<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-21"><span class="space">2.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Professional; Hybrid Employee</h4>
<p class="noindent">The evolution of collective bargaining coverage for VA medical professionals was described in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d 341, 344-45 (D.C. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case has its roots in a labor dispute between the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA") Medical Center in Asheville, North Carolina, and the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 446, ("the Union"), which represents operating room nurses who work at the Asheville Medical Center. The Union secured an arbitration award in favor of the Asheville nurses, but a subsequent decision by the VA's Under Secretary for Health made it impossible for the Union to enforce that award. The Union filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the VA's Under Secretary for Health to have that decision declared unlawful, so that the arbitration award could be enforced. The district court dismissed the Union's lawsuit for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. On this appeal, the Union argues that the district court erred in dismissing the suit and should have ruled in its favor on the merits. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the district court did have jurisdiction over the Union's complaint. On the merits, however, we hold that the district court should have ruled for the VA defendants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), which is codified at title 5, chapter 71 of the U.S. Code, authorizes most federal employees to collectively bargain over the "conditions of [their] employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). The collective bargaining rights of doctors and nurses employed by the VA, however, are more limited. In <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n v. FLRA, </span>271 U.S. App. D.C. 259, 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988), we held that the Secretary of the VA had the authority to set the conditions of employment for these employees by regulation and that VA medical professionals did not have a right to mandatory collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">Colo. Nurses,</span> 851 F.2d at 1492. Following that decision, in 1991 Congress passed a new statute providing that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations under section 7421 of this title is subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by them in accordance with chapter 71 of title 5 (relating to labor-management relations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Department of Veterans Affairs Health-Care Personnel Act, Pub. L. No. 102-40, title II, &#x00A7; 202, 105 Stat. 187, 200 (1991), <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a). Chapter 71 of title 5 governs federal employees' labor relations generally, including grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 7121-7123. In other words, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a) gives VA medical professionals the right to bargain according to the rules set out in chapter 71 of title 5, subject to limitations "specifically provided" in title 38. Title 38 imposes three substantive limitations on the VA nurses' bargaining rights under title 5:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such collective bargaining (and any grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement) in the case of employees described in section 7421(b) of this title may not cover, or have any applicability to, any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b)...</p>
<p class="noindent">Because the Secretary of Veterans Affairs decides what matters relate to VA professional employees' professional conduct, the Secretary decides, indirectly, what matters can or cannot be grieved. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Amarillo and NFFE Local 1138</span>, 49 FLRA 1511, 1516 (1994), set aside an award of an arbitrator who decided that an employee had the right to union representation during a professional standards board proceeding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wisconsin Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, Veterans Administration Staff Nurses Council, Local 5032 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Clement J. Zablocki Medical Center, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</span>, 47 FLRA 910 (1993), <span class="Italic">petition for review</span> <span class="Italic">filed</span>, No. 93-1496 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 1993), the Authority dismissed a petition for review of negotiability issues involving a provision addressing professional conduct and competence of employees appointed under title 38. The Authority concluded that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b), such matters are not subject to collective bargaining. The Authority also concluded that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d), the Secretary has exclusive authority to determine whether a proposal concerns such matters. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Long Beach California</span>, 48 FLRA 970, 975 (1993) (<span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span>), the Authority concluded that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) "specifically excludes matters concerning professional conduct or competence, [and]] peer review...from coverage under negotiated grievance procedures." The Authority concluded further that the Secretary has exclusive authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) to determine whether a grievance involves such matters and that, as the Secretary had determined that the grievance involved in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> concerned professional conduct and competence, the Authority was "required by law to treat the grievance as nonarbitrable." <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span>, 48 FLRA at 976.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency determined, pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d), that the grievance concerned the peer review process and, therefore, was not <span id="page_1685"></span>arbitrable. The Agency's determination is not reviewable. Consequently, the Arbitrator's award that the grievance is arbitrable is inconsistent with law and must be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of a somewhat belated, but fully effective, determination by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs removing a matter from the scope of the grievance procedure is <span class="Italic">VA Maryland HCS and Professional Staff Nurses Ass'n Local 1998</span>, 59 FLRA 384, 385 (2003), involving a grievance concerning reassignment of nurses:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue raised by the Agency's exception in this case is similar to <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Amarillo, Tex</span>, 49 FLRA 1511 (1994) (<span class="Italic">VA Amarillo</span>). In <span class="Italic">VA Amarillo</span>, a grievance was filed alleging that a registered nurse was denied her right to union representation. The agency denied the grievance based on a determination by the Chief Medical Director (on behalf of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs) that the matter was not grievable under &#x00A7; 7422. The union invoked arbitration and the arbitrator sustained the grievance, finding that the matter did not involve professional conduct, competence, or peer review within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7422. The Authority cited <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span>, which held that the Secretary has exclusive authority to make a determination as to whether a matter is excluded from coverage under the negotiated grievance procedures under &#x00A7; 7422<span class="Italic">. VA Amarillo, </span>49 FLRA at 1516. The Authority also cited its holding in <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span> that the Authority "was 'required by law to treat the grievance as non-arbitrable.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">VA Long Beach</span>, 48 FLRA at 976.). In <span class="Italic">VA Amarillo</span>, the Authority found that since the Secretary had determined that the grievance was not arbitrable, the award finding the grievance arbitrable was inconsistent with the law. On that basis, the Authority set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reach the same result here.&#x2003;The Under Secretary in this case made a determination under &#x00A7; 7422 that the reassignment of the nurses was a matter concerning or arising out of professional conduct or competence, and, as such, was not grievable under the negotiated grievance procedure. That determination is not reviewable by the Authority, regardless of the fact that the determination was issued after the grievance was filed<span class="Italic">. See VA Asheville</span>, 57 FLRA at 683 (in unfair labor practice case, the Authority did not have jurisdiction to review agency's alleged noncompliance with arbitration award where the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 determination was made after the arbitrator's award was issued and during pendency of the ULP proceeding because "[p]arties may raise arguments regarding the Authority's jurisdiction at any stage of the Authority's proceedings").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2423.40, which sets forth the deadline for filing exceptions to a Judge's decision, the Union asserts that the GC's motion is untimely because the GC filed it after the time for filing exceptions in this matter had expired. The Union's argument fails. As an initial matter, the GC did not file exceptions; rather, the GC filed a motion to dismiss the Judge's decision. Accordingly, the regulations cited by the Union are inapplicable. Moreover, the GC's motion concerns the Secretary's determination that this matter arises under Title 38, an issue that goes directly to the Authority's jurisdiction. Arguments concerning the Authority's jurisdiction may be raised by a party at any stage of the Authority's proceedings,[4] and may even be raised by the Authority <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>.[5] Thus, the GC's motion is not untimely, and the issue regarding the Authority's jurisdiction is properly before us.</p>

Arbitrators may decide to stay adjudication of a grievance pending a determination by the Secretary's designee, the Under Secretary of Health, concerning whether a grievance is exempt from arbitration under 38 USC 7422(b). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and VAMC Asheville</span>, 59 FLRA 451, 454 (2003); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2145 and VA Hunter Holmes McGuire MC</span>, 61 FLRA 571 (2006) (remanding case so that Secretary could determine whether reassignment challenged in arbitration was matter that involved professional competence and conduct and would be outside scope of negotiated grievance procedure).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Kansas City and AFGE Local 910</span>, 65 FLRA 809, 811-12 (2011), involved a grievance that the facility improperly reassigned its head of the Nephrology Section to another position, staff nephrologist, with a resulting potential reduction in future pay. The basis stated for the reassignment involved concerns about management or leadership skills. The arbitrator found that the reassignment violated the negotiated agreement. As a remedy, the arbitrator's remedy was to require the VA to pay the grievant the difference between his actual compensation and the compensation he would have received had he remained the chief of the unit and to pay the union's counsel fees. The arbitrator also directed that the grievant be restored to his prior position. As to the compensation, FLRA took official notice of a determination by the VA Undersecretary of Health:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The USH addressed several issues raised in the Agency's exceptions to the arbitration award. The Secretary has the "exclusive authority" to make 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422 determinations. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2145, </span>61 FLRA 571, 575 (2006) (Secretary has authority to make &#x00A7; 7422 determination even after arbitration award resolves grievance pertaining to such matters) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Asheville, N.C., </span>57 FLRA 681, 683 (2002)). These determinations are not reviewable by the Authority. <span class="Italic">See Veterans Admin., Long Beach, Cal., </span>48 FLRA 970, 975 (1993) (<span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the USH determined that the grievant's reassignment was not a matter pertaining to professional conduct or competence within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7422(b). Accordingly, the USH did not address the portion of the Arbitrator's award requiring the Agency to: (1) reinstate the grievant as head of Nephrology and (2) publicly acknowledge that the grievant had been vindicated by the arbitration. As the USH found that the grievance did not address matters concerning professional conduct or competence, issues raised in the Agency's exceptions concerning the grievant's reassignment in this regard are not excluded from the Authority's review under &#x00A7; 7422(d). Accordingly, we will address the Agency's exceptions pertaining to those matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the USH concluded that a portion of the award pertained to matters regarding compensation within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7422. Accordingly, the USH invalidated the portion of the award regarding compensatory damages and attorney fees. As the Secretary has authority to make &#x00A7; 7422 determinations even after an arbitration award resolves a grievance pertaining to such matters, <span class="Italic">see AFGE, </span>61 FLRA at 575, we set aside that portion of the award. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Amarillo, Tex., </span>49 FLRA 1511, 1516 (1994) (setting aside award where Chief Medical Director determined under &#x00A7; 7422(d) that the grievance concerned the peer review process and, therefore, was not arbitrable).</p>
<p class="noindent">The courts enforced the authority the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, through his delegations, to render matters pertaining to Title 38 health professionals' competence and compensation beyond the reach of arbitrators, including the ability to exclude indirect challenges to that authority in arbitration by denominating the grievance as one asserting discrimination. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2152 v. Principi</span>, 464 F.3d 1049, 1051-60 (9th Cir. 2006), affirmed jurisdiction of a district court to review the exercise of discretion by the Secretary, and that discretion was upheld:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Dr.&#x2003;Savlov was a VA physician who filed a grievance alleging unlawful discrimination based upon his age and gender. Dr. Savlov spent approximately seventy percent of his time providing primary care services, in the form of compensation and pension examinations ("C&#x0026;P examinations"), and approximately thirty percent of his time performing surgeries. The basis of the grievance was the allegation that Dr. Savlov was removed from surgical duties at the age of seventy-six, and his "specialty pay" for surgery was discontinued, even though, allegedly, a female physician of approximately the same age, who had also been removed from surgical duty, continued to receive specialty pay. Dr. Savlov was denied specialty pay from 2000, when he was removed from surgical duty, until 2002, when he retired and ceased all work for the VA. He estimates that he was denied a total of approximately $46,000 in specialty pay, which he allegedly should have received in addition to his pay for his primary care duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1686"></span>While VA medical professionals now enjoy collective bargaining rights, including a grievance procedure, these rights are restricted by three significant exemptions designed to ensure adequate patient care and to prevent conflicts with statutorily established pay scales. The rights to grievance procedures provided by a CBA do not extend to three statutorily exempted types of disputes, relevantly including "any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conductor competence...or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7422(b). Section 7422(d) provides that whether a matter concerns or arises from one of the exemptions of &#x00A7; 7422(b) "shall be decided by the Secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After exhausting the procedures of the negotiated grievance process, AFGE Local 2152, acting on Dr. Savlov's behalf, sought to have the grievance resolved by a labor arbitrator, in accordance with the terms of the CBA. Before the dispute was finally submitted to the arbitrator, VA Under Secretary Roswell issued a "decision paper," under the authority of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d), determining that the grievance was exempt from the terms of the CBA because the grievance involved issues of "professional conductor competence" and because it "concerns or arises out of a matter or question of the establishment, determination, or adjustment of compensation under Title 38." After issuing its decision paper, the VA moved for the arbitration to be dismissed with prejudice, based upon the exemptions defined by &#x00A7; 7422(b). The arbitrator dismissed the case without prejudice to give Appellants an opportunity to seek judicial review. Plaintiffs filed no exceptions to the arbitrator's decision and filed this action, claiming that the VA had "misused, misapplied and violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) and (d)."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard of Review</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court properly denied the VA's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Our review of the district court's subject matter jurisdiction is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Campos v. Nail,</span> 940 F.2d 495, 496 (9th Cir. 1991). The district court based its assertion of jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331, which authorizes original jurisdiction in federal district courts over disputes arising out of the application of federal law. <span class="Italic">See Gallo Cattle Co. v. U. S. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 159 F.3d 1194, 1198 (9th Cir. 1998) ("[A] federal court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331 over challenges to federal agency action as claims arising under federal law, unless a statute expressly precludes review."). The VA argues that the district court's jurisdiction over this case was precluded by &#x00A7; 7422(e) of title 38, which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions, shall be taken only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA argues that &#x00A7; 7422(e) applies to this case and limits the forum in which judicial review could have been sought by Appellants because the &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination denied the applicability of the grievance procedure and, therefore, the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to Dr. Savlov. Appellants argue that &#x00A7; 7422(e) limits jurisdiction only over petitions arising "under section 7123 of title 5." Section 7123 of title 5 relates to judicial review of orders of the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA"), and no such order was ever issued in this case because judicial review was sought instead of an appeal to the <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>. An appeal of the arbitrator's dismissal to the FLRA would have been fruitless because the <span class="Italic">FLRA</span> constitutes a different agency and cannot rule on the propriety of the VA's use of &#x00A7; 7422(d). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 57 F.L.R.A. 681 (2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"We review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the district court's construction or interpretation of a statute. Our analysis begins with the language of the statute." <span class="Italic">United States v. Davidson,</span> 246 F.3d 1240, 1246 (9th Cir. 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The parties vigorously dispute the statutory construction and legislative history of &#x00A7; 7422(e). The VA argues that several possible readings of &#x00A7; 7422(e) grant the D.C. Circuit exclusive jurisdiction over disputes that do not involve an <span class="Italic">FLRA</span> order, but we reject the VA's alternate readings of the statute and affirm the district court's assertion of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The VA's First Proposed Reading of &#x00A7; 7422(e)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "petition for review" is a phrase associated with judicial review of an administrative decision. Section 7123(a) of title 5 authorizes judicial review for "[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the [<span class="Italic">FLRA</span>]." A "petition for enforcement" is a petition, filed by the reviewing administrative agency, such as the <span class="Italic">FLRA,</span> which seeks judicial enforcement of an order. Both parties agree that, under the best reading of the statute, both of the terms "petition for judicial review" and "petition for enforcement" are modified by the phrase "under section 7123 of title 5." The parties disagree on how this phrase is modified by the remaining phrase, "in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions." The VA argues that the clause "or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions" has independent meaning and that the D.C. Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over any appeal challenging the VA's application of "chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions." The VA argues that jurisdiction is therefore limited to the D.C. Circuit for review of any petition for review or enforcement "under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving [VA health care professionals]" or any petition "arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with the VA's proposed reading of the statute. Section 7422(e) limits jurisdiction to the D.C. Circuit only with respect to a "petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5." To read the statute as suggested by the VA would expand the statute's reach beyond its plain meaning. The meaning of the language "or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions" can be determined by the context, which is that this clause refers to a petition involving such issues. The types of petitions that are jurisdictionally limited are specified in the first clause of the sentence, which refers to "petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5." The VA argues that the opening phrase "a petition for review or petition for enforcement" is actually modified by two independent phrases, the first being "under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title" and the second modifying phrase being "or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions." The problem with the VA's reading is that it divorces the phrase "petition for review or petition for enforcement" from the words "under section 7123 of title 5" even though that section clearly refers to and defines the types of orders that may serve as the basis for such petitions, and despite the fact that these clauses are not grammatically separated in a way to indicate that any of the subsequent text in &#x00A7; 7422(e) refers to petitions not brought under &#x00A7; 7123. The plain language of &#x00A7; 7422(e) refers only to petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under &#x00A7; 7123 of title 5. Section 7123 of title 5, in turn, specifically references petitions for review and petitions for enforcement as means to challenge or enforce certain FLRA orders. Moreover, the types of petitions for judicial review are limited by &#x00A7; 7123 and would have precluded judicial review of an FLRA order in the instant case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although all parties would agree that &#x00A7; 7422(e) was not intended to prevent all forms of judicial review, they disagree about whether any meaningful review could take place under the VA's construction of the statute. Because &#x00A7; 7422(d) prohibits review by any other agency, it is undisputed that the FLRA would not have had jurisdiction over the dismissal of the arbitration in this case. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit would have affirmed the FLRA's dismissal and never reached the merits of the arbitration in light of &#x00A7; 7123(a), which prohibits judicial review of a petition for review of an FLRA decision that involves the award of an arbitrator "unless the order involves an unfair labor practice under section 7118 of this title." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1). Because no unfair labor practice under &#x00A7; 7118 was involved in this case, as a practical matter, an appeal from the arbitrator's decision would be immune from any form of substantive agency or judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA asserts that the statutory construction adopted by the district court, and urged by Appellants, renders the phrase "or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions" superfluous because that clause is preceded by a clause referring to petitions brought under &#x00A7; 7123 of title 5 "<span class="Italic">in any case</span> involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(e) (emphasis added). Although at first blush, the phrase "in any case" appears to cover any FLRA cases involving such employees, a closer reading of the section shows that the words "or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5" clause does not have independent meaning but modifies the phrase "under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title." We do not believe that such a reading renders the phrase "arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions" superfluous because the phrase is merely a description of a type of FLRA order that can only be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit as opposed to other courts that may otherwise have had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) and (b) (authorizing petitions for review of FLRA orders "in the United States court of appeals in the circuit in which the person resides or transacts business" and petitions for enforcement in "any appropriate United States court of appeals"); <span class="Italic">Preminger v. Principi,</span> 422 F.3d 815, 821 (9th Cir. 2005) ("Section 502 gives the Federal Circuit exclusive jurisdiction to review challenges to most actions by the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs."). Moreover, the statute does not provide for exclusive jurisdiction over petitions for review or <span id="page_1687"></span>enforcement "in any case" involving a &#x00A7; 7123 order involving &#x00A7; 7421(b) employees or "in any case" arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to such employees. Instead, the statute's drafters placed the phrase "in any case" after a description of the types of petitions whose review would be jurisdictionally limited (i.e., petitions for review or enforcement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123). Therefore, based on the plain language of the statute, we conclude that &#x00A7; 7422(e) does not grant exclusive jurisdiction to the D.C. Circuit over petitions involving &#x00A7; 7421(b) employees or the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5, unless those petitions also arise from an <span class="Italic">FLRA</span> order as described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123. Because no such order was issued in this case, we find that the district court properly asserted jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The VA's Second Proposed Reading of &#x00A7; 7422(e)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The VA's admittedly "second best construction" of the statute suggests that the various canons of statutory construction, including the doctrine of the last antecedent, should control our reading of the statute. Under the doctrine of the last antecedent, qualifying phrases are to be applied to the words or phrase immediately preceding the qualifier and are not to be construed as modifying more remote phrases. <span class="Italic">See Bingham, Ltd. v. United States,</span> 724 F.2d 921, 926 (11th Cir. 1984). The VA argues that, applying the doctrine of the last antecedent, "under section 7123 of title 5" modifies only the words "petition for enforcement" and not the words "petition for judicial review."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find this argument unpersuasive.&#x2003;The implication of the VA's argument is that any petition for review involving a &#x00A7; 7421(b) employee, irrespective of the subject matter, would have to be litigated in the D.C. Circuit. This reading is inconsistent with our reading of the text, as discussed above, as well as the statutory framework and history of &#x00A7; 7422(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the text of &#x00A7; 7422(e), or case law addressing judicial review of VA actions, suggests that Congress intended to grant exclusive jurisdiction to the D.C. Circuit over all petitions for review brought by VA professionals in any context. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Preminger,</span> 422 F.3d at 821 (discussing the Federal Circuit's exclusive jurisdiction over most actions of the VA Secretary). When, as in this case, the doctrine of the last antecedent is inconsistent with the plain language and the legislative history of the statute, a court must adhere to a logical plain reading of the statute. <span class="Italic">See May Trucking Co. v. Or. DOT,</span> 388 F.3d 1261, 1268 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that the doctrine of the last antecedent only applies "where no contrary intention appears"); <span class="Italic">Nw. Forest Res. Council v. Glickman,</span> 82 F.3d 825, 833 (9th Cir. 1996) ("[W]e are not inflexible in our application of the doctrine of last antecedent, and have recognized that the principle must yield to the most logical meaning of a statute that emerges from its plain language and legislative history."). Section 7422(e), plainly refers to both a "petition for judicial review" and a "petition for enforcement" in connection with the phrase "under section 7123 of title 5." Moreover, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) provides that "[a]ny person aggrieved by any final order of the Authority other than [certain exceptions]...may...institute an action for <span class="Italic">judicial review</span>." Section 7123(c) goes on to provide that "[u]pon the filing of a <span class="Italic">petition under subsection (a) of this section for judicial review</span> or under subsection (b) of this section for enforcement,...the court...shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding." We conclude that Congress must have used the term "petition for judicial review" and the term "petition for enforcement" in the phrase "petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under 7123" in the sense those terms are used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123 and therefore intended that petitions for review be treated in the same fashion as petitions for enforcement <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> &#x00A7; 7422(e). We turn now to the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7422(e) and conclude that it is also inconsistent with the grammatical constructions offered by the VA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Legislative History of &#x00A7; 7422(e)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we base our conclusion that &#x00A7; 7422(e) does not provide exclusive jurisdiction over this case to the D.C. Circuit on the plain language of the statute, we examine the legislative history to ensure that our reading comports with Congress' intent and to demonstrate that the alternative grammatical readings offered by the VA are inconsistent with the logical meaning of the language in light of the section's history. We find that the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7422(e) reveals that it was developed independently of &#x00A7; 7422(d) and that the two subsections are concerned with entirely different subject matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although &#x00A7; 7422 was not enacted until 1991, its origins lay in a congressional bill proposed in 1990. The original, 1990 version of &#x00A7; 7422(d) provided only one exemption from arbitration and review by other agencies of grievances involving issues of professional conduct or competence. The 1990 version also precluded administrative review by any other agency and precluded review of the VA Secretary's determination <span class="Italic">by any court</span>.<span class="Italic"> See </span>H.R. Rep. No. 101-466 at 55 (1990) (proposed as new 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108(b)(2)). The 1990 House version of &#x00A7; 7422(e) also contained almost identical language to the final 1991 version, discussed above, and thereby provided for judicial review of certain petitions by the D.C. Circuit. The doctor and the union representing him argue that this development shows that Congress intended to treat &#x00A7; 7422(d) review distinctly from &#x00A7; 7422(e) review. Moreover, Plaintiffs-Appellants suggest that the subsequent removal of the phrase "by any court" from &#x00A7; 7422(d), before it was passed in 1991, shows that Congress intentionally removed the limits of judicial review of &#x00A7; 7422(d) except to the extent that &#x00A7; 7422(e) provides for the D.C. Circuit's exclusive review of FLRA orders involving certain employees or subject matter related to those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Explanatory Statement of the House-Senate conferees discussed the deletion of any form of judicial review of &#x00A7; 7422(d) determinations under a heading entitled "Review of Secretary's Collective Bargaining Determinations." 137 Cong. Rec. 8802 (1991). By contrast, the Explanatory Statement discussed the adoption of what would become &#x00A7; 7422(e) under the separate heading of "Jurisdiction for Certain Cases." To further support the significance of this deletion, Appellants cite the comments of the bill's principal sponsor and then Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Cranston, who said:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Although the compromise agreement does not provide for independent agency review of the Secretary's negotiability decisions based on a professional conduct or competence interpretation, <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">prohibition against court review of such decisions has been eliminated</span>....&#8197;<span class="Italic">[P]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic">rofessional conductor competence would be reviewable by a court of competent jurisdiction--most likely a Federal district court.</span>...&#8197;[T]he compromise agreement does provide for a check on the Secretary's exercise of discretion in this area, which is of critical importance to maintaining a situation of good faith bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">137 Cong.&#x2003;Rec. 8296 (Apr. 17, 1991) (emphasis added). The VA argues that Senator Cranston's statement was not a clear expression of legislative intent because he stated that judicial review would "most likely" be conducted by a district court. It is also true that remarks made by Senator Cranston regarding this bill recognize that the "statute as enacted is a compromise between potentially conflicting purposes." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed. Employees Local 589 v. F.L.R.A,</span> 73 F.3d 390, 394 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The VA also suggests that we reject Appellants' argument regarding the "structure of the predecessor statute" because there is no legislative history for the predecessor. Despite these objections by the VA, we find that the changes between the 1990 proposal and the final 1991 law support Plaintiffs-Appellants' view and further support our rejection of the VA's alternate grammatical constructions of &#x00A7; 7422(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The VA Permissibly Excluded Its Decision From Review By An Arbitrator Or Any Other Agency</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that the district court had jurisdiction to hear this matter we turn now to the grant of summary judgment.&#x2003;Our review of the district court's decision to grant summary judgment is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Universal Health Servs., Inc. v. Thompson,</span> 363 F.3d 1013, 1019 (9th Cir. 2004). The district court's decision, granting summary judgment to the VA, was based upon the agency's application of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) and (d). Generally, we give great deference to agency interpretations involving statutes under which the agency operates. In the instant case, however, that interpretation is not entitled to the full level of deference typically afforded administrative decisions pursuant to <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984), because the agency's decision was issued in the form of an opinion letter and not as the result of a formal proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Christensen v. Harris County,</span> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000) (holding that an agency's interpretations under such circumstances are "entitled to respect...but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade" (citations and internal quotations omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Plaintiff doctor and the union representing him challenge the district court's conclusion that the VA had exempted itself properly from arbitration because resolution of Savlov's grievance would involve issues of "professional conduct or competence." Section 7422(c) defines "professional conduct or competence" as meaning either" (1) Direct patient care" or "(2) Clinical competence." Appellants argue that this exclusion applies only to a "genuine health care determination," and not to a case alleging discrimination, but the VA challenges this extra-statutory standard and advocates a more expansive reading of the statute. The parties dispute whether the statute's text, legislative intent, and policy considerations favor consideration of the VA's anticipated defenses as a basis for exempting the VA from arbitration and administrative review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellants contend that the instant grievance is based on allegations of discrimination and therefore an allegation that the decision was not based upon "direct patient care" or "clinical competence." Appellants' claim, that the basis of the discontinuation of Savlov's specialty pay was age and gender discrimination, is supported by his allegations that younger physicians continued to receive surgical duties and that a female surgeon of similar age was also reassigned from surgical duties but continued to receive specialty pay for surgery that she was not performing. The non-discriminatory reasons offered by the VA can be <span id="page_1688"></span>found in the decision paper issued by the VA Under Secretary in this case, and include: (1) the "specific patient care needs" created by a decrease in the surgical workload and a substantial backlog of C&#x0026;P examinations, which Dr. Savlov was competent to perform; (2) the increasingly limited surgical privileges held by Dr. Savlov as a result of a privileging process that serves as an "indicator of a physician's competence to perform particular surgical procedures"; and (3) the fact that reassignment of another surgeon to address the backlog of compensation and pension examinations would have affected the availability of surgeons that were competent to perform a fuller range of surgical procedures needed by VA patients.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The CBA clearly was intended to cover grievances related to discrimination.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See 1997 Master Agreement Between the Department of Veterans Affairs and the American Federation of Government Employees</span> (describing three types of suits, including discrimination suits, that may be filed "under the statutory procedure or the negotiated grievance procedure but not both"). The CBA also specifies that disputes regarding the scope of &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemptions would be resolved in accordance with the "VA Partnership Council's <span class="Italic">Guide to Collective Bargaining and Joint Resolution of 38 USC Section 7422 Issues</span>," which provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he definition of professional conduct and competence has often been the subject of dispute between labor and management. The Secretary has decided that VA will apply the exception to bargaining based on professional conduct or competence <span class="Italic">"narrowly to matters clearly and unequivocally involving direct hand-on patient care or clinical competence."</span> Therefore, labor and management parties must be mindful of the fact that many matters affecting the working conditions of Title 38 employees affect patient care only<span class="Italic"> indirectly and therefore should be subject to bargaining.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">No contract or arbitration should attempt to define the care which is given to patients. Nor should a contract or arbitration define the professional qualifications for positions or whether particular employees meet those qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Dr.&#x2003;Savlov and the union may have relied upon indications by the VA that it would not claim an exemption in discrimination cases, we agree with the district court, which found that the VA's prior statements do not prevent the VA from arguing for an application of &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemptions in such cases. The VA argues that the resolution of the discrimination claims in this case would give rise to defenses based upon the VA's view of patient care and the relative competence of the hospital's employees in connection with those services. We find it unnecessary to discuss the legislative history, cited by Appellants, indicating that the "professional conduct or competence" exemption ought to be narrowly applied, because the instant grievance involves issues that plainly fall within a narrow construction of the exemption. We find that the grievance is related to "direct patient care" because the grievance challenged the ability of the VA to provide adequate patient care by reducing the backlog of C&#x0026;P examinations and by ensuring that the hospital's available surgeons were competent to perform a wide array of surgical procedures. In addition, the grievance challenged the VA's determination of Savlov's relative clinical competence, as compared to the clinical competence of other doctors, with respect to their ability to perform certain surgical procedures and C&#x0026;P examinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellants argue that the VA's unproven defenses ought not serve as the basis for a &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemption because a completely unfounded, factually incorrect defense concerning or arising from an issue of patient care could prevent further substantive review of a grievance. Appellants also argue that the VA could prevent any meaningful development of an administrative record for judicial review by effectively ending the factual inquiry into a grievance at the time of the VA's determination that the grievance falls within one of &#x00A7; 7422(b)'s exemptions. We find Appellants' arguments unpersuasive for two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, a holding for Appellants would result in an equally troubling result. Decisions that are clearly related to patient care could be challenged in arbitration or other agency forums by grievants who simply craft the language of their complaints to avoid mention of "direct patient care" or "clinical competence." Congress has entrusted the VA Secretary with the sole authority to determine whether a &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemption applies to a grievance, and the language of the statute does not limit the VA's application of such exemptions to cases that explicitly raise such issues on the face of the grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) ("[W]hether a matter or question concerns or arises out of [a &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemption] shall be decided by the Secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, even if a record had been developed by an arbitrator who determined that the VA's proffered defenses were pretextual, the VA still would have the right to declare itself exempt from any adverse determinations by an arbitrator or other agency. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 446 v. Principi,</span> 404 F. Supp.2d 14, 25 (D.D.C. 2005) ("[T]he matter [of a &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemption] may be raised at any stage of the FLRA proceedings, <span class="Italic">even if the result is to reverse an arbitration award.</span>" (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellants also argue that a finding by the arbitrator that the discontinuance of Savlov's specialty pay and surgical duties was not the result of unlawful discrimination would require only that the arbitrator determine whether the VA's motive was discriminatory and not whether the purported reasons were sound decisions <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> patient care. We find this argument disingenuous because a determination of the VA's motives necessarily would involve an examination of the legitimacy of the non-discriminatory reasons offered by the VA to justify the adverse action. Therefore, we conclude that the reasons offered by the VA have the "power to persuade" us that the VA's application of the "professional conduct or competence" exemption was not beyond the VA's discretion in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of our conclusion that Dr.&#x2003;Savlov's claim was exempt from arbitration or further review by any agency because it related to "professional conduct or competence," as defined by &#x00A7; 7422(c), we find it unnecessary to address the VA's claim that the district court erred by denying the applicability of the exemption based on "the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation."</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2152 v. Principi, supra,</span> was relied on in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 v. Nicholson</span>, 475 F.3d 341, 344-56 (D.C. Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, involving an arbitration over premium pay for VA operating room nurses. Once again, a court decided that the matter of the exercise of discretion by the VA Secretary to remove a matter from collective bargaining and arbitration by invoking the statutory exclusion for matters affecting compensation of Title 38 employees, with judicial review of that decision only in a district court exercising deference to the reasoned discretion of the Secretary:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a) gives VA medical professionals the right to bargain according to the rules set out in chapter 71 of title 5, subject to limitations "specifically provided" in title 38. Title 38 imposes three substantive limitations on the VA nurses' bargaining rights under title 5:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such collective bargaining (and any grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement) in the case of employees described in section 7421(b) of this title may not cover, or have any applicability to, any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b). The third of these limitations--matters concerning employee compensation--is at issue in this case. In addition, Congress authorized the VA Secretary to determine whether a matter is subject to collective bargaining or instead falls under one of the three listed exceptions. As applicable to this case, the statute provides that "[a]n issue of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of...the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title shall be decided by the Secretary and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7422(d). The VA Secretary has delegated this &#x00A7; 7422(d) authority to the Under Secretary for Health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to their collective bargaining rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a) and chapter 71 of title 5, operating room nurses at the VA Medical Center in Asheville, North Carolina are represented by the plaintiff Union, AFGE Local 446. The Asheville Medical Center is subject to a nationwide collective bargaining agreement ("CBA") between the American Federation of Government Employees and the VA. In February 1999 AFGE Local 446 filed a grievance. The Union claimed that, under the CBA, operating room nurses at the Medical Center were entitled to "premium pay" for any hours worked at night or on weekends. The Medical Center disagreed. The grievance went to arbitration, and in December 1999 the arbitrator ruled in favor of the Union. The arbitrator concluded that operating room nurses were entitled to premium pay for night and weekend work, and ordered appropriate back pay dating to the filing of the grievance. The details of the grievance, which are not relevant to the question of the district court's jurisdiction over this lawsuit, are discussed at greater length in section II of this opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award may be appealed to the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA"), but in this case the Medical Center waited too long before filing its appeal, and the FLRA dismissed the appeal as untimely. The Medical Center refused to recognize the award. It is an unfair labor practice ("ULP") for a federal agency to fail to comply with a valid arbitration award, <span class="Italic">see Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs. v. FLRA, </span>298 U.S. App. D.C. 105, 976 F.2d 1409, 1413 (D.C. Cir. 1992), so to enforce the award the Union filed a ULP charge with the FLRA. In September 2000 the FLRA served a ULP complaint on the Medical Center.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Meanwhile, by letter of February 14, 2000, the Medical Center had requested a determination from the VA that the arbitrator lacked the authority to rule on the Union's grievance, on the grounds that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) excludes matters concerning the determination of employee compensation from the bargaining and grievance process. Several <span id="page_1689"></span>months later, the VA Under Secretary for Health returned the Medical Center's request for a &#x00A7; 7422 determination. The Under Secretary instructed the Center to first attempt to resolve the matter through consultation with the Union, pursuant to the collective bargaining guidelines then in effect between the AFGE and the VA. Negotiations failed, and in October 2000 the Medical Center again requested a ruling from the Under Secretary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With this request still pending with the Under Secretary, the FLRA General Counsel prepared to seek judgment against the Medical Center in the ULP proceeding. On March 5, 2001, the General Counsel moved for a summary judgment to enforce the arbitration award. Also on March 5th, the VA Under Secretary issued a Decision Paper ("&#x00A7; 7422 Decision"). The Under Secretary found, "[u]nder the authority in 38 U.S.C. 7422(d)," that the arbitrator's decision and the subsequent ULP proceeding before the FLRA "concern[&#8197;] the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision in hand, the Medical Center opposed summary judgment in the FLRA proceeding and sought dismissal of the Union's attempt to enforce the arbitration award. The Medical Center argued that the FLRA lacked jurisdiction over the Union's complaint, and that the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision conclusively decided the issue because a question decided by the VA under &#x00A7; 7422(d) "is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d). The FLRA agreed and dismissed the complaint. The FLRA held that its jurisdiction could be challenged at any stage in its proceedings, and that because the Under Secretary "has made a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination, the Authority lacks jurisdiction over this matter." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, VA Med. Ctr., Asheville, N.C.,</span> 57 F.L.R.A. 681, 2002 WL 1019134 (Jan. 31, 2002) <span class="Italic">("VAMC Asheville")</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union did not seek judicial review of the FLRA decision, for reasons that will be discussed below. Instead, in April 2002 it filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Under Secretary for Health in their official capacities--collectively, the "VA"--on the theory that the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision was unlawful. If the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision were declared unlawful by the district court, the Union reasoned, then the arbitration award would be enforceable against the Medical Center, and the operating room nurses at that facility would finally receive their "premium pay" for night and weekend work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union and the VA filed cross motions for summary judgment.&#x2003;The VA also sought dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), arguing that the district court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised in the Union's complaint. In July 2005 the district court granted the VA's motion to dismiss. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 446 v. Principi, </span>404 F. Supp.2d 14, 28 (D.D.C. 2005) <span class="Italic">("Local 446")</span>. The district court concluded that, although the Union claimed to be challenging the legality of the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision, the Union's "Complaint is properly characterized as a claim seeking review of the January 31, 2002, FLRA decision in the ULP proceeding, which dismissed Plaintiff's administrative complaint." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 21. Judicial review of such an FLRA order is established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a), which provides that an aggrieved person--here, the Union--may seek review of an FLRA order involving an unfair labor practice in the United States Court of Appeals.<span class="Italic"> See id.</span> at 20-22. And because the Union's FLRA case involved VA medical professionals whose bargaining rights were established and limited by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422, subsection (e) of that statute specifically requires that a petition for judicial review authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123 be brought in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 21.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">District courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction to review challenges to FLRA orders, <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Loy, </span>361 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 367 F.3d 932, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2004), so the district court held that it lacked jurisdiction over the FLRA's January 31, 2002 order dismissing the ULP complaint. Review of that order, the court concluded, could be had only in the D.C. Circuit. <span class="Italic">Local 446,</span> 404 F. Supp.2d at 23. Having found that the Union's complaint was "actually an appeal of the FLRA ruling," the district court concluded that the Union had failed to "adequately set forth any claim challenging the merits of the Under Secretary's determination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 27-28. For the reasons explained below, we reverse the district court's jurisdictional determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court reviews the district court's dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Metro. Police Dep't,</span> 370 U.S. App. D.C. 381, 445 F.3d 460, 465 (D.C. Cir. 2006). First, the Union argues that the district court mischaracterized its complaint. According to the Union, this lawsuit is not a veiled attempt to appeal the January 31, 2002 FLRA order. Rather, it is a straightforward claim under the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") to set aside agency action--the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision--that the Union contends is arbitrary and capricious or otherwise unlawful. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2). Second, the Union argues that the district court did have jurisdiction over its complaint. The VA acknowledges that the legality of final agency action is presumptively subject to judicial review, <span class="Italic">see Transactive Corp. v. United States,</span> 319 U.S. App. D.C. 428, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C. Cir. 1996), but argues that in this case the Union was required to bring its claims against the VA in this court, not the district court. We agree with the Union on this issue, and hold that the district court erred in dismissing the Union's complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial Review of the FLRA Order</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As emphasized by the district court, the Union did not seek review of the January 31, 2002 FLRA order in the D.C. Circuit, although it was authorized to do so under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(e) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). The reason is simple: petitioning for review of that order would have been to no avail, because the D.C. Circuit lacked the authority to grant the relief sought by the Union. The Under Secretary's decision that a matter arises out of a collective bargaining exclusion "may not be reviewed by any other agency." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d). The Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Department of Veterans Affairs, of course, are separate agencies. The FLRA therefore lacked authority to review the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision, and on review of the FLRA's dismissal this court could not have concluded otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is true that "district courts do not have concurrent jurisdiction over matters within the exclusive purview of the FLRA." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. Loy,</span> 361 U.S. App. D.C. 309, 367 F.3d 932, 935 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The district court concluded, under <span class="Italic">Loy,</span> that the FLRA had exclusive jurisdiction over the claims raised in this lawsuit.<span class="Italic"> Local 446, </span>404 F. Supp.2d at 21-22. The rule from <span class="Italic">Loy</span> does not apply in the instant case, however, because the legality of the disputed &#x00A7; 7422 Decision is expressly outside the FLRA's purview. Because the Union is presumptively entitled to judicial review of its claim that the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision was unlawful, and because the D.C. Circuit could not provide that review on a petition for the review of the FLRA decision dismissing the ULP complaint, <span class="Italic">Loy</span> does not provide a basis for the district court dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Judicial Review of the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding any mistaken reliance on <span class="Italic">Loy,</span> the VA contends that the district court nonetheless reached the right result in dismissing this case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The VA argues that the Union was required to bring such a challenge directly to the D.C. Circuit. On this theory, the district court correctly dismissed the Union's lawsuit, not because it was a veiled appeal of the FLRA order, but because the district court lacked jurisdiction over the Union's challenge to the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To resolve this question we must analyze the scope of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(e), which concerns judicial review of disputes involving VA medical professionals. As discussed above, under title 38 these VA employees are entitled to bargain collectively "in accordance with chapter 71 of title 5," "[e]xcept as otherwise specifically provided in [title 38]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(a). One of the exceptions to the rights provided under title 5 is found in &#x00A7; 7422(e):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions, shall be taken only in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7422(e). As it concerns petitions for review of FLRA orders, the effect of &#x00A7; 7422(e) is simply to channel all such petitions involving VA medical professionals to the D.C. Circuit, as opposed to any other United States court of appeals. Thus--as noted above--had the Union sought judicial review of the January 31, 2002 FLRA order, &#x00A7; 7422(e) would have required the Union to file that petition for review in this court. Such a petition for judicial review would be brought "under section 7123 of title 5" (which authorizes judicial review of unfair labor practice claims involving arbitration awards, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a)(1)), and would involve VA employees "described in section 7421(b)" (which include registered nurses,<span class="Italic"> see </span>38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7421(b)(5)). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(e). In contrast, a party whose right to judicial review of an FLRA order arises directly under title 5 may choose to seek review "in the circuit in which the person resides <span class="Italic">or</span> transacts business <span class="Italic">or</span> in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That much should not be controversial.&#x2003;The controversy is over the meaning of the phrase "petition for judicial review" as it is used in &#x00A7; 7422(e): "A petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions" must be brought in the D.C. Circuit. The VA argues that &#x00A7; 7422(e) applies not only to petitions authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123, but also to all other disputes that "aris[e] out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to [VA medical] employees." On this argument, the Union's claims in this lawsuit were required to be brought in a petition for review filed in the D.C. Circuit because the Union's claims "aris[e] out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5" to the Asheville operating room nurses. In defense of their <span id="page_1690"></span>reading of subsection (e), the VA asks us to read &#x00A7; 7422 as a whole. It makes sense--the argument goes--that subsection (e) would govern all challenges to the VA's authority, established in subsection (d), to settle disputes concerning the collective bargaining exclusions enumerated in subsection (b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While plausible at first glance, the VA's intuition is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statute. On the VA's reading of subsection (e), the term "petition for judicial review" refers to two types of petitions: petitions "under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title," and petitions "arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions." In other words, according to the VA, subsection (e) provides that "[a] petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement" must be taken in the D.C. Circuit if that petition is brought "under section 7123 of title 5 in any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title," and a petition must also be taken in the D.C. Circuit if that petition "aris[es] out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute does not support such an unwieldy construction.&#x2003;To the contrary, the term "petition for judicial review" refers only to one type of petition: petitions authorized under section 7123 of title 5. It is clear that both "petition for judicial review" and "petition for enforcement" are so authorized. Section 7123(a) provides that aggrieved persons may obtain judicial review of specified final FLRA orders. Section 7123(b) provides that the FLRA may petition "for the enforcement of any order of the Authority." And &#x00A7; 7123(c) contains rules applicable to "a petition under subsection (a) of this section for judicial review or under subsection (b) of this section for enforcement." Accordingly, the first fifteen words in &#x00A7; 7422(e) must be read together: "A petition for judicial review or petition for enforcement under section 7123 of title 5" must be taken in the D.C. Circuit if that petition is from "any case involving employees described in section 7421(b) of this title or arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5 to employees in those positions." Subsection (e) does not apply to <span class="Italic">every</span> "case...arising out of the applicability of chapter 71 of title 5," because "any case" does not refer to all cases, but only to those cases involving final FLRA orders that are subject to judicial review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our construction of this statute is supported by a recent decision in a very similar case.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2152 v. Principi, </span>464 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2006), the Ninth Circuit rejected the argument that challenges to the VA's &#x00A7; 7422(d) authority must be brought in the D.C. Circuit. Though subsection (e) is not a model of clear draftsmanship, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that "[t]he plain language of &#x00A7; 7422(e) refers only to petitions for review or petitions for enforcement under &#x00A7; 7123 of title 5." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1054. Read properly, &#x00A7; 7422(e) merely channels 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123 petitions to the D.C. Circuit in certain cases involving VA employees; it does not establish the D.C. Circuit's jurisdiction to review, in the first instance, all cases involving the application of title 5 to VA medical professionals. Congress did not preclude judicial review of the VA's &#x00A7; 7422(d) authority, and because &#x00A7; 7422(e) does not establish the D.C. Circuit as the forum for such challenges we hold that the district court erred in dismissing this case for lack of jurisdiction. Under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1331, the district courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions arising under federal law, and the Union properly filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Merits</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The district court dismissed the Union's complaint on fully-briefed cross-motions for summary judgment. The facts are not in dispute. Rather than remand the case for further proceedings, in the interest of judicial efficiency--and mindful that the Asheville operating room nurses with a stake in this litigation received their favorable arbitrator's award in December 1999--we turn to the merits of the Union's claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Block v. Meese,</span> 253 U.S. App. D.C. 317, 793 F.2d 1303, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Section 7422(d) grants the VA broad authority to decide whether a question "concerns or arises out of" a determination of employee compensation, and we hold that the Under Secretary's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision was not unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In February 1999 the plaintiff in this case, AFGE Local 446, filed a grievance on behalf of operating room nurses employed by the VA Medical Center in Asheville, North Carolina. The grievance alleged that the collective bargaining agreement in place between the AFGE and the VA required the Medical Center to pay its operating room nurses a premium for all work at night or on weekends. The grievance was not resolved, so the Union pursued arbitration under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In December 1999 the arbitrator sided with the Union.&#x2003;The arbitrator based this decision on 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7453, which governs VA nurses' premium pay, and on corresponding provisions in the collective bargaining agreement. Section 7453 provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;A nurse performing service on a tour of duty, any part of which is within the period commencing at 6 postmeridian and ending at 6 antemeridian, shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to 10 percent of the nurse's hourly rate of basic pay if at least four hours of such tour fall between 6 postmeridian and 6 antemeridian. When less than four hours of such tour fall between 6 postmeridian and 6 antemeridian, the nurse shall be paid the differential for each hour of service performed between those hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;A nurse performing service on a tour of duty, any part of which is within the period commencing at midnight Friday and ending at midnight Sunday, shall receive additional pay for each hour of service on such tour at a rate equal to 25 percent of such nurse's hourly rate of basic pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7453(b)-(c). The "premium pay" section of the CBA, in turn, repeats most of this statutory language and provides that premium pay shall be provided "in accordance with" &#x00A7; 7453. The Medical Center argued that nurses were entitled to premium pay only for <span class="Italic">regularly scheduled</span> tours of duty that include night or weekend hours. Because the Medical Center's operating room was generally open only on weekdays, operating room nurses did not work any regularly scheduled tours on weekends or after 6:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span>, and the Center claimed that the nurses were entitled only to overtime pay when their work was required during those times. In support of this argument the Medical Center pointed to an internal regulation that defined "tour of duty" as scheduled hours that employees were required to work on a regular and recurring basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator, however, concluded that service at night or on weekends was service "on a tour of duty" as required by the statute, and ruled that the Medical Center had violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7453 and the CBA by failing to award the nurses premium pay for all hours worked at night and on weekends. The arbitrator ordered the Medical Center to compensate the nurses accordingly, "hereafter and retroactive to the date of the grievance filing."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's award may be appealed to the FLRA. If the FLRA finds that the award is "contrary to any law, rule, or regulation," it "may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). But, "[i]f no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed...during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>&#x00A7; 7122(b). In this case, the Medical Center waited 31 days before filing its exceptions, and the FLRA rejected the appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Medical Center refused to recognize the award, so in June 2000 the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA. This attempt to enforce the arbitrator's award was thwarted by the VA Under Secretary's March 2001 decision on the Medical Center's request for a &#x00A7; 7422 ruling. In that decision, the Under Secretary noted that, under the VA's pay regulations, "tour of duty" is defined in terms of nurses' basic, 40-hour work schedule, and that the nurses receive overtime pay--but not premium pay--for work outside that normal workweek. Because the operating room nurses' regularly scheduled tours of duty did not involve night or weekend work, the Under Secretary concluded:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the authority in 38 U.S.C. 7422(d), I find:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">that the arbitrator's decision and subsequent ULP concerns [sic] the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the authority in 38 U.S.C. 7422(d), I find:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">that the payment of night differential and weekend premium pay to OR [operating room] nurses for periods of overtime work concerns or arises out of a matter or question of the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under title 38.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the FLRA dismissed the ULP complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">VAMC Asheville, </span>57 F.L.R.A. 681, 2002 WL 1019134.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union makes two principal arguments.&#x2003;The first is based on timing: the Union argues that the VA waited too long before issuing the &#x00A7; 7422 determination. The second concerns the substance of the Under Secretary's determination: the Union argues that the grievance did not concern the determination or adjustment of employee compensation. We reject these arguments and hold in favor of the VA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Timing of the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues, first, that the VA lacks statutory authority to issue a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination after a grievance has been resolved in a final and binding arbitration. Section 7422(b) provides that "grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement" may not be applied to matters concerning the determination of employee compensation; according to the Union, those grievance procedures ended when the arbitrator's award became "final and binding" by operation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; <span id="page_1691"></span>7122(b). On this argument, the VA impermissibly undermined the finality of a legitimate arbitration by issuing its &#x00A7; 7422 Decision in March 2001, more than a year after the arbitrator's award became final. In a related argument, the Union asserts that the VA violated the Union's "substantive" due process rights by interfering with the Union's (and its members') property interest in the relief promised by the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot agree that the VA loses its authority to decide an issue under &#x00A7; 7422(d) once an arbitrator enters an award on that same issue. As an initial matter, nothing in title 38 imposes such a time limit. The Union argues that Congress is presumed to legislate with existing law in mind, and therefore the interest in arbitral finality reflected in &#x00A7; 7122 of title 5 must limit the VA's authority under title 38. We need not determine whether there is a conflict between title 38 and title 5 in this case, however, because 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7425(b) expressly provides that "no provision of title 5...which is inconsistent with any provision of...[chapter 74 of title 38] shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify" any provision under chapter 74 of title 38. The plain text of this statute requires that, to the extent 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) creates a conflict with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122, the latter provision must give way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of greater importance, the collective bargaining exclusions in &#x00A7; 7422(b) are jurisdictional: disputes that concern or arise out of the determination or adjustment of employee compensation are not subject to arbitration. In turn, a decision under &#x00A7; 7422(d) will settle a dispute over an arbitrator's jurisdiction, or, as in this case, a dispute over the FLRA's authority to enforce an award in a ULP proceeding. It will not however address the "merits" of an arbitrator's award, because the effect of such a decision is to establish whether the matter is subject to title 5 collective bargaining procedures in the first place.[2] The &#x00A7; 7422 Decision states that the "FLRA has no jurisdiction to review the ULP," because the "ULP concerns the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation." In its decision dismissing the Union's attempt to enforce the arbitration award, the FLRA stated that "[p]arties may raise arguments regarding the Authority's jurisdiction at any stage of the Authority's proceedings." <span class="Italic">VAMC Asheville,</span> 57 F.L.R.A. 681, 2002 WL 1019134. Though that decision is not now before us, there is nothing troubling about the FLRA's conclusion that its jurisdiction was properly challenged in a ULP proceeding. In the analogous private sector context, an arbitrator's jurisdiction may be challenged in an enforcement proceeding brought in a district court, and this court has similarly approved the FLRA's authority to review the arbitrability of a dispute when that challenge was raised in an unfair labor practice proceeding to enforce an arbitrator's award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 271 U.S. App. D.C. 89, 850 F.2d 782, 785 (D.C. Cir. 1988). As there was nothing improper about the FLRA's examination of its own jurisdiction over the ULP proceeding, we cannot find that the VA exceeded its authority by issuing the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision while that proceeding was pending. Accordingly, we hold that the VA did not exceed its authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) by issuing its decision after the conclusion of the arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Accordingly, the Union's argument that the VA impermissibly reviewed the merits of the arbitrator's decision fails.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's constitutional claim is also without merit. This court has recognized that an act of "grave unfairness," such as "a deliberate flouting of the law that trammels significant personal or property rights," may violate the right to "substantive" due process under the Fifth Amendment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Tri County Indus., Inc. v. District of Columbia, </span>322 U.S. App. D.C. 412, 104 F.3d 455, 459 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Silverman v. Barry, </span>269 U.S. App. D.C. 327, 845 F.2d 1072, 1080 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). The Union asserts a legitimate claim of entitlement in the arbitration award and in the relief ordered in that award, and claims that the government's interference with that interest "shocks the conscience." <span class="Italic">See Washington Teachers' Union v. Bd. of Educ. of the District of Columbia,</span> 324 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 109 F.3d 774, 781 (D.C. Cir. 1997). The threshold for such a constitutional violation is unclear, but this court has held that a mere violation of law does not give rise to a due process claim. <span class="Italic">See Tri County Indus., </span>104 F.3d at 459 (state law); <span class="Italic">Comm. of U.S. Citizens Living in Nicaragua v. Reagan,</span> 273 U.S. App. D.C. 266, 859 F.2d 929, 944 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (international law). We have held that the timing of the VA's &#x00A7; 7422 Decision was not unlawful, and so our discussion of the Union's due process claim comes to an end.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union hints at a distinct constitutional challenge, one rooted in the constitutional separation of powers. The Union contends that "[a] final and binding arbitration award, in the context of a collective bargaining agreement, is the equivalent of a U.S. District Court judgment," and argues that the VA may not "use an administrative power [to] evade the labor equivalent of a District Court judgment." It is true that "[j]udgments within the powers vested in courts by the Judiciary Article of the Constitution may not lawfully be revised, overturned or refused faith and credit by another Department of Government." <span class="Italic">Chicago &#x0026; S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp.,</span> 333 U.S. 103, 113, 68 S. Ct. 431, 92 L. Ed. 568 (1948); <span class="Italic">see also Hayburn's Case,</span> 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 409, 1 L. Ed. 436, 2 Dall. 409 (1792). The problem with the Union's argument is that an arbitration award under chapter 71 of title 5 is not constitutionally equivalent to a judgment of an Article III court. Enforcement of such an award is through an FLRA unfair labor practice proceeding, which itself is subject to review by the United States Court of Appeals. There may be a point after which the VA may no longer invoke its &#x00A7; 7422(d) authority to resolve a jurisdictional dispute, but because that is not the case before us, we need not draw that line in holding that a determination made during an FLRA proceeding is not too late. It may be inconsiderate or even unfair, but it is not without legal effect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Reasonableness of the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union next argues that the VA misapplied the collective bargaining exclusion.&#x2003;We will rule for the VA if the &#x00A7; 7422 Decision is not arbitrary or capricious and if the Decision is based on a permissible interpretation of the relevant statutes under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984). <span class="Italic">See Shays v. FEC, </span>367 U.S. App. D.C. 185, 414 F.3d 76, 96-97 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (analyzing FEC regulations pursuant to both arbitrary and capricious review and <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>). In applying these standards we part ways with the Ninth Circuit, which applied a higher level of scrutiny to a similar &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination in <span class="Italic">Local 2152.</span> In that case, the court first determined that the VA's interpretation of the &#x00A7; 7422 bargaining exclusions "is not entitled to the full level of deference typically afforded administrative decisions pursuant to <span class="Italic">Chevron.</span>" <span class="Italic">Local 2152,</span> 464 F.3d at 1057. The court instead treated the Under Secretary's determination as an "opinion letter" entitled to respect only for its "power to persuade." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(relying on<span class="Italic"> Christensen v. Harris County,</span> 529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S. Ct. 1655, 146 L. Ed. 2d 621 (2000)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree with that approach.&#x2003;Congress specifically authorized the VA Secretary to decide disputes over the scope of the collective bargaining exclusions listed in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b), and under the APA we must set aside final agency action if it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A). Here, the Medical Center's request for a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination arose from a specific grievance involving operating room nurses, and the VA decided that the dispute was exempt from collective bargaining and that the FLRA was without jurisdiction to review the unfair labor practice complaint. The &#x00A7; 7422 Decision is final agency action for the purpose of judicial review under the APA and therefore will not be disturbed unless it is arbitrary or capricious. And to the extent that the VA's decision turned on its interpretation of the collective bargaining exclusions in &#x00A7; 7422, our review is similar, because the VA's interpretations are entitled to a deferential review under <span class="Italic">Chevron. </span>"[A]dministrative implementation of a particular statutory provision qualifies for <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>deference when it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority." <span class="Italic">United States v. Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 226-27, 121 S. Ct. 2164, 150 L. Ed. 2d 292 (2001). In our view, by treating a &#x00A7; 7422 decision as an opinion letter, the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Local 2152</span> did not give effect to the text of the statute; a &#x00A7; 7422 decision does not offer the VA's opinion on the scope of the exclusions enumerated in subsection (b). Rather, subsection (d) authorizes the VA to "decide" an "issue of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of...the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d). Congress's delegation of such authority "may be shown in a variety of ways," <span class="Italic">see Mead</span> at 227, and in &#x00A7; 7422(d) that delegation is express and unambiguous. Moreover, we cannot read &#x00A7; 7422(d) to establish the VA's decisional authority with respect to other agencies but not with respect to judicial review, because it is clear from the text of the statute that the bar on review by any other agency is independent of the VA's authority to decide disputes. A dispute over a bargaining exclusion "shall be decided by the Secretary <span class="Italic">and</span> is not itself subject to collective bargaining <span class="Italic">and </span>may not be reviewed by any other agency." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) (emphasis added). A decision under &#x00A7; 7422(d) is subject to judicial review, but it is a decision that we review, not an opinion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold question under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> is "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. at 842. In this case, this question is not whether the VA is authorized to decide disputes over the scope of a collective bargaining exclusion--it is--but whether &#x00A7; 7422 is ambiguous as to the VA's authority to interpret the statute to exclude the Union's grievance from the collective bargaining process. While it seems fairly plain that Congress did intend to grant that authority, to the extent that there is any ambiguity in this regard, under the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis we must defer to the VA's interpretation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) if that interpretation is "based on a permissible construction of the statute," that is, if the interpretation is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. at 843.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our inquiry under <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step two overlaps with our inquiry under the arbitrary and capricious standard. "Whether a statute is unreasonably interpreted is close analytically to the issue whether an agency's actions under a statute are unreasonable." <span class="Italic">Gen. Instrument Corp. v. FCC, </span>341 U.S. App. D.C. 367, 213 F.3d 724, 732 (D.C. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see also Nat'l Ass'n of Regulatory Utility Comm'rs v. ICC,</span> 309 U.S. App. D.C. 325, 41 F.3d 721, 726 <span id="page_1692"></span>(D.C. Cir. 1994). Congress gave the VA broad authority to decide whether a matter "concerns or arises out of...the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under [title 38]," and we hold that the VA's decision in this case was reasonable. The Union argues that it merely sought the Medical Center's compliance with the premium pay standards already established by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7453 and the CBA. But this begs the question. The question is not whether the Medical Center failed to pay its nurses in accordance with an agreed-upon standard. The applicable standard is in dispute; the parties would agree that &#x00A7; 7453 provides that standard but the Union disagrees with the VA's ultimate conclusion that, as it applies to the operating room nurses who work at the Asheville Medical Center, &#x00A7; 7453 does not mandate premium pay for night and weekend work. The question before us, however, is whether it was reasonable for the VA to determine that the dispute over the nurses' pay for night and weekend work "concerns or arises out of...the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under [title 38]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d). To hold for the VA in this case, we need not determine that the VA's reading of the premium pay statute is the best possible reading, only that it was reasonable for the VA to conclude that the matter concerns or arises out of the determination or adjustment of the nurses' compensation as that compensation is provided for by &#x00A7; 7453.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">That standard is met in this case, because the VA's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7453 is reasonable. The VA based its decision on its interpretation of the phrase "[a] nurse performing service on a tour of duty." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7453(a), (b). The &#x00A7; 7422 Decision explained that "tour of duty" refers to the regularly scheduled workweek for which the nurses receive regular pay. The nurses receive overtime pay for work outside their normal workweek, but at the Asheville Medical Center, operating room nurses' tours did not fall during the premium pay periods identified in &#x00A7; 7453. This interpretation of "tour of duty" as a "regularly scheduled tour of duty" might not be the only permissible interpretation of the statute, but it is a reasonable one. The VA's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7453 as it applies to the Asheville operating room nurses is reasonable and clearly concerns the determination or adjustment of employee compensation under title 38. Therefore, we hold that the VA's decision--that "the payment of night differential and weekend premium pay to OR [operating room] nurses for periods of overtime work concerns or arises out of a matter or question of the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under title 38"--was not unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Conclusion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed above, the district court's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court with instructions to enter judgment in favor of the appellees.</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance was precluded as to hazard pay claimed by VA registered nurses based on the VA's assertion that the grievance involved their compensation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pershing VAMC and AFGE Local 2328</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-149.html">71 FLRA 769</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent">If there is no claim that the grievant in a disciplinary case is a professional medical employee of the DM&#x0026;S, FLRA adjudicates exceptions to the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Chillicothe and AFGE Local 1631</span>, 34 FLRA 457, 459-60 (1990). There are exceptions within the VA statutory scheme that permit grievance review for some employees. There is a group of "hybrid" VA employees, appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) [formerly 4104(3)]. FLRA affirmed its review authority in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Newington and NAGE Local R1-109</span>, 37 FLRA 111, 114-17 (1990), involving a grievance over the nonpromotion of a GS-5 Licensed Practical Nurse:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[G]rievant is a...nurse appointed pursuant to section 4104(3) of title 38. The Agency argues that section 4106(g)(1) of title 38 "governing the promotion of hybrid appointees is exclusive" because "[t]he plain language...requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish rules for promotions of covered employees[.]"...&#8197;We reject the Agency's argument for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4106(g)(1) of title 38 provides, in part, that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the Administrator (A) may use the authority in subsection (a) of this section to establish the qualifications for and...to appoint individuals to positions listed in section 4104(3) of this title, and (B) may use the authority provided in subsection (c) of this section for the promotion and advancement of Veterans' Administration employees serving in such positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4106(c) provides, in part, that "[p]romotions...shall be made only after examination given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Administrator."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to employees appointed under section 4104(3), section 4106(g)(3) of title 38 provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[n]otwithstanding any other provision of this title or other law, all matters relating to adverse actions, disciplinary actions, and grievance procedures involving individuals appointed to such positions...shall be resolved under the provisions of title 5 as though such individuals had been appointed under such title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's argument that the grievance is barred by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4119. That provision provides that no provision of title 5 which is "inconsistent" with a provision of title 38 "shall be considered to supersede, override, or otherwise modify" the title 38 provisions unless title 5 specifically so provides....&#8197;The Agency appears to argue that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(1), which states that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(c) applies to promotion decisions of employees appointed under section 4104(3), is inconsistent with title 5...which, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3), applies to matters relating to those employees' grievance procedures. However, we have already found that section 4106(g)(3), which allows title 5 to apply to matters relating to the grievance procedures of employees appointed under section 4104(3), supersedes section 4106(g)(1). Accordingly, we find no conflict between title 38 and title 5, and, therefore, 38 U.S.C. 4119 does not bar the grievance in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the grievance is barred by two appellate court cases holding that "where Congress intended a procedure to be exclusive, the VA ha[s] no duty to bargain over the procedures."...&#8197;<span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center Northport, New York v. FLRA</span>, 732 F.2d 1128 (2d Cir. 1984), and <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center Minneapolis, Minnesota v. FLRA</span>, 705 F.2d 953 (8th Cir. 1983). Based on our interpretation of the language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3)...we find that the Agency's assertion that Congress intended 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(c) to be the exclusive provision governing the promotion of employees appointed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3) is without merit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the court cases cited by the Agency involved a conflict between 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 and title 5 over whether 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110 precluded employees appointed pursuant to section 4104(1) of title 38 from bargaining over disciplinary and adverse action procedures. Applying 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4119, the courts found that because title 5 makes no specific reference to title 38 with respect to disciplinary and adverse action cases, the conflict must be resolved in favor of the system set forth in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110. While the rights of employees appointed pursuant to section 4104(1) of title 38 have been specifically limited by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4110, those limitations do not apply to employees appointed under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4104(3)....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reaffirmed the rights of "hybrid" VA employees, i.e., employees appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) who retain certain rights under Title 5 of the United States Code, to pursue grievances. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Hot Springs and AFGE Local 1539</span>, 48 FLRA 804, 812-13 (1993), denied agency exceptions to an award concerning a grievance protesting means for filling vacancies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievance involves the failure of the Agency to select an LPN appointed pursuant to section 7401(3) of title 38 for a vacant position. The Agency argues that the parties' agreements were superseded by amendments to title 38 and that sections 7403(f)(1) and 7425(b) of title 38 bar arbitration of the grievance. These arguments were raised by the agency and rejected by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Newington I</span> and <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>. Specifically, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">Newington I</span> that if promotions of "hybrid" employees are covered by a negotiated grievance procedure, then 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4106(g)(3) (now 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3)) takes precedence over the provisions of title 38 relating to the promotion of "hybrid" employees and requires that matters involving promotions of "hybrid" employees instead be resolved under the provisions of title 5 of the U.S. Code. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newington I</span>, 37 FLRA at 115-17....&#8197;We reaffirmed that interpretation of 38 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7403(f)(3) in <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>. <span class="Italic">See Newington II</span>, 44 FLRA at 362.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency acknowledges that under the Authority's interpretation of 38 U.S.C.A. 7403(f)(3) set forth in <span class="Italic">Newington I</span> and <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>, the instant grievance is arbitrable if it is covered by the parties' grievance procedure. However, the Agency argues that the Authority failed to consider all of the relevant legislative history of the title 38 provisions relating to "hybrid" employees and should reconsider <span class="Italic">Newington I</span> and <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>. In <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>, the Authority examined the pertinent legislative history of title 38, including the Senate Report relied on by the Agency. The Authority found that the legislative history "clearly indicates that Congress did not intend to deny 'hybrid' employees the collective bargaining rights and protections enjoyed by employees appointed pursuant to title 5" and that "hybrid" employees were to "have the 'full panoply of rights available to title 5 employees for the resolution of grievance and disciplinary matters....'" <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>, 44 FLRA at 363 (quoting S. Rep. No. 215, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 145 (1987)). The Authority concluded that "in order to have the 'full panoply of rights available to title 5 employees for the resolution of grievance' matters, 'hybrid' employees must be permitted to resolve matters pertaining to the scope of the grievance procedure under the provisions of title 5." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Agency has presented no basis warranting reconsideration of that conclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievance involved a matter that is covered by the parties' grievance procedure. Therefore, consistent with <span class="Italic">Newington I</span> and <span class="Italic">Newington II</span>, the Arbitrator properly found that the instant grievance was arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1693"></span>Before the 1991 legislative changes, VA medical professionals had no substantive resort to collective bargaining processes. In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Danville and AFGE Local 1963</span>, 34 FLRA 131, 134-36 (1990), FLRA determined that it generally lacked jurisdiction to review arbitration awards involving VA professionals hired under Title 38:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...<span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486 (D.C. Cir. 1988)....reversed the Authority's ruling that the Veterans Administration (VA) is obligated to bargain over conditions of employment for professional medical employees of the Department of Medicine and Surgery (DM&#x0026;S) appointed under title 38 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span>, the court held that the VA Administrator has "exclusive" authority to determine the conditions of employment of professional medical employees of DM&#x0026;S....&#8197;The court stated that, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108, the authority of the VA Administrator is "exempt from all laws governing the terms and conditions of federal employment except as otherwise explicitly provided in the DM &#x0026; S Statute[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded that the VA had no obligation to bargain over, among other things, a proposal which "would establish a grievance and arbitration procedure for DM &#x0026; S professional medical employees concerning conditions of employment[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1487.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We now find that the authority of the VA Administrator under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4108 to establish conditions of employment of professional medical employees of DM&#x0026;S is not subject to sections 7121 and 7122 of the Statute. Sections 7121 and 7122 govern, respectively, negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures and appeals from arbitration awards rendered pursuant to those procedures....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A "collective bargaining agreement" results from the performance of the statutory obligation to bargain over conditions of employment. The VA is not obligated under the Statute to bargain over the conditions of employment of professional medical employees of DM&#x0026;S, including the establishment of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures. Therefore, these professional medical employees are not eligible for coverage by a "collective bargaining agreement" negotiated under the Statute. Because these employees are not eligible for coverage...they are not eligible for coverage by a negotiated grievance procedure under section 7121 of the Statute. Accordingly, the Authority does not have jurisdiction to review exceptions filed to arbitration awards involving conditions of employment of professional medical employees of the DM&#x0026;S.</p>
