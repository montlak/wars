<p class="Body-Text">The Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 amended Title 5 USC, Chapter 35 to provide for the removal of SES career appointees due to an agency RIF. A career appointee may appeal to the Board under &#x00A7; 7701 from removal by RIF. 5 USC 3595(c). <span class="Italic">Vanderburgh v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 57, 57-58 (1983). [Refer to Chapter <span id="Page_3019"></span>6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-158.html#sec6-157">Senior Executive Service</a>"; refer to Chapter 12, "Reductions in Force and Furloughs" of Broida and Davis's <span class="Italic">Senior Executive Service Legal Guide</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/09SESG.html">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2009).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 3595(d) defines an SES RIF to include the elimination or modification of a position due to a reorganization, due to a lack of funds or curtailment of work, or due to any other factor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 3595(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency shall establish competitive procedures for determining who shall be removed from the Senior Executive Service in any reduction in force of career appointees within that agency. The competitive procedures shall be designed to assure that such determinations are primarily on the basis of performance, as determined under subchapter II of chapter 43 of this title.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulations implementing the statute state, in part, 5 CFR 359.602 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Agency reductions in force.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;This paragraph applies to all SES career appointees in the agency, including appointees serving a probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An agency shall establish competitive procedures in writing to determine who will be removed from the SES in any reduction in force of career appointees within the agency. Such competitive procedures shall be based primarily on performance. When performance ratings are used, they shall be the final ratings under 5 CFR part 430, subpart C.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">MSPB jurisdiction over an SES RIF appeal is provided by 5 USC 3595(c):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A career appointee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of this title whether the reduction in force complies with the competitive procedures required under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The current structure for the SES RIF process was set by Public Law 98-615, effective November 8, 1984, amending the Civil Service Reform Act to provide a straightforward procedure for removing individuals from the Senior Executive Service as a result of reduction in force, and the same legislation stated that individuals who are career appointees to the SES "shall be entitled to be placed in a civil service position (other than a Senior Executive Service position) in any agency" following removal by RIF from the SES.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Senate Report 93-351 (February 3, 1984) (1984 USCCAN 563) explained of the amendments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final section makes changes to the Senior Executive Service bonus and RIF provisions. Currently, reduction-in-force procedures for the SES are muddled and cumbersome. The bill repeals the current restrictions on SES RIFs and substitutes it with fallback rights to positions not less than GS-15.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same Report states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (1) of subsection (D) amends section 3594 of such title by entitling an SES employee who is removed from the SES as a result of a reduction-in-force to be placed in a civil service position in any agency at a grade no lower than a GS-15. This means, in effect, an SES employee so removed cannot be removed from the civil service. The employee must be placed in a position in any agency not lower than a GS-15. Such protections do not apply to such an employee for subsequent reductions-in-force.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a career appointee is removed from the SES by reduction in force, 5 USC 3594 establishes the right of the employee to placement in a GS-15 (or equivalent) "continuing position" in the civil service with what amounts to saved pay. OPM regulations, 5 CFR 359.702 (2022), define placement rights for individuals separated from the SES by reduction in force:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An appointee covered by this subpart is entitled to be placed in a vacant civil service position (other than an SES position) in any agency that is--</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The OPM <span class="Italic">Guide to the Senior Executive Service</span> (March 2017), explains:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">REDUCTION IN FORCE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reduction in force (RIF) is a management tool for dealing with the consequences of abolishing functions or positions. It is not a tool for dealing with performance issues. When an agency abolishes SES positions due to reorganizations, eliminated programs or functions, or reduced resources, there are several ways to deal with the affected SES members. They can be reassigned to vacant positions anywhere in the agency. They can be offered early retirement (if eligible). Agencies can help them find job opportunities elsewhere in government. Reduction in force is usually the last resort.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Key Statutory Requirements: Agencies establish competitive procedures for determining who is removed during a RIF that affects career appointees. These procedures must ensure that RIF determinations are based primarily on performance. The agency must place a career executive who has completed the probationary period in a vacant SES position for which he/she is qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency cannot place the executive, OPM offers placement assistance (45 days) to try to place the executive elsewhere in the government. If the executive cannot be placed in any SES position, he/she is removed from the SES, but is entitled to placement in his/her agency at GS-15, with saved base pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM can require an agency to take any action that OPM considers necessary to carry out a RIF placement. A career executive has an appeal right to MSPB on agency compliance with competitive RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moratorium: The 120-day moratorium on certain removal actions does not apply to a removal as a result of RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FALLBACK RIGHTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A career SES appointee is entitled to be placed ("fallback") in a position outside the SES, with saved base pay, when removed from the SES under certain circumstances. The appointee may elect discontinued service retirement, if eligible, in lieu of fallback. The appointee has fallback rights in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During SES probation, for other than disciplinary reasons, if the individual held a career or career-conditional appointment, or an appointment of equivalent tenure, at the time of his/her appointment to the SES.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After SES probation, as the result of a less than fully successful performance rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After SES probation, as the result of a reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Conditions of Offer: The placement offer must be to a continuing position (i.e., one that will last at least 3 months); the position must be at GS-15 or above, or equivalent; the individual must meet the qualifications requirements for the position. For an individual who was appointed to the SES from a career or career-conditional (or equivalent) position) the tenure of the appointment must be equivalent to the tenure of the appointment he/she held at the time of entry into the SES. The placement may not cause the separation or grade reduction of any other employee. If there is no vacant position for which the individual is qualified, the agency must create a position<br/><a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidesesservices.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/senior-executive-service/reference-materials/guidesesservices.pdf</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the Federal Register notice of August 10, 1988, first explaining the OPM's regulations pertaining to placement rights of SES employees removed by RIF (53 FR 30061), OPM explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the agency conducting the RIF will remain in existence, but has no vacant position currently available at GS-15 or above for which the individual qualifies and cannot make a placement in another agency, the agency still must create a position to permit the fallback. The agency should then continue its efforts to find an appropriate position for the individual either internally or conduct a further RIF action. Such an action may not be taken within three months of the removal from the SES. That is the same period provided in Part 351 (5 C.F.R. 351.701(a)) as the minimum length of time a position must last when an employee is assigned to another position under RIF procedures outside the SES.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It should be noted that the congressional section analysis for Pub. L. 98-615 states that although appointees are entitled to placement following a RIF within the SES, this entitlement does not apply for the subsequent RIFs outside the SES. Such subsequent actions would be subject to the regulations in Part 351 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The SES RIF scheme was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Facer v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 24 MSPR 404, 407-09 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 756 (1981), established the statutory basis for a RIF system in the Senior Executive Service. 5 USC 3595 (1982). This section was later amended by Pub. L. 97-346, 96 Stat. 1650 (1982). The amendment, codified at subsection 3595(b)(5), provided that an individual who, like the appellant, was a career appointee on May 31, 1981, can be removed from the Senior Executive Service and the civil service due to RIF after the 120-day period specified in paragraph (b)(4)(B). However, for the removal to take effect, the Director of OPM must certify to the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate no later than 30 days prior to the effective date of such removal that the Office has taken all reasonable steps but was unable to place the career appointee in another Senior Executive Service position. In the instant case, the evidence plainly demonstrates that the foregoing prerequisites took place prior to appellant's separation. Accordingly, we find that the agency complied with the provisions of 5 USC 3595 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant maintains that 5 USC 3592(b)(1) precluded his involuntary removal pursuant to a RIF on January 7, 1983, because the agency had <span id="Page_3020"></span>acquired a new head in December, 1982, less than 120 days before his separation. Appellant's basic argument is that since his removal by RIF was involuntary, then the restriction in section (b)(1)(A) applies to his case and his separation is not in accordance with law. The agency maintains that the statute allows appellant's removal because his most immediate supervisor, who was a noncareer appointee and who had the authority to remove him under the RIF was employed over 120 days at the time of appellant's separation. The agency argues that appellant's removal was in compliance with Section 3592(b) because the utilization of the word "or" between (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) means that only one of the two situations needs to exist in order to permit appellant's separation. In her initial decision, the presiding official in effect added another exception to paragraph (b)(2) by including a RIF action initiated before an appointment referred to in paragraph (1) of the subsection. OPM, on the other hand, argues that 5 USC 3592 does not apply to an SES reduction in force. After considering the statutory construction and the legislative history concerning the enactment of sections 3592 and 3595, we agree with the position of the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3595 was included in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 756. In addition to establishing RIF procedures, that act also amended section 3393 of Title 5, United States Code, by inserting at the end thereof the following new subsection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(g)&#x2003;A career appointee may not be removed from the Senior Executive Service or civil service except in accordance with the applicable provisions of sections 1207, 3592, 3595, 7532, or 7543 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7542 was also amended by the insertion of "or 3595" after "3592." That section now states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7542. Actions Covered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This subchapter applies to a removal from the civil service or suspension for more than 14 days, but does not apply to an action initiated under section 1206 of this title, to a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title, or to a removal under section 3592 or 3595 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the inclusion of a section 3595 removal as a distinct action from a 3592 removal demonstrates that Congress considered them separate actions. This conclusion is further bolstered by the House Budget Committee Report on the RIF proposals which ultimately became law. The Committee therein recognized that the legal authorities for removal of career executives in SES were clarified by the addition of a new subsection (g). H.R. Rep. No. 158, 97th Cong., 2d Sess (1981). Further, it noted that section 3592 only applies to performance-based removals for less than fully successful executive performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 49, 51. The addition of new regulations for RIF removals is recognized as an additional removal mechanism. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50. The Office of Personnel Management regulations at Part 359, Subpart E, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, likewise interpret 5 USC 3592 as governing removal of career appointees for less than fully successful executive performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The well-established rule is that in reviewing an agency's application of a statutory term of which it has administrative charge "the judicial role is narrow." <span class="Italic">Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB</span>, 437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S. Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L. Ed.2d 370 (1978). This limited judicial role assumes an adequately articulated administrative decision interpreting the relevant statutory law within a range of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Federal Election Campaign Commission v.</span> <span class="Italic">Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee</span>, 454 U.S. 27, 37, 102 S. Ct. 38, 44, 70 L. Ed.2d 23 (1981). Congress provided that the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of Subchapter V, Removal, Reinstatement and Guaranteed Placement in the Senior Executive Service, 5 USC 3596 (1982). Based on our review of the pertinent legislative history, and after giving due deference to OPM's interpretation of the statutory terms which it is responsible for administering, we find that the restriction of 5 USC 3592(b)(1) is not applicable to a removal pursuant to a RIF. Therefore, appellant's claim that the agency's action is not in accordance with law is found to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Competitive areas for SES RIFs need not be department-wide. The Federal Circuit affirmed the use of relatively narrow competitive areas for SES members, and made clear that agency discretion in SES RIFs was considerable, <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 153 F.3d 1348, 1352-57 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Schmidt's first argument is that, when it conducted the SES RIF, Interior violated 5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(a) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 359.602(a)(2). Section 3595(a) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall establish competitive procedures for determining who shall be removed from the Senior Executive Service in any reduction in force of career appointees within that agency. The competitive procedures shall be designed to assure that such determinations are primarily on the basis of performance, as determined under subchapter II of chapter 43 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 359.602(a)(2) tracks the statutory provision. It provides that "[a]n agency shall establish competitive procedures in writing to determine who will be removed from the SES in any reduction in force of career appointees within the agency. Such competitive procedures shall be based primarily on performance." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 359.602(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Schmidt argues that the RIF procedures that were adopted by Interior in 1995 violated the statute and implementing regulation because they limited competitive areas to bureaus. According to Mr. Schmidt, Interior's SES RIF plan failed to ensure that competition was based on the relative performance of the executives covered by the RIF, as required by the statute. He contends that, in order to comply with &#x00A7; 3595(a), Interior should have established a department-wide competitive area for its SES employees. He bases this contention on the fact that lnterior's SES members were subject to the administrative authority of the agency's Executive Resources Board (ERB). Mr. Schmidt also contends that, before the Board, Interior failed to provide a rational explanation for its decision to structure the agency's competitive areas based upon its bureaus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note first that there is no language in the statute that requires that an agency conducting a RIF of SES employees adopt department-wide competitive areas. Section 3595(a) simply states that RIF procedures shall be designed to assure that the determination as to which employees shall be removed shall be made "primarily on the basis of performance." Indeed, Congress was urged to adopt statutory language which would have required department-wide competitive areas but declined to do so. We further note that the relevant portion of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement recognizes that "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3595(a) requires competition for job retention." FPM Supplement 920-1, S10-7d(1) (1989). It then continues by stating that "[t]he competitive area may be the full agency or a major component of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at S10-7d(2). In short, neither the language of the statute, the legislative history, nor OPM's guidance on the statute supports Mr. Schmidt's contention that Interior was required to adopt department-wide competitive areas as part of its SES RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, Mr. Schmidt argues that Interior should have established a department-wide competitive area for its SES members because, regardless of the particular bureau in which they worked, the SES members all were subject to the administrative authority of the ERB. Mr. Schmidt contends that a proper competitive area under &#x00A7; 3595(a) is one in which the employees are subject to a "single administrative authority." In making this argument, Mr. Schmidt cites <span class="Italic">Williams v.</span> <span class="Italic">Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 24 MSPR 555, 557 (1984). In that case, the Board held that the government had violated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.402(b) by conducting a RIF using competitive areas that failed to include all employees assigned under a single administrative authority. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Mr. Schmidt's reliance on <span class="Italic">Williams</span> is misplaced, however, because &#x00A7; 351.402(b) does not apply to SES members. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.202(b) ("This part [part 351] does not apply to an employee:...In a position in the Senior Executive Service."). Accordingly, there is no requirement that competitive areas for SES RIFs include all employees subject to a single administrative authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Schmidt also contends that we should not uphold the Board's decision because, before the Board, Interior failed to provide a rational explanation for using bureau-wide competitive areas in setting up its SES RIF procedures. Specifically, Mr. Schmidt argues that lnterior's decision on this point was irrational because (1) the decision was made without full understanding of RIF procedures; (2) the agency officials who formulated the RIF procedures in 1995 acted beyond the scope of their authority; (3) the officials did not consult with personnel specialists; (4) the agency provided no explanation for setting the competitive areas at the bureau level; and (5) the decision was inconsistent with the pertinent provisions of the FPM. These contentions are without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record suggests that agency officials failed to fully understand the relevant RIF procedures. Nor did agency officials exceed the scope of their authority by adopting the SES RIF plan without the approval of the ERB; the adoption of such a plan does not require ERB approval. Section 3595(a) simply provides that "[a]n <span class="Italic">agency</span> shall establish competitive procedures" for an SES RIF. 5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(a) (emphasis added). There is no requirement that the SES RIF plan be approved by the ERB. Nor is there a requirement that agency officials consult with personnel specialists prior to adopting an SES RIF plan. Furthermore, as noted above, Interior did provide an explanation for adopting bureau-wide competitive areas, and for the reasons discussed above, the use of those competitive areas did not conflict with the FPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, it is well settled that, as long as an agency's actions are not arbitrary or capricious, it has the discretion to establish single-person competitive areas or competitive areas in which all positions are abolished. <span class="Italic">See Ginnodo v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management</span>, 753 F.2d 1061, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (affirming agency's elimination of a competitive area consisting of only a single individual); <span class="Italic">Grier v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 750 F.2d 944, 946 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (affirming agency's elimination of all positions in a competitive area). Mr. Schmidt argues that <span class="Italic">Ginnodo</span> and <span class="Italic">Grier</span> are inapplicable because both of those cases involved <span id="Page_3021"></span>general schedule RIFs rather than SES RIFs. He contends that, unlike 5 USC &#x00A7; 3502(a), which governs RIFs of general schedule employees, &#x00A7; 3595(a) entitles SES employees to actually compete for retention. However, we discern no such distinction between the competition requirement in &#x00A7; 3502(a) and &#x00A7; 3595(a). Both sections require that the government establish competitive retention procedures, but neither statute guarantees that actual competition will occur. <span class="Italic">Ginnodo</span> and <span class="Italic">Grier</span> both apply in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As he did before the Board, Mr. Schmidt argues that, in the course of the SES RIF, Interior committed various prohibited personnel practices, in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) and (b)(11). He also points to alleged violations of 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3392, 3393, 3131(7), and 3131(13). Section 2302(b)(6) states that it is a prohibited personnel practice to</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">grant any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for employment (including defining the scope or manner of competition or the requirements for any position) for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to Mr. Schmidt, Interior violated this provision when it formulated an SES RIF plan that limited the competition among SES employees to individual bureaus. Mr. Schmidt contends that, by limiting competition in this way, Interior ensured that it would be able to exercise increased control over which employees would be retained at the conclusion of the RIF, thereby ignoring the requirement of &#x00A7; 3595(a) for competitive procedures. The argument requires little discussion. We have held above that Interior's use of bureau-wide competitive areas was permitted by 5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(a). In any event, there is no evidence in the record that, when it conducted the SES RIF, Interior was targeting particular employees, either for retention or separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(11) [now 2302(b)(12)] makes it a prohibited personnel practice to</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">take or fail to take any other personnel action if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The thrust of Mr. Schmidt's argument is that Interior violated this section and hence &#x00A7; 3595(a) by basing its RIF plan upon organizational location rather than on relative performance. As part of this argument, he also asserts that the RIF plan violated 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3392, 3393, 3131(7), and 3131(13). The argument is unavailing. Again, we have held that lnterior's SES RIF plan did not violate 5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(a). Also without merit are Mr. Schmidt's arguments relating to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3392, 3393, 3131(7), and 3131(13). Sections 3392 and 3393 concern appointments to SES positions and are completely unrelated to the retention of employees during a RIF. Section 3131(7) states that the SES shall be administered so as to "protect senior executives from arbitrary or capricious actions." We have already discussed above why the agency's action was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Section 3131(13) states that the SES shall be administered so as to "provide for an executive system which is guided by the public interest and free from improper political interference." The record contains no indication that Mr. Schmidt's removal from the SES was influenced by political motives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the AJ determined that Mr. Schmidt's challenge to Interior's efforts to place him and other employees of the Bureau did not concern the "competitive procedures" required by 5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(a) and therefore was not within the jurisdiction of the Board. On appeal, Mr. Schmidt argues that this ruling was error. He contends that he should have been allowed to present evidence concerning the agency's efforts to place him and other SES employees during the RIF. He asserts that the evidence would have shown that the agency violated &#x00A7; 3595(a) by "hand-selecting" three senior executives from the Bureau for positions within Interior after the RIF was announced and by withholding "vacant" SES positions within Interior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ did not err in ruling that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Schmidt's complaints about Interior's efforts to place him and other SES employees. "The jurisdiction of the Board is not plenary. Rather, it is limited to those matters specifically entrusted to it by statute or regulation." <span class="Italic">Serrao v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 95 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Section 3595(c) provides that "[a] career appointee is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701 of this title whether the reduction in force complies with the competitive procedures required under subsection (a)." Thus, section 3595(c) limits the Board's jurisdiction to claims that the agency failed to comply with the competitive procedures required by &#x00A7; 3595(a). Mr. Schmidt contends that these competitive procedures must be utilized when placing SES members into vacant positions pursuant to &#x00A7; 3595(b)(3).[6] We do not read the statute in this manner. Section 3595(a) grants SES employees the right to compete for retention only within a particular competitive area. Once the agency has determined that an employee must be removed from the SES because all SES positions within the competitive area have been abolished or because the employee is too low on the retention register, no further competition is required by &#x00A7; 3595(a) for assignments to vacant SES positions pursuant to &#x00A7; 3595(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Section 3595(b)(3) grants SES employees the right to be assigned to any vacant SES position for which they are qualified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A career appointee who, but for this subsection, would be removed from the Senior Executive Service due to a reduction in force within an agency...is entitled to be assigned by the head of that agency to a vacant Senior Executive Service position for which the career appointee is qualified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 USC &#x00A7; 3595(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the AJ recognized, the essence of Mr. Schmidt's argument is that the agency failed to comply with &#x00A7; 3595(b)(3). Plainly, the Board lacks jurisdiction over such a claim. Prior to 1984, &#x00A7; 3595(c) granted SES members the right to appeal to the Board the issue of whether the government took all reasonable steps to achieve placement in other SES positions as required by &#x00A7; 3595(b)(3). However, in the 1984 amendments to this section, Congress specifically eliminated that appeal right and instead granted SES members the right to fallback to a GS-15 position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-615, &#x00A7; 303, 98 Stat. 3195, 3218. Accordingly, the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Schmidt's claim that the agency's placement efforts failed to comply with the statutory requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Schmidt raises the additional contention that the Board had jurisdiction to review the agency's placement efforts pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4).[8] We disagree. Section 2302(b)(4) cannot establish Board jurisdiction because &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction and does not by itself authorize an appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (holding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over a claim that an agency committed prohibited personnel practices in violation of &#x00A7; 2302(b)). Furthermore, Mr. Schmidt cannot avoid the limitations imposed by &#x00A7; 3595(c) on SES RIF appeals by invoking other statutory provisions. As discussed above, Congress specifically amended &#x00A7; 3595(c) to eliminate Board jurisdiction for exactly the type of claim asserted by Mr. Schmidt. The limitations on Board jurisdiction expressed in &#x00A7; 3595(c), a statute which deals specifically with SES RIFS, must prevail over other more general provisions such as those found in &#x00A7; 2302(b). <span class="Italic">See Thiess v. Witt</span>, 100 F.3d 915, 919 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (recognizing the standard rule that a specific statute controls over a more general one).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Section 2302(b)(4) provides that it is a prohibited personnel practice to "deceive or willfully obstruct any person with respect to such person's right to compete for employment."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Given an appeal from the RIF of an SES member, the governing regulations are ordinarily those of the employing agency.

FERC</span>, 41 MSPR 653, 655 (1989) (remanding for a determination of the authority of FERC to issue its own RIF regulations and the impact of any Department of Energy regulations).

Dept. of Commerce</span>, 24 MSPR 398, 400-02 (1984), discussed competitive level determinations for SES members and set aside the appellant's RIF because the appellant's ranking within a performance-based competitive group was based on an evaluation that lacked any correlation to his performance elements and standards. <span class="Italic">Biter v. ICC</span>, 76 MSPR 82, 87-94 (1997), considered the rights of SES members in transfers of function under 5 USC 3503(a).
