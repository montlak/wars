<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-94"><span class="space">1.</span> Appeal of Probationary Termination</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The probationary appointment is the product of 5 USC 3321, separately providing periods of competitive service probation for nonsupervisory and supervisory or managerial personnel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 3321. Competitive service; probationary period</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The President may take such action, including the issuance of rules, regulations, and directives, as shall provide as nearly as conditions of good administration warrant for a period of probation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;before an appointment in the competitive service becomes final; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;before initial appointment as a supervisor or manager becomes final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An individual--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;who has been transferred, assigned, or promoted from a position to a supervisory or managerial position, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;who does not satisfactorily complete the probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was transferred, assigned, or promoted. <span id="Page_138"></span>Nothing in this section prohibits an agency from taking an action against an individual serving a probationary period under subsection (a)(2) of this section for cause unrelated to supervisory or managerial performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to appointments in the Senior Executive Service or the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration Senior Executive Service, or any individual covered by section 1599e of title 10.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Executive Order 12107 authorizes OPM to issue rules for administration of the competitive service. By regulation OPM establishes a limited right of appeal to the Board for competitive service employees terminated in their first (probationary) year. The right of a probationer to appeal applies only to competitive service employees. 5 CFR 315.801-.806 (2022). The probationary appeal scheme for competitive service employees creates a small but significant portion of the Board's caseload--about 6%, according to the Board's FY 2015 Annual Report (more than the combination of RIF, suitability, performance, and VEOA appeals after adjustment for the unusual level of furlough appeals that year). The excepted service preference eligible employee does not have a right to any appeal from termination during his first or trial year of service. Postal employees are excepted service and they do not receive competitive service probationary protections. <span class="Italic">See Gordon v. USPS</span>, CH-315H-17-0418-I-1 (NP 6/7/2022) ("As the administrative judge correctly noted in addressing the appellant's claim under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c), the Board only has jurisdiction over a claim under section 315.806 for employees in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Ramirez-Evans v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). Postal Service employees have not been part of the competitive service since the enactment of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. <span class="Italic">Daisy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 15, 19 (1995). Therefore, Postal Service employees, like the appellant, cannot establish Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(c)."). The probationer has the burden of proving the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Herring v. VA</span>, 72 MSPR 96, 98 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulation granting the Board jurisdiction over competitive service probationers' appeals, 5 CFR 315.806 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Right of appeal</span>. An employee may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board in writing an agency's decision to terminate him under &#x00A7; 315.804 or &#x00A7; 315.805 only as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The Merit Systems Protection Board review is confined to the issues stated in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">On discrimination</span>. An employee may appeal under this paragraph a termination not required by statute which he or she alleges was based on partisan political reasons or marital status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">On improper procedure</span>. A probationer whose termination is subject to &#x00A7; 315.805 may appeal on the ground that his termination was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of that section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;An employee may appeal to the Board under this section a termination that the employee alleges was based on discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, (including pregnancy and gender identity), national origin, age (as defined by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended), or disability. An appeal alleging a discriminatory termination may be filed under this subsection only if such discrimination is raised in addition to one of the issues stated in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-099.html#sec1-98">Probationary Supervisor</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-08-139.html#sec1-138">Veterans Readjustment Act</a>" concerning a limited probationary-type appeal right for excepted service Veterans Readjustment Act employees; refer to 5 CFR 316.304 (2022) for probationary appeal rights of employees serving trial periods in competitive service nonpermanent appointments.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rounding out the regulatory definition of appeal rights, the two regulations incorporated by reference in 5 CFR 315.806 (2022) are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 315.804 <span class="Italic">Termination of probationers for unsatisfactory performance or conduct</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to &#x00A7; 315.803(b), when an agency decides to terminate an employee serving a probationary or trial period because his work performance or conduct during this period fails to demonstrate his fitness or his qualifications for continued employment, it shall terminate his services by notifying him in writing as to why he is being separated and the effective date of the action. The information in the notice as to why the employee is being terminated shall, as a minimum, consist of the agency's conclusions as to the inadequacies of his performance or conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 315.805 <span class="Italic">Termination of probationers for conditions arising before appointment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subject to &#x00A7; 315.803(b), when an agency proposes to terminate an employee serving a probationary or trial period for reasons based in whole or in part on conditions arising before his appointment, the employee is entitled to the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Notice of proposed adverse action. The employee is entitled to an advance written notice stating the reasons, specifically and in detail, for the proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Employee's answer. The employee is entitled to a reasonable time for filing a written answer to the notice of proposed adverse action and for furnishing affidavits in support of his answer. If the employee answers, the agency shall consider the answer in reaching its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Notice of adverse decision. The employee is entitled to be notified of the agency's decision at the earliest practicable date. The agency shall deliver the decision to the employee at or before the time the action will be made effective. The notice shall be in writing, inform the employee of the reasons for the action, inform the employee of his right to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and inform him of the time limit within which the appeal must be submitted as provided in &#x00A7; 315.806(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because an employee in the competitive service who is serving a probationary period under an initial appointment is not included within the definition of "employee" in 5 USC Chapter 75, the probationer has no statutory adverse action appeal right. 5 USC 7512-13. With the exception of certain situations, later described, involving probationary supervisors, terminations of probationary employees are not required to meet the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">Vilt v. U.S. Marshals Serv.</span>, 16 MSPR 192, 199 n.7 (1983). For a brief description of the procedural scheme permitting limited appeals for probationers, review <span class="Italic">Sampson v. Murray</span>, 415 U.S. 61, 94 S. Ct. 937, 940 (1974).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Funari v. VA</span>, DA-315H-12-0319-I-1 (NP 11/27/2013), described the limited availability of a Board hearing for a terminated probationer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal from a termination during the appellant's probationary period; however, the Board may consider an appeal when the appellant alleges that his termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status, or his termination for pre-appointment conditions was procedurally deficient. <span class="Italic">Hurston v. Department of the Army</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 8 (2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806. Alternatively, an appellant can show he qualifies as a competitive service "employee" with 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 appeal rights by showing that he was not serving a probationary period at the time of termination or had completed 1 year of current continuous service under an appointment other than a temporary one limited to 1 year or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">Hurston</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Probationers do not have a right to a pretermination hearing, <span class="Italic">Peery v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 377, 379 (1989), although the regulation, 5 CFR 315.805, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, provides the probationer who is terminated for preappointment reasons a written advance notice of the reasons for the termination, an opportunity to supply a written response for the agency's consideration, and an expeditious <span id="Page_139"></span>final agency decision. Probationary appointees terminated for pre- or postappointment reasons get a Board hearing under 5 CFR 315.806 (2022) on allegations that termination occurred because of partisan political reasons or marital status. Any probationary appointee who asserts one of those bases for a hearing may also present other issues of discrimination raised as to the termination. [Refer later in this Chapter to "Preappointment Conditions" for the right to appeal a probationary termination concerning those reasons, in addition to or to the exclusion of partisan political reasons or marital status.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 82 MSPR 211, 214-15 &#x00B6; 7 (1999), the probationer who believes that her termination results from whistleblowing reprisal is not barred from appealing to the Board to assert violations of law encompassed within the ordinary appeal from a probationer's termination and from separately initiating through OSC, and then pursuing to the Board, an IRA appeal [discussed in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-148.html#sec13-142">Probationary Termination</a>"] . <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Varney v. MSPB</span>, 112 Fed. Appx. 748, 750 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (probationer could appeal directly to the Board if she asserted that her termination was because of martial status or for partisan political reasons; allegation of whistleblowing reprisal had to first be routed through OSC to be brought to the Board under IRA appeal to challenge the probationary termination); <span class="Italic">Blackwell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, PH-315H-11-0091-I-1 (NP 12/15/2011) (probationer's appeal: "The appellant's petition for review solely addresses the appellant's assertions that the agency acted in retaliation for the appellant's whistleblowing activities. The administrative judge explained to the appellant that, in order to establish Board jurisdiction over an individual right of action (IRA) appeal, the appellant must show that he exhausted his administrative remedies before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and must make nonfrivolous allegations that (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. The record below does not contain any allegations or evidence that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedies or even contacted OSC to submit a complaint. Similarly, the appellant's petition for review does not include any evidence or argument that the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies. Accordingly, we discern no basis to reverse the holding below that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this matter.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Probationary supervisors have the right to Board review of allegations that their terminations resulted from discrimination based on partisan politics or marital status. 5 CFR 315.908(b) (2022). <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 270, 271, 7 MSPB 169 (1981); <span class="Italic">Mendez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 5 MSPR 223, 225, 5 MSPB 270 (1981) (when the supervisor who was not downgraded appealed her reassignment to a nonsupervisory position during the probationary period, she did not allege that the agency action was based on partisan political reasons or marital status; the Board lacked jurisdiction over an associated claim of discrimination based on race and sex); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 3 MSPR 517, 518-19 (1980) (explaining the distinctions in probationary appeal rights before and after the Reform Act and Reorganization Plan 1 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 19807 (1978)). According to <span class="Italic">Collins v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 51 MSPR 697, 699-700 (1991), procedural irregularity on the agency's part in returning probationary supervisors to their former positions does not give the employee the right to a Board appeal that he does not otherwise have. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-08-099.html#sec1-98">Probationary Supervisor</a>" in this chapter.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board strictly construes probationers' appeal rights, meaning that the appellate jurisdiction is not expanded beyond the OPM regulatory grant. The EEO process may be used to challenge a probationer's termination under the civil rights acts. But the Board only considers an appeal from a probationer's termination for postappointment reasons if there is an allegation of partisan political or marital status discrimination. 5 CFR 315.806 (2022); <span class="Italic">Wunderlich v. DOJ</span>, 2 MSPR 239, 240, 2 MSPB 402 (1980); <span class="Italic">Kellum v. VA</span>, 2 MSPR 65, 66, 2 MSPB 237 (1980) ("neither law nor regulation provided the Board with appellate jurisdiction over a probationary employee's termination for post appointment reasons, absent an allegation of partisan political or marital status discrimination... The new evidence which the appellant offers with his petition for review bears on the issue of whether the agency has justified the misconduct allegations against the appellant. The Board finds this to be argument concerning the sufficiency and propriety of the appellant's termination. Since the appellant's termination is not an action subject to the Board's appellate jurisdiction, we find any evidence concerning the substantive issues in that action to be immaterial."). If a probationer is terminated for postappointment reasons, under 5 CFR 315.806 (2022), the Board does not review alleged procedural defects. <span class="Italic">Steele v. GSA</span>, 6 MSPR 368, 373, 6 MSPB 314 (1981). A probationer alleging a coerced resignation will not have an appeal to the Board unless there is an allegation tying the termination to a nonfrivolous allegation of covered discrimination. <span class="Italic">Chaney v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 197, 198 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 14 MSPR 623, 623 n.* (1983) ("Appellant's [a probationary employee] resignation in lieu of termination provided him with no greater appeal rights than he would have had if he had been terminated during his probationary period."); <span class="Italic">Rosenbach v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 37, 38 (1981) (a probationer who resigns has no greater rights than does a probationer who is terminated). [For appeal rights of Veterans Readjustment Act excepted service employees, similar to those of competitive service probationers, refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-139.html#sec1-138">Veterans Readjustment Act</a>."]</p>
