<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-89"><span class="space">14.</span> Leave Restoration for MSPB, Related Proceedings; Compensatory Time; Official Time</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Drake v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 37 MSPR 676, 678-81 (1988), declined to award employees compensatory time or administrative leave in lieu of counsel fees for time taken to reply to adverse action proposals or pursue their appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ISSUE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Can the Board grant compensatory time to a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant in lieu of attorney fees for 140 hours of annual leave time used in successfully pursuing <span class="Italic">pro se</span> actions?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's appellate jurisdiction is defined in 5 CFR 1201.3. Although its jurisdiction may be conferred by statute or regulation, the Board has no power to expand or diminish that jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Pratt v. Veterans Administration,</span> 3 MSPB 376, 3 MSPR 288, 289 (1980). The Board has consistently held that attorney fees cannot be awarded under 5 USC 7701(g)(1) to nonattorneys<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Department of the Interior,</span> 24 MSPR 209, 211 (1984) (no attorney fees awarded to nonattorney representative); <span class="Italic">Horton v. United States Postal Service,</span> 7 MSPB 138, 7 MSPR 232, 234-35 (1981) (attorney-client relationship could not exist where the employee's representative was not an attorney-at-law). Nor may fees be awarded as paralegal expenses to an appellant, absent evidence he was employed in such a capacity by his attorney. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 31 MSPR 219, 223 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While a few courts have awarded fees to nonlawyer <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants, these cases generally involve actions brought under the Freedom of Information Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 M.F. Derfner and A.D. Wolf, <span class="Italic">Court Awarded Attorney fees &#x00A7;</span> 7.03[3] (1985). Moreover, the Board has recognized that there is a distinction between the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act and the attorney fee award provisions of 5 USC 7701(g)(1). In the former, successful complainants enhance the public interest by acting as agents of the national policy of public disclosure by bringing the government into compliance, while the purpose of the latter is to protect the proprietary interest in Federal employment, in the interest of justice, of employees and applicants who substantially prevail, with minimal benefit derived by the public. <span class="Italic">See Horton,</span> 7 MSPR at 235 n.5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An excused absence is defined in Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 990-2, Subchapter S11-1, as "an absence from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay and without charge to leave." The same authority provides that, "[o]rdinarily excused absences are authorized on an individual basis, except where an installation is closed or a group of employees is excused from work for various purposes." Agencies are generally authorized to determine administratively those situations in which employees will be excused from duty without charge to leave and may restrict or limit such absences as they deem them to be warranted<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at Subchapter S11-5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employees whose agencies have proposed adverse actions against them are granted certain rights by 5 CFR 752.404(c)(1). Upon request, if those employees are otherwise in an active duty status, an agency is required to give them a reasonable amount of official time to review the material the agency is relying upon to support the proposed action and to prepare an answer and secure affidavits. Official time is time at the worksite. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Letter 752-12, April 28, 1983. However, no regulation or OPM guidance provides for granting compensatory time for any period away from the worksite the employee spends preparing a response under circumstances such as those present in the case now under consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Comptroller General, whose authority extends to matters of this type, has not issued any decision relating to an award of compensatory time in lieu of attorney fees in any case. The ruling we have found to be the most analogous involves a question of entitlement to court leave authorized under 5 USC &#x00A7; 6322. In 59 Comp. Gen. 290 (1980), an employee brought a civil action against her employing agency in a United States district court based on sex discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The court awarded the appellant a retroactive promotion with back pay and attorney fees. The agency asked the Comptroller General for a ruling on whether it could grant the plaintiff's request to change 6 days of charged annual leave that she used to attend her trial to administrative or court leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his decision, the Comptroller General ruled that an employee on court leave is considered to be on official time, rather than on leave, and that court leave is limited under 5 USC &#x00A7; 6322(a) to jurors and witnesses, and is not applicable to plaintiffs in a sex discrimination action. However, considering the "make whole" purposes of Section 717(c) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and an employee's entitlement under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.214(b) to a reasonable amount of official time to pursue her administrative remedy under the law, the Comptroller General found that it would be "inconsistent and indefensible" to hold an employee at a less advantageous position for successfully pursuing a judicial remedy specifically provided by the Act beyond the administrative level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He also noted that if the employee had been separated for sex discrimination, rather than passed over for promotion, and she had been ordered by the court to be restored retroactively with back pay, neither her back pay nor her annual leave would have been reduced for the time she spent attending her trial, because under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596, she would have been deemed to have performed service for the agency during the entire period she suffered the unjustified and unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its policy guidance relating to the Comptroller General's decision, the Office of Personnel Management noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies may continue to grant leave, as appropriate, to employees who are plaintiffs in court suits against the Government for purposes similar to those identified above. A determination that the absence is to be treated as official "hours of work" and leave restored accordingly can be made only upon conclusion of the court action. If the employee-plaintiff does not prevail in such a <span class="Italic">civil rights</span> action, the original leave charge must stand. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Bulletin No. 630-38 (August 4, 1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where the congressional purpose is to "achieve equality of employment opportunities," <span class="Italic">see Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</span> 401 U.S. 424, 429, 91 S. Ct. 849, 852, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971), the underlying policy, as stated in Section 3 of the Civil Service Reform Act, is "to provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and productive Federal work force reflective of the Nation's diversity, and to improve the quality of public service." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1101 note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress' main intent in enacting the attorney fees award provision of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)...was to award, in the interest of justice, the employee or applicant who has substantially prevailed in protecting his proprietary interest in his federal employment with the reimbursement of attorney fees. Any public benefit derived from a successful vindication of employment rights in many if not most cases will be minimal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Horton,</span> 7 MSPR at 235 n.5. Since the instant case, unlike the action <span id="Page_4894"></span>involved in the Comptroller General's decision, was not brought under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the "make-whole" objective of that Act is not applicable. Therefore, we find that 59 Comp. Gen. 290 does not provide support for the position of the appellant in the case now before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Horton,</span> 7 MSPR at 235, a case not involving prohibited discrimination, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 235 n.6, the Board found that the existence of an attorney-client relationship between an employee and his representative was essential in order for attorney fees to have been incurred and before the Board can award attorney fees under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing analysis, and in the absence of any authority supporting the appellant's request, we find that the Board has no authority to award the appellant compensatory time in lieu of attorney fees for annual leave used in successfully pursuing his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disputed in <span class="Italic">Forrest v. USDA</span>, 74 MSPR 213, 219-25 (1997), was whether an appellant may recover the leave he took to meet with his attorney during the course of a Board appeal from denial of a step increase. Neither the Reform Act nor the Back Pay Act allowed for restoration of that leave. The leave could be recovered as a component of compensatory damages, if supported by statute, apparently, through a settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has provided the Board with the following authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;The Merit Systems Protection Board shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;hear, adjudicate, or provide for the hearing or adjudication, of all matters within the jurisdiction of the Board under this title, chapter 43 of title 38, or any other law, rule, or regulation, and, subject to otherwise applicable provision of law, take final action on any such matter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;order any Federal agency or employee to comply with any order or decision issued by the Board under authority granted under paragraph (1) of this subsection and enforce compliance with any such order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 1204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has found that the statutory provision currently codified at &#x00A7; 1204 constitutes a broad grant of enforcement power that enables the Board to make substantive assessments of whether the agency placed an appellant as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> upon cancellation of an unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for</span> <span class="Italic">the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court further explained that the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> concept required the agency to place the injured party as near as may be in the situation he would have occupied if the wrong had not been committed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 733 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to return an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the Board typically orders an agency to award all back pay and benefits which are due the employee in accordance with the Back Pay Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this section does not specifically discuss an award of leave, 5 USC 5596(b)(1)(B) and OPM's regulations implementing the Back Pay Act do. Subsection 5596(b)(1)(B) provides the procedures for accounting for annual leave restored pursuant to the Act that exceeds the maximum leave accumulation permitted by law. 5 CFR 550.803 states that the term "pay, allowances, and differentials" means monetary and employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation by virtue of the performance of a Federal function. The Board has also specifically found that an award under the Back Pay Act includes crediting the appellant with all of the leave he would have accrued but for the unwarranted personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations further provide that when an appropriate authority corrects an unjustified personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal, reduction, or denial of all or part of the pay, allowances, and differentials otherwise due an employee, the employee shall be deemed to have performed service for the agency during the period covered by the corrective action, and that the agency shall compute for that period the pay, allowances, and differentials the employee would have received if the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action had not occurred. 5 CFR 550.805(a). An appellant, however, may not receive any amount in excess of that which he would have normally earned. <span class="Italic">See Lavelle</span>, 37 MSPR at 89[;] 5 CFR 550.805(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under the Back Pay Act, the relevant inquiry is whether the appellant's use of annual leave to consult his attorney constituted leave he was otherwise denied due to an unwarranted personnel action, or whether reimbursing his use of leave here would constitute a payment in excess of that which he normally earned. We find that, because the personnel action at issue, a denial of a within-grade increase, did not cause the appellant's removal from the rolls, he was able to accrue and use the annual leave to which he was entitled during the entire period of the personnel action at issue. Reimbursing him for the leave in question, which the appellant accrued and used, would constitute a payment in excess of what he would have normally earned and is, therefore, not required to restore him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hawkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 633, 638-39 (1993) (Back Pay Act entitled the appellant to receive all of the leave she was unable to accrue and use during the unwarranted personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that no authority exists for allowing time spent to consult a representative regarding a Board appeal to be considered official time or administrative leave. Unlike the FLRA or the EEOC, the Board has no specific statutory or regulatory authority for allowing the use of official time to pursue an appeal. 5 USC 7105(g)(3) and 7131 pertain to the FLRA and authorize that agency to take any remedial action it considers appropriate to carry out its statutory purpose, and provide for official time in connection with an employee's participation for, and on behalf of, labor organizations. 29 CFR 1614.605 of the EEOC's regulations allows a complainant employee a reasonable amount of official time to prepare an equal employment opportunity complaint and to respond to agency and EEOC requests for information. The EEOC was specifically granted administration and enforcement authority of equal opportunity in Federal employment, and the authority to issue regulations regarding Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, pursuant to Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 19,807 (1978), and Executive Order 12106, 44 Fed. Reg. 1053 (1978)<span class="Italic">. See</span> 54 Fed. Reg. 45,747 (1989). The Board, however, has no comparable statutory or regulatory authority authorizing such leave to pursue an appeal before the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 610.301-306 also fail to require the granting of administrative leave under the circumstances at issue before us. These regulations describe the circumstances under which an agency may dismiss certain employees on administrative leave. The regulations state that granting short periods of administrative leave may be appropriate when normal operations are interrupted by events beyond anyone's control, to close an establishment for managerial reasons, to promote the public interest by relieving employees from work to participate in civil activities which the government is interested in encouraging, and for other circumstances which an agency authorizes under its regulations. 5 CFR 610.302, 610.305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that 5 USC 6304(d)(1)(A), which provides for the restoration of leave lost due to an administrative error, does not entitle the appellant to reimbursement of the leave in question. As stated above, the appellant here did not lose his leave. He accrued and used it in a manner to which he was entitled. Section 6304(d)(1)(A) does not provide for restoration under these circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Adams v. United States</span>, 3 Cl. Ct. 696 (1983); <span class="Italic">In re Peterson</span>, No. B-239118, 1990 WL 278507 (C.G. Sept. 18, 1990) (unpublished).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the present case is distinguishable from our decision in <span class="Italic">Tyrrell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 MSPR 276, 278-79 (1994), which found that the appellant's claim that the agency "forced him to use annual leave and sick leave while he was demoted," along with other claims, constituted a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had not restored him to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> in rescinding the action before the Board. That decision does not indicate the circumstances under which the appellant was allegedly "forced" to use leave, and the circumstances here concern the appellant's voluntary actions--his desire to meet with his chosen representative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A desire to meet with one's representative, however, does not constitute being forced to use leave against one's will. Although an appellant has a statutory right to representation before the Board, representation is not required. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 MSPR 288, 291 n.2 (1990); <span class="Italic">Grassell v. Department of Transp.</span>, 40 MSPR 554, 564 (1989). Any selection of a representative is at the appellant's discretion, and difficulties in securing representation and errors by representatives do not excuse appellants' failures to properly prosecute their appeals.... Here, the appellant elected to retain a representative who was located two hours away and who insisted upon meeting during normal business hours. The appellant is responsible for this personal choice. We, therefore, conclude that, due to the absence of a grant of authority for the Board to fashion such a remedy, the appellant is not entitled to Board-ordered reimbursement of leave used to consult his attorney. <span class="Italic">See King v. Jerome</span>, 42 F.3d 1371, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988)) (the Board may not supplant the remedies Congress expressly provided or create new remedies which it believes Congress overlooked).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find, however, that, because the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency discriminated against him on the bases of his race, national origin, and sex in effecting the action, he is entitled to reimbursement for a reasonable amount of annual leave used to consult his attorney as compensatory damages under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (CRA). In <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 191 (1996), the Board addressed the issue of whether the agency had rescinded an appealable action and rendered the appeal moot in light of the appellant's claim that he might be entitled to compensatory damages based upon his claims <span id="Page_4895"></span>of age, race, and sex discrimination. In finding that an outstanding claim for compensatory damages precluded a finding of mootness, the Board discussed the differences between the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy available under the Back Pay Act, and compensatory damages available under the CRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board explained that, prior to the CRA, it was limited to providing <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief--complete rescission of the appealed action. This consisted of canceling the action, restoring the appellant to his former or other substantially equivalent position, as appropriate, back pay, interest on back pay, and other employment benefits that he would have received had the action not occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 196-97. The CRA, however, authorized for the first time an award of compensatory damages in a Board appeal based on claims of intentional discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, or the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. The Board further explained that the term "compensatory damages," as it pertained to the CRA, excluded back pay, interest on back pay, or any other type of previously available relief, and includes future pecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish, loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 196-97 (citing 42 USC 1981a(b)(3)). The Board, therefore, found that because of its broadened remedial power in mixed cases under the CRA, the standard for mootness is whether the appellant has received all of the possible, effectual relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that reimbursement for the reasonable amount of annual leave used to consult an attorney to pursue a Board appeal constitutes compensatory damages within the meaning of the CRA. The Office of the Comptroller General has addressed the question of an employee's entitlement to recover annual leave used to successfully pursue a sex discrimination claim against her employing agency for failing to promote her. It found the employee entitled to reimbursement for annual leave used to attend her trial in United States District Court, by considering the "make whole" purpose of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in conjunction with the Back Pay Act. It also recognized that, had the employee been removed, rather than passed over for promotion, she would have been entitled to recover the annual leave that she would have been denied during the time of the court trial under the Back Pay Act. It concluded that charging the employee with official time, rather than annual leave, for the time spent in court achieved the "make whole" objective of the Civil Rights Act. 59 Comp. Gen. 290 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this case was decided before the CRA, and is, therefore, not dispositive of our broadened remedial authority, we find it provides helpful guidance regarding the appropriateness of reimbursing leave to achieve a make-whole remedy. Thus, we find here that reimbursing the appellant for the reasonable amount of time spent to consult with his representative regarding his appeal before us, which included a nonfrivolous allegation of prohibited discrimination, constitutes an award of compensatory damages within our broadened remedial powers under the CRA. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 29 CFR 1614.605 (under EEOC regulations, complainant employee allowed a reasonable amount of official time to prepare an equal employment opportunity complaint and to respond to agency and EEOC requests for information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because a valid claim for compensatory damages remains outstanding in this case, we are not divested of jurisdiction under the doctrine of mootness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Currier, Caldwell v. West</span>, 1994 WL 740586, No. 01934139 (EEOC June 2, 1994). <span class="Italic">See also Morgan v. Perry</span>, 1995 WL 405806, No. 01952077 (EEOC June 29, 1995) (complaint not moot where appellant's claim to restore annual leave used to consult attorney remained unresolved). Forwarding the matter to the regional office as a new appeal typically constitutes the appropriate remedy under these circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Currier</span>, at 200; <span class="Italic">Forrest</span>, 70 MSPR at 543-44; <span class="Italic">Rojas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 400, 407 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that following the forwarding of the prior <span class="Italic">Forrest</span> case, the parties entered into a settlement agreement which resolved the overtime and personnel record issues discussed in our prior decision. Under the terms of that agreement, as set forth in the initial decision dismissing that appeal as settled, the parties also agreed to allow litigation of both attorney fees and the annual leave issue before us, and the appellant agreed not to pursue an equal employment opportunity complaint and to withdraw the "above-titled appeal." We find that, based upon this agreement, the only matter remaining properly before us in this phase of the appeal is the issue of whether the amount of leave the appellant used to consult his attorney was reasonable.</p>

USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0283-C-1 (NP 8/10/2016) ("However, he has not shown that he was entitled to personal absence time or administrative leave for purposes of pursuing his Board appeal.
