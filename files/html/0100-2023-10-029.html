<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-31"><span class="space">3.</span> Confidential Employees; 5 USC 7112(b)(2)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Section 7112(b)(2) provides that a unit will not be appropriate for representation by a labor organization if it includes a confidential employee. Section 7103(a)(13) defines a "confidential employee" as one "who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot and NFFE Local 803</span>, 2 FLRA 659, 660 (1980). The statutory formulation may require analysis of the duties of both a boss and a subordinate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of Admin. Law Judges, Pittsburgh, Pa. and AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 40 FLRA 1021 (1991) (legal technician was in confidential relation to the District Chief Judge, but the judge had no significant role in formulating or effectuating labor-management relations policies).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office and AFGE Local 12,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v37/37-112.html">37 FLRA 1371</a>, 1376-77 (1990), summarized how FLRA classifies employees as confidential:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An employee is "confidential" if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations....&#8197;Of course, we will also exclude as a confidential employee any individual who actually formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations....</p>
<p class="noindent">In greater detail, from <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Office of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office and AFGE Local 12,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v37/37-112.html">37 FLRA 1371</a>, 1377 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(13) of the Statute defines a "confidential employee" as an employee "who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations." An employee is "confidential" if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Plant Representative Office, Mesa, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 181, 186 (1990) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Army, <span id="Page_34"></span>Mesa</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">1947th Administrative Support Group</span>, 14 FLRA at 225). <span class="Italic">See Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C. and Internal Revenue Service, Cincinnati District, Cincinnati, Ohio</span>, 36 FLRA 138, 145 (1990); <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard, 8th Coast Guard District, New Orleans, Louisiana</span>, 35 FLRA 84, 89 (1990); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 34 FLRA 207, 211-13 (1990); <span class="Italic">Headquarters, Fort Sam Houston, Fort Sam Houston, Texas</span>, 5 FLRA 339, 341-43 (1981). An employee is not "confidential" in the absence of either of these requirements. U.S. Army, Mesa, 35 FLRA at 186 (citing Tick Eradication Program, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, 15 FLRA 250, 252 (1984); Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, 5 FLRA 28, 31 (1981)). This two-part analysis is the Authority's "labor-nexus" test, which we use to examine the nature of an employee's confidential working relationship. Of course, we will also exclude as a confidential employee any individual who actually formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C.,</span> 35 FLRA 1249, 1255-57 (1990) (<span class="Italic">HUD, Washington</span>).</p>

Health Care Sys. and AFGE</span>, 66 FLRA 522, 524 (2012) (Member Beck dissenting as to another exemption discussed in the decision) (overruled as to personnel office employees by <span class="Italic">VA Kansas City Med.

<p class="noindent-1">The principles applied and the issues resolved by the RD in reaching these conclusions accurately reflect the principles and issues recognized as relevant by Authority precedent. Regarding "confidential employees," the Authority has held that an employee is not "confidential" unless (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor, and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yuma</span>, 37 FLRA at 244; <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 35 FLRA at 186 (same). The Authority has also held that labor-management relations matters are limited to matters such as contract negotiations and the disposition of grievances. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Broad. Bd. of Governors</span>, 64 FLRA 235, 236-37 (2009). Regarding employees involved in personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity, the Authority has held that the character and extent of the employee's involvement in personnel work must be more than clerical in nature, and the position's duties must not be performed in a routine manner; the employee must exercise independent judgment and discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA</span>, 56 FLRA at 1018; <span class="Italic">accord U.S. Dep't of Agric., Forest Serv., Albuquerque Serv. Ctr., Human Capital Mgmt., Albuquerque, N.M.</span>, 64 FLRA 239, 242 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric.</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Nat'l Mediation Bd. and AFGE</span>, 56 FLRA 1, 7 (2000), considering the unit status of an administrative assistant, reiterated the criteria that must be met before an employee is classified as confidential:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(13) of the Statute defines a "confidential employee" as an employee "who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations." An employee is "confidential" if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor, and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Headquarters, 1947th Administrative Support Group,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., </span>14 FLRA 220, 225 (1984). An employee is not "confidential" in the absence of either of these requirements. <span class="Italic">See Tick Eradication Program, Veterinary Services, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture</span>, 15 FLRA 250, 252 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, bargaining unit eligibility determinations are based on testimony as to an employee's actual duties at the time of the hearing rather than duties which may exist in the future. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Prescott, Arizona, </span>29 FLRA 1313, 1315 (1987). Bargaining unit eligibility determinations are not based on testimony as to what duties had been or would be performed by an employee occupying a certain position, because such evidence might not reflect the employee's actual duties. <span class="Italic">Id. See also U.S. Army</span> <span class="Italic">Engineer Topographic Laboratories, Fort Belvoir, Virginia</span>, 10 FLRA 125, 127 n.3 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Bonds serves as an Administrative Assistant to, and is directly supervised by, the Agency's Chief of Staff. There is no dispute that the Chief of Staff formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations. There is also no dispute that in her position as an Administrative Assistant, Bonds does not act in a confidential capacity to her immediate supervisor. Instead, the Agency's assertion that Bonds should be excluded as a confidential employee is based solely on Bond's relationship with Joyce Blackwell. According to the Agency, since Blackwell acts in a confidential capacity to the Agency's Chief of Staff and, since Bonds performs Blackwell's duties when Blackwell is on leave, "Bonds, like Blackwell, acts in a confidential capacity to [the Chief of Staff] in regard to labor-management relations," including employee grievance and performance issues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found, based on the testimony of Bonds and the Agency's Chief of Staff that on those occasions that Bonds has filled in for Blackwell, Bonds had not been involved in activities considered to be of a confidential nature. The RD further found that Bonds had never been advised that she might become involved in such matters at some future date. Our review of the record establishes that the RD's findings and conclusions are wholly supported by the evidence. We, therefore, conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that review should be granted concerning the confidential status of this employee.</p>
<p class="noindent">Excluded from the unit as confidential employees were an administrative officer and an administrative specialist who advised the deputy regional administrator who, in turn, was responsible for labor relations issue that might arise. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 71 FLRA 28, 30 (2019) (Member Abbott concurring, Member DuBester dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent">Criteria relied on in the analysis of confidential status were restated, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 59 FLRA 853, 855-56 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the RD erred in finding that Diane Blair is not a confidential employee under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) of the Statute by failing "to apply established law to the factual record." Under Authority precedent, an employee is confidential within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NASA, Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio</span>, 57 FLRA 571, 573 (2001) (<span class="Italic">NASA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the factors that the Authority considers when assessing whether an individual serves in a confidential capacity are whether the individual: (1) obtains advance information of management's position with regard to contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor relations matters, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>.; (2) attends meetings where labor-management matters are discussed, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Yuma Projects Office</span>, 37 FLRA at 247; (3) because of physical proximity to their supervisor, overhears discussions of labor-management matters, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>.; and (4) has access to, prepares, or types materials related of labor-management relations, such as bargaining proposals and grievance responses, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., FDA, Region I</span>, 6 FLRA 229, 231-37 (1981). The Authority makes its determination of unit status based on the evidence of an individual's actual duties at the time of the hearing, not on possible future assignments or duties that had been performed by the individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Yuma Project Office</span>, 37 FLRA at 245.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the criteria and factors listed above, the RD found no evidence establishing that Blair served in a confidential capacity to any manager for whom she works or that any of those individuals are involved in labor-management relations. The Agency's claim that the RD's decision as to Blair is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Yuma Project Office</span> is not persuasive. Unlike the secretaries in <span class="Italic">Yuma Project Office</span>, Blair does not: (1) attend meetings at which labor-management matters are discussed; (2) routinely have access to or prepare management materials concerning labor relations or employee relations issues; or (3) routinely overhear her supervisor's most sensitive employee-related or labor-related conversations. Thus, the Agency has not established that the RD's application of existing precedent is in error or that her conclusion that Blair is not a confidential employee is inconsistent with that precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NASA, Glenn Research Ctr. and IFPTE Local 28</span>, 57 FLRA 571, 573-74 (2001), excluded from a unit secretaries to managers who established labor relations policies and who made related personnel decisions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(13) of the Statute defines a "confidential employee" as an employee "who acts in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations." An employee is confidential if: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between an employee and the employee's supervisor; and (2) the supervisor is significantly involved in labor-management relations. An employee is not confidential in the absence of either of these requirements. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Office</span> <span class="Italic">of the Solicitor, Arlington Field Office, </span>37 FLRA 1371, 1376-77, 1383 (1990) <span class="Italic">(DOL Solicitor).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employees who, in the normal performance of their duties, may obtain advance information of management's position with regard to contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor relations matters, are considered confidential within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1383. The frequency and the amount of an employee's working time devoted to labor relations matters may be relevant factors in determining confidential status, but are not controlling factors for &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) purposes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1382.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the RD erred in finding that there was no showing that Holton and Sammon attended meetings where sensitive and advance information on management's position on contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances and other labor relations matters were discussed or disclosed. Based on our review of the record, and as explained below, we find that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error on this substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_35"></span>First, the record establishes that Holton and Sammon attend meetings of the APMC....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we find that the record demonstrates that sensitive labor-management issues are discussed at APMC meetings. Dr. Russo testified that the Agency's "Maxiflex" policy, telecommuting policy and external hiring policy are among the labor relations matters that have been discussed at APMC meetings. Dr. Sehra further testified that policy discussions at AMPC meetings have included subjects such as "hiring," "awards," "promotions" and "grievances."...&#8197;With respect to labor-management issues, the record reveals that "the DLT is the major decision-making body relative to those issues and policies."...&#8197;Testimony further reveals that, at the APMC meetings, attendees are "solicit[ed for] their views and input on matters that [may be taken] into negotiations" with the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also demonstrates that Holton and Sammon obtain advance information regarding sensitive labor relations matters and that discussions of such matters at the APMC meetings occur "at a stage before [they are] ripe for general disclosure." When asked what the secretaries did at the meeting, Dr. Sehra answered that "they take notes in the meeting" and also discuss "action items." Dr. Russo also testified that Holton and Sammon "participate in the preparation of management responses to such matters as grievances, proposed disciplinary actions, negotiations, [and] personnel actions which might result in the filing of union grievances." In addition, Holton and Sammon copy and distribute sensitive materials, maintain confidential files, open their supervisors' mail and e-mail, and distribute directorate mail. When questioned on the effect of the premature disclosure of such information and discussions at the APMC meetings, Dr. Russo testified that such disclosure would "basically usurp the management responsibilities from making those decisions in an informed and organized, disciplined manner" and "would lead to inappropriate grievances based on premature disclosure of information which may change before a final decision is reached...."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority case law, employees who, in the normal performance of their duties, may obtain advance information of management's position with regard to contract negotiations, the disposition of grievances, and other labor relations matters, are considered confidential within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">DoL Solicitor, </span>37 FLRA at 1383. Based on the record evidence discussed above, we find that Holton and Sammon are confidential employees within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) and that the RD erred in reaching a contrary result.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Yuma and NFFE Local 1487</span>, 37 FLRA 239, 244 (1990) (secretary was confidential employee: she served "as a confidante to management in sensitive matters ranging from personnel problems to policy matters which cannot be prematurely disclosed to other personnel").</p>
<p class="noindent">A manager may be a confidential employee through his work with a higher-level official, as occurred when a training manager worked with the flight commander, who in turn was involved in labor-management relations, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Edwards AFB and SPORT Air Traffic Control Org.,</span> 62 FLRA 159, 163 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The issue before the RD, however, concerned what labor-relations activities, if any, the Flight Commander <span class="Italic">was</span> involved in and the Union's questions are irrelevant to that inquiry. In any event, it was not necessary for him to be involved in negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement for him to be significantly involved in labor-management relations. <span class="Italic">See United States Department of the Army, United States Army Aviation Center, Fort Rucker, Ala.</span>, 60 FLRA 771, 772 (2005) (evidence other than that as to director's involvement in negotiations supported RD's determination director significantly involved in labor relations). As such, the Union has not established that it was prejudiced by the Hearing Officer's ruling. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs</span>, 56 FLRA 169, 172 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union's claim that there is an absence of precedent with respect to the collaborative activities of the Training Manager that are addressed by the RD's decision does not establish grounds warranting review of that decision under &#x00A7; 2422.31(c)(1). In this respect, under long-standing Authority precedent, the confidential relationship that constitutes one of the requirements for finding that an employee is a confidential employee under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) of the Statute concerns the relationship between the employee in question and that employee's supervisor. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.</span>, 55 FLRA 1243, 1246 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Tex.</span>, 2 FLRA 659, 660 (1980)). The Union's argument that some of the information was collaborative with the Union, rather than confidential, does not establish that there is an absence of precedent.</p>
