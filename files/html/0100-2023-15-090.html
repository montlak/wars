<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-90"><span class="space">k.</span> Decisions Postdating <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Conyers</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> decisions, if the appellant holding a noncritical sensitive position was removed for inability to hold that position and if the appellant was provided due process, i.e., notice of the reasons and an opportunity to respond, the Board would have proceeded to an examination of the merits of the action. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. DOD</span>, 118 MSPR 149, 152-43 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2012 MSPB 66 (2012) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Ingram v. DOD</span>, 120 MSPR 420, 421, 423-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9-15, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/INGRAM_NELLIE_M_DC_0752_10_0264_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_916657.pdf">2013 MSPB 78</a> (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2581"></span>We agree, however, with the agency's assertion that it did not violate the appellant's due process rights. Due process requires an agency to provide an employee with, among other things, notice of the reasons for the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gray v. Department of Defense</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 6 (2011). The record shows that, during the eligibility proceeding, the agency both informed the appellant of the reasons it was examining whether to end her eligibility, specifically identifying her financial problems, and afforded the appellant the opportunity to respond to those reasons and to appeal its decision. The record also shows that the appellant, in fact, availed herself of these opportunities, and her replies demonstrated that she understood the charges and was able to present a meaningful response. Thus, the appellant was aware of the underlying reasons for the loss of her eligibility, even though the agency did not again provide this information in its demotion action. The administrative judge found that the agency's failure to include the documents from the eligibility proceeding in the demotion proceeding was "fatal" to the agency's case. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant received notice and opportunity to reply to the underlying reasons for the eligibility determination. Because the appellant received the required notice of the specific charges against her in the eligibility proceeding, and given that the eligibility determination formed the basis of her demotion, we find that the agency has not denied the appellant due process in effecting her demotion. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hinton v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 692, 695-96 (1994) (when an agency bases an indefinite suspension on the revocation of access to security areas or information, the agency must provide the appellant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to the reasons for the indefinite suspension by ensuring that either in the advance notice of that action or in the earlier access determination, he has been notified of the cause that led to the access determination). Adjudication of the merits of the appellant's demotion is, therefore, required.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> decisions reversed the Board's direction. <span class="Italic">Ingram v. DOD</span>, 120 MSPR 420, 421, 423-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 9-15, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/INGRAM_NELLIE_M_DC_0752_10_0264_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_916657.pdf">2013 MSPB 78</a> (2013) (on further review from remand decision in <span class="Italic">Ingram v. DOD</span>, 118 MSPR 149, 2012 MSPB 66 (2012)), the first precedential decision following the Federal Circuit's 2013 <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, affirmed a demotion of the appellant, who was determined ineligible to occupy a noncritical sensitive position (also ineligible to access classified information):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant served in the non-critical sensitive position of YC-01 Supervisory Store Associate. On June 21, 2007, the agency's Washington Headquarters Services, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (WHS CAF) informed the appellant that it had tentatively determined to deny her eligibility for access to classified information "and/or" to occupy a sensitive position. The WHS CAF provided the appellant with a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising her that the basis for the tentative denial was that information obtained from an investigation of her personal history and a credit report raised concerns about her trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. The credit report in question was attached, along with instructions on how to respond to the SOR. Upon considering the appellant's response, the WHS CAF denied her eligibility for access to classified information and/or to occupy a sensitive position. The WHS CAF provided the appellant with instructions on how to appeal the denial of her eligibility. After the appellant filed an appeal of her denial of eligibility with the WHS Clearance Appeal Board (CAB), the WHS CAB issued a decision sustaining the denial.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The limited scope of review in Egan applies to this appeal.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, the Federal Circuit held that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> prohibits Board review of Department of Defense national security determinations concerning the eligibility of an individual to occupy a "sensitive" position, regardless of whether the position requires access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17278, at *30-31. In support of this holding, the court found that "there is no meaningful difference in substance between a designation that a position is 'sensitive' and a designation that a position requires 'access to classified information.' Rather, what matters is that both designations concern national security." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *30. Accordingly, under the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, the limited scope of review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies to appeals such as this one, where an adverse action is based on the decision that an employee is not eligible to occupy a non-critical sensitive position. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at *30-31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court held that the Board does not have authority to review the substance of a security clearance determination, contrary to what is required generally in other adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530-31. The Court held that, in an appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 based on the denial of a security clearance, the Board has authority to review only: (1) whether an Executive Branch employer determined the employee's position required a security clearance; (2) whether the clearance was denied or revoked; (3) whether the employee was provided with the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513; and (4) whether transfer to a non-sensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17278, at *6 (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530). The Court ruled that "[n]othing in the [statute enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513] ...direct[ed] or empower[ed] the Board to go further." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530. Our review of the appeal is therefore limited to the issues set forth by the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's action must be affirmed under Egan.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that she was never given eligibility to occupy a sensitive position and that she was not provided with the requisite training that would have enabled her to maintain her eligibility. The appellant further contends that the administrative judge failed to discuss all aspects of her original appeal. In this regard, the appellant appears to assert that the administrative judge did not allow discussion of whether her position entailed access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying the limited scope of review under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, we must affirm the agency's demotion action. The record reflects that the appellant's position as a Supervisory Store Associate required that she maintain eligibility to access non-critical sensitive information. While the appellant claims she was not provided with the requisite training on how to keep her eligibility, this argument is beyond the scope of review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 530.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, it is undisputed that the WHS CAF denied the appellant's eligibility for access to classified information and/or to occupy a sensitive position, and that the CAB sustained the denial of her eligibility. In addition, the agency complied with the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 in demoting the appellant to a vacant non-sensitive position. Specifically, the agency provided the appellant with 30 days' advance written notice of the proposed demotion, reasons for the proposed action, and a reasonable opportunity to reply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) and (2). The agency further notified the appellant of her right to be represented by an attorney and provided her with a written decision letter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(3) and (4). Therefore, the agency complied with the minimum due process requirements set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> in removing the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Department of Justice</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6; 23 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's assertion that the administrative judge did not allow discussion of whether her position entailed access to classified information, the court in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> held that "[t]here is nothing talismanic about eligibility for access to classified information." <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17278, at *50-51. Rather, "[t]he core question is whether the [a]gency determination concerns eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at *51. Accordingly, because the issue of whether the appellant actually had access to classified information is not dispositive, the appellant has failed to show that any decision by the administrative judge to exclude discussion of classified information prejudiced her substantive rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, where an adverse action is based on denial or revocation of a security clearance, the action promotes the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (in an adverse employment action based on failure to maintain a security clearance required by the job description, "the absence of a properly authorized security clearance is fatal to the job entitlement"). Because the Federal Circuit has concluded that non-critical sensitive positions that implicate national security are analogous to positions requiring security clearances, <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 17278, at *50-51, we find that the agency's demotion action in this case promoted the efficiency of the service and must be affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again the Board declined to review an agency determination that an appellant was ineligible to hold a sensitive position, although the Board considered the due process of the ensuing removal process and determined it lacked mitigation authority in <span class="Italic">Flores v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 287, 290-92 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10, 2014 MSPB 46 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board lacks authority to review the merits of the decision to deny the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 526-30 (1988), the Supreme Court held that in an appeal of a removal action under chapter 75 based on the revocation of a security clearance, i.e., eligibility to access classified information, the Board may not review the merits of the underlying clearance determination. While this appeal was pending in the regional office, the Board issued decisions in <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Department of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Northover v. Department of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 451 (2010), holding that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not limit Board review of an adverse action based on the denial of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position not requiring access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 34; <span class="Italic">Northover</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 33. In accordance with the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> and <span class="Italic">Northover</span>, the administrative judge reviewed the merits of the decision by CAF to deny the appellant eligibility to occupy a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While this appeal was pending on petition for review, the Federal Circuit overruled the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> and <span class="Italic">Northover</span> and held that <span id="Page_2582"></span><span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes Board review of a determination that a Department of Defense employee is ineligible to occupy a sensitive position, regardless of whether the position requires access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1156-60 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 134 S. Ct. 1759 (Mar. 31, 2014). In light of our reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, we must conclude that the administrative judge overstepped the Board's authority in adjudicating the merits of the decision by CAF to deny the appellant eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the initial decision. Because it is undisputed that the appellant's position was noncritical sensitive and that he was denied eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, we find the agency proved its charge by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has due process rights with respect to the removal action</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established that employees do "not have a...property interest in access to classified information, and the termination of that access therefore [does] not implicate any due process concerns." <span class="Italic">Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1184-85 (quoting <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). Like a security clearance, the granting of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is a matter within the Executive's broad discretion to make determinations concerning national security. <span class="Italic">See</span> Executive Order 10,450, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.). Hence, just as it is "obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 528, it is likewise clear that an employee has no property interest in eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. Consequently, the denial of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is not itself subject to due process requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, by virtue of being an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and thus removable only for cause, the appellant did have a property interest in his continued employment. <span class="Italic">See King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 661 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Therefore, he was entitled to due process, including notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, prior to being removed. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). It is the appellant's removal, not his loss of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, that triggered due process protections. <span class="Italic">Kriner v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 526, 532 (1994); <span class="Italic">see Hairston v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 22 (2013) (employees in sensitive positions not requiring access to classified information are entitled to no fewer due process protections than employees whose positions require such access), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by</span> <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 2014 MSPB 45, &#x00B6; 18 n.7.

U.S. Information Agency</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 370, 374 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that Mr. Flores waived his reply right, and the Board opinion continued, stating of its inability to mitigate the removal, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00B6; 12:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to nexus and penalty, it is well settled that a failure to meet the requirements of a position justifies removal of an individual from the position. <span class="Italic">See Benally v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 537, 538-39, 542 (1996) (removal of an employee who did not meet a job requirement to hold a driver's license). Where an employee in a sensitive position is denied eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, the loss of eligibility is fatal to the job entitlement. <span class="Italic">See Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (loss of security clearance). Consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors would be inappropriate in this case, because in the absence of a statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment, we lack authority to review whether the lesser sanction of reassignment to a nonsensitive position would have been feasible. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">cf. Radcliffe v. Department of Transportation</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 237, 241 (1993) (removal for failure to complete training requirements). We therefore sustain the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 584, 591-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16, 2014 MSPB 74 (2014), reiterated the limitations on Board review of an appeal of an employee removed for inability to hold a critical nonsensitive position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that employees do not have a property interest in access to classified information and that the termination of that access does not implicate any due process concerns. <span class="Italic">Flores v. Department of Defense</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 9 (2014). Like a security clearance, the granting of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is a matter within the Executive's broad discretion to make determinations concerning national security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, just as it is obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance, it is likewise clear that an employee has no property interest in eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, and the denial of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is not itself subject to due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, by virtue of being an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and thus removable only for cause, the appellant did have a property interest in his continued employment. <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10. Therefore, he was entitled to due process, including notice and a meaningful opportunity to respond, prior to being removed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Gargiulo</span>, 727 F.3d at 1185 (although Mr. Gargiulo had no due process rights relating to the procedures used to determine whether to suspend or revoke his security clearance, he did have due process rights concerning his indefinite suspension). It is the appellant's removal, not his loss of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, that triggered due process protections. <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 287, &#x00B6; 10. The Board may review the due process protections afforded in the removal proceedings without second guessing the underlying eligibility determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6; 15 (the Court did not have occasion in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to decide if the Board was authorized to consider a claim that an agency denied due process in taking an adverse action based on a security clearance determination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 26-28, which involved an indefinite suspension based in part on the suspension of a security clearance, the Board held that, if there are "viable alternatives" to the indefinite suspension, due process requires that the employee be afforded an opportunity to invoke the discretion of a deciding official with authority to select such alternatives. The Board found that the right to invoke the deciding official's discretion exists only in such cases where there is doubt as to the appropriateness or necessity of the penalty and that due process does not demand that the deciding official consider alternatives that are prohibited, impracticable, or outside management's purview. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant matter, the deciding official indicated in her decision letter that "I have no authority to review, change, or influence the determination made by CAF concerning either your access to sensitive information or whether your reply was timely filed." The deciding official also noted in the decision letter that the agency had no available positions that did not require access to sensitive information. (testimony of the deciding official that she "had to remove" the appellant because all of the positions at DFAS were categorized as non-critical sensitive, and there were no positions that were not classified that way). She further noted that "I have decided to take this action because your continued assignment to a set of temporary, non-sensitive duties for an indefinite period of time does not promote the efficiency of the service." In addition, the agency's representative indicated that DFAS "has no ability to impact, negotiate or change the risk determinations made by the DOD WHS," and "DFAS is bound by the risk determinations notwithstanding DFAS' desire to keep what it might determine are excellent employees in DFAS' employ." The deciding official testified that she did not consider any penalty other than removal and did not conduct a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis because "I didn't have a choice. That was the only thing that we, that we had, only option we had." The deciding official testified that, because all DFAS positions were classified as non-critical sensitive, there were no positions to which she could have assigned the appellant. She further testified that she did not have a choice in deciding to remove the appellant, that she was told that she had to remove him, and that she would not have removed him if she had been given the choice. The deciding official testified that, although she signed the decision letter, she did not prepare it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not identified any viable alternatives to his removal in this case, and we find no such alternatives. Given the record evidence establishing that all positions within DFAS were classified as non-critical sensitive, any alternative to removal that would have retained the appellant in his Accounting Technician position, reassigned him to another position within DFAS, or indefinitely assigned him to non-sensitive duties without his being assigned to a position in the civil service was either prohibited, impracticable, or outside the purview of DFAS management. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(1) (defining "employee" as an individual appointed in the civil service); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101(1) (the "civil service" consists of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches); <span class="Italic">Bracey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 236 F.3d 1356, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("We are aware of no setting in the federal employment system in which an employee is considered to hold a 'position' consisting of a set of ungraded, unclassified duties that have been assigned to that employee on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis."); <span class="Italic">cf. McFadden v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 18, &#x00B6; 20 (1999) (an agency is not obligated to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning her to light-duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency has effected an indefinite suspension without pay pending the completion of an investigation and/or resolution of an appellant's security clearance status, the Board has suggested that placement on administrative leave "may" be a viable alternative to suspension without pay. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 28. Here, however, there was no pending adjudication of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a non-critical sensitive position. Rather, such eligibility had been denied and the appellant's removal had been proposed. Even assuming that there was a "practicable" alternative in the sense that someone in DFAS management may have had the authority to create a non-sensitive position for the appellant to occupy, <span class="Italic">see Haeuser v. Department of Law, Government of Guam</span>, 97 F.3d 1152, 1159 n.4 (9th Cir. 1996) (contrasting the terms "practicable" and "practical," with <span id="Page_2583"></span>"practicable" referring to something that can be put into effect, and "practical" referring to something that is also sensible and worthwhile), the Board does not have the authority to determine whether such an alternative would be practicable, <span class="Italic">see Skees v. Department of the Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("If the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance."); <span class="Italic">see also Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d at 1155 ("<span class="Italic">Egan</span>, at its core, explained that it is essential for the President and the DOD to have broad discretion in making determinations concerning national security."). The Board is not permitted to second-guess the agency's determination to classify positions as non-critical sensitive. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not established a due process violation in the absence of a showing that there were viable alternatives to his removal. <span class="Italic">See Buelna</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-28.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brown</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, recognized the possibility of harmful error if an agency failed to consider the response of an employee's attorney in the agency regulatory internal review process related to the denial of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, but the Board concluded that it was not demonstrated that it was likely a different result would have been reached had that error not occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, <span class="Italic">Woods v. DOD</span>, CH-0752-11-0047-I-2 (NP 7/29/2014) (Vice Chairman Wagner concurring), sustained termination of an employee determined by her employing agency to be ineligible to continue occupying a noncritical sensitive position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, where an adverse action is based on the failure to maintain a security clearance required by the job description, the action promotes the efficiency of the service because "the absence of a properly authorized security clearance is fatal to the job entitlement." <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 498 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Because the appellant's non-critical sensitive position required eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, the revocation of her eligibility to occupy a sensitive position was fatal to the job requirement. <span class="Italic">See Flores</span>, 2014 MSPB 46, &#x00B6; 12. Consideration of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors would be inappropriate in this case, because in the absence of a statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment, we lack authority to review whether the lesser sanction of reassignment to a non-sensitive position would have been feasible.[5] <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 2014 MSPB 46, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see Griffin v.

We therefore sustain the agency's action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In sustaining the penalty, the administrative judge found that "[b]ecause there were no non-sensitive positions to which the appellant could be assigned, the agency's decision to remove her comports with applicable law." However, as noted above, the Board lacks authority to review whether reassignment to a non-sensitive position was feasible in the absence of a statute or regulation requiring the agency to seek out alternative employment. <span class="Italic">See Griffin v. Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 864 F.2d 1579, 1580-81 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In any event, to the extent the administrative judge erred in considering whether there were non-sensitive positions to which the appellant could be reassigned, any such error does not provide a basis for reversal because it did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

Like a security clearance, the granting of eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is a matter within the Executive's broad discretion to make determinations concerning national security. <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 2014 MSPB 46, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">see also</span> Executive Order 10,450, 3 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 937 (1949-1953). Hence, just as it is "obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528, it is likewise clear that an employee has no property interest in eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 2014 MSPB 46, &#x00B6; 9. Consequently, the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is not itself subject to due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge, therefore, erred in finding that the agency violated the appellant's constitutional due process rights by failing to provide her with a meaningful opportunity to respond to WHS CAF's security eligibility determination. Accordingly, we must vacate the initial decision reversing the agency's action on these grounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> ID at 3, 17-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's action must be reversed because the agency committed harmful procedural error in the application of its procedures.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513 is not the only source of procedural protections for employees subject to adverse actions; agencies must also comply with the procedures set forth in their own regulations. <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense</span>, 527 F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Schnedar v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 8 (2014). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board may not sustain an adverse action decision if the employee can show "harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." The Board may review whether the agency complied with its own procedures for suspending or revoking a security clearance. <span class="Italic">See Romero</span>, 527 F.3d at 1329 (security clearance revocation); <span class="Italic">Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 8 (same); <span class="Italic">Ulep v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 4 (2014) (security clearance suspension). It follows that the Board may also review whether the agency complied with its own procedures for taking an adverse action based on a security eligibility determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DoD has promulgated regulations, codified at 32 C.F.R. part 154, subpart H, setting forth agency-wide procedures for "unfavorable administrative action[s]" relating to personnel security. The term "unfavorable administrative action" is defined to include both an unfavorable personnel security determination and an adverse action taken as a result of a personnel security determination. 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 154.3(bb), 154.55(a). With exceptions not relevant here, 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.56(b) provides that "no unfavorable administrative action shall be taken under the authority of this part" unless the individual concerned has been afforded the procedures set forth under that paragraph. These procedures include: (1) provision of a written statement of reasons for the unfavorable administrative action, signed by an adjudicatory official within the DoD component's designated Central Adjudication Facility; (2) an opportunity to respond in writing; (3) a written response to the reply, stating the final reasons therefor; and (4) an opportunity to appeal to a higher level authority designated by the component concerned. <span class="Italic">Ulep</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.41(b)(1)(ii), (2)(ii) (discussing the signature requirement); <span class="Italic">cf. Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 10 (interpreting parallel provisions of DoD regulation 5200.2-R).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, WHS CAF provided the appellant a November 29, 2010 SOR underlying its tentative determination to deny her eligibility for access to classified information and/or occupancy of a sensitive position. The appellant was granted an extension until February 7, 2010, to submit a response to the SOR. WHS CAF issued the appellant a LOD stating the final reasons for its decision to deny her eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. The LOD, however, advised the appellant that the security eligibility decision was final and not subject to further appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, therefore, violated its own regulations by imposing an adverse action based on the denial of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a sensitive position without providing the appellant an opportunity to <span id="Page_2584"></span>appeal to a higher level authority, as required under 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.56(b)(4). <span class="Italic">See Ulep</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 6 (finding that the agency violated its own regulations by imposing an adverse action without providing any of the procedures set forth under 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.56(b)); <span class="Italic">see also Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 12 (finding that the agency failed to comply with the requirements of DoD regulation 5200.2-R, chapter 8 where it imposed an adverse action prior to the appellant's receipt of the written decision by the agency's Personnel Security Appeals Board). The error was plainly harmful for, if the agency had complied with its own regulations, it would not have taken the action without first providing this procedural guaranty. <span class="Italic">See Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 12. Consequently, the removal action cannot be sustained, regardless of whether it would otherwise promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Schnedar</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 516, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
