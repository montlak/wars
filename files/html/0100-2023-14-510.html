<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-511"><span class="space">E.</span> RECREATIONAL, EXCHANGE, AND SCHOOL FACILITIES</h3>
<p class="noindent">Negotiability of proposals providing employees the right to use agency recreational, commissary and like facilities has evolved from flat <span id="page_986"></span>nonnegotiability to an analysis of the past practices of the parties, the availability of similar facilities not within agency control, and the degree that use of the facilities is connected with employees' ability or facility to work.</p>
<p class="noindent">The phrase "conditions of employment" is relatively narrowly construed by FLRA to mean proposals directly affecting "the work situation and employment relationship." That construction was relied on to deny the negotiability of a proposal that permitted sale of alcoholic beverages to employees off duty at membership associations of NAF instrumentalities. Drinking privileges at clubs involved non-work activities of employees in a nonduty status. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1363 and Army Garrison, Yongsan, Korea</span>, 12 FLRA 635, 635-36 (1983). Proposals concerning operation of a health club were not negotiable. They were not related to employment conditions, as the term is defined, i.e., they did not relate to policies, practices, or matters affecting working conditions. Although there would be benefit to morale and physical or mental well-being of employees, the test for the purposes of negotiability was whether there was a direct connection of the proposals and working conditions. It was concluded there was not. <span class="Italic">Air Force, 2750th Air Base Wing Hq., Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 16 FLRA 335 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Another set of proposals was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-134 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Sys. Ctr., Newport</span>, 38 FLRA 589, 597-98 (1990) (Proposals 3 and 4), that required continuation of a certain level of contributions from private on-base food vendors to a "Food Services Board" to subsidize sports, travel, social events, personal improvement, and discount buying for employees. FLRA determined that those matters were non-work, nonduty time activities. The proposals did not concern employment conditions under the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test, discussed <span class="Italic">post</span> and <span class="Italic">supra</span>, concerning the definition of "employment conditions." [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-155.html#sec6-156">Weight Control, Fitness</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The results were reasonably uniform. A proposal concerning the use of recreational facilities for off-duty employees and their dependents was nonnegotiable because it did not pertain to conditions of employment, i.e., personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting working conditions relating to employees in the bargaining unit. FLRA concluded that there was no connection between the off-duty use of recreational facilities and privileges and the employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, Local F-116 and Dept. of Air Force, Vandenberg AFB</span>, 7 FLRA 123, 125 (1981). Recreational use of agency property (a yacht) on weekends, nonduty time, was not negotiable. Matters concerning non-work activities of employees while in a nonduty status did not constitute statutory conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Maritime/Metal Trades Council and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 18 FLRA 326, 329-30 (1985) (Proposal 3). Access to agency recreational facilities was nonnegotiable, beyond the scope of working conditions. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-168 and Dept. of Army, Hq. 5th Infantry Div.</span>, 19 FLRA 552 (1985). Nonnegotiable was a provision to permit employees to use exchange and recreational facilities, retail food outlets, the exchange system, and hospital facilities on a paid basis. It did not affect unit employees' working conditions. <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n and Antilles Consol. Sch. Sys.</span>, 22 FLRA 235, 238 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals for employees' use of a pool and gym did not concern conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 and VAMC, New York, N.Y.</span>, 22 FLRA 710, 713-15 (1986) (Proposal 3). <span class="Italic">Local 2094</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2094 v. FLRA</span>, 833 F.2d 1037, 1044 (D.C. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In interpreting the statutory definition of "conditions of employment," the Authority has consistently determined that proposals which relate to the involvement of employees in nonwork activities while in a nonduty status, are outside the duty to bargain unless a direct relationship can be established between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...Even if some connection were to exist between the activity being considered and the unit employees' work situations or employment relationships, that connection would not establish a duty to bargain on the matter if it is merely remote and speculative....</p>

<p class="noindent">An exception developed as to facilities at military bases offered as an inducement to civilian employees to work or remain at those locations. In the context of a ULP unilateral change case, FLRA decided that because exchange privileges at a remote military installation continued for a sufficient period of time and contributed toward retention of employees, they became a condition of employment, a necessary part of the resources available to maintain a reasonable lifestyle. Those exchange privileges could not be unilaterally terminated by the agency. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Eielson AFB and AFGE Local 1836</span>, 23 FLRA 605, 609-10 (1986). Termination of commissary and exchange privileges without bargaining over the decision was again determined to be unlawful when there was a practice long in effect and when the use of those facilities was an inducement to recruitment and continued employment of civilians in an isolated area. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Greely and AFGE Local 1949</span>, 23 FLRA 858, 863-65 (1986). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2614 and Dept. of Navy, Antilles Consol. Sch. Sys.</span>, 43 FLRA 830, 833 (1991), employee necessity led FLRA to determine negotiable a proposal that post exchange privileges be available for school staff. Employees were not allowed access to the commissary, they could not purchase food in the school lunchroom, there were no other food facilities at the schools, and the employees could not drive off the base, have their luncheons, and return within the time allowed for lunch. The post exchange apparently offered food and was accessible. There was a direct connection between exchange privileges, to be used by employees during work, and their working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent">The special factors concerning negotiability of exchange facilities privileges were emphasized in <span class="Italic">DOD, Ft. Buchanan, San Juan and AFGE Local 2614</span>, 24 FLRA 971, 974-75 (1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446-48 (D.C. Cir. 1989), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> [22 FLRA 235 (1986)] we explained the two basic factors which determine whether a matter proposed for negotiations involves a condition of employment under section 7103(a)(14): (1) Whether the matter proposed to be bargained pertains to <span class="Italic">bargaining unit employees</span>; and (2) the nature and extent of the effect of the matter proposed to be bargained on <span class="Italic">working conditions</span> of those employees. In <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> we determined that the union's proposals for the creation of privileges at the agency's retail, recreational, and medical facilities did not concern conditions of employment under the second factor, because there was no showing on how the employees' access to these facilities, off the job, related to their working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Eielson</span> [23 FLRA 605 (1986)], we applied the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> factors and determined that the Exchange privileges, although analogous to the privileges at issue in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, did concern conditions of employment.... This conclusion was based on a showing that the employees at the isolated base in Alaska needed the Exchange privileges to maintain adequate living standards in connection with their employment there, because of the lack of reasonably convenient substitutes and the difficulties and dangers of travel in Alaska in winter months, and the Exchange privileges had been described as part of the living and working conditions in Alaska....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our analysis of the loss of Exchange privileges in the circumstances here yields results different from the conclusions in <span class="Italic">Eielson</span> and <span class="Italic">Ft. Greely, Alaska</span>. The employees at Ft. Buchanan lost a convenience when their Exchange privileges were terminated. However, the record does not show that the privileges were necessary to enable employees to sustain adequate living standards.... Here, the record shows that there is an abundance of private sector shopping alternatives to the Exchange near the employees' home and the base. Uncontradicted testimony suggested a belief that Exchange prices are lower; however, the record disclosed that Federal employees in San Juan receive cost of living allowances which are adjusted for benefits such as Exchange privileges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record also suggests increased traffic and parking difficulties connected with private sector shopping.&#x2003;These problems are common in large metropolitan areas in the States; we do not consider any alleviation of such problems by shopping at an Exchange to be of consequence as to raise the Exchange privileges to the level of a condition of employment. The testimony on the comparative quality of poultry and milk products shows that employees believe the Exchange's products are better. However, the record does not establish that the comparable private sector products create health problems....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also concluded that the Exchange privileges became conditions of employment by operation of past practice.&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, the Judge relied on Authority precedent which is inapposite. In our view, matters which are not conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14) do not become conditions of employment merely by the effect of a past practice....</p>
<p class="noindent">On review, the D.C. Circuit reversed FLRA in the <span class="Italic">Local 2614</span> case, <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446-48 (D.C. Cir. 1989): FLRA failed to distinguish the outcome from the results in other cases involving foreign exchange post privileges. The court considered persuasive the long past practice permitting the use of exchange facilities and the inducement to work at the activity through the promised availability of those facilities. Additionally, the court determined that the employees' beliefs that food purity was higher at the exchange facilities than on the local market directly affected the working conditions at the base. On remand FLRA held the case open to determine a question concerning whether the agency was prevented from bargaining over the cancelation of the exchange privileges by an agency regulation supported by a compelling need. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Buchanan, San Juan and AFGE Local 2614</span>, 35 FLRA 1105 (1990). In <span class="Italic">AFGE and Dept. of Army, Ft. Buchanan, San Juan</span>, 37 FLRA 914 (1990), FLRA noted that the agency withdrew its allegation of nonnegotiability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Buchanan, San Juan and AFGE Local 2614</span>, 37 FLRA 919 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Following <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Aviation Sys. Command, St. Louis and NFFE Local 405</span>, 36 FLRA 418, 422-23 (1990), concluded that a negotiable proposal required union involvement in the design of a physical fitness center. The employing agency encouraged physical fitness of its employees and <span id="page_987"></span>under some conditions granted administrative leave for employees to engage in conditioning. FLRA explained its revised position concerning exchange privileges in <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n and Antilles Consol. Sch. Sys.</span>, 46 FLRA 625, 626, 629-30 (1992), relying on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446-48 (D.C. Cir. 1989). The proposal was that unit employees have access to post exchange facilities that included main exchanges and satellite stores. Sufficient justification for their use existed to create a nexus between the proposal and employees' working conditions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case,...access to the exchange facilities has a direct effect on the work situation of bargaining unit employees.... First, it is undisputed that employees may be assigned duties during evening hours. Given such assignments, some employees...may stay on the base rather than travel lengthy distances back and forth between their homes and their work locations. In our view, the ability to obtain a variety of goods and services at the exchanges, including health-related supplies and food items, while awaiting evening school activities, directly relates to the work situation of employees. The same holds true for employees who work beyond their normal duty day. Obviously, the assignment of duties to employees beyond their normal duty day, including assignments in the evening hours, limits the amount of personal time employees have available to satisfy their shopping needs. Thus, providing access to the exchanges would accommodate the needs of employees where, as here, the Agency routinely assigns duties that extend beyond the employees' normal work day. Additionally, permitting access to the exchanges would enable employees to purchase a wider variety of food items for consumption during the duty day....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The situation presented here is distinguishable from that presented in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>. In that case, there was no showing that access to base/post privileges was in any manner related to the work situation or employment relationship of employees or was otherwise linked to their work assignments....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's multifactor analysis of proposals concerning access to exchange facilities was also explored in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1786 and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Combat Dev. Command, Marine Corps Base, Quantico</span>, 49 FLRA 534, 539-44 (1994), approving as negotiable a proposal perpetuating past practice permitting exchange facility use by unit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a matter involves a condition of employment of unit employees, we consider whether: (1) the matter pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the matter and the work situation or employment relationship of bargaining unit employees. <span class="Italic">See Antilles I</span>, 22 FLRA at 236-37. As to the first factor, there is no dispute between the parties concerning whether the proposal applies to bargaining unit employees. Consequently, in the absence of any evidence in the record to the contrary, we find that the subject matter of the proposal pertains to unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second factor--whether the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the subject matter of the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees--we conclude that the record supports the finding that there is a direct connection between access to the base exchange and the work situation of unit employees. Specifically, we note that, in <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reviewed the Authority's application of the second part of the <span class="Italic">Antilles I</span> test and stated that, under <span class="Italic">Antilles I</span>, "the Authority inquires into the extent and nature of the practice on working conditions." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d at 1445. In determining whether the matter at issue in that case was a condition of employment, the court examined whether there was a "link" or "nexus" between that matter and employees' employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1447, 1449. The court concluded that where a matter has "a direct effect on the work relationship[,]" it concerns a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1449. <span class="Italic">See also Dept. of Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York v. FLRA</span>, 949 F.2d 1169 (D.C. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether exchange privileges concern employees' conditions of employment, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">Ft. Greely</span>, 23 FLRA at 864, that the agency's long-standing practice of granting exchange privileges to unit employees, the isolation of the facility, and the use of exchange privileges as an inducement for recruiting employees and to improve morale showed a direct connection between access to the exchange and the employees' work situation. In <span class="Italic">Eielson</span>, 23 FLRA at 609-10, the Authority found a connection between exchange privileges and unit employees' conditions of employment based on the agency's long-standing past practice of granting exchange privileges to employees, the isolation of the facility, and the use of exchange privileges as an inducement for recruitment and to stabilize the workforce. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Antilles</span> <span class="Italic">Consolidated Educ. Ass'n and Antilles Consolidated</span> <span class="Italic">School System, Fort Buchanan, Puerto Rico</span>, 46 FLRA 625 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in determining whether exchange privileges are a matter related to employees' conditions of employment, the Authority considers the circumstances of each case and determines whether factors exist that establish a connection between access to a base exchange and employees' work situation. In finding a direct connection between base exchange privileges and employees' work situation, the Authority has considered the significance of such factors as an agency's past practice of affording employees exchange privileges, the use of exchange privileges as an inducement to employment, the isolation of the work facility, and the effect on employee morale. However, the Authority has not held that only these factors may be considered in determining whether exchange privileges are related to employees' work situation. Moreover, the Authority has not found that any one factor is more significant than another in establishing that a nexus exists between access to exchange privileges and unit employees' employment. A finding that there is a connection between exchange privileges and the employment relationship of unit employees also does not depend on the number of those factors present in the circumstances of a case. Rather, the Authority will find that exchange privileges are a matter related to the conditions of employment of unit employees when, on balance, an examination of all the factors present in a case establishes that a direct connection exists between access to a base exchange and the work situation or employment relationship of the unit employees involved. Finally, contrary to the Agency's argument, we agree with the court that "[i]n close cases...past practice can be determinative." <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d at 1448.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the instant case, we find, based on the record, that there is a direct connection between exchange privileges and the work situation of unit employees. Although the Agency's facility is not in an isolated location, we find that there are other factors present that show that access to the base exchange has a direct effect on the work situation of unit employees. Specifically, the record shows that the Marine Corps extended exchange shopping privileges to employees to improve morale and to improve the productivity and effective operation of the MWR activity. We note that, in defense of its practice of allowing exchange privileges for the employees covered by the proposal, the Marine Corps claimed that loss of those privileges would have a "'devastatingly deleterious effect'" not only on the morale of its employees, but on the professional character and operation of the Marine Corps' MWR program itself. The record also shows that this practice existed for 6 years. On balance, we find that the Marine Corps' 6-year practice of granting exchange privileges to unit employees, coupled with the Marine Corps' use of those privileges to enhance "morale, productivity, cohesion and operability of the newly consolidated NAFI[ ]," establish that the continued availability of exchange privileges for unit employees has a direct effect on, and a direct connection with, the work situation of those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude, based on the record, that this case is distinguishable from the situation presented in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> <span class="Italic">I</span> and <span class="Italic">Vandenberg</span>. In <span class="Italic">Antilles I</span>, there was no showing that access to exchange privileges was in any manner related to the work situation or employment relationship of employees or was otherwise linked to their work assignments. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Vandenberg</span>, there was nothing in the record to support a finding of a direct relationship between the subject matter of the proposal and the unit employees' work situation or employment relationship. In contrast, the record in this case establishes that there is a direct connection between the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees and access by those employees to the base exchange.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the subject matter of the proposal concerns a condition of employment of unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's contention that the proposal directly interferes with its right to determine its mission under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, the mission of base exchanges is to serve authorized patrons by providing articles and services necessary for their health, comfort and convenience. Nothing in the proposal prevents the base exchange from appropriately serving authorized patrons or interferes with that mission. Rather, by authorizing Base exchange privileges for unit employees, the proposal simply includes unit employees within the scope of those individuals who are considered authorized patrons of the exchange. We conclude, therefore, that the Agency has not established that the proposal directly interferes with management's right, under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, to determine its mission....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the proposal is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(2) of the Statute because it is inconsistent with DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II, an Agency regulation for which a compelling need exists under section 2424.11(a) and (c) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the merits of the Agency's argument, in order to demonstrate that a proposal is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(2) because it is barred by an agency regulation for which a compelling need exists, an agency must: "(1) identify a specific agency-wide regulation; (2) show that there is a conflict between its regulation and the proposal; and (3) <span id="page_988"></span>demonstrate that its regulation is supported by a compelling need with reference to the Authority's standards set forth in section 2424.11 of its regulations." <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Local 3097 and Dept. of Justice, Justice Management Division</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 466 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first requirement, we find that there is no dispute that DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II is an Agency-wide regulation. With respect to the second requirement, we find that because the proposal would permit employees who are not authorized exchange shopping privileges under DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II to use the Base exchange, the proposal conflicts with that regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, with respect to the third requirement, we find that the Agency has not established that a compelling need exists for DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II under section 2424.11(a) and (c) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. To establish a compelling need under section 2424.11(a) of the Authority's regulations, an agency must demonstrate that its regulation is essential, as distinguished from helpful or desirable, to the accomplishment of its mission or execution of its functions in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of an effective and efficient Government. The Agency has not met its burden of establishing that the regulation in question is "essential" to carrying out the mission of the DOD, MWR program at the Base. We find that the exclusion of MWR employees who are not employed by an exchange from the list of individuals authorized exchange privileges is not essential to the accomplishment of the mission of the DOD, MWR program in providing for the MWR of active duty military members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the regulation describes individuals who are authorized such privileges, Section 1-102b. of DOD Directive 1330.9 also provides that "Secretaries of the Military Departments may grant deviations with patron privileges." Because the regulation permits Secretaries to grant deviations from the list of authorized patrons set forth in DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that limitation of personnel authorized exchange privileges to those prescribed by the regulation is essential to the accomplishment of the mission of the MWR program. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1501 and Dept. of Air Force, Airlift Military Command, McChord Air Force Base, Washington</span>, 38 FLRA 1515, 1522-24 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Agency has not demonstrated that there is a compelling need for its regulation under section 2424.11(c) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations. Section 2424.11(c) provides that a compelling need may be found to exist for an agency regulation that implements a mandate to the agency, under law or other outside authority, which implementation is essentially nondiscretionary in nature. The Agency contends that the regulation implements Congressional mandates regarding who is eligible to use military exchanges. The Agency bases its claim of compelling need for DOD Directive 1330.9, Section II, on a Congressional report and a letter from Congressman Price.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the evidence provided by the Agency does not support its claim.&#x2003;Specifically, the Agency did not provide a copy of the report with its statement of position or otherwise provide us with information that was sufficient to allow us to identify the report. Consequently, we are unable to confirm the wording of the alleged mandate, to determine whether the alleged mandate represents the view of both the Senate and the House of Representatives, or to ascertain whether the report accompanied legislation that was passed by Congress. We find, therefore, that in these circumstances the Agency has not established that the Congressional committee report constitutes the legislative history of a public law or otherwise legally constitutes a mandate to the Agency<span class="Italic">. Compare NFFE, Local 1669 v. FLRA</span>, 745 F.2d 705 (D.C. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">affirming</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1669 and Arkansas Air Nat'l Guard</span>, 13 FLRA 176 (1983) (in affirming the Authority, the court found that a Congressional committee report constituted outside authority on the basis that it was an expression by the Appropriations Committees of both Houses and that it accompanied a bill that passed the Congress); <span class="Italic">NAGE, SEIU, Local R1-34 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Underwater Systems Center, Newport, Rhode Island</span>, 43 FLRA 1526 (1992) (where we found that Congressional committee reports constituted an outside authority where the reports accompanied a bill that passed the Congress).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the letter from Congressman Price, we note that the record shows that this letter was a personal letter expressing the Congressman's views as Chairman of the HASC concerning the use of military exchanges and that there is no indication that Congress as a whole was aware of those views<span class="Italic">. See Montana Wilderness Ass'n v. U.S. Forest Service</span>, 655 F.2d 951, 956 n.10 (9th Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 455 U.S. 989 (1982) ("In general, off-the-record views of congressmen are not attributed to Congress as a whole."). Consequently, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the letter constitutes a nondiscretionary mandate from an outside authority within the meaning of section (c) of the Authority's compelling need criteria.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The parties do not dispute that Proposals 1 and 2 would grant all unit employees access to the base commissary, the BX, and BX satellite stores.

With regard to the second factor of the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test, the Authority has consistently held that proposals related to the provision of food services at the workplace concern conditions of employment and are, therefore, within the scope of mandatory bargaining. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IFPTE, Local 35,</span> 54 FLRA 1377, 1381 (1998) (Member Wasserman concurring); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal.,</span> 46 FLRA 782, 783 (1992) (and cases cited therein) ("[M]atters pertaining to food services and related prices for bargaining unit employees are within the mandatory scope of bargaining."),<span class="Italic"> reconsideration denied,</span> 47 FLRA 454 (1993); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Admin.

Ass'n,</span> 46 FLRA 625, 629-30 (1992) (rejecting agency claim that other on-base dining options were sufficient and finding proposal negotiable because it "would enable employees to purchase a wider variety of food items for consumption during the duty day") (<span class="Italic">Antilles II</span>). With regard to the Agency's claim that, because leaving base is not required, the proposals involve only employees' "personal choice[s]" about where to eat or shop, the Authority has previously rejected a similar argument. <span class="Italic">See Local R1-144</span>, 43 FLRA at 1335 (finding proposal negotiable despite agency contention that it involved only "personal considerations").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Agency's assertion that the Authority has held that proposals concerning access to retail establishments during nonduty hours are always outside the duty to bargain, the Agency cites no decisions that support this assertion. In fact, the Agency's assertion is contrary to other Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local 1786,</span> 49 FLRA at 535, 53940 (finding proposal concerned conditions of employment and was within duty to bargain, despite agency argument that proposal was nonnegotiable because shopping at post exchange would be "conducted during off-duty hours [and was therefore] clearly unconnected with the work situation of unit employees"). The Agency cites <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> in connection with this assertion, but <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> contains no such blanket statement regarding employees' nonduty-hour activities. To the contrary, <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> states that, when a proposal concerns nonduty-hour activities, its negotiability depends on whether it satisfies the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> second factor by establishing a direct connection to employees' work situation or employment relationship. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> 22 FLRA at 237-38. <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, N.Y. v. FLRA,</span> 949 F.2d 1169, 1173 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (Court "agree[d] with the Authority" that neither circuit's "case law [nor Authority's] own precedents establish a broad rule excluding employer policies affecting off-duty conduct from the [Statute's] coverage."). The Authority found the Antilles proposals nonnegotiable because "the [u]nion...provided no evidence, whatever, and the record d[id] not otherwise establish[,] that access to the facilities in question [was] in any manner related to the work situation or employment relationship or [was] otherwise linked to the employees' assignments[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 238 (emphases added). The same cannot be said regarding the proposals in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency argues that any products purchased from the facilities would not usually be ready for consumption, Authority precedent does not support finding that only proposals involving prepared foodstuffs concern conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Local R1-144,</span> 43 FLRA at 1345-46 (finding proposal negotiable because it involved food services). To the extent that the Agency contends that the sale of non-food items at the facilities renders the proposals nonnegotiable, Authority precedent establishes that the "ability to obtain a <span class="Italic">variety of goods and services</span>..., including health-related supplies and food items, [during nonduty hours,] directly relates to the work situation of employees." <span class="Italic">Antilles II,</span> 46 FLRA at 630 (emphasis added) (finding further that, where employees work evening hours or beyond a normal duty day, agency must bargain over proposal that allows employees "to satisfy their shopping needs," which are not limited to food items).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's argument that the proposals do not involve sustaining adequate living standards, discontinuing a past practice, or using privileges as an inducement to employment, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Local 1786</span> that, when determining whether a proposal concerns condition of employment: (1) the Authority "considers the circumstances of each case[;]" (2) no "one factor is more significant than another" in establishing the <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> second-factor direct connection; and (3) finding a direct connection "does not depend on the number of [previously considered] factors present in the circumstances of a case." <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, 49 FLRA at 540. Therefore, the mere fact that the proposals may not implicate three particular factors that the Authority has relied on to find other proposals negotiable does not establish that Proposals 1 and 2 are outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, with respect to Proposal 2, the Authority has frequently held that proposals granting civilian employees access to exchange and exchange-affiliated facilities are within the duty to bargain because they concern conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SEIU, Local 556,</span> 49 FLRA 1205 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Local 556</span>); <span class="Italic">Local 1786</span>; <span class="Italic">Antilles II</span>; <span class="Italic">Local 2614; Dep't of the Army, Fort Greely, Alaska,</span> 23 FLRA 858 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Fort Greely</span>); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska,</span> 23 FLRA 605 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Eielson</span>); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1363,</span> 4 FLRA 139 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Local 1363</span>). <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 1547,</span> 64 FLRA at 638 (finding negotiable proposals involving military base club memberships, where clubs operated dining facilities and offered discounted prices to members, and finding negotiable a proposal concerning civilian employees' use of military base "chow hall").</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> Shoppette proposal returned to the bargaining table and ended up with the Impasses Panel and assignment to a mediator-arbitrator who directed the parties to include in their contract the provision that: "Bargaining[-]unit employees with a valid DOD [identification] card shall be granted full access to the Luke Air Force Base Exchange Shoppette, including the gas station. Employees may not purchase uniform items, "[t]ax free" tobacco items[,] and "[t]ax-free" alcoholic beverages." Upon agency-head review, the provision was set aside as contrary to law and returned to FLRA in a second-round negotiability appeal in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1547 and Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB</span>, 67 FLRA 523, 525-30 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (recon. den., 68 FLRA 557 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), (vacated, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB v. FLRA</span>, 844 F.3d 957 (D.C. Cir. 2016)), <span class="Italic">post</span>). FLRA set aside the agency head determination, deciding that statutes establishing exchange facilities for the Defense Department did not preclude the agency from extending access to those facilities to civilian employees, leaving the provision intact and not inconsistent with statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that it is the Authority's responsibility to apply the law to the issues and facts that are a part of the case record properly before it.[27] And in discharging this responsibility, we honor the section of the Statute requiring that its provisions be interpreted in a manner consistent with an effective and efficient government.[28] Where other statutory and regulatory provisions apply, we are guided, as adjudicators, by the fundamental principle that the terms and intent of those statutory and regulatory provisions control.[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Local 1547</span>, the Authority concluded that the Union's proposals--broader than the provision now before us--concerned conditions of employment. The Authority cited longstanding precedent that, in widely varying circumstances, providing unit employees access to food services at the workplace,[30] as well as civilian employees access to military exchange and exchange-related facilities,[31] including access during non-duty hours,[32] concerns employees' conditions of employment. The Authority cited judicial precedent to the same effect.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">While the Agency continues to press the point, it raises nothing new. And the Agency neither requested reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Local 1547</span> nor requested judicial review of that decision.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the provision is contrary to various sections of Title 10 of the U.S. Code because: (1) those sections give the Secretary of Defense "sole and exclusive discretion" to determine who has access to exchanges; and (2) the provision is inconsistent with the cited sections of Title 10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">And the Agency contends that its interpretations of Title 10 are "entitled to deference." While the Agency does not specify what level of deference the Authority should give those interpretations, we find that deference is warranted to the extent that the interpretations have the "power to persuade."[36] In this regard, agency interpretations that are promulgated solely in the course of litigation receive the level of deference set forth in <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift</span> (<span class="Italic">Skidmore</span>),[37] under which the deference due an agency's statutory interpretation "will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control."[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency neither cites any judicial or Authority precedent regarding sole and exclusive discretion, nor explains how the cited sections of Title 10 are similar to statutes that have been found to provide such discretion. And there is nothing in the plain wording of these sections comparable to the wording, noted above, found to provide sole and exclusive discretion. Instead, these sections, individually and as a whole, provide the Secretary with power to operate an exchange system, in concert with laudable statutory goals. Further, the only legislative history the Agency cites is a House of Representatives subcommittee report (the subcommittee report) that, according to the Agency, provides that the exchange system was intended to "improve [military-service members'] purchasing power" and to be "maintained for the morale and vital benefit" of those members. We have no doubt that the exchange system is intended for these purposes and agree that they are important. But nothing in this report addresses whether such benefits may be extended to others. And it certainly does not address the situation here, involving only an incremental extension (from a part of the Shoppette to the whole).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Agency's reliance on &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2), that section states, as relevant here, that: (1) the Secretary of Defense may authorize the sale of certain merchandise in commissaries; and (2) "the Department of Defense military resale system shall continue to maintain the exclusive right to operate convenience stores, shopettes, and troop stores, including such stores established to support contingency operations." But the <span class="Italic">commissary</span> system addressed by &#x00A7; 2484 is "separate" from the <span class="Italic">exchange</span> system at issue here. Thus, it is unclear how &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2) is relevant. Further, the plain wording of &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2) does not suggest that it is intended to provide sole and exclusive discretion. To the contrary, this section is about the sale of specific merchandise, not access to facilities selling it. And the Agency has cited no legislative history supporting its claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the deference we provide the Agency's interpretations of these statutory sections under <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> "depend[s] upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, [and] its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements."[74] The foregoing demonstrates that the Agency's interpretations do not satisfy these requirements. As such, we do not defer to the Agency's interpretations and conclude that the Secretary does not have sole and exclusive discretion to determine access to the Shoppette under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 113, 2481(a)-(b), or 2484(c)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[74]&#x2003;323 U.S. at 140.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency has discretion to take an action, and that discretion is not sole and exclusive, then the Statute requires the agency to bargain over that action, unless bargaining is otherwise unlawful.[75] The Agency disagrees, relying on <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Military Sealift Command v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">Military Sealift Command</span>).[76] There, the court held that "Congress did not intend to subject the Navy's pay practices" to collective bargaining but found it unnecessary to decide whether the test urged by the Authority--that matters subject to an agency's discretion are within the duty to bargain subject to such exceptions as sole and exclusive discretion--could have "utility in defining the scope of bargaining over agency discretion outside the area of pay and pay practices."[77] Thus, <span class="Italic">Military Sealift Command</span> does not undermine our reliance on "discretion" precedent, both judicial and Authority.[78]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the provision is contrary to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 113, 2481(a)-(b), and 2484(c)(2). According to the Agency, those statutory sections set forth categories of individuals who are authorized to use exchanges, and "[t]o impose [a] requirement to extend [e]xchange privileges to" individuals who are not listed would be contrary to law. Citing the subcommittee report, the Agency claims that the exchange system is maintained "for the morale and vital benefit of the military service personnel" and that "[a]ny expansion of patron privileges without the express authority granted by the Secretary [of Defense] is contrary to law."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The wording of the cited provisions is set forth above.&#x2003;They define various terms, including "department" [86] as used with respect to the Department of Defense, and provide that the Secretary has authority to operate commissary and exchange systems. They also provide that the systems "are intended to enhance the quality of life of members of the uniformed services, retired members, and dependents of such members, and to support military readiness, recruitment, and retention."[87] As for 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2) (and as discussed previously), that provision addresses the commissary system, not the separate exchange system, and is of questionable, if any, relevance.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[87]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">None of these provisions addresses civilian access to exchanges.&#x2003;And the Agency does not provide any reasoning, or cite any precedent, to support its contrary interpretations. We have no doubt either that exchanges are intended to benefit the military community or that those benefits support readiness, recruitment, and retention. But this does not resolve the issue of whether extending those benefits to unit employees is contrary to law. And nothing in the wording of the provisions suggests that the incremental extension of benefits encompassed by the provision (as stated by the arbitrator, from "hot dogs" to "aspirin, batteries, [and] tissues"[88]) is unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[88]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span>, 11 FSIP 111 at 7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, under the DOD Instruction, the Agency has already extended some benefits to civilians, including unit employees. In fact, the DOD Instruction permits numerous non-military persons access to exchange facilities. As noted by the arbitrator, civilian employees of the exchanges themselves have unlimited access to the exchanges (with the exception of uniform items and tobacco). So do civilian employees working for the Red Cross. And "contract surgeons" have "unlimited exchange privileges" during the periods of their contracts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Agency's position on this matter has been far from consistent. The Agency did not claim in <span class="Italic">Local 1547</span> that the proposals were "contrary to the provisions of Title 10; the Agency merely assert[ed] that nothing in Title 10 grants unit employees the privileges that the <span id="page_992"></span>proposal[ ] request[ed]." The Agency also did not make such a claim before the arbitrator; in fact, as set forth above, it argued that the <span class="Italic">Secretary of the Air Force</span> had discretion to grant such access. And the Authority previously has rejected similar arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, the Agency has not demonstrated that its interpretations have the "power to persuade" within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span>. Accordingly, we conclude that the Agency has not demonstrated that the provision is inconsistent with 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101, 113, 2481(a)-(b), or 2484(c)(2). And as the Agency has not demonstrated that the provision is contrary to law on any other basis, we order the Agency to rescind its disapproval of the provision....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, we restate that we do not see our role as rendering policy pronouncements. If appropriate at all in a quasi-adjudicatory, administrative agency such as the Authority, it is a luxury accorded only to one writing a separate opinion, which, of course, is not subject to judicial review. Instead, we are guided, as we must be, by the law, including the decades of precedent and scores of decisions that support our conclusion here.</p>
<p class="noindent">The underlying and related shoppette decisions were set aside, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB v. FLRA</span>, 844 F.3d 957, 958-65 (D.C. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Labor Relations Authority ordered the Air Force to bargain collectively with its civilian employees over access to an on-base shoppette--a gas station and convenience store that forms part of the military's network of commissaries and exchanges. The Air Force challenges that decision, arguing, among other things, that the issue is not a proper subject of bargaining because Congress has given the military unfettered discretion to determine whether civilians may patronize commissaries and exchanges. For the reasons set forth below, we agree and grant the Air Force's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, enacted in 1978 as Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act, governs collective bargaining in the federal workplace. The statute grants federal employees the right to collectively bargain over "conditions of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). Under Authority and D.C. Circuit precedent, however, employees have no right to bargain over matters that Congress has committed to an agency's "unfettered discretion." <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396, 1401 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">see Patent Office Professional Association &#x0026; U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, 59 F.L.R.A. 331, 346 (Sept. 30, 2003) (holding that the Authority may not order an agency to bargain over matters within the agency's "sole and exclusive discretion" (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dispute here began when some 800 civilian employees of Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, represented by their exclusive bargaining agent, Local 1547 of the American Federation of Government Employees, sought access to the Base's commissaries and exchanges--stores run by the Defense Department that sell reduced-price food and merchandise to members of the uniformed services, National Guardsmen and reservists, and certain retirees, dependents, and survivors. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2481(a), 1061-1064. Commissaries are similar to grocery stores. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(a). Exchanges take a variety of forms, from department-store-like retail outlets to laundromats, gas stations, flower shops, and fast-food franchises. <span class="Italic">See</span> Department of Defense Instruction 1330.21, Enclosure 3.1.1 (July 14, 2005). If accepted, Local 1547's proposal would have significantly expanded shopping privileges for civilian employees, who, under existing rules, were allowed to buy only food and beverages from "any exchange food activity, if consumed on post."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Air Force filed with the FLRA what is known as a negotiability appeal, in which it argued that the proposal was nonnegotiable because it lacked a connection to employee working conditions. The FLRA disagreed and ordered the Air Force to negotiate with the union. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547 &#x0026; U.S. Department of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span> ("<span class="Italic">Local 1547 I</span>"), 64 F.L.R.A. 642, 646-47 (Apr. 7, 2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties resumed discussions but soon reached impasse.&#x2003;The union brought the matter to the Federal Service Impasses Panel, which ordered the parties to participate in mediation-arbitration before an arbitrator, who the Panel empowered to issue a binding decision if the parties were unable to reach a settlement. Before mediation began, however, the union circulated a revised proposal seeking shopping privileges only at the Base's Shoppette, a 24-hour gas station and convenience store that sells such things as fresh and frozen food, gas, and certain health and household items. After mediation over this more limited proposal failed, the arbitrator sided with the union and ordered the Air Force to give its civilian employees access to the Shoppette.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Air Force refused to implement the arbitrator's decision, the union filed a second negotiability appeal with the FLRA. Although the Air Force again insisted that the proposal had nothing to do with employee working conditions, it added a second argument: that the proposal was not a proper subject of bargaining because Title 10 of the U.S. Code, which governs all military operations, gives the Secretary of Defense "unfettered discretion" over commissaries and exchanges. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1401. Unpersuaded, the FLRA ordered the Air Force to implement the proposal. <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547 &#x0026; U.S. Department of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona</span> ("<span class="Italic">Local 1547 II</span>"), 67 F.L.R.A. 523, 525-30 (July 29, 2014). One member dissented, reasoning that Title 10, when "read in its entirety and in its historical context," leaves the question of "authoriz[ing] access to military exchanges...to the sole discretion of the Secretary of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 532-33 (Member Pizzella, Dissenting). The Air Force sought reconsideration, which the FLRA denied. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547 &#x0026; U.S. Department of the Air Force, Luke Air Force Base, Arizona,</span> 68 F.L.R.A. 557, 558-61 (May 13, 2015).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force petitions for review.&#x2003;It argues, as it did before the FLRA, that it has no duty to bargain over the Shoppette proposal because Title 10 grants the Secretary of Defense complete discretion to decide whether civilian employees may shop at commissaries and exchanges. It also argues that the Authority failed to point to any record evidence in support of its conclusion that the proposal concerns employee working conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the Air Force's first argument, and because it relies on a particular interpretation of several provisions of Title 10, we think it best to proceed by first exploring the parties' understanding of these provisions and then setting forth our own interpretation of the statute's meaning. In doing so, we owe the Authority no deference, as we "review[ ] <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the FLRA's interpretation of a statute it is not charged with administering." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 648 F.3d 841, 846 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force anchors its unfettered-discretion argument in 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2481, which provides that "[t]he Secretary of Defense shall operate, in the manner provided by this chapter and other provisions of law, a world-wide system of commissary stores and a separate world-wide system of exchange stores." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(a). Both systems may "sell, at reduced prices, food and other merchandise" to a closed set of military and military-related patrons--i.e., "members of the uniformed services on active duty, members of the uniformed services entitled to retired pay, dependents of such members, this title." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 101(a)(5) (defining "uniformed services"). Chapter 54 extends shopping privileges to members of the Guard and Reserve, along with certain retirees, dependents, and survivors. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1061-1064. Section 2481 also sets forth Congress's reasons for creating these stores, explaining that they are "intended to enhance the quality of life of members of the uniformed services, retired members, and dependents of such members, and to support military readiness, recruitment, and retention." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(b). As the Air Force points out, missing from section 2481's list of authorized patrons and beneficiaries is any mention of civilian employees of the Defense Department.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force then moves to a more specific provision of Title 10, section 2484, which prescribes in subsection (b) an exacting list of goods that may be sold in commissaries: "[m]eat, poultry, seafood, and fresh-water fish," etcetera. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(b). Subsection (c)(1) provides that the Secretary may add additional items to that list, so long as he notifies Congress, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(c)(1), and subsection (c)(2) then explains that "[n]otwithstanding [subsection (c)](1), the Department of Defense military resale system shall continue to maintain the <span class="Italic">exclusive right to operate</span> convenience stores, <span class="Italic">shopettes</span>, and troop stores...[,]" <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2484(c)(2) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force argues that the phrase "exclusive right to operate...shopettes," <span class="Italic">id</span>., means what it says: that the military has unfettered discretion to operate "shopettes" like the one at Luke AFB. And because, in its view, "common usage [of] the term 'operate' includes access determinations," Congress conferred "unfettered discretion" on the military to determine who may patronize commissaries and exchanges, thereby exempting the Air Force from bargaining over the union's proposal, <span class="Italic">see Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1402.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For its part, the Authority argues that section 2484(c)(2)'s reference to the Secretary's "exclusive right to operate...shopettes" relates not to who can patronize them, but rather only to the selection of merchandise and the setting of prices. The Authority also points out that the commissary-and-exchange provisions nowhere state that the Secretary has authority to control access "'notwithstanding' other provisions of law"--language that, according to the Authority, this court has found signals congressional intent to exempt an agency from the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See</span> Respondent's Br. 38 (quoting <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association v. FLRA</span>, 851 F.2d 1486, 1488 (D.C. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute</span>, Department of Veterans Affairs Labor Relations Improvement Act of 1991, Pub. L. No. 102-40, title II, &#x00A7; 202, 105 Stat. 187, 200, <span class="Italic">as recognized in National Federation of Federal Employees Local 589 v. FLRA</span>, 73 F.3d 390, 390-91 (D.C. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree that Congress has given the military unfettered discretion to determine whether civilians may patronize commissaries and exchanges, though for reasons that are slightly different from those offered by the Air Force. Our starting point is section 113(b) of Title 10, which gives the Secretary of Defense "the authority, direction, and control over the Department of Defense." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 113(b). Sections <span id="page_993"></span>3013, 5013, and 8013, in turn, grant the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force "the authority necessary to conduct[ ] all affairs of the[ir respective] Department[s]," including the "functions [of]...Recruiting[,]...Administering (including the morale and welfare of personnel)[,]...and Maintaining" Department personnel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b); 5013(b); 8013(b). Those sections also authorize the Branch Secretaries to "prescribe regulations to carry out [their] functions, powers, and duties under this title," subject only to "the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b), (g); 5013(b), (g); 8013(b), (g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These three enumerated duties--recruiting, administering, and maintaining--appear in almost identical form in section 2481, in which Congress explained that it "intended [commissaries and exchanges]...to <span class="Italic">support military readiness, recruitment, and retention</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2481(b) (emphasis added). The symmetry between these purposes and the functions delineated in sections 3013, 5013, and 8013 is unmistakable, and we draw from it two basic conclusions. First, Congress intended commissaries and exchanges to advance the objectives of recruiting, administering, and maintaining the armed forces. Second, Congress gave the Branch Secretaries authority to decide how best to achieve those objectives, subject only to direction by the Secretary of Defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3013(b), (g); 5013(b), (g); 8013(b), (g).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these legislative directives, we cannot imagine that Congress intended to empower a civilian agency like the Federal Labor Relations Authority to second-guess the military's judgment about non-military access to commissaries and exchanges. As the Supreme Court has made clear, "[i]n construing a statute that touches on" matters of internal military governance, like troop morale or discipline, "courts must be careful not to circumscribe the authority of military commanders to an extent never intended by Congress." <span class="Italic">Brown v. Glines</span>, 444 U.S. 348, 360 (1980) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have taken this concern seriously in the federal-labor-relations context, declining to require bargaining over proposals that could potentially undermine military judgment even where the relevant statute never expressly shields the military from bargaining. In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1623 v. FLRA</span>, 852 F.2d 1349 (D.C. Cir. 1988), for example, we found "unbargainable" a proposal by dual-status guard technicians that would have required civilian supervisors to attempt to "convince military officials to assign personnel in some manner other than the one they originally thought best." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352. Although the proposal would not have led to civilians directly interfering with military-management choices, and although the Technician Act "d[id] not <span class="Italic">specifically</span> countermand the Local's proposal," we concluded that it fell outside the duty to bargain because it would "subject [military personnel decisions] to civilian <span class="Italic">influence</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352-53 (second emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2953 v. FLRA</span>, 730 F.2d 1534, 1544-46 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rejecting a proposal requiring military leaders to disregard National Guard technicians' military evaluations in favor of civilian evaluations when conducting layoffs, where the statute's purpose was "to assure that the <span class="Italic">military</span> mission of the Guard would be carried out effectively and efficiently").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, by requiring negotiation over the Shoppette proposal, the Authority has similarly second-guessed the Secretary's judgment in deciding how best to use a military benefit to achieve military purposes. The panel arbitrator required civilian access to the Shoppette because, in her view, "it is illogical that it is acceptable to have civilians enter a store to buy hot dogs, but damaging to [troop] morale if they are allowed to purchase aspirin, batteries, or tissues." Agreeing with the arbitrator, the Authority reasoned that nothing in Title 10 "suggests that the incremental extension of benefits...from hot dogs to aspirin, batteries, [and] tissues...is unlawful." <span class="Italic">Local 1547 II</span>, 67 F.L.R.A. at 530 (internal quotations marks omitted) (alteration in original). But the Air Force Secretary, exercising his delegated "authority...to conduct[ ] all affairs of the Department" subject only to review by the Defense Secretary, 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8013(b), decided otherwise. Contrary to both the arbitrator and the Authority, this case is not about hot dogs and aspirin, but rather whether the military retains its unfettered authority to determine if and under what circumstances non-military persons may enjoy access to commissaries and exchanges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2761 v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443 (D.C. Cir. 1989), we concluded that access to a military exchange fell within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1447. But that decision predated by fifteen years Congress's enactment of Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions which, as we have explained, vest the Secretary with sole discretion over civilian-employee access to commissaries and exchanges. <span class="Italic">See</span> Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-375, &#x00A7; 651, 118 Stat. 1811, 1964-73 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority nonetheless argues that the Shoppette proposal is negotiable because nothing in Title 10 expressly precludes civilian employees from bargaining over access to commissaries and exchanges.&#x2003;In support, it points to <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span>, in which we held that the Technician Act gives the Army Secretary unfettered discretion to determine National Guard technicians' work schedules because the statute provides that, "[n]otwithstanding [the scheduling and overtime provisions] of title 5 or any other provision of law, the Secretary concerned may...prescribe the hours of duty for technicians." 854 F.2d at 1401 (quoting 33 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(g)(2) (1988) (emphasis omitted)); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) v. FLRA</span>, 435 F.3d 1049, 1051 (2006) (holding that Comptroller of the Currency had sole and exclusive discretion over bank-examiner salaries where Congress provided that the "'employment and compensation of examiners...shall be without regard to the provisions of other laws applicable to officers or employees of the United States'" (quoting 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 481 (2006))). Since Title 10 contains no similar carve-out for commissaries and exchanges, the FLRA reasons, Congress must have intended them to be a proper subject of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's argument suffers from two flaws. First, although it is true that the Authority "consider[s] the absence of such preemptive language...to be a strong indication that Congress did not intend [an agency] to have unfettered discretion" over a given matter, <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Administration Medical Center, Veterans Canteen Service</span>, 44 F.L.R.A. 162, 164-65 (Feb. 28, 1992), neither it--nor for that matter this Court--has ever held that a statute <span class="Italic">must</span> contain phrases like "notwithstanding any law" to place a subject outside an agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, in each of the cases cited by the Authority, the agency argued that the statute it administered--a statute that expressly addressed employment matters, such as hours, pay, and benefits, for a defined category of federal employees--exempted it from Title 5's broadly applicable civil-service rules, including collective-bargaining requirements. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury</span>, 435 F.3d at 1051 (interpreting statute giving the Treasury Secretary authority to employ and compensate bank examiners); <span class="Italic">Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1403 (interpreting statute giving the Army Secretary authority to set work schedules for dual-status guard technicians); <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Association</span>, 851 F.2d at 1488 (interpreting statute giving the Secretary of Veterans Affairs authority to control hours and working conditions of medical personnel). In this case, however, the Air Force is not seeking to exempt itself from collective bargaining; it merely seeks to limit the scope of bargaining with respect to a matter that it believes Congress has committed to its unfettered discretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions differ significantly from the statutes at issue in the case cited by the Authority. Those statutes all directly addressed an agency's employment-related authority, so it makes sense that the FLRA would describe its interpretive task as "ascertain[ing] whether Congress has clearly expressed an intent to <span class="Italic">deprive employees</span> of their rights under the [FSLMRS]." <span class="Italic">See Colorado Nurses</span>, 851 F.2d at 1489 (court must determine whether Congress intended to "exempt [a federal employer] from all laws governing the terms and conditions of federal employment"). Title 10's commissary-and-exchange provisions stand on wholly different footing, as they have absolutely nothing to do with civilian employment and everything to do with creating a military benefit designed to "support military readiness, recruitment, and retention." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2481(b). Given Congress's focus on defining a military benefit, which has nothing at all to do with terms and conditions of civilian employment, it would have had no reason to include a "notwithstanding" clause exempting that benefit from "'other laws applicable to [civilian] <span class="Italic">officers or employees of the United States</span>.'" <span class="Italic">National Treasury</span>, 435 F.3d at 1051 (quoting 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 481).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all of these reasons, we hold that civilian access to commissaries and exchanges is not a proper subject of collective bargaining because Congress has vested the military with "unfettered discretion" over the matter. <span class="Italic">See Illinois National Guard</span>, 854 F.2d at 1401. Although this is sufficient to resolve this case, we think it nonetheless helpful to consider the Air Force's alternative argument--that the Authority failed to make any factual findings in support of its conclusion that the proposal concerns unit employee's conditions of employment--since that issue is likely to arise again in cases where collective bargaining is not barred by legislation giving the agency unfettered discretion over the subject of negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has itself explained, in evaluating whether a proposal concerns conditions of employment, it must, among other things, determine if "the record establishes...a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of bargaining unit employees." <span class="Italic">Antilles Consolidated Education Association &#x0026; Antilles Consolidated School System</span>, 22 F.L.R.A. 235, 237 (June 24, 1986). The Authority must also, as this Court has held, "point to evidence in the record establishing this link." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Griffis Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 949 F.2d 1169, 1174 (D.C. Cir. 1991). And as with all Authority fact-finding, our role is limited to ensuring that its "findings of fact [are] supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole." <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d 658, 665 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_994"></span>Consider a few examples.&#x2003;In one case, we upheld an Authority decision that declined to require the Department of Defense Dependents Schools to bargain over a proposal that would have extended into retirement a benefit allowing teachers to travel for free aboard military aircraft. <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association, Inc. v. FLRA</span>, 858 F.2d 769, 770, 772 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Although we recognized the clear link between free travel and working conditions for <span class="Italic">active</span> employees, who were "called upon...to situate themselves...abroad," we agreed with the Authority that nothing in the record showed that extending the free-travel benefit into "the golden years of retirement" would have had a "direct impact on an employee's day-to-day allegiance to his or her job." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 772-73. In another case, civilian employees sought to bargain over an Air Force decision requiring them to challenge disciplinary actions, not on base, as they had been permitted to do for years, but rather before a magistrate court forty-two miles away. <span class="Italic">Griffis Air Force Base</span>, 949 F.2d at 1171. Ruling for the employees, the Authority found a direct connection between the change in policy and the employee's working conditions, citing record evidence showing "that the [new] policy would cause employees to expend annual leave time to travel..., appear before the Magistrate, and prepare for trial." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1172. Given those findings, we had little difficulty deciding that the Authority's direct-connection conclusion rested "on firm ground." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1174.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief on appeal here, the Authority acknowledges that its obligation to "ascertain whether there is a direct connection...is a factual determination, dependent on the record evidence in each individual case, and reviewed for substantial evidence supporting [its] conclusion." Surprisingly, however, the Authority engaged in no such fact-finding in this case. Instead of pointing to the circumstances at Luke AFB that tie Shoppette access to employee working conditions, the Authority simply cited its earlier decision in this case for the proposition that "access to military exchange and exchange-related facilities...concerns employees' conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Local 1547 II</span>, 67 F.L.R.A. at 525.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, this would not be a problem had the earlier decision established the required factual link between Shoppette access and employee working conditions. But it did no such thing. Even though the Air Force insisted that conditions at Luke AFB did <span class="Italic">not</span> justify civilian access, the Authority made no contrary findings, instead rejecting the Air Force's arguments by simply citing its own precedent. For instance, the Air Force argued that nothing in the record supported allowing civilians to purchase groceries "not...ready for consumption." <span class="Italic">Local 1547 I</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. at 646. In response, instead of describing the circumstances that, in its judgment, made it necessary for civilian employees to purchase such groceries, the Authority simply stated that its "precedent does not support finding that only proposals involving prepared foodstuffs concern conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Air Force also argued that civilian employees had no need to shop during non-duty hours. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But rather than identifying the conditions on base that warranted off-duty access to the Shoppette, the Authority simply declared that "no decisions...support [the Air Force's] assertion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We could go on and on with more examples, but we think the point is clear: the Authority has entirely failed to establish a factual link between Shoppette access and base-employee working conditions. Although our role in reviewing negotiability determinations is limited, the Authority must find facts to give us something to review. Because it failed to do so in this case, we would grant the Air Force's petition for review on this ground were we not granting it on the antecedent ground that access to commissaries and exchanges falls outside the scope of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We grant the petition for review and vacate the Authority's order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Marking something of a departure from FLRA's traditional analysis of proposals seeking use by unit employees of recreational facilities, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 60 FLRA 533, 534 (2004), determined that the requisite nexus between use of a recreational facility and employment conditions existed through the agency's interest, expressed in its contract and public statements, concerning the fitness of employees, a generalized health concern rather than a specific concern about employees' fitness for physically demanding jobs. At issue in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12</span> was Proposal 1, that the agency would maintain the existing racquetball court and exercise facility and keep the facility open during work hours, weekends, and holidays:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees, the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n</span>, 22 FLRA 235 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>). Under this test, the Authority determines whether: (1) the proposal pertains to bargaining unit employees; and (2) the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 237.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 requires the Agency to continue to operate the exercise facility for employee use.&#x2003;As the proposal pertains to bargaining unit employees, it meets the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Antilles </span>test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second--direct connection--prong of the test, the Authority, "inquires into the extent and nature of the effect of the practice on working conditions," determining whether there is a "link" or "'nexus' between the matter and the worker's employment" that has a "'direct effect on the work relationship'" of employees. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Aviation Sys. Command, St. Louis, Mo</span>., 36 FLRA 418, 422-24 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>) (<span class="Italic">quoting</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE, 2761</span>, 866 F.2d at 1445, 1449). In "close cases," which "fall[ ] within [a] gray area" where a matter might or might not be a condition of employment under the Authority's precedent, the existence of a "past practice can be determinative." <span class="Italic">AFGE, 2761</span>, 866 F.2d at 1448.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command, </span>the Authority held that an agency was required to negotiate over a proposal concerning the establishment of a fitness center because the fitness center "directly affect[ed]" the work situation of unit employees. <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span>, 36 FLRA at 424. In finding a nexus between the proposal and the employment relationship, the Authority relied on agency regulations that "linked employee participation in physical fitness activities to more efficient work performance." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 423<span class="Italic">. </span>The agency's regulations noted that physical strength and stamina may be required for some jobs and that the agency encouraged all employees to engage in physical fitness activities. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 423;<span class="Italic"> cf.</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2077</span>, 43 FLRA 344, 355 (1991) (fitness training during duty time found to be a condition of employment where employees were subject to weight restrictions) (<span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2077</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency here also links employee's physical fitness with more efficient work performance. In this regard, the Agency publicly acknowledges that "[f]itness is an important part of staying healthy and productive at work." Dep't of Labor, Employee Wellness at <a href="http://dol.gov/oasam/doljobs/programs/wellness.html">http://dol.gov/oasam/doljobs/programs/wellness.html</a>. Moreover, this linkage between physical fitness and job performance has been ongoing. In this connection, the parties' most recent agreement demonstrates that the Agency previously linked physical fitness with the work performance and productivity. Specifically, the agreement states that "wellness and fitness programs [are] a valuable means of enhancing the well-being, and thereby, the performance and productivity of...employees." Union's Response at 3 (citing Article 9, &#x00A7; 3(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's public statements and the parties' most recent agreement are consistent with the federal government's position supporting programs that promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of its employees. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901. Also consistent with these views is the Comptroller General's precedent finding that agencies are authorized to utilize appropriated funds to pay the costs of employee memberships in private fitness facilities. <span class="Italic">See Matter of Def. Med. Sys. Support Ctr.-Health &#x0026; Fitness Program</span>, 70 Comp. Gen. 190 (1991). Based on the foregoing, we find that the same link between the use of fitness facilities and the employment relationship found to exist in <span class="Italic">Aviation Systems Command</span> exists here. Consequently, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> and <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, where no such connection was established, is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, insofar as the issue here is a "close case[ ]," the fact that the Agency has an established practice of providing the exercise facility "tips the balance" in favor of finding that the facility is a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2761</span>, 866 F.2d at 1448. In this connection, it is undisputed that the Agency has operated the exercise facility "[s]ince the mid-1970's." The Agency is correct, in general, that "[a] matter which is not a condition of employment does not become [one]...through practice or agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">Dep't of Labor, </span>38 FLRA at 908. Nevertheless, consistent with <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2761, </span>866 F.2d at 1448, the Agency's established practice further supports a conclusion that Proposal 1 concerns a condition of employment within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) of the Statute and is, therefore, within the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered Proposal 3, calling for the agency to create, equip, and maintain an exercise room at a new facility, in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1458 and DHS, Citizenship &#x0026; Immigration Serv.</span>, 63 FLRA 469, 471-72 (2009), and determined the provision to be negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Proposal 3, regarding the provision of an exercise room at the new facility infringes upon its right "to determine the requirements employees must satisfy to retain their positions." In essence, the Agency argues that because the positions within the USCIS do not have a fitness requirement, it is not necessary to provide an exercise room within the work facility. However, the question regarding this proposal is not whether an exercise room is required, the question is whether the Agency must negotiate over making an exercise room available to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not explain how the existence of an exercise room would affect its ability to determine what requirements an employee must satisfy to retain his or her position.&#x2003;When an agency fails to support its &#x00A7; 7106(a) claim with an explanation of how management's rights are affected, the Authority rejects the arguments. <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 60 FLRA 367, 380 (2004) (Authority declined consideration of an argument where agency presented "no explanation of how [the proposal] would affect its right to assign work") (Chairman Cabaniss and Member Pope dissenting on other grounds), <span class="Italic">petition for review granted, remanded in part, rev'd in part,</span> 437 F.3d 1248 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, Local 2139,</span> 57 FLRA 292, 295 n.7 (2001) (Authority summarily dismissed "bare assertion" that proposal interfered with management's right to determine its mission because the agency made no arguments in support of the claim); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.,</span> 56 FLRA 966, 971 (2000) (Authority denied claim that arbitration award violated agency's right to determine its security where no rationale or explanations were provided); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin., Wash, D.C.,</span> 55 FLRA 322, 326-27 (1999) (Authority found that management's rights to assign work and determine budget were not affected when agency made only bare assertions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Agency's failure to provide any support for its management's right argument, we find that the original Proposal 3 does not violate management's right and that consideration of the severed portion of the proposal is not required. Thus, we conclude that Proposal 3 is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 56 FLRA 265, 266-67 (2000), considered, in the context of exceptions to an arbitration award, whether an agency could be required to abide by an MOU requiring television facilities in a firehouse station and firefighters' sleeping quarters. There was no statutory impediment to use of appropriated funds for that purpose:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section [5 USC] 1301(a) provides, as relevant here, that appropriation may be "applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made...." As plainly worded, section 1301(a) requires that appropriated funds be used consistent with particular appropriations. The Agency has neither asserted nor demonstrated that there are restrictions in its particular appropriations acts on the use of funds for television services.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also has not demonstrated that expenditure of funds for cable television services in the sleeping quarters is contrary to Comptroller General precedent.&#x2003;In reviewing whether appropriated funds are used for authorized purposes under section 1301(a), the Comptroller General applies the "necessary expense" test. Under that test, an expenditure that is not specifically set forth in the appropriations act is nevertheless permissible if it is reasonably necessary in carrying out an authorized function or will contribute materially to the effective accomplishment of that function, and if it is not otherwise prohibited by law. <span class="Italic">See IRS, </span>66 Comp. Gen. 356, 359 (1987); <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>71 Comp. Gen. 527, 528 (1992). In this connection, an agency has a broad range of discretion to determine that a particular expense is necessary for an authorized purpose. <span class="Italic">See Implementation of Army Safety Program, </span>1988 WL 228374 at *2. It is well established that where an agency has discretion under applicable law and regulation over a matter affecting conditions of employment, the agency is obligated under the Statute to exercise that discretion through bargaining unless the governing law or regulation specifically requires that only the agency may exercise that discretion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, US.</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Service, </span>21 FLRA 6, 10 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service v.</span> <span class="Italic">FLRA, </span>836 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1988). There is no indication that only the Agency may exercise discretion to determine that television service in the disputed sleeping quarters is necessary. Here, the Agency exercised its discretion by entering into the memorandum of understanding to provide cable television services to the day room and the sleeping quarters<span class="Italic">. Cf. Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration Regional Office, Denver, Colorado and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">Union 1557, </span>25 FLRA 1106, 1107 (1987) (an agency may exercise, through negotiations, its discretion to determine whether travel constitutes official business for the purposes of reimbursement of travel expenses).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General decisions relied upon by the Agency concerning cable television do not establish that the Agency lacked discretion to agree, in the memorandum of understanding, to provide cable television service. These decisions establish that the costs associated with providing cable television <span class="Italic">in an employee's</span> <span class="Italic">home </span>are normally considered the personal expense of the employee and not chargeable to appropriated funds<span class="Italic">. See Cable Television Costs, </span>1991 WL 174487 at *2. However, the decisions also establish that the provision of television service, under certain circumstances, can be considered as a necessary expense. <span class="Italic">See National</span> <span class="Italic">Park Service, </span>1993 WL 496921. The decisions do not address whether the provision of cable television can be considered a necessary expense <span class="Italic">in agency-provided</span> <span class="Italic">sleeping quarters. </span>However, the Comptroller General has approved the use of appropriated funds to pay other entertainment expenses. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 51 Comp. Gen. 797, 798-99 (1972) (agency authorized to use appropriated funds to provide music in the employees' workplace in order to create a pleasantly stimulating and efficient atmosphere).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from this precedent that the Comptroller General permits entertainment to be considered a necessary expense under some circumstances.&#x2003;As such, and noting particularly that the Agency does not question its discretion to continue to provide cable television service to the day room, we conclude that the Agency has not established that it lacks discretion to comply with its contractual agreement to provide such service to the sleeping quarters also. Therefore, the award is not contrary to section 1301(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">In 2021, FLRA determined that there should be a clear nexus between a benefit sought by overseas employees and their work for the benefit to be negotiable. The question was whether the agency could discontinue (it was a ULP case) a practice of having an agency employee carry personal mail of employees from the facility post office to the employees' work stations--a convenience, and a time-saver for the employees, but not a service closely tied to performance of the employees' assigned duties. <span class="Italic">DODEA and OFT</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-3.html">72 FLRA 15</a>, 16-18 (2021) (Member DuBester dissenting), resolved the ULP duty-to-bargain complaint in management's favor:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a matter concerns bargaining-unit employees' conditions of employment, the Authority has previously applied a two-pronged test set forth in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>.[13] Under <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority has asked whether: (1) the matter pertained to bargaining-unit employees; and (2) the record established a direct connection between the matter and the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees.[14] With respect to the second prong of the test--direct connection--the Authority has "inquire[d] into the extent and nature of the effect of the practice" on employees' work situation or employment relationship, including whether there is a "link" or "'nexus' between th[e] matter and the worker's employment."[15] "In 'close cases,' which 'fall[ ] within [a] gray area' where a matter might or might not be a condition of employment under the Authority's precedent, the existence of a 'past practice can be determinative.'"[16] However, a matter that is not a condition of employment does not become one "through practice or agreement" alone.[17]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;22 FLRA at 236-37. However, the Authority has more recently undertaken a reexamination of the relationship between the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, El Paso, Tex</span>., 70 FLRA 501, 503 &#x0026; n.33 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 71 FLRA 49 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting), <span class="Italic">pet. for review granted &#x0026; decision remanded sub nom.

The <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test likewise will merit a plain-wording reformation to clearly differentiate between the terms "conditions of employment" and "working conditions." However, we need not explore that eventuality in this particular case because--for the reasons explained more fully below--even under the expansive <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> test, as the Authority has previously applied it, we find that the Respondent did not have a duty to bargain here. <span class="Italic">See also</span> note 14.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we must determine whether a requirement that the Respondent devote personnel to the retrieval and delivery of employees' personal packages to their workplaces concerns those employees' conditions of employment. Under the first prong of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the proposal pertains to bargaining-unit employees because it concerns their personal packages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second prong of <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Judge found that prong satisfied because he determined that: (1) "it is essential for employees to have access to the American mail system"; (2) the change in package delivery "could lead employees to sacrifice lunch breaks and planning periods, as well as after-school meetings and overseeing extracurricular activities, in order to pick up packages"; and (3) the direct connection to employees' work situation or employment relationship is "readily apparently from the Respondent's longstanding [delivery] practices," including the regulation of those practices through the parties' collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the Judge's first finding, unit employees do benefit from their <span id="page_995"></span>access to the American mail system. However, even before the change here, employees "would have to go to the post office to <span class="Italic">send</span> packages," which shows that access to the American mail system is not dependent on a personal, employer-sponsored delivery service to transport mail items to (or from) the employees' workplaces. Rather than access to the American mail system, what is at issue here is personalized workplace package delivery. We acknowledge the Judge's findings that several employees found it inconvenient to retrieve their packages from the post office.[22] But the inconvenience of needing to retrieve a package during work hours is not unique to the employees at issue here or their particular work situation. In fact, it seems reasonable to assume that most employees in any vocation would prefer if their employers were responsible for retrieving all of their packages and delivering them to the workplace so that the employees never had to adjust their daily routines. However, the added convenience of personalized workplace package delivery does not establish a direct connection to the work situation or employment relationship of unit employees.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find this case similar to <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>,[24] where the union proposed that the agency authorize professional employees to cash personal checks through the agency's treasury or its branch offices. The proposal aimed to expand employees' opportunities to interact with the banking system while at their workplace--an aspect of their daily lives that seems no less important than accessing the mail system. And at the time that the Authority decided the case in 1985, before ubiquitous electronic-payment systems, the ability of employees to cash their personal checks was essential for maintaining their finances.[25] But the Authority found that employees' ability to cash checks through the treasury at their workplace did not concern their conditions of employment.[26] Thus, the importance of the activity to the employees' lives outside of work was insufficient to bring personal check cashing at the workplace within the duty to bargain.[27]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;17 FLRA 890 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 891 (discussing proposal that would require that the agency "do everything it can to see that professional employees are authorized to cash personal checks" through the agency's treasury or branch offices).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 891-92. Here, as mentioned, the Judge found that teachers may need to miss their lunch breaks, planning periods, or extracurricular activities in order to pick up a package. Judge's Recommended Decision at 25. However, a similar situation would have confronted the employees in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span> who needed to cash a check during a bank's regular business hours. Occasionally, they may have had to miss a small amount of work time in order to cash their checks. But that minimal loss of work time did not change the result in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>, and we do not think it changes the result here either.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;We recognize that in <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>, the Authority found that check cashing involved "non-work activities while in <span class="Italic">non-duty status</span>." 17 FLRA at 892 (emphasis added). By comparison, the Agency here sometimes permits employees to make trips to the post office while they are in <span class="Italic">duty status</span>. However, like check cashing, retrieving packages remains the type of personal errand that many employees in other work environments perform while in non-duty status. So, we still find <span class="Italic">Maritime Metal Trades Council</span> a useful comparator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To further support his conclusion that personalized package delivery satisfied <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> prong two, the Judge relied on certain Authority decisions that we find distinguishable for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge cited a decision involving a workplace fitness facility that the Authority found concerned employees' conditions of employment.[28] However, the agency in that case had, for an extended period of time, publicly linked employee fitness to <span class="Italic">work productivity</span>.[29] Moreover, the Authority cited Congress's determination to authorize agency heads to establish health-service programs for employees as bolstering the agency's own public statements about the connection between fitness and employees' work situations.[30] In contrast, the present case does not involve a similarly direct connection between personalized workplace package delivery and work productivity, nor has the Union cited a congressional determination to encourage agencies to provide personalized package delivery.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;Judge's Recommended Decision at 26 (citing <span class="Italic">Local 12</span>, 60 FLRA at 533-34).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[29]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 12</span>, 60 FLRA at 534.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Judge compared the current dispute to cases concerning workplace daycare facilities. But the Authority found that the "existence and availability of such facilities can be <span class="Italic">determinative</span> of whether an employee will be able to accept a job with an employer and of whether an employee will be able to continue employment with an employer."[32] Here, none of the Judge's findings establishes that the end of personalized workplace package delivery would lead employees to end their employment with the Respondent. Nor can the importance of package delivery reasonably be compared to the wellbeing of employees' children while the employees are at work.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 2 FLRA 603, 606 (1980) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 32</span>, 6 FLRA 423 (1981) (relying completely on the analysis in <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> to find that daycare facilities at the workplace concerned conditions of employment), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. OPM v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1229 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (unpublished table decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge also relied on an Authority decision holding that the ability of employees to make and receive personal calls at work concerned a condition of employment.[33] However, the Authority's decisions on such telephone calls have been limited to employees' use of phones for infrequent or emergency situations, or to communicate with a union.[34] For example, in a decision applying <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, the Authority noted that employees may need to: (1) let their families know that they must work overtime; (2) schedule medical care; or (3) arrange transportation or car repairs.[35] As for these examples, working overtime is a direct result of the employment relationship, medical care is necessary for employees to remain well enough to be able to work, and transportation to and from the workplace is similarly necessary to allow employees to perform duties there. Regarding the use of phones for communication with a union, the substance of such communications would primarily involve workplace concerns, and the Statute protects the ability to engage in such communications.[36] Thus, the Authority's precedent on personal calls using agency phones found a direct connection between making such calls and employees' work situations or employment relationships for purposes of applying the second prong in <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge's prong-two analysis additionally relied on the Agency's longstanding practice of providing personalized workplace package delivery, and the regulation of that practice in the parties' collective-bargaining agreement, we would rely on those considerations only if this were a "close case[ ]" in a "gray area."[38] But because we do not find that personalized workplace package delivery is closely analogous to previous matters that the Authority has found to concern a condition of employment, that matter did not become a condition of employment "through practice or agreement."[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For all of the foregoing reasons, we find that, even under the expansive <span class="Italic">Antilles</span> precedent, the Judge erred in concluding that this dispute affected employees' conditions of employment. Consequently, we also find that he erred in concluding that the Agency violated its duty to bargain by discontinuing personalized workplace package delivery without first providing the Union notice and an opportunity to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Judge erred and the Respondent did not have a duty to bargain, there is no basis for finding a violation of the Statute. Accordingly, we set aside the Judge's recommended decision and dismiss the complaint.[40]</p>
