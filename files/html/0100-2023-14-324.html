<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-325"><span class="space">3.</span> Seniority</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable to rank excepted service employees through service credit. The former FPM preclusion of seniority credit only applied to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">ACT, Pa. State Council and Adjutant Gen., Dept. of Military Affairs, Pa.</span>, 7 FLRA 346, 353 (1981), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds as to others matters sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen., Dept. of Military Affairs, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, DOD v. FLRA</span>, 685 F.2d 93, 94 (3d Cir. 1982). Another proposal was negotiable that management select by seniority when it had determined to fill a vacancy and it had narrowed its choice to two groups of competing employees equally capable and qualified under management's criteria. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 29 FLRA 734, 791-93 (1987). As to competitive service selections among employees with differing qualifications, FLRA would not approve seniority as a mandatory selection factor.</p>
<p class="noindent">The late FPM precluded an agency from giving controlling weight in the competitive promotion process to the length of time a promotion candidate has been rated qualified for promotion. <span class="Italic">Office of Gen. Counsel, NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 6 FLRA 56, 58 (1981). A proposal was nonnegotiable that required "[i]f, in the judgment of the selecting official, two or more of the applicants are equally qualified for a position, the candidate with the greatest...service shall be selected," regardless of the source of candidates, <span class="Italic">USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv. and NTEU</span>, 35 FLRA 1154, 1155-60 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the disputed language is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(C)...and FPM Chapter 335, subchapter 1, requirement 4.... [T]he provision conflicts with management's rights...to select from among properly ranked and certified, or best-qualified, candidates and from any other appropriate source...without restriction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 2 FLRA 603 (1980)...[t]he Authority explained that a procedure for selecting an employee for assignment solely on the basis of seniority removes from the agency the discretion to determine the personnel requirements of the work of the position that is an essential part of the decision to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority found that Proposal III was distinguishable from the other proposals because the proposal applied only when the agency chose not to use competitive selection procedures.&#x2003;The Authority noted that under FPM chapter 335, subchapter 1, requirement 4, use of competitive selection procedures preserves the agency's right to select the employee for promotion or assignment from among those available from any appropriate source. Consequently, the Authority concluded that because the proposal permitted the agency to use competitive selection procedures without the restriction of the proposal's procedure for selection, the proposal preserved the agency's discretion to select a particular employee for assignment and did not conflict with management's rights...to make selections for appointments under section 7106(a)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision...in this case does not preserve the Agency's discretion to select under competitive procedures from among properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or among best-qualified candidates. The provision also does not preserve the Agency's discretion to select under competitive procedures the employee for promotion from among those available from any other appropriate source. Instead, by mandating seniority as the determining factor in the selection among equally qualified applicants even when management chooses to select under competitive selection procedures, the provision directly interferes with management's right to make the actual selection from a merit promotion certificate or to make the appointment from any other appropriate source.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association</span>...does not provide otherwise. In finding Proposal 46 negotiable, the Authority expressly noted that the proposal applied only after management had decided to fill the position with a candidate from certain specified categories.... In contrast, the provision in this case requires that seniority be used to select between equally qualified applicants, regardless of the source from which the Agency chooses to select, and does not maintain management's right to select.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Union's reliance on cases involving management's right to assign employees and to assign work is misplaced. In these cases, the Authority has found procedures governing the assignment of employees to be negotiable provided the procedures apply to employees previously judged by management to be equally qualified to perform the work.... In contrast, there can be no procedure that requires the selection of individual employees for promotion that applies to competitive selection procedures. Under competitive selection procedures, management must maintain the right and discretion to make the actual selection from the promotion certificate or to make the appointment from any appropriate source....</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1138 and Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 51 FLRA 1725, 1728-36 (1996), considered a proposal that permitted the interchangeability, for purposes of promotional opportunities, of two related positions: boiler mechanics and boiler operators. Seniority would control selection for promotions. The proposal violated management rights and it did not constitute an arrangement:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) includes the right to establish the necessary qualifications and skills for a position, and to assess whether employees under consideration for assignment to a position possess the requisite qualifications and skills....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In establishing qualifications and skills for a position under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, management may require more than the "minimum qualifications" for the position that are established by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).[6] In particular, an agency may also require employees to possess additional specific knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to do the work of the position, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 738 and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Headquarters, USA Medical Department</span> <span class="Italic">Activity, Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri</span>, 34 FLRA 809, 812 (1990),[7] and certain necessary job-related individual characteristics such as judgment and reliability.... Proposals that prevent management from establishing the knowledge, skills, and <span id="page_869"></span>abilities required by a position and determining position assignments based on management's assessment of whether employees possess those knowledge, skills, and abilities have been found to directly interfere with management's right to assign employees under 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The OPM is responsible for developing and issuing minimum qualification standards, policies and instructions, which Federal executive branch agencies are responsible for applying in individual personnel actions. <span class="Italic">U.S. Office of Personnel Management</span>, <span class="Italic">Operating Manual, Qualification Standards for</span> <span class="Italic">General Schedule Positions</span>, p. II-1 (as revised August 1994; replaces the qualification standards for civil service positions set forth in Civil Service Commission Handbook X-118) (<span class="Italic">Operating Manual</span>). The OPM also must approve qualification standards for particular positions when OPM qualification standards are not appropriate for filling an agency's positions<span class="Italic">. Operating Manual</span> at p. II-1. The Authority has not had occasion to determine whether, in the absence of OPM regulation, management's right to assign or select under section 7106(a)(2)(A) or (C), respectively, would include the right to establish the minimum qualifications of a position. However, agencies with personnel authority that is not subject to OPM may determine qualifications and skills needed by positions within that agency. <span class="Italic">E.g., Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Administration, V.A. Medical Center, Muskogee, Oklahoma</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2250</span>, 20 FLRA 441, 442 n* (1985) (the qualification standards for the position at issue were established by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs under authority of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4105).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Information provided in OPM minimum qualification standards generally is not sufficiently specific to be used directly in examining for positions or quoted in vacancy announcements. Therefore, agencies are advised by OPM to include in their vacancy announcements the general or specialized experience or education required for their positions<span class="Italic">. Operating Manual</span> at p. II-1. These specific qualification standards developed by agencies for a position are called "selective factors." The OPM defines "selective factors" as "knowledge, skills, abilities, or special qualifications that are in addition to the minimum qualifications in a qualification standard, but are determined to be essential to perform the duties and responsibilities of a particular position<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at p. II-3. Knowledge, skills, and abilities are defined by OPM as "the attributes required to perform a job and are generally demonstrated through qualifying experience, education, or training. Knowledge is a body of information applied directly to the performance of a function. Skill is an observable competence to perform a learned psychomotor act. Ability is competence to perform an observable behavior or a behavior that results in an observable product<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at p. II-2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where management has determined that certain employees are "equally qualified" for an assignment to a particular position, the Authority has held that a proposal which sets forth a method or criteria for selecting employees for the position assignment does not directly interfere with management's right to assign employees.... In this context, the term "equally qualified" refers to employees who are determined by management to be relatively equal in terms of their knowledge, skills, and abilities.... Management's right to assess whether employees are equally qualified extends beyond the determination of whether employees possess the minimum qualifications for a position and includes the right to determine whether employees are relatively equal in terms of the specific knowledge, skills, and abilities, including job-related individual characteristics, required for a position....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, a union claims that a proposal requiring selection for assignment on the basis of seniority does not directly interfere with management's right to assign employees because management has determined that the employees covered by the proposal are equally qualified for the particular assignments and the agency disputes that claim, the Authority will decide, based on the record before it, whether management has determined that employees are equally qualified for the particular assignment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the record before the Authority establishes that a proposal requiring selection for assignment of work on the basis of seniority applies to employees whom management has already determined are equally qualified, the Authority has held that the proposal does not interfere with management's right to assign.... In contrast, where the record before the Authority establishes that an agency has determined that employees are not equally qualified, a proposal requiring the use of seniority as a tie-breaker among those employees interferes with management's right to assign employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency acknowledges that there are similarities between operator and mechanic positions and that all mechanics and operators are "minimally qualified" to perform the duties of both positions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite these similarities, the record indicates a significant difference between operators and mechanics. In particular, as stated in the position description, the overall purpose of the boiler plant operator position is "to provide for the operation and maintenance of boilers and auxiliary equipment within a central heating plant and/or at other locations...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence in the record that all operators affected by the proposal either [sic] have completed the necessary on-the-job training. The Union's assertions that <span class="Italic">some</span> of these employees have been assigned the duties of both the mechanic and operator positions, and that the Agency has made overtime assignments of the work of those positions from an overtime roster of mechanics and operators, do not demonstrate that the Agency has determined that <span class="Italic">all</span> operators have received the necessary training for them to be equally qualified to other applicants for an assignment to the mechanic position. The proposal would nevertheless apply to all operators without regard to whether, based on past work assignments, they have received the training that is necessary to make them equally qualified to mechanics for an assignment to the mechanic position, or have formerly held mechanic positions and were reassigned by the Agency to operator positions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that with the required on-the-job training, all operators would be equally qualified to perform the full range of duties of the mechanic positions. The reverse is also true, however. Without such on-the-job training, all operators are not equally qualified as mechanics. Consistent therewith, the Agency has determined that only those employees with the on-the-job training to perform the full range of mechanic duties are qualified for the mechanic positions at issue and has distinguished the affected employees' qualifications, above the minimally qualified level, on the basis of such training. The fact that all operators <span class="Italic">could</span> be made equally qualified as mechanics does not mean that they <span class="Italic">are</span> equally qualified. Accordingly, we are persuaded by the record before us that, despite the similarities between mechanics and operators and the parties' pre-1987 practice and their 1987 agreement, not all of the operators who would be affected by the proposal are equally qualified to mechanics for the mechanic position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the proposal would require the Agency to place any operators with requisite seniority in mechanic positions, even if they do not have all of the qualifications required by the Agency for assignment to those positions, we conclude that the proposal would limit management's ability to assign employees with the requisite qualifications, as determined by management, to perform mechanic duties on the various shifts. Consequently, the proposal affects management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will assume, without deciding, that the proposal at issue in this case constitutes an arrangement. In determining whether the proposal excessively interferes with management's right, we note that the proposal affords significant benefits to <span class="Italic">some</span> employees by permitting them to affect the Agency's decision as to their position assignments. However, these benefits do not outweigh the heavy burden placed on management to assign employees by requiring the Agency to make assignments to the mechanic position without regard to the Agency's determinations concerning employees' qualifications to perform the duties and responsibilities of the mechanic position. The proposal's requirement that employees be assigned to operator and mechanic positions based on seniority is particularly burdensome because it permits no exception where individual operators may not be able to perform the full range of duties of the mechanic position or do not have the specific skills that are needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similar burdens on management's right to assign employees have been held to outweigh equally significant benefits because they precluded the agency from ensuring that employees are capable of performing the required work of the agency. <span class="Italic">E.g., Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 44 FLRA at 690. No basis on which to reach a contrary conclusion is present in this case. Therefore, we find that, consistent with Authority precedent, the proposal excessively interferes with management's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and, therefore, does not constitute an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute....</p>
