<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-128"><span class="space">7.</span> Marriage of at Least Nine Months; Parent of Issue by Marriage; Exceptions</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">To qualify for a survivor annuity under CSRS, the marriage must have lasted nine months or the annuity claimant must have been the mother or father of issue by the marriage. 5 USC 8341 provides for CSRS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;"widow" means the surviving wife of an employee or Member who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;was married to him for at least 9 months immediately before his death; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;is the mother of issue by that marriage;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;"widower" means the surviving husband of an employee or Member who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;was married to her for at least 9 months immediately before her death; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;is the father of issue by that marriage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The FERS counterpart is 5 USC 8441.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Exceptions to the nine-month marital duration rule were described in <span class="Italic">Dow v. OPM</span>, 66 MSPR 21, 25 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the appellant is not entitled to survivor annuity benefits because she was not married to her husband for at least nine months prior to his death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(1)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.642(a)(1). The two exceptions to this statutory requirement are (1) if the death of the deceased annuitant was accidental, or (2) if the surviving spouse of such individual had been previously married to the individual and subsequently divorced. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(i)(1), (2). Since the record does not indicate, nor has the appellant alleged, that either of these two exceptions apply to her, we find that OPM correctly denied her request for a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Pabst v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 598, 600 (1991)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant's argument regarding "death-bed marriages" is immaterial because the statute does not speak of death-bed marriages, and states only that a surviving spouse of a deceased annuitant must have been married to the annuitant for at least nine months prior to the annuitant's death. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(1)(A)...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kearney v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 179, 182 (1992) ("The appellant also argues that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, she should be considered Allan Kearney's 'widow' because she is the mother of issue of that marriage. That provision defines a widow' as 'the surviving wife of an employee' who was 'married to him for at 9 months immediately before' his death or is 'the mother of issue by that marriage.' 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a). While the appellant is the mother of issue by her marriage to Allan Kearney, she is not his 'surviving wife' because they were divorced. The appellant cited <span class="Italic">Rawcliffe-Vela v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 540 (1991), as support for her argument. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Rawcliffe-Vela</span> was denied a survivor annuity by OPM on the basis of an erroneous finding that she was divorced from the employee. The Board found on review that the evidence showed that the appellant and the employee were not divorced at the time of the employee's death and that she was the employee's widow. <span class="Italic">See Rawcliffe-Vela.</span> This is not the circumstance in the instant appeal. The appellant does not deny that she and Allan Kearney were divorced and the record contains a copy of the divorce decree.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fields v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 659, 663-64 (1998), added as to the effect of remarriage prior to the death of the annuitant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(1), defines a "widow" as the "surviving wife" of an employee who (1) was married to him for at least 9 months immediately before his death, or (2) is the mother of issue by that marriage. The Board has determined that it is insufficient for a survivor annuity applicant to merely be the mother of issue by the marriage to be within the definition of "widow" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Holder v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 348, 355 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 47 F.3d 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Kearney v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 179, 182 (1992). If Dorenda Fields remarried another man prior to Donald Fields's death, she would not meet the statutory definition of "widow" and could not establish eligibility for his accrued retirement annuity benefits and survivor annuity benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System. The marriage certificates that the appellant submitted with her petition for review supplement the record below and tend to indicate that Dorenda was not married to Donald Fields when he died.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The constitutionality of the statutory requirement of a marriage of at least nine months' duration was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Becker v. OPM</span>, 853 F.3d 1311, 1313-15 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Becker does not dispute that she does not meet the definition of a "widow" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(1). Rather, she challenges the constitutionality of the provision under the Fifth Amendment, arguing that it interferes with the exercise of her fundamental rights to marry and procreate, and that it arbitrarily discriminates against widows who do not satisfy the nine-month requirement or the child-bearing requirement. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, we note that Ms. Becker appears to concede that the challenged provision is subject to rational basis review as opposed to the strict scrutiny test. Even without this apparent concession, however, we hold that heightened scrutiny of &#x00A7; 8441(1) is inappropriate here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Weinberger v. Salfi</span>, the Supreme Court applied rational basis review to a materially identical statutory provision that determined social security insurance benefits for a widow based on, among other criteria, whether the widow had been married to her late husband for at least nine months or whether the widow was a mother of a child to her late husband. <span class="Italic">See</span> 422 U.S. 749, 753-54, 754 n.2, 767-85 (1975). In that case, a widow filed a claim for insurance benefits with the Social Security Administration, but was denied because she had not been married to her late husband for at least nine months. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 753-54. The widow challenged the constitutionality of the provision. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 753. Despite recognizing the distinctive constitutional status of choices about marriage and family life, the Court determined that rational basis review of the provision was appropriate as the case involved the receipt of public funds under a noncontractual claim. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 771, 772. In applying rational basis review, the Court explained that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he question raised is not whether a statutory provision precisely filters out those, and only those, who are in the factual position which generated the congressional concern reflected in the statute. Such a rule would ban all prophylactic provisions.... Nor is the question whether the provision filters out a substantial part of the class which caused congressional concern, or whether it filters out more members of the class than non-members. The question is whether Congress, its concern having been reasonably aroused by the possibility of an abuse which it legitimately desired to avoid, could rationally have concluded both that a particular limitation or qualification would protect against its occurrence, and that the expense and other difficulties of individual determinations justified the inherent imprecision of a prophylactic rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 777. The Court then concluded that there was a rational basis for the statutory requirements for a widow to receive social security benefits, reasoning that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The common denominator of these disjunctive requirements appears...to be the assumption of responsibilities normally associated with marriage, and...Congress has treated them as alternative indicia of the fact that the marriage was entered into for a reason other than the desire to shortly acquire benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 781.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Salfi</span> applies here, even though Ms. Becker's claim for survivor benefits has its roots in a federal employment relationship and even if these benefits could be considered protected as a vested portion of compensation for completed work--that is, her claim is arguably contractual in some sense, but not in others.[1] <span class="Italic">See Chu v. United States</span>, 773 F.2d 1226, 1229 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (well-settled law that "public employment does not[&#8197;] give rise to a contractual relationship in the conventional sense" (ellipses omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Shaw v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1254, 1260 (Ct. Cl. 1981))); <span class="Italic">see also Schism v. United States</span>, 316 F.3d 1259, 1274-75 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Ms. Becker has not supplied any persuasive reason to depart from <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>. The concern about the spending of public funds is present, and so the rationale for permitting Congress to use an imprecise set of criteria as a proxy for "the assumption of responsibilities normally associated with marriage" carries the day. 422 U.S. at 781.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that there was no change of criteria here as the definitions for a "widow" under &#x00A7; 8441(1) were in place and have not changed since Mr. Mayberry began his federal employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>, Ms. Becker acknowledged at oral argument that her constitutional challenge to &#x00A7; 8441(1) fails unless the Supreme Court displaced this precedent when it recently held that the Constitution precludes states from denying same-sex couples the right to marry in <span class="Italic">Obergefell v. Hodges</span>, __ U.S. __, 135 S. Ct. 2584, 2604-05 (2015). We see no such displacement. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Obergefell</span> changes the required approach to evaluating the kind of line-drawing for eligibility for public funds that is presented here. <span class="Italic">Obergefell</span> did not involve such a measure; it involved state bans on recognition of same-sex marriages. We cannot take <span class="Italic">Obergefell</span> as altering the applicability of <span class="Italic">Salfi</span>. Accordingly, we hold that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(1) does not violate the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Concerning the rule that a wife does not qualify as a widow unless the marriage has occurred at least nine months prior to the employee's death and the exception for accidental death, <span class="Italic">Trotter v. OPM</span>, 50 MSPR 267, 268-69 (1991) (FERS), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Norman Trotter were married on June 10, 1989. Mr. Trotter, a civilian employee with the Department of the Navy, died unexpectedly as a result of cardiac arrhythmia, on August 21, 1989. Mrs. <span id="Page_4265"></span>Trotter applied to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for the death benefit payable under FERS to a widow of a Federal employee who dies after completing at least 18 months of creditable civilian service.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(b). OPM denied her application on the basis that she as not a "widow" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8441(1), which requires that a surviving wife have been married to the employee for at least nine months before his death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her appeal to the Board's regional office, the appellant relied in part on an exception to the nine-month rule that applies where an employee's death is accidental.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(e)(1). The appellant alternatively contended that the government was equitably estopped from applying the nine-month rule because of misrepresentations made to the deceased. She adduced evidence that both Navy personnel officials and a brochure published by OPM stated that the only requirement upon which the survivor benefit depended was that the employee have completed 18 months of Federal service prior to his death. The appellant further contended that, in reliance on these representations, Mr. Trotter refrained from securing private life insurance policies naming her as a beneficiary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Mr. Trotter's death was not "accidental" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8442(e), relying on OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.303(d)(1), which states that "[a] death is accidental if it results from homicide or from bodily injuries incurred solely through violent, external, and accidental means." Relying on the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Richmond v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 862 F.2d 294 (Fed. Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">rev'd,</span> [110 S. Ct. 2465 (1990)], the administrative judge stated that equitable estoppel could be applied in certain circumstances to prevent the government from applying an express statutory requirement such as the nine-month rule at issue in this case. The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant had failed to establish that her husband had detrimentally relied on the government's misrepresentations, one of the elements necessary for creating an estoppel against the government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering legislative history, the lack of clear regulatory guidance, definitions from other statutes and interpretative decisions or authorities, and OPM interpretation, <span class="Italic">Gibson v. OPM</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/20-1651.OPINION.9-9-2020_1649543.pdf">825 Fed. Appx. 890</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP), determined that, for purposes of calculating the duration of a marriage required to last for at least nine months to qualify for survivor annuity benefits, "month" is to be calculated as a period of 30 days, disallowing an interpretation that considered a portion of a calendar month (e.g., several days in February to constitute a "month").</p>
