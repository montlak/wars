<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-42"><span class="space">1.</span> Predecision Proposal Not Mandated in Some Cases When Due Process Is Provided Following Decision</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2003 the Board weakened the constitutional due process requirements in adverse action cases by determining that a postdecision reply provided the process due when the agency failed to issue a predecision proposal; the examination shifted to harmful error measured against statutory and regulatory requirements of predecision proposals and reply periods. <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 614, 619-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-24 (2003)<span class="Italic">,</span> <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS</span>, 129 Fed. Appx. 628 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>, determined of a noticeless indefinite suspension and removal that could have been challenged by a grievance process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985), which involved the termination of a tenured government employee, the U.S. Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property "be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case."... This principle requires "some kind of hearing" prior to the discharge of an employee who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed here that the appellant, as a preference eligible who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in the U.S. Postal Service, is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii), and thus has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 162, 165 &#x00B6; 1 (2000). He was thus entitled to minimum due process regarding his indefinite suspension, <span class="Italic">see Barresi</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994), and regarding his removal, <span class="Italic">see Clark,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 162, 165 &#x00B6; 1. If the agency denied the appellant minimum due process in suspending or <span id="Page_3169"></span>removing him, those actions must be reversed due to the constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Indefinite Suspension</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency suspended the appellant based on a charge of "reasonable cause to believe that you have committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment can be imposed." As noted above, this charge was in turn based on his having been arrested and charged with attempted first degree murder. It is undisputed that the agency did not issue a proposal notice before issuing its decision notice suspending him the same day. The agency did, however, afford the appellant a post-suspension opportunity to grieve the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 542-46, 105 S. Ct. 1487, that prior notice and an opportunity to respond is required before the removal of an employee who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. The Court suggested, however, that the level of process that is due depends on "the nature of the case," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 542, 105 S. Ct. 1487, and noted that "[T]here are, of course, some situations in which a post-deprivation hearing will satisfy due process requirements," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 542 n.7, 105 S. Ct. 1487.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 932-33, 117 S. Ct. 1807, 138 L. Ed. 2d 120 (1997), the Court held that prior notice and an opportunity to respond were not constitutionally required before a police officer was suspended without pay for having been arrested and charged with a felony, and that a post-suspension opportunity to respond was sufficient to satisfy his constitutional right to minimum due process. The Court explained that "due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 930, 117 S. Ct. 1807 (citing <span class="Italic">Morrissey v. Brewer,</span> 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. ct. 2593, 33 L. Ed. 2d 484 (1972)), and distinguished <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> on the basis that the employee there faced termination, rather than a temporary suspension without pay, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 932, 117 S. Ct. 1807.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court noted in <span class="Italic">Homar</span> that, "[s]o long as the suspended employee receives a sufficiently prompt post-suspension hearing, the lost income is relatively insubstantial (compared with termination), and fringe benefits such as health and life insurance are often not affected at all...." 520 U.S. at 932, 117 S. Ct. 1807. The Court further noted that "the arrest and formal charges imposed...'by an independent body demonstrat[e] that the suspension is not arbitrary,'" <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 934, 117 S. Ct. 1807 (citing <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Mallen,</span> 486 U.S. 230, 244, 108 S. Ct. 1780, 100 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1988)), and that "the imposition of felony charges 'itself is an objective fact that will in most cases raise serious public concern'" sufficient to "assure that the...employer's decision to suspend the employee is not 'baseless or unwarranted'" <span class="Italic">id. (citing Mallen,</span> 486 U.S. at 240, 108 S. Ct. 1780).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the facts here are materially similar to those in <span class="Italic">Homar</span>. The appellant was suspended for having been arrested and charged with a felony. He was afforded a post-suspension opportunity to grieve the suspension immediately. Although the appellant did not take advantage of the grievance opportunity, he has not alleged that a grievance hearing would not have occurred within a reasonably prompt manner had he filed a grievance. We therefore find that the appellant was not denied minimum due process regarding his suspension, and REVERSE the AJ's contrary finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Removal</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant based on a charge that he was convicted of a crime. It is undisputed that the agency did not issue a proposal notice before issuing its June 14, 2002 decision removing him effective June 21, 2002. The agency did, however, afford the appellant an opportunity to file a grievance before the effective date of his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has summarily reversed removal actions for denial of minimum due process where, as here, the agency failed to issue a proposal notice before issuing its removal decision, even if the decision notice was issued well before the effective date of the action, and without examining any right to initiate a grievance before the effective date. <span class="Italic">Redus v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 193 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 17 (where the agency did not issue a proposal notice before issuing its May 5, 1998 decision notice removing the appellant effective June 12, 1998, the Board reversed the removal for denial of minimum due process), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 25 Fed. Appx. 904 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 519 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7 (2000) (similar holding); <span class="Italic">Daniel v. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 459, 460-62 (1995) (similar holding). In fact, the AJ here relied on <span class="Italic">Daniel</span> to find that the appellant was denied minimum due process (regarding both the suspension and the removal). For the reasons discussed below, however, we find that such Board decisions go beyond what <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> requires, and must be modified consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Supreme Court observed in <span class="Italic">Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 929, 117 S. Ct. 1807, it previously "concluded [in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>] that a public employee dismissable only for cause was entitled to a very limited hearing prior to his termination, to be followed by a more comprehensive post-termination hearing." "[T]he pretermination hearing 'should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action."' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 545-46, 105 S. Ct. 1487). The "pretermination process need only include oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to tell his side of the story." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 546. 105 S. Ct. 1487).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency removed the appellant based on his undisputed conviction for a serious crime. In doing so, the agency conducted an Investigative Interview to discuss the criminal conviction, before issuing its decision notice removing him effective seven days later. The decision notice informed the appellant of the agency's charge and provided an explanation of the agency's evidence. The decision notice also provided the appellant an opportunity to tell his side of the story, by filing a grievance, before the effective date of his removal. In addition, the appellant had a right, which he exercised, to file a Board appeal after the effective date of his removal. We find, under these circumstances, that such pre- and post-removal procedures are all that <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> requires in terms of minimum due process. <span class="Italic">Cf. Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 934, 117 S. Ct. 1807 (the arrest and formal charges imposed by an independent body provides adequate assurance that the suspension is not unjustified and also raises serious public concern so as to warrant the suspension). We therefore find that the appellant was not denied minimum due process regarding his removal, and REVERSE the AJ's contrary finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Harmful Error</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), "[a]n employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--(1)...advance written notice...stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;...and (4) a written decision and the specific reasons therefor...." Thus, section 7513(b) mandates both a proposal notice and a decision notice. The agency has conceded, and we find, that it committed procedural errors regarding the suspension and the removal, by failing to issue proposal notices as required by section 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversal of an action for harmful error is warranted where the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681 (1991). Harmful error cannot be presumed, and the burden of showing harmful error lies with the appellant<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 685; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)]. In order to show harmful error, an appellant must prove that any procedural error was likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown harmful error. It appears from the record, however, that the AJ did not hold a hearing, which the appellant requested, in light of her planned ruling that both the suspension and the removal must be reversed for denial of minimum due process. Indeed, the agency stated below, in arguing that the appellant was not denied minimum due process, that the appellant instead should be afforded his requested hearing to establish harmful error. Under these circumstances, and in light of our reversal of the AJ's finding that the appellant was denied minimum due process regarding the suspension and the removal, we must remand this appeal to afford the appellant an opportunity, including an opportunity for a hearing, to establish that the agency committed harmful error warranting reversal of the suspension and removal actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rawls</span> was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">Rawls v. USPS</span>, 129 Fed. Appx. 628, 630-31 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Rawls argues that he was not afforded Due Process as required by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution. Specifically, Mr. Rawls argues that he was not afforded a pre-termination opportunity to respond. Mr. Rawls maintains that the Investigative Interview was an inadequate process because he did not know that termination was a possible disciplinary action at the time. He further argues that the grievance procedure was also an inadequate process because it did not offer a pre-decisional opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Due process with respect to government employees was described by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Loudermill, supra</span>, which set the minimum criteria of notice and an opportunity to respond:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement. The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">470 U.S. at 546 (citations omitted). Due process also requires "an opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'" <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976) (quoting <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. Manzo</span>, 380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965)). Termination requires a pre-disciplinary <span id="Page_3170"></span>hearing, in contrast to suspension, which in appropriate circumstances may be effected with only a post-disciplinary hearing. <span class="Italic">Homar</span>, 520 U.S. at 935. The purpose of the pre-termination hearing is to provide "an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 545-46).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the Investigative Interview in this case satisfies the <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> test because Mr. Rawls knew the charges against him and that disciplinary action would be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By the time of Mr. Rawls' second Investigative Interview on June 12, 2002, the agency had already issued a suspension, his criminal conviction was recent, and he knew that he would soon be incarcerated. In the written notice of June 7, 2002, the agency stated the charges against him, namely the misconduct of July 25, 1999 and subsequent conviction of criminal charges. The Investigative Interview gave Mr. Rawls notice that the charges would be considered in determining further disciplinary action, and provided an opportunity to rebut the charges. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 545-46 ("Here, the pretermination hearing need not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge. It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action."). At the Interview, Mr. Rawls was present and had an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the circumstances in this case, where Mr. Rawls was given notice that the purpose of the second Investigative Interview was to "discuss your misconduct in July 25, 1999 and subsequent conviction," and the first Investigative Interview had already resulted in indefinite suspension of Mr. Rawls, the strictures of constitutional due process were satisfied. <span class="Italic">See Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 545 ("The foregoing considerations indicate that the pretermination 'hearing,' though necessary, need not be elaborate. We have pointed out that '[the] formality and procedural requisites for the hearing can vary, depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Boddie v. Connecticut</span>, 401 U.S. 371, 378 (1971)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Henton v. USPS</span>, 102 MSPR 572, 576-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16, 2006 MSPB 215 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 546 (1985), which involved the termination of a tenured government employee, the U.S. Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of life, liberty, or property "be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case."... This principle requires "some kind of hearing" prior to the discharge of an employee who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii), and thus has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 162, 165, &#x00B6; 1 (2000). He was thus entitled to minimum due process regarding his removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. If the agency denied the appellant minimum due process in removing him, his removal must be reversed due to the constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency removed the appellant for refusing to submit to a fitness-for-duty examination in violation of grievance settlements and an arbitrator's award. The agency's decision notice informed the appellant of the charge and provided notice of the agency's evidence. It is undisputed that the agency did not issue a proposal notice before issuing its September 21, 2004 decision removing him effective November 5, 2004. However, the appellant was well aware of the basis for the agency's removal notice since he had been engaged in essentially the same dispute with the agency since 2001. Moreover, the agency afforded the appellant an opportunity to file a grievance before the effective date of his removal. The notice also informed the appellant that he had a right, which he exercised, to file a Board appeal after the effective date of his removal. Under these circumstances, such pre- and post-removal procedures are all that <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> requires in terms of minimum due process. <span class="Italic">See Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 21 (2003). We therefore find that the appellant was not denied minimum due process regarding his removal and REVERSE the administrative judge's contrary finding. <span class="Italic">See Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 185, &#x00B6; 9 (2003); <span class="Italic">Rawls</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6; 21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), "[a]n employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--(1) ...advance written notice...stating the specific reasons for the proposed action;...and (4) a written decision and the specific reasons therefor...." Consequently, section 7513(b) mandates both a proposal notice and a decision notice. Therefore, we find that the agency committed procedural error regarding the removal by failing to issue a proposal notice as required by section 7513(b)(1).</p>

USPS</span>, 204 Fed. Appx. 891, 893 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Rawls</span> and appeared to retreat from the fair meaning of its precedent in <span class="Italic">Edwards v. USPS</span>, 112 MSPR 196, 200-02 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-15, 2009 MSPB 166 (2009), involving a noticeless suspension, not implicating criminal conduct, set aside for lack of constitutional due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a supervisory employee of the Postal Service, the appellant was subject to the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5 of the United States Code. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(I). Therefore, he had a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 1 (2000). He was thus entitled to minimum due process regarding his suspension, typically meaning notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> If the agency deprived the appellant of due process in suspending him, the suspension must be reversed due to the constitutional violation. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6.</p>

In the present case, in its suspension notice, the agency cited Employee and Labor Relations Manual &#x00A7; 651.4, which allows it to place an employee on immediate suspension for various reasons, but it did not specify the reason for the appellant's suspension. Further, it gave the appellant written notice of his suspension and an opportunity to file an internal appeal only after he had been placed in a non-duty, non-pay status. Although the absence of any pre-suspension process is not a <span class="Italic">per se</span> constitutional violation, <span class="Italic">see Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 930 (citing <span class="Italic">Parratt v. Taylor,</span> 451 U.S. 527 (1981), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Daniels v. Williams,</span> 474 U.S. 327 (1986)), the situations in which such a procedure is constitutionally permissible are rare. "An important government interest, accompanied by a substantial assurance that the deprivation [of property] is not baseless or unwarranted, may in limited cases demanding prompt action justify postponing the opportunity to be heard until after the initial deprivation." <span class="Italic">Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 930-31 (quoting <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Mallen,</span> 486 U.S. 230, 240 (1988)). Thus, a public employee may be suspended with little or no pre-suspension process where the employee has been charged with a serious crime. <span class="Italic">Homar,</span> 520 U.S. at 933-34; <span class="Italic">Rawls v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 614, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2003).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the agency did not assert that the appellant had been charged with any crime. Nor did the agency identify any other fact that would provide comparable assurance that the appellant's suspension was not baseless or unwarranted. Therefore, the agency was constitutionally required to provide the appellant with notice of the basis for the suspension and an opportunity to respond before the suspension took effect. The agency's failure to do so deprived the <span id="Page_3171"></span>appellant of minimum due process and accordingly we must REVERSE the suspension. <span class="Italic">See Clark,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6.</p>
