<p class="Body-Text">The provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act providing stay authority to the MSPB at the request of OSC are at 5 USC 1214, as amended in 2017 (allowing for stay extensions when the Board lacks a quorum but has one member):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)(A)(i) The Special Counsel may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; Any member of the Board requested by the Special Counsel to order a stay under clause (i) shall order such stay unless the member determines that, under the facts and circumstances involved, such a stay would not be appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(iii)&#x2003; Unless denied under clause (ii), any stay under this subparagraph shall be granted within 3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of the request for the stay by the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(B)(i) The Board may extend the period of any stay granted under subparagraph (A) for any period which the Board considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; If the Board lacks the number of members appointed under section 1201 required to constitute a quorum, any remaining member of the Board may, upon request by the Special Counsel, extend the period of any stay granted under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;The Board shall allow any agency which is the subject of a stay to comment to the Board on any extension of stay proposed under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(D)&#x2003;A stay may be terminated by the Board at any time, except that a stay may not be terminated by the Board--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; on its own motion or on the motion of an agency, unless notice and opportunity for oral or written comments are first provided to the Special Counsel and the individual on whose behalf the stay was ordered; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; on motion of the Special Counsel, unless notice and opportunity for oral or written comments are first provided to the individual on whose behalf the stay was ordered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(E)&#x2003;If the Board grants a stay under subparagraph (A), the head of the agency employing the employee who is the subject of the action shall give priority to a request for a transfer submitted by the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulations at 5 CFR 1201.134-.136 (2022) provide the regulatory framework for the stay procedure:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Request to stay personnel action</span>. Under 5 U.S.C. 1214(b)(1), the Special Counsel may seek to stay a personnel action if the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the action was taken or will be taken as a result of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Deciding official</span>. Any member of the Board may delegate to an administrative law judge the authority to decide a Special Counsel request for an initial stay. The Board may delegate to a member of the Board the authority to rule on any matter related to a stay that has been granted to the Special Counsel, including a motion for extension or termination of the stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Place of filing</span>. A Special Counsel stay request must be filed with the Clerk of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial filing and service</span>. The Special Counsel must file a copy of the request, together with numbered and tabbed exhibits or attachments, if any, and a certificate of service listing the respondent agency or the agency's representative. The certificate of service must show the last known address, telephone number, and facsimile number of the agency or its representative. The Special Counsel must serve a copy of the request on the agency or its representative, as shown on the certificate of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Subsequent filings and service</span>. Each party must serve on every other party or the party's representative one copy of each of its pleadings, as defined by &#x00A7; 1201.4(b). A certificate of service describing how and when service was made must accompany each pleading. Each party is responsible for notifying the Board and the other parties in writing of any change in name, address, telephone number, or facsimile number of the party or the party's representative.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The names of the parties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The agency and officials involved;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;The nature of the action to be stayed;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;The laws or regulations that were violated, or that will be violated if the stay is not issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 1201.136&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Action on stay request.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Initial stay</span>. A Special Counsel request for an initial stay of 45 days will be granted within three working days after the filing of the request, unless, under the facts and circumstances, the requested stay would not be appropriate. Unless the stay is denied within the 3-day period, it is considered granted by operation of law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Extension of stay</span>. Upon the Special Counsel's request, a stay granted under 5 U.S.C. 1214(b)(1)(A) may be extended for an appropriate period of time, but only after providing the agency with an opportunity to comment on the request. Any request for an extension of a stay under 5 U.S.C. 1214(b)(1)(B) must be received by the Board and the agency no later than 15 days before the expiration date of the stay. A brief describing the facts and any relevant legal authority that should be considered must accompany the request for extension. Any response by the agency must be received by the Board no later than 8 days before the expiration date of the stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Evidence of compliance with a stay</span>. Within five working days from the date of a stay order or an order extending a stay, the agency ordered to stay a personnel action must file evidence setting forth facts and circumstances demonstrating compliance with the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Termination of stay</span>. A stay may be terminated at any time, except that a stay may not be terminated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;On the motion of an agency, or on the deciding official's own motion, without first providing notice and opportunity for oral or written comments to the Special Counsel and the individual on whose behalf the stay was ordered; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;On the motion of the Special Counsel without first providing notice and opportunity for oral or written comments to the individual on whose behalf the stay was ordered. 5 U.S.C. 1214(b)(1)(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional information</span>. At any time, where appropriate, the Special Counsel, the agency, or both may be required to appear and present further information or explanation regarding a request for a stay, to file supplemental briefs or memoranda, or to supply factual information needed to make a decision regarding a stay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Guidance on the implementation of the regulatory authority to delegate responsibility for issuance of stays was issued by Chairman Erdreich on July 31, 1998:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations permit an individual Board member to delegate his or her authority to decide a Special Counsel request for an initial stay to an administrative law judge. A Board member who wishes to make such a delegation will do so in writing to [the Board's ALJ], with copies to the Clerk and the Director, Office of Appeals Counsel. Such a delegation may be made for all Special Counsel stay requests received during the time period in which the Board member is responsible for acting on these <span id="Page_4054"></span>requests or on a case-by-case basis, at the Board member's discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations permit the Board to delegate to an individual Board member the authority to rule on matters related to a stay that has been granted to the Special Counsel, including requests for extension or termination of a stay. The Board hereby delegates the authority to <span class="Italic">grant a request for extension of a stay</span> and to <span class="Italic">rule on other stay-related</span> <span class="Italic">matters</span> to each individual member of the Board. Special Counsel requests for extension of a stay and other stay-related matters are to be forwarded by OAC to the same member who is responsible for deciding Special Counsel requests for an initial stay during the time period involved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a Board member action under this delegated authority grants a Special Counsel request for extension of a stay, in whole or in part, no action by the other Board members is required. If the responsible Board member finds that a Special Counsel request for extension of a stay should be denied, or if the Special Counsel has already obtained an initial stay and extensions in the particular matter totaling more than 120 days, then the request for extension must be forwarded to the other Board members for voting, with a decision to be determined by majority vote.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has agreed to change the time period for which each member is responsible for acting on Special Counsel stay requests and other stay-related matters from 4 months to 3 months. The Clerk of the Board and the Director, OAC, are directed to effect this change as of April 1, 1998.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has internal procedures to adjudicate requests from OSC for initial stays and extensions of stays:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">PROCEDURES FOR PROCESSING SPECIAL COUNSEL STAY REQUESTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Scope: These procedures apply to requests for stays and requests for extensions of stays filed by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;GENERAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING FILES AND DOCUMENTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;All stay files, documents, and decisions should be identified by the use of brightly colored folders marked "OSC Stay--Urgent" (hereafter "special folders.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Decision sheets in stay cases will be yellow.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;HANDLING OF INCOMING DOCUMENTS IN OSC STAYS BY THE CLERK'S OFFICE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;When a request for an initial stay or a request for extension of a stay is received in the Clerk's Office (CB), CB will immediately deliver a copy, in a special folder, to an OAC staff member. CB will then create an official Board file using a special folder and deliver the file to OAC as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;When CB receives an additional submission from one of the parties, a CB staff member places it in a special folder and delivers it immediately to an OAC staff member to be placed in the file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;PROCESSING OF INITIAL STAY REQUESTS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Initial stays (i.e., stays requested under 5 USC 1214(b)(1)(A)) are assigned to Board members according to the following schedule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">January through April--Chairman</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">May through August--Vice Chair</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">September through December--Member</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the assigned Board member is not available to decide an initial stay, the case will be assigned to the next available Board member in the schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;OAC will prepare a decision to be signed by the Board member who is currently assigned responsibility for initial stays.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;OAC will take a proposed decision in an initial stay to a member of the assigned Board member's staff two working days after receipt of the stay request. OAC will make sure that the Chief Counsel or her or his designate is informed of the proposed decision and told how much time the Board member has to vote on the decision. (By law, if the stay is not granted or denied within three working days after its receipt at the Board, it goes into effect automatically for 45 days. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(1)(A)(iii)). If no staff member is present in the member's office, OAC will leave the decision in a prominent place in the office, and leave a note on the Chief Counsel's door and a message on the Chief Counsel's voice mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;If OAC believes a stay should be permitted to go into effect by operation of law, the "decision" sent to the Board will be a "Notice of Stay by Operation of Law," which will inform the parties of the effective date of the stay and the deadline for filing for an extension and for the agency's response. The notice might also provide that, in the event an extension is requested, the parties address certain issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;PROCESSING OF REQUESTS FOR EXTENSIONS OF STAYS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;When OAC sends a decision to the Board on a request for an extension, it will package it according to the Board's simultaneous processing procedures and place each package in a special folder.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;OAC will deliver the original of the O&#x0026;O and the transmittal memo, along with the official file, to a staff member in the Clerk's Office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;OAC will immediately distribute the packages to the Board members. OAC will also distribute copies of the transmittal memo, in the special folders, to the Chief Counsels or their designates. The packages and memos will be physically handed to a member of each Board member's staff, if one is available, with an explanation of the nature of the package and its time sensitivity, including the date the current stay expires. If no staff member is available in an office, OAC will leave the package in a prominent place and will leave a note on the Chief Counsel's door and a message in the Chief Counsel's voice mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">D.&#x2003;The OAC attorney who processed the stay will follow up with each Board member's Chief Counsel or his or her designate to be sure that the stay was received by the Board members and is being considered. The OGC attorney will take all reasonable action to ensure that deadlines will be met.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An OSC administrative internal stay policy of May 31, 2001, no longer on the OSC website, provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC POLICY STATEMENT: STAYS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;OSC Criteria for Seeking a Stay</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) will consider requesting a stay of a personnel action against an employee from an agency or from the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;OSC has reasonable grounds to believe that a personnel action that was taken or will be taken constitutes a prohibited personnel practice;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Absent a stay, the employee will be subjected to removal; a suspension for more than 14 days; a reduction in grade; a significant reduction in pay; a geographic reassignment; the non-renewal of an appointment; or any other personnel action which the complainant demonstrates, by compelling evidence, will result in a serious, immediate hardship;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any other case when: (a) based on available information, there exists a substantial likelihood a personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as the result of a prohibited personnel practice; or (b) the Special Counsel, in her sole discretion, otherwise determines that it would be appropriate and consistent with OSC's statutory mission to request a stay from the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Processing Stay Cases</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Stay Procedure for Matters Pending in the Complaints Examining Unit (CEU)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;When a complainant requests a stay, the CEU attorney or personnel management specialist will review the file within two (2) business days, and will promptly make a recommendation to the Chief, CEU, about whether any of the criteria for seeking a stay set forth in Section A, above, appear to be present.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;If a determination is made that the criteria for seeking a stay do not appear to be present, the attorney or personnel management specialist will document the reasons for that determination in writing. The case will be returned to his or her case docket to be processed consistent with routine procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;If the attorney or personnel management specialist and the Chief, CEU, believe that the criteria for seeking a stay appear to be present, they will make a written recommendation to the Associate Special Counsel for Complaints and Disclosure Analysis and the appropriate Associate Special Counsel for Investigation and Prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;If the Associate Special Counsel for Complaints and Disclosure Analysis and the Associate Special Counsel for Investigation and Prosecution agree that the criteria for seeking a stay appear to exist, the matter will be immediately referred to the Investigation and Prosecution Division and processed in accordance with Section (B)(2), below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">e.&#x2003;If the Associate Special Counsel for Complaints and Disclosure Analysis and the Associate Special Counsel for Investigation and Prosecution agree that the criteria for seeking a stay do not appear to exist, then the matter will be returned to the examiner's case docket and processed in accordance with routine procedure. When the Associate Special Counsel for Complaints and Disclosure Analysis and the Associate Special Counsel for Investigation and Prosecution do not agree, the matter will be referred to the Special Counsel for a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Stay Procedure After Referral to the Investigation and Prosecution Division</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;At the time that a case is referred to the Investigation and Prosecution Division, pursuant to Section (B)(1)(d), above, the assigned case attorney or investigator will promptly obtain whatever information (if any) is necessary to confirm that the criteria for seeking a stay exist. If the additional information confirms that the criteria for seeking a stay exist, the assigned case attorney or investigator will contact the agency involved to request that the personnel action be held in abeyance for at least 45 days. If the additional information dispels the existence of the <span id="Page_4055"></span>criteria for seeking a stay, then the reasons for that conclusion will be documented by the case attorney and the case will be handled consistent with routine procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;If the agency declines to hold a personnel action in abeyance at OSC's request, then with the Special Counsel's approval, the OSC will petition the MSPB for a stay, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;If an agency agrees to stay a personnel action, but the agreed-upon stay period ends before OSC completes its investigation, the assigned attorney or investigator will request an extension of the stay, assuming that the criteria for seeking a stay set forth in Section A above, continue to exist.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;If an agency agrees to stay a personnel action at OSC's request, or if the MSPB grants a stay request, the case will receive priority for investigation and legal review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">e.&#x2003;If the agency declines a request for an extension of a stay, then with the Special Counsel's approval, OSC will petition the MSPB for a stay. If the MSPB grants the stay request, the case will receive priority for investigation and legal review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">f.&#x2003;On occasion, a request for a stay may be made after a case has been referred for investigation, or the investigation may uncover additional facts that suggest that a stay is warranted. In such circumstances, if a determination is made by the assigned case attorney during an investigation that the criteria for requesting a stay exist, then, with the approval of the Associate Special Counsel for Investigation and Prosecution, the assigned attorney or investigator will proceed to seek a stay as set forth above. On the other hand, if the assigned attorney makes a determination that the criteria for seeking a stay have not been met, then the attorney shall document the reasons for the denial in the file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Miscellaneous</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;In their discretion, OSC staff may ask an agency to grant a stay even when the criteria for seeking a stay set forth in Section A do not exist. In addition, an agency may, in its own discretion, decide to stay a personnel action pending an OSC investigation, even when the criteria for seeking a stay set forth in Section A do not exist In such cases, however, OSC cannot commit to give priority to the investigation or legal review of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Except in extraordinary circumstances, OSC will not seek to stay the filling of a vacant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;"Reasonable grounds" means such grounds as a reasonable person, in possession of the same information, and with knowledge of the applicable law, would accept as adequate to support the conclusion that a prohibited personnel practice has been or will be committed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;This policy statement will become effective on Monday, June 4, 2001, and will supercede the policy statement issued on September 7, 2000. This statement is intended only to provide guidance to OSC staff on the circumstances under which the Special Counsel may exercise her authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b) to seek a stay from the MSPB, and the procedures for doing so. The statement is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the Office of Special Counsel or any other individual or entity.</p>
