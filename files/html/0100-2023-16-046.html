<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-47"><span class="space">20.</span> Bargaining to Impasse on Permissive Matter</h4>
<p class="noindent">Permissive subjects of bargaining are defined at 5 USC 7106:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Nothing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;at the election of the agency, on the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty, or on the technology, methods, and means of performing work[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Permissive subjects of bargaining are permissive. Parties commit a ULP by negotiating a permissive matter to the point of impasse, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3937 and SSA,</span> 64 FLRA 17, 21 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that insisting to impasse on a permissive subject of bargaining violates the Statute.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">United States. Food and Drug Admin., Ne. &#x0026; Mid-Atlantic Regions,</span> 53 FLRA 1269, 1273-74 (1998) (<span class="Italic">FDA</span>) (agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5)); <span class="Italic">SPORT Air Traffic Controllers Org. (SATCO),</span> 52 FLRA 339, 347 (1996) (union violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (5)); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agric, Food Safety &#x0026; Inspection Serv.,</span> 22 FLRA 586, 587-88 (1986) (agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5)); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Headquarters,</span> 18 FLRA at 771-72 (agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5)). In cases alleging such conduct, there is no need to apply a "totality of the circumstances analysis," as the Judge did here. Rather, if the GC establishes that a respondent insisted to impasse on a single proposal that concerned a permissive subject of bargaining, then the respondent will be found to have violated the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FDIC,</span> 18 FLRA at 772-74 (violation established where one of two proposals submitted to the Panel was a permissive topic). Thus, to establish a violation, the GC must prove that: (1) the Respondent insisted to impasse over the disputed proposals; and (2) at least one of the disputed proposals concerns a permissive subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent">The course of negotiations over permissive subjects can change as a result of the direction of higher-level authority. Section 2.(d) of the 1993 Executive Order 12871, "Labor-Management Partnerships," [58 Fed. Reg. 52201-52203] directed the head of each agency to "negotiate over the subjects set forth in 5 USC 7106(b)(1) and "instruct subordinate officials to do the same." As a result of the Executive Order, unions sought to characterize some proposals as negotiable because they involved permissive subjects of bargaining. Exec. Order 12871 was revoked on February 17, 2001, by Executive Order 13202 [66 Fed. Reg. 11227]. Section 3 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that agency heads shall move to rescind orders, rules, or policies enforcing Exec. Order 12871. Section 4 of Exec. Order 13203 provides that "[n]othing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order." The law that follows was developed under Exec. Order 12871.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 53 FLRA 858, 870-75 (1997), explored the nature of permissive bargaining, while reserving a decision on the effect of the Executive Order following additional briefing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties vigorously dispute whether the President, by virtue of issuing Executive Order 12871, has exercised the Respondent's discretion to bargain over the decision to use term appointments. However, neither party addresses longstanding Authority precedent concerning the effect under the Statute of such an election, even if it is determined that an election has been made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent describes matters covered by section 7106(b)(1) as "permissive" subjects of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Seattle, Washington and Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 14 FLRA 644, 648 (1984). This description is appropriate because an agency may elect to, but absent an election is not required to, bargain about section 7106(b)(1) subjects: "It is well-established that a party is not required to bargain over a permissive subject of bargaining." <span class="Italic">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, <span class="Italic">Headquarters</span>, 18 FLRA 768, 771 (1985) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>). Consistent with this principle, Authority precedent clearly states that an agency that elects to bargain over section 7106(b)(1) matters may withdraw from bargaining at any time before reaching agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Clearly, if parties are not required to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining, it follows that parties cannot insist on bargaining to impasse with respect to such matters....&#8197;Where a matter falls outside the required scope of bargaining or is negotiable only at the election of an agency, there is no mutual obligation to bargain at all. If parties do bargain over such matters either may withdraw at any time prior to reaching agreement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Authority has not previously found that an agency acted unlawfully in refusing to bargain over a section 7106(b)(1) subject.[11] Indeed, the Authority has held that it is an unfair labor practice for a party to insist to impasse on bargaining over a permissive subject of bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sport Air Traffic Controllers Organization</span>, 52 FLRA 339 (1996); <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 18 FLRA at 771-72. With specific regard to section 7106(b)(1) matters, this construction of the Statute is consistent with the only legislative history that addresses this point. <span class="Italic">See</span> 124 Cong.

<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;We note, however, that the Authority has not previously determined the effect of section 2(d) of the Executive Order on an agency's obligation to bargain under section 7106(b)(1). In particular, contrary to the judge's conclusion in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, 647th Air Base Group, Hanscom Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Massachusetts</span>, Case No. BN-CA-41011, cited <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 2, the Authority did not "inferentially" determine in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, that agencies are not obligated to bargain under section 7106(b)(1) despite the Executive Order. In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, the Authority established an analytical framework for determining whether proposals claimed to affect rights under both section 7106(a) and 7106(b)(1) are within the duty to bargain. Although the Authority determined that certain of the union's proposals were bargainable at the agency's election under section 7106(b)(1), the Authority explained that it was required by virtue of existing regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.10(b), to dismiss the union's petition for review with regard to those proposals. The Authority made no determination in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Lexington</span>, "inferential" or otherwise, about the effect of the Executive Order on an agency's duty to bargain under section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;The following exchange, in pertinent part, occurred during the floor debate on the final version of section 7106:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. The Executive order says that there shall be no obligation to meet and confer on "numbers, types, and grades of positions or employees assigned to an organizational unit, work project, or tour of duty," and so forth....&#8197;Yet, in the Udall substitute it says they are not "precluded" from meeting and conferring....&#8197;Is the Defense Department or any other Federal agency, for that matter, required to bargain on those particular subjects?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. FORD of Michigan. It is permissible, and it is in exactly the same status as the existing law. I might say that not only are they under no obligation to bargain, but they can start bargaining and change their minds and decide they do not want to talk about it any more, and pull it off the table. It is completely within the control of the <span id="Page_1272"></span>agency to begin discussing the matter or terminate the discussion at any point they wish without a conclusion, and there is no appeal or reaction possible from the parties on the other side of the table.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is completely, if you will, at the pleasure and the will of the agency. Where an agency wants to resolve a particular problem with an organization and come to some agreement, it can choose to do so....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. So...there is no way that they can be forced to negotiate on those subjects?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. FORD of Michigan. That is correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. EDWARDS of Alabama. And if they in fact start negotiating on those subjects and conclude at some point that they should not negotiate further, there is no way to force them to negotiate further?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Mr. FORD of Michigan. That is correct. It is completely within the discretion of one side of the table, and there is no appeal from their decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Legislative History</span> at 1075.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Authority has held that an <span class="Italic">election to</span> <span class="Italic">bargain over </span>a permissive subject of bargaining is not enforceable under the Statute, it has enforced an <span class="Italic">agreement on</span> such a subject. Once such an agreement has been reached, that agreement is enforceable, during its lifetime, under the same terms as any other negotiated agreement. In particular, once agreement concerning a section 7106(b)(1) subject is reached, neither that agreement nor the election that resulted in the agreement is subject to disapproval on section 7106(b)(1) grounds by an agency head under section 7114(c) of the Statute.[13] <span class="Italic">See National Association of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R4-75 and Department of Interior, National Park</span> <span class="Italic">Service, Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 24 FLRA 56, 62 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Blue Ridge</span> <span class="Italic">Parkway</span>). Similarly, such agreed-upon provision is enforceable in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor (OSHA) and National Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 577 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;Upon expiration of the agreement, however, either party may notify the other tha[t] it is no longer bound by any provisions on permissive matters that the agreement may have contained. This is in contrast to the general rule that expired provisions relating to mandatory subjects of bargaining continue until changed by the parties in accordance with the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 23 FLRA 209 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel cites precedent applying the principle that an agreed-upon provision concerning a section 7106(b)(1) subject may not be disapproved as support for its argument that the Respondent is obligated to bargain with the Union. In particular, the General Counsel states that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It is well settled that an agency at the exclusive level of recognition can exercise its discretion to bargain over section 7106(b)(1) matters, and the agency head cannot overturn that discretion on agency-head review under section 7114(c) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See [Blue Ridge</span> <span class="Italic">Parkway]</span><span class="Italic"></span>. Here, the General Counsel asserts that the President has made an election at the level of exclusive recognition to bargain over section 7106(b)(1) matters. Thus, if agency heads cannot reverse elections to negotiate which are made at the level of recognition, then it stands to reason that they should not be allowed to reverse the President's determination to negotiate over section 7106(b)(1) matters at the level of recognition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This assertion fails to recognize that, in the case cited, the agency had not only elected to bargain over a section 7106(b)(1) matter but also had reached agreement with the union and the parties had executed an agreement on that matter. In fact, although the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 24 FLRA at 61, that "[n]egotiations on permissive subjects may begin and later cease[,]" the Authority emphasized that "bargaining on the [disputed] provision [had] occurred at the local level and an agreement was executed." Thus, by its terms, the constraint imposed on agency head action in <span class="Italic">Blue Ridge Parkway</span> does not concern elections to bargain under section 7106(b)(1) matters; rather, the constraint applies only after agreement is reached as a result of such bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, Authority precedent indicates that an agency official who elects to bargain with a union about permissive subjects but later withdraws that election prior to reaching agreement does not commit an unfair labor practice. The parties have not addressed how the precedent establishing this principle should be applied in this case. The General Counsel's assertion that Executive Order 12871 constitutes "an <span class="Italic">irrevocable</span> election to bargain over the subjects contained in section 7106(b)(1)[,]" suggests that this asserted blanket election cannot be revoked at any time. According to the General Counsel, "public policy" provides the basis for finding that Section 2(d) of the Executive Order constitutes an irrevocable election binding on all agencies. As support, the General Counsel points to the purpose of the Executive Order and the absence of any language that the mandate to expand the scope of bargaining is discretionary. However, the basis for construing this asserted election as "irrevocable," and the meaning of the term "irrevocable" in this context, is not explained. In addition, the General Counsel has pointed to no support in the Statute, legislative history or precedent for finding that an election to bargain under section 7106(b)(1) can be made in an irrevocable manner. Such irrevocable election would, it appears, transform permissive subjects of bargaining into mandatory subjects, thereby making the election subject to enforcement through unfair labor practice proceedings in the same manner that bargaining over a mandatory subject is enforceable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union, in its exceptions, offers an alternative theory under which the asserted blanket election to bargain may be revoked, but only by "an official of the agency, with the authority to act on behalf of the agency, who states that the agency has declined to make the election specified in the Executive Order." However, the Union has provided no support for this alternative theory, nor has it provided a basis on which to find it compatible with the legislative history quoted above.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 54 FLRA 360 (1998), determined that Section 2.(d) was not enforceable through ULP proceedings. FLRA's analysis of the impact of the Executive Order on permissive bargaining subjects was confirmed by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-8 v. FLRA</span>, 179 F.3d 946, 948-51 (D.C. Cir. 1999). The D.C. Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">PTO</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 147 v. FLRA</span>, 204 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">PTO</span> did not change impact bargaining obligations, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hanscom AFB and NAGE Local R1-8</span>, 54 FLRA 457, 463 n.4 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the substance of the decision is not itself subject to negotiation, the agency is nonetheless obligated to bargain over the impact and implementation of that decision if the resulting changes have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 24 FLRA 403, 407-08 (1986)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all agreements that permitted management to avoid bargaining obligations over mandatory subjects of bargaining converted those matters into permissive subjects of bargaining, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Washington and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 1423, 1430 (1990) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The fact that the parties agreed that, for certain actions, the Respondent could act unilaterally does not support a conclusion that the provision constituted a permissive subject of bargaining....&#8197;Instead, the subject matter of the provisions, employee reassignments, was and remained a mandatory subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note...in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement, a union is entitled to bargain over the substance or the impact and implementation of all conditions of employment. By agreeing to a contract term involving such a matter, a union can be said to have waived its right to bargain over separate exercises of management's rights or separate changes in conditions of employment. When the subject matter of the provision constitutes a mandatory subject of bargaining, however, the parties' agreement to contract terms, including terms which enable an employer to act unilaterally with respect to certain aspects of that mandatory subject, does not convert the mandatory subject to a permissive one. Stated otherwise, the Union's agreement not to bind the Respondent to contract procedures when the Respondent effected certain reassignments and to, in effect, allow the Respondent to determine the procedures by which those certain reassignments would be affected, did not change the subject matter of the agreement from mandatory to permissive.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the issuance of the Executive Order, negotiation on permissive subjects of bargaining was limited. In <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 18 FLRA 768, 771-72 (1985), FLRA announced that a party may not bargain to impasse over a permissive subject of bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established that a party is not required to bargain over a permissive subject of bargaining. This applies equally to proposals advanced by agency management as it does to proposals made by a union....&#8197;While in such instances, neither agency management nor the union could be required to bargain, nothing in the Statute would preclude bargaining if the parties chose to do so. In this latter connection, the Authority has held that where parties are negotiating a collective bargaining agreement and have elected to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining and have reached agreement thereon, the parties are bound to adhere to those terms during the life of their agreement. However, upon the agreement's expiration, either party may elect to no longer be bound by such terms and, in effect, reassert its right not to negotiate with regard to such permissive subjects of bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clearly, if parties are not required to bargain over permissive subjects of bargaining, it follows that parties cannot insist on bargaining to impasse with respect to such matters within the meaning of section 7119 of the Statute....&#8197;Where a matter falls outside the required scope of bargaining or is negotiable only at the election of an agency, there is no mutual obligation to bargain at all. If parties do bargain over such matters either may withdraw at any time prior to reaching agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="Page_1273"></span>Concerning another proposal in <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, requiring that the union accept that the employer had the right to implement the change (even though the matter was referred to a third party for resolution) if agreement had not been reached within 45 days from the date the union requested negotiations as to the change, FLRA determined that the proposal precluded the union from fully utilizing the impasse machinery of the Statute--including, under most conditions, procedures requiring a stay of changes pending the outcome of FSIP proceedings. By limiting a statutory right, the proposal was not within the required scope of bargaining, although the union did have the option of choosing to bargain over the proposal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 774.</p>
