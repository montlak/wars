<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-744"><span id="page_1162"></span><span class="space">4.</span> Department of Veterans Affairs--Title 38</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Under 38 USC 7422:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">(a)&#x2003;Except as otherwise specifically provided in this title, the authority of the Secretary to prescribe regulations under section 7421 of this title is subject to the right of Federal employees to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by them in accordance with chapter 71 of title 5 (relating to labor-management relations).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">(b)&#x2003;Such collective bargaining (and any grievance procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement) in the case of employees described in section 7421(b) of this title may not cover, or have any applicability to, any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.</span></p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Ft. Lyons, Colo.,</span> 25 FLRA 803, 811 (1987) (Proposal 1), determined that Title 38 employees are covered by the Statute. No conflict existed between the provisions of Title 38 and the provisions of the Statute that permit collective bargaining concerning conditions of employment, except as to disciplinary and adverse actions for alleged professional inaptitude, inefficiency, or misconduct of Title 38 medical personnel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 244 (1987) (Proposal 11). The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">VA Staff Nurses Council, Local 5032 and VAMC, Wood</span>, 29 FLRA 849 (1987) (Proposals 1 and 2; grievance procedure for nurses). A grievance concerning the failure of VA to promote respiratory technicians upon their conversion from General Schedule to Title 38 employment under the Veterans Health Care Amendments of 1983, Pub. L. 98-160, was arbitrable and grievable. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Omaha and AFGE Local 2270</span>, 26 FLRA 371 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union proposed that the grievance procedure include contract interpretation, application, or violations, and that it include any matters involving working conditions or the interpretation and application of agency policies, regulations, and practices not specifically covered by the agreement, but exclude matters subject to statutory appeals procedures. The agency objected, arguing that the procedure would apply to matters "nongrievable as a matter of law," i.e., that the procedure would apply to matters concerning the appointment and discipline of agency employees appointed under Title 38, U.S. Code (excluding certain VA personnel actions from civil service law). Although a reviewing court would not enforce its decision, FLRA ruled the proposal negotiable, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3669 and VAMC, Minneapolis</span>, 3 FLRA 311, 313-14 (1980):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language and legislative history of section 7121(a) of the Statute, viewed as an entirety, do not indicate that Congress intended to require the parties to a collective bargaining agreement specifically and expressly to set forth all or any of those matters which, under provisions of law, could not properly be covered by their negotiated grievance procedure. Rather, in this regard, section 7121(a) of the Statute provides that a collective bargaining agreement must contain a grievance procedure which shall be the exclusive method of resolving grievances falling within its coverage, with the proviso that the parties "<span class="Italic">may</span> exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedure...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, Congress clearly intended that the scope and coverage of a negotiated grievance procedure shall extend to all matters which "under the provisions of law" could be covered unless the parties agreed through the collective bargaining process to a procedure having a narrower coverage. Congress clearly did not, however, mandate that, to fall within the duty to bargain, each proposed grievance procedure must enumerate all or some of the matters which "under the provisions of law" could not be so covered. Such a requirement would be redundant and without legal significance since, as indicated, section 7121, as explained by the Committee on Conference, already provides that negotiated grievance procedures cover, at a maximum, matters which under the provisions of law could be submitted to the procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If the agency believes that, as a matter of law, certain matters are nongrievable and nonarbitrable, grievances which might be filed with respect to them may be challenged by the agency as nongrievable or nonarbitrable.... In this regard, section 7121(a) of the Statute requires the parties to "provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, <span class="Italic">including questions of arbitrability</span>...." Furthermore, if an arbitrator were to render an award involving the matters which "under the provisions of law" may not be covered by negotiated grievance procedures, the agency would have an opportunity to challenge the award by filing exceptions thereto with the Authority pursuant to section 7122 of the Statute on the basis that the award is "contrary to any law, rule or regulation."</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we hold that a grievance disputing the Agency's process of scheduling Title 38 physicians to perform patient care duties on weekends is excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Jerome A.&#x2003;Diekemper found that the Agency violated the parties' collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) and other Agency directives by scheduling the grievants to work on weekends and in excess of forty-hours per week. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the grievance is non-arbitrable. We set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievants are physicians--Title 38 health care professionals under the U.S. Code, subject to unique federal employee rules and requirements--at one of the Agency's hospitals. The grievants work a regular forty-hour workweek but are required to perform rounds ("rounding" duties) typically two weekend days per month. When the physicians are performing rounding duties, they primarily visit and assess patients and order any necessary tests, treatments, or medications, which can take one to six hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2014, the Agency revised its policy regarding the basic workweek for full-time physicians in order to cover extended service hours during evenings and weekends. The policy is set out in VA Handbook 5011/27 and defined the basic workweek for full-time physicians as 40 hours, from Sunday through Saturday. Article 35, Section 20 (Article 35) of the parties' CBA authorizes hospital directors to approve absences for "rest and relaxation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2017, the Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency was violating the CBA and VA Handbook 5011/27 by scheduling physicians to work on weekends in excess of forty hours per week. The Union requested that the Agency cease scheduling physicians for more than forty hours per week and provide retroactive "rest and relaxation" for those periods of time when the grievants worked more than forty hours during any given week. The parties failed to resolve the matter and the Union invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his award dated November 13, 2019, the Arbitrator framed the issue as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the Agency violate the CBA and any associated guidance and/or directives in scheduling Title 38 physicians to perform patient rounding on Saturdays and/or Sundays during weeks they were also scheduled for their regular 40-hour tours of duty? If so, what is the appropriate remedy?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argued that because the grievance concerns compensation and direct patient care, the grievance is not arbitrable because those matters are excluded from the grievance procedure by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422. As relevant here, &#x00A7; 7422 excludes from the negotiated grievance procedure any "matter or question" concerning either "professional conduct or competence," including patient care, or "employee compensation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator agreed that rounding duties involve "physician-patient care" because those duties require the physicians to enter the hospital and examine patients. However, he also found that the CBA does not describe "rest and relaxation" as pay or compensation. According to the Arbitrator, the parties "would not have negotiated a section to provide for rest and relaxation if that topic was taboo and prohibited by federal statute." Therefore, he concluded that rest and relaxation does not involve pay or compensation and that the grievance is not barred by &#x00A7; 7422.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the grievance, concluding that the Agency violated the CBA and VA Handbook 5011/27 by scheduling weekend rounding outside of the basic forty-hour workweek. The Arbitrator <span id="page_1163"></span>ordered the Agency "to include weekend rounding assignments in the basic 40-hour workweek by scheduling a two-hour workday for each shift of weekend rounding" and to adjust one of the other workdays to be six hours. He also ordered the Agency to provide the grievants retroactive rest and relaxation time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422[7] because the grievance concerns professional conduct or competence and affects compensation. Specifically, the Agency contends that the award impacts direct patient care by requiring the Agency to adjust scheduling and to authorize rest and relaxation time, which interferes with the Agency's ability to schedule the grievants to provide direct patient care. The Agency also argues that the award affects compensation by forcing the Agency to provide paid rest and relaxation time off.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The issue in this case, as framed by the parties and the Arbitrator, concerns when the physicians are scheduled to provide direct patient care. The Arbitrator found that weekend rounding "involves physician patient care work"--"see[ing] and examin[ing] patients." While focusing on whether "rest and relaxation" involves "pay or compensation" under &#x00A7; 7422, the Arbitrator failed to analyze whether &#x00A7; 7422 bars the grievance because scheduling weekend rounding involves direct patient care. But his factual findings support the conclusion that this case clearly concerns a matter of professional conduct or competence within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7422(b). Furthermore, the Secretary of the VA has repeatedly found that the Agency's ability to control the work schedules of Title 38 professionals is a matter involving professional conduct or competence because it implicates the Agency's ability to provide direct patient care.[18] Consequently, the grievance is excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure pursuant to &#x00A7; 7422(b).</p>

In its reconsideration decision, FLRA determined it had jurisdiction to consider the agency's exceptions to the arbitrator's award because the VA Secretary did not invoke statutory authority to determine the matter in dispute involved professional conduct or competence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its motion for reconsideration, the Union argues that the Authority "exceeded its statutory authority when it determined that the arbitration award in this matter concerned professional conduct or competence under [&#x00A7;] 7422 without such a determination by the VA Secretary." Specifically, the Union points out that the Agency did not seek a &#x00A7; 7422 determination from the VA Secretary in this case and argues that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(d) "explicitly provides that determinations regarding whether a matter is excluded from collective bargaining may only be made by the VA Secretary." The Union argues that courts have "recognized that [the] statutory language [under &#x00A7; 7422(d)] means that the [Authority] may not rule on whether a matter is excluded from collective bargaining pursuant to [&#x00A7;] 7422" and thus that the Authority exceeded its jurisdiction in this case.[19] </p>

<p class="noindent-1">As the Union states, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) "sets forth three substantive limitations on. . .Title 38 employees' bargaining rights."[20] Under &#x00A7; 7422(b):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Such collective bargaining (and any grievance procedures provided under a collective[-]bargaining agreement) in the case of employees described in [&#x00A7;] 7421(b). . .may not cover, or have any applicability to, any matter or question concerning or arising out of (1) professional conduct or competence, (2) peer review, or (3) the establishment, determination, or adjustment of employee compensation under this title.[21] </p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b).

<p class="noindent-1">However, as the Union stresses, &#x00A7; 7422(d) provides that the issue of whether a matter or question concerns or arises out of one of these enumerated exemptions "<span class="Italic">shall be decided by the Secretary</span> and is not itself subject to collective bargaining and may not be reviewed by any other agency."[22] The Authority has repeatedly declined to assert jurisdiction in cases where the VA Secretary has explicitly made a determination under &#x00A7; 7422(d), which the Authority has acknowledged removes the case from the scope of collective bargaining under the Statute and may not be reviewed by the Authority.[23] In cases where the VA Secretary has <span class="Italic">not</span> made a &#x00A7; 7422(d) determination, the extent to which our jurisdiction is limited is less clear. However, the Union's arguments on this point convince us that we erred when we determined that the grievance in this case concerned a matter under &#x00A7; 7422(b) and was thus excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure. </p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7422(d) states that whether a matter is excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure "shall be decided by the Secretary."[24] Upon reconsideration, we find instructive the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's determination that "Congress has entrusted the VA Secretary with the sole authority to determine whether a &#x00A7; 7422(b) exemption applies to a grievance."[25] Moreover, we are convinced by the Union's argument that the Authority's decision interrupts the statutory scheme under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422 and decides an issue beyond the Authority's statutory mandate.[26] </p>

Furthermore, we recognize upon re-reviewing the record in this case, that Article 43, Section 2(C) of the parties' CBA restates the exemptions under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7422(b) and includes the following note: </p>
<p class="noindent-3">The language in the above paragraph shall only serve to preclude a grievance where the Secretary, or a lawfully appointed designee of the Secretary (currently the Under-Secretary for Health), determines in accordance with 38 [U.S.C. &#x00A7;] 7422 that the grievance concerns or arises out of one or more of the three items listed above. </p>

As a result, we find that there are extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of <span class="Italic">VA</span>.

<p class="noindent-1">In order to provide more clarity to parties moving forward, we note that based on the above discussion and the language of &#x00A7; 7422(d), neither the Authority, nor arbitrators, have the authority to determine that a matter is excluded from the grievance procedure under &#x00A7; 7422(b). If the VA Secretary or his/her designee issues a 7422-determination finding a matter or question concerns or arises out of one of the limitations set forth in &#x00A7; 7422(b), then, consistent with established Authority precedent, it is clear that we are without jurisdiction over the issue. However, if the Secretary has not issued a 7422-determination finding a matter or question concerns or arises out of one of the limitations set forth in &#x00A7; 7422(b), then the Authority is not similarly precluded of jurisdiction and may decide the issue.[30]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;We state as much based on the language of &#x00A7; 7422(d), and that only the VA Secretary may decide if a matter falls under &#x00A7; 7422(b) and is excluded from the grievance procedure, even though, as in this case, it seems obvious to us that the matter clearly should be excluded under &#x00A7; 7422(b). Although we question whether this language requires the VA Secretary to repeatedly issue 7422-determinations on the same questions, we understand that there is no 7422-determination at issue here and that question is not before us now. Furthermore, we recognize that the approach noted here is in fact consistent with the Authority's decision in AFGE, 61 <span class="Italic">FLRA</span> at 571. <span class="Italic">See VA II</span>, 71 FLRA at 769(c) n.12. Moreover, we hope that this decision clarifies for the parties that in the future we will not consider the technical arguments as to why an issue does or does not concern one of the limitations in &#x00A7; 7422(b), as those decisions are within the purview of the VA Secretary.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(b)(10) provides that chapter 75, subchapter II, does not apply to an employee "who holds a position within the Veterans Health Administration which has been excluded from the competitive service by or under a provision of title 38, unless such employee was appointed to such position under section 7401(3) of such title." While hybrid employees are generally appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7401(3), part-time hybrid employees are appointed under 38 USC &#x00A7; 7405, not &#x00A7; 7401(3). <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal would afford part-time hybrid title 38 employees the right to grieve disciplinary and performance actions that they are not entitled to appeal under chapter 75 of title 5. Consistent with Authority precedent and with the decisions of numerous circuit courts, the proposal is inconsistent with the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See HHS, Region IX v. FLRA</span>, 894 F.2d 333; <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1467; <span class="Italic">HHS v.
