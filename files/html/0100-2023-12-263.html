<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-262"><span class="space">a.</span> Penalty, Time-Served Suspension; Remedy</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An arbitrator may mitigate a penalty, but she must analyze the penalty under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> standards. <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 85 MSPR 684, 689 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2000); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hunter v. DOJ</span>, 110 MSPR 219, 224-25 &#x00B6; 12, 2008 MSPB 236 (2008) (examining an arbitrator's award under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> standards). Without a reasoned <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis from the arbitrator, the Board may substitute its own judgment on the penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chandler v. SSA</span>, 80 MSPR 542, 548 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (finding that, in the complete absence of any indication that the arbitrator considered factors relevant to the penalty selection, "the penalty selection is not entitled to deference, and the Board will perform the proper analysis").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Generally the Board defers to an arbitrator's reasoned assessment of the charges and determination of a penalty. <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. FEC</span>, 105 MSPR 677, 698-700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 50-56, 2007 MSPB 140 (2007), saw no error in the arbitrator's determination to sustain a removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deference that is due to arbitrators' findings extends to findings related to penalty determinations. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 20. In making these findings, arbitrators are required to apply the same rules the Board applies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Belldina v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 497, 501-02 (1991). When the arbitrator does not apply those rules, his penalty determination is not entitled to deference, and the Board will conduct its own analysis. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 20; <span class="Italic">Chandler</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 542, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the arbitrator erred by failing to find that the agency's decision to impose the penalty of removal, as opposed to some lesser penalty, violated the progressive discipline requirement of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator carefully and thoughtfully considered this argument below, noting that some discipline short of removal is "normally" issued "where, as the Agency effectively admits, there is no misconduct that standing alone warrants immediate termination." The arbitrator found that, under the circumstances of this case, a deviation from the principle of progressive discipline was appropriate because, although the appellant had no prior disciplinary record, he had been placed on notice that he needed to improve his behavior subject to the possibility of discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant disputes the arbitrator's finding that he was on notice of the possibility of discipline if he failed to improve his behavior, the arbitrator's finding is entitled to deference, <span class="Italic">see Pleasant</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 602, &#x00B6; 17. Further, the arbitrator's finding that some penalty less than removal was not strictly required by the principles of progressive discipline contained in the collective bargaining agreement is also entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Luna</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also contends that the agency misapplied the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and that a proper weighing of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors leads to the conclusion that the penalty of removal is unreasonable under the circumstances of this case. Where, as here, all of the agency's charges are sustained, the Board will review the agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Adam v.

The arbitrator explicitly mentioned in his decision the tumultuous events in the appellant's life and the construction adjacent to the appellant's office, although not in his penalty analysis.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An arbitrator's finding that an employee failed to prove a disability discrimination claim is a factual determination that is entitled to due deference unless the arbitrator erred in his legal analysis, e.g., by misallocating the parties' burdens of proof or utilizing the incorrect analytical framework. <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of Commerce,</span> 55 MSPR 451, 457 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Clark v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 552, 558-62 (1997), the Board set forth the applicable analytical framework to be utilized in disability discrimination cases in which the appellant relies on (a) indirect evidence (i.e., where the agency alleges that it was unaware of the employee's disability or that its action was taken for a reason unrelated to the alleged disability), or (b) direct evidence (i.e., where the agency acknowledges that the employee is disabled and based its action on the alleged disability).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the analytical framework for proving disability discrimination based on indirect evidence, the employee is required to first establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination before the burden of production shifts to the agency, i.e., the appellant is required to show that: (1) He is disabled or perceived to be disabled; (2) he is otherwise qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation, for the position in question; (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision (which is within the Board's jurisdiction); (4) the agency knew or had reason to know of the appellant's disability, or perceived him as disabled; and (5) the position remained open while the agency sought other applicants or the appellant was replaced. <span class="Italic">See Monette v.</span> <span class="Italic">Electronic Data Systems Corp.,</span> 90 F.3d 1173, 1184-86 (6th Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Clark,</span> 74 MSPR at 559.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the arbitrator implicitly found that the appellant was relying on indirect evidence of disability discrimination.

He further found "that neither party presented sufficient evidence as to whether the [a]gency had met or not met its obligation to 'reasonably accommodate' [the appellant]." Thus, implicitly, the arbitrator found that the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving disability discrimination because he did not make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination by showing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he could be accommodated. In reaching this finding, the arbitrator essentially utilized the analytical framework for adjudicating disability discrimination cases based on indirect evidence.

The Board did not order back pay in that case, providing only that the employee's pay was to begin after he successfully completed his rehabilitation treatment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 479.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, despite the arbitrator's finding that the appellant failed to prove disability discrimination, he nevertheless found that the appellant was a disabled employee who was in need of medical care but that neither party provided sufficient evidence of whether he could be accommodated. Although the arbitrator did not find disability discrimination, he mitigated the removal penalty. He found that the appellant was not fit for duty in October or November of 1995, around the time of his removal, but directed the agency to reinstate the appellant "to his previous employment status" with attendant rights and benefits as of the date of his removal. The arbitrator, however, further directed the agency not to return the appellant to duty until he was certified fit for duty by a qualified or Board-certified psychiatrist. He specified that, during the period between the appellant's removal and his return to duty, if the agency returned him to duty, he would be considered unfit for duty and would not be entitled to back pay because he was not fit for duty at the time of his removal. In fashioning this remedy, the arbitrator noted the relevant penalty factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981). We find that the remedy provided by the arbitrator is consistent with Board law and, therefore, we find no basis for disturbing his findings on the appropriateness of the remedy. <span class="Italic">See Gomez</span>, 70 MSPR at 266.

The arbitrator appears to have used this analytical framework by finding that the appellant's obsessive-compulsive disorder contributed to his negligent conduct, and mitigating his 60-day suspension to a medical leave of absence. We find that this decision violates no statute or civil service law. Merely because the Board would not, under its own jurisprudence, have imposed a leave of absence, does not necessarily demonstrate that the arbitrator committed legal error. This is particularly true where, as here, the appellant had the alternative of appealing his suspension directly to the Board, instead of going through the negotiated grievance procedure, as he did....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Some arbitrators decide to reinstate an employee but allow no back pay.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In imposing a 435-day suspension (the difference between the effective date of the appellant's removal, and the date of her reinstatement), the arbitrator did not conduct an analysis under <span class="Italic">Douglas v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator found that based on the appellant's years of service with the agency and no prior disciplinary record, the penalty of removal was excessive. We agree.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Indeed, even if this issue were a mixed question of fact and law, we still would not apply collateral estoppel to the arbitrator's penalty determination because this determination is facially incorrect under the Board's interpretation of civil service law and would result in injustice and compromise of public policy....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have indicated above that the arbitrator in the present case found that the appellant should be "reinstated" as of the date of the arbitrator's decision, that he was not entitled to back pay between the effective date of the removal and the date of his "reinstate[ment]," and that the period from the removal until the "reinstate[ment]" was to be considered a suspension without pay. Because the arbitration decision was not issued until November 25, 2003, the arbitrator in effect mitigated the removal to a suspension of 20 months and 13 days. The appellant argues, in essence, that the arbitrator improperly based the length of the suspension that was to be substituted for the removal on the length of time taken to adjudicate the grievance, instead of on an analysis of the applicable <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including a determination of the maximum reasonable penalty that could be imposed for the sustained charges.</p>

In <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 684 &#x00B6; 13, the Board found that a similar penalty determination by an arbitrator, i.e., one extending over the 13-month period from the effective date of the removal until the arbitrator's decision was issued, was entitled to deference because the arbitrator had "conduct[ed] a thorough <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis"; and in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 373 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 9-10 (2001), it gave collateral estoppel effect to a similar, "time served"--this one lasting 334 days--because "the arbitrator...gave a reasoned explanation for his penalty determination and...did not set the penalty in the arbitrary way involved in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the arbitrator's decision could be regarded as consistent with the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>. The arbitrator here considered the appellant's lengthy service, indicating that it was an important factor; he considered the absence of any indication that the appellant had been disciplined during his first 25 years of employment; he considered the appellant's performance record, including the absence of any indication that the appellant had received "anything other than excellent work reviews"; he considered the unintentional nature of the misconduct and the role of the illness he had found caused it; he considered the nature of the appellant's duties and the appellant's success in "getting along with others"; he indicated that he did not concur in the agency deciding official's apparent belief that the appellant lacked rehabilitative potential and that the offenses had affected the agency's reputation; and he considered various other mitigating factors.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the arbitrators in <span class="Italic">Belldina</span> and <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> also considered factors identified in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> as relevant to penalty determinations, and that they based their conclusions regarding mitigation on those factors. <span class="Italic">See Belldina</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 499-500 (referring to the arbitrator's findings that the employee had 11 years of service and no prior disciplinary record, and that the agency failed to show that the employee was on notice that she could be disciplined for conduct at issue in the case); <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 50-51 (noting that the arbitrator had "set forth a number of factors that he considered supportive of his decision to mitigate the penalty," and that he had relied, in mitigating the penalty, on the agency's failure to give adequate weight to the fact that the absences for which the employee had been disciplined "occurred at a time when she was suffering from severe, medically-related emotional problems, some of which required medication and <span id="Page_1852"></span>hospitalization"); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305 (listing, among factors relevant to a penalty determination, the employee's "past work record, including length of service," the "clarity with which the employee was on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense," and "mitigating circumstances...such as...mental impairment"). Moreover, the administrative body that mitigated the removal at issue in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span> considered similarly appropriate factors in doing so. <span class="Italic">See Cuiffo</span>, 137 F. Supp. at 949-50 (referring to findings regarding the value of the agency property the employee had improperly taken for his own use and the fact that it was recovered without its having left the premises).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, it is clear that the penalties in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span>, <span class="Italic">Belldina</span>, and <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span> were not found inappropriate because of a failure to consider appropriate factors in deciding whether mitigation was appropriate. They were instead found inappropriate because the penalty was then "determined by accident," i.e., by reference to the length of time taken by the appeal or other administrative review process. <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span>, 137 F. Supp. at 950; <span class="Italic">See Belldina</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 501; <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. at 50. To the extent <span class="Italic">Cloutterbuck</span> and <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> are inconsistent with this reasoning, they are hereby overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in this case leaves no doubt that the unusual length of the suspension to which the arbitrator mitigated the appellant's removal was determined by reference to the time that had elapsed since that removal. In fact, the arbitrator appears to have relied on his analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors only as a basis for finding that the appellant was entitled to reinstatement in his former position. <span class="Italic">See</span> Arbitration Decision at 41; <span class="Italic">see id.</span> at 42 ("I am convinced that the grievant must be reinstated, for the reasons I have indicated above..."). After making this finding, he stated that the "question then becomes whether the grievant is entitled to back pay and benefits for the period of his termination." After finding that the appellant "did not vigorously pursue medical help until very late in his employment and after his termination," he concluded that the appellant's "conduct [made] it inappropriate to order back pay and benefits." We note further that the arbitrator did not even expressly characterize the period between the appellant's removal and his reinstatement as a suspension until after he was asked for clarification on that matter. Clarification at 3 (indicating that the parties' requests for clarification included "issues dealing with the nature of the period"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 4 (stating that the "period in question...should be considered an unpaid suspension," and acknowledging that "that term [did] not appear in the original Opinion and Award").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law pertaining to mitigation authority, and that his mitigation of the appellant's removal to a "time served" suspension of 20 months and 13 days is not entitled to deference. We defer, however, to his findings of fact concerning matters related to the mitigation issue, and to his conclusion that the evidence he addressed warranted mitigation of the appellant's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering this issue, we note that the unintentional nature of the appellant's misconduct, his performance record, the length of his service, the absence of any indication that he was disciplined during his first 25 years of employment, the arbitrator's finding concerning his rehabilitation potential, and--most important--the relationship the arbitrator found between the appellant's illness and his misconduct support a substantial mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bond v. Department of Energy</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 534, 543-45 (1999) (mitigating to a 60-day suspension a removal that was primarily based on sleeping on duty, when the employee had 9 years of federal service, was suffering from a medical condition that played a part in his misconduct, and had sought treatment and taken other steps indicating his rehabilitative potential); <span class="Italic">Roseman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 334, 345 (1997) (evidence that an employee's medical condition played a part in the charged conduct ordinarily is entitled to considerable weight as a mitigating factor). We also note that the appellant is not a supervisor, and that his offense does not appear to have endangered the safety of others. <span class="Italic">See Bond</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. at 544 (the Board considered the fact that the employee was not a supervisor and thus was not held to the higher standard of conduct to which a supervisor would be held); <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 14 M.S.P.R. 291, 294 (1983) (in denying a petition for review of an initial decision sustaining removal for sleeping on duty, the Board relied in part on evidence that the safety of others depended on the employee's attention to duty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, however, the appellant fell asleep on duty repeatedly; one of these instances occurred in front of students at the school at which he was employed; and, despite prior disciplinary actions and other efforts by the agency to encourage the appellant to seek medical attention, the appellant delayed in doing so. Under these circumstances, we find that a 120-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's misconduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Washington v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 195, 197, 200 (1987) (removal was a reasonable penalty for sleeping on duty, when that offense was preceded by progressive discipline for similar offenses).</p>

Admittedly, <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> is distinguishable from the instant appeal because it involved the Board's review of a non-Postal Service arbitration decision. However, <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> is still relevant to the present case because in it the Board revisited and expanded its prior holding in <span class="Italic">Montalvo</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the arbitrator erred in setting the penalty by happenstance, in that the arbitrator imposed a 13-month suspension because that was the length of time from the appellant's date of removal to the date that the agency reinstated him pursuant to the arbitrator's decision. The arbitrator was required to apply the same substantive rules as the Board in assessing the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Belldina,</span> 50 MSPR at 502. When the arbitrator's award is devoid of an indication that factors relevant to the penalty selection were considered under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, then the penalty is not entitled to deference, and the Board will perform the proper analysis. <span class="Italic">See Chandler,</span> 80 MSPR 542 &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the arbitrator performed a thorough <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis, as he was required to do. He found that the agency failed to give proper weight to the appellant's potential for rehabilitation. Therefore, he found, returning the appellant to work but with no back pay was the appropriate penalty.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Belldina</span>, the Board found that an arbitrator acted improperly in imposing a 435-day suspension. The Board found that the arbitrator imposed this punishment without articulation of a reasonable basis for the selection of the suspension period, because it was imposed by accident, rather than by a process of logical deliberation and decision. Instead, the length of the suspension was merely the difference between the effective date of the appellant's removal and the date of her reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Similarly, the length of the suspension here was determined by the difference between those two dates. Unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Belldina</span>, however, the arbitrator here did conduct a thorough <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis. Accordingly, we find no basis upon which to modify or set aside the arbitration decision.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's approach to time-served suspensions imposed by arbitrators is mixed. The result appears to depend, in a manner similar to the outcome of the Board appeals, on whether the duration of the suspension was the product of reasoned decisionmaking by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the law that arbitrators' decisions are reviewed in the same manner as MSPB decisions, the Federal Circuit approved what amounted to a time-served suspension in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2718 v. DOJ, INS</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 350-51 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The employee provided false information in the course of an investigation. The arbitrator mitigated the removal to a 15-day suspension. By the time of <span id="Page_1853"></span>the reinstatement order, the employee was off the payroll for six months. The arbitrator, who concluded that the employee's loss of pay was as much her fault as the agency's, reinstated her with the disciplinary suspension and with no back pay. The court determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the arbitrator's decision is not contrary to the Back Pay Act. Section 5596(b)(1)(A) states that an employee, "affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the [employee's] pay," is entitled "on correction of the personnel action" to receive back pay for the period for which the personnel action was in effect. That language is meant to cover a situation, for example, where the decisionmaker has <span class="Italic">reversed</span> an agency imposed removal or suspension action, precisely because the action was "unjustified or unwarranted." Plainly, the section does not cover the situation where the arbitrator has mitigated a removal, has found the employee as much responsible for the removal action as the agency, and has expressly denied back pay as part of the mitigated penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Implicit in McCullough's argument is that the arbitrator <span class="Italic">could</span> <span class="Italic">not</span> deny back pay for a period greater than that encompassed by the suspension. To adopt such a proposition would impair the arbitrator's broad discretion in fashioning a just award which takes account of the parties' mutual interests and conduct. In reviewing the Back Pay Act, and the legislative history cited by McCullough, we are unable to find any provision which precludes an arbitrator from denying back pay as part of a mitigated penalty, or which limits a denial of back pay to a period of suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stilley v. VA</span>, 225 Fed. Appx. 889, 890 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), sustained an arbitrator's award imposing a time-served suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Stilley argues that a "time-served" suspension is an inappropriate penalty. Under this court's precedents, however, an arbitrator may mitigate a removal penalty to a time-served disciplinary suspension without pay if the petitioner was "at least in part responsible for the removal action" and "some personnel action was justified." <span class="Italic">Ollett v. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 253 F.3d 692, 694 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">see also Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2718 v. Dep't of Justice, INS,</span> 768 F.2d 348, 351 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Because Ms. Stilley admitted at least some of the misconduct on which the initial removal action was based, the arbitrator acted within his discretion when he imposed the suspension as a mitigated penalty. Furthermore, while the arbitrator did not identify specific mitigating factors under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), he did consider in determining the appropriate sanction factors such as her twenty-four years of exemplary and discipline-free service and her willingness to admit her actions were wrong. Finally, to the extent decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board cited by Ms. Stilley, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Fulks v. Dep't of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228 (2005), may be seen as inconsistent with the governing law of this circuit, they of course do not affect the outcome of the case. Under the circumstances presented by this case, we cannot say that the arbitrator's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence or was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">Ollett,</span> 253 F.3d at 693.</p>

Cir. 2018), equating denial of backpay for several years for the union's laches in pursuing a removal grievance to a time-served suspension, remanded for reassessment of the penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator also limited Ms. Sihota's back pay award by over three years. Ms. Sihota contends the arbitrator's decision violated the Back Pay Act. The government argues we should uphold the arbitrator's reduction of Ms. Sihota's back pay as a mitigated penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act states that an employee "affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" is entitled to receive "an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred, less any amounts earned by the employee through other employment during that period." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i). An arbitrator, however, can deny or reduce back pay as a form of mitigated penalty. <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. of Gov. Emps., Local 2718 v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 350 (Fed. Cir. 1985). But if an arbitrator reduces back pay as a mitigated penalty, the period of withheld back pay is effectively a "time-served" suspension that must be reasonable under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Greenstreet v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 543 F.3d 705, 710 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">see Douglas v. Veterans Admin</span>., 5 M.S.P.B. 313, 332-33 (1981). The period of withheld back pay cannot be based only on the time served, since this "would make the penalty depend not on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors..., but on the speed with which (1) the employee or his representative handled the case, and (2) the tribunal rendered its decision." <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 710.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent the arbitrator limited back pay as a mitigated penalty, we find that his decision was arbitrary and capricious. To start, if the only charge before the arbitrator was under section 1203(b)(9), then the arbitrator had no authority to impose any mitigated penalty. And even if the arbitrator sustained an alternate charge, his decision to reduce Ms. Sihota's back pay by more than three years is still unsupported by any analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. The arbitrator found a ten calendar day suspension was reasonable given Ms. Sihota's "long twenty-five year history [and] the absence of any other documented disciplinary actions, other than three in some twenty-five years." Nothing in the arbitrator's decision supports what is effectively a three year "time-served" suspension, and the arbitrator never considered whether such a penalty is "within the parameters of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 333. As a result, even if the arbitrator's reduction of back pay was a mitigated penalty, we find that reducing back pay by over three years is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the arbitrator's reliance on the doctrine of laches was legal error. Laches "bars a plaintiff from maintaining a suit if he unreasonably delays in filing a suit and as a result harms the defendant." <span class="Italic">Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan</span>, 536 U.S. 101, 121 (2002). "Laches requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense." <span class="Italic">Costello v. United States</span>, 365 U.S. 265, 282 (1961). Notably, "[t]he bar of laches [is] predicated on the prejudice to a defendant's case from the tardy entry of a prayer for compensation." <span class="Italic">Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody</span>, 422 U.S. 405, 440 (1975) (Marshall, J. concurring). "The lapse of time carries with it the memory and life of witnesses, the muniments of evidence, and other means of proof." <span class="Italic">Costello</span>, 365 U.S. at 282 (quoting <span class="Italic">Brown v. Cty. of Buena Vista</span>, 95 U.S. 157, 161 (1877)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator misapplied the doctrine of laches here. As the Supreme Court observed in <span class="Italic">Costello</span>, laches bars a claim where the plaintiff's lack of diligence prejudices the defendant's access to witnesses and other evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Laches does not reduce monetary damages that accrue while a dispute is pending. Even if laches were applicable, the arbitrator made no findings to suggest the IRS was prejudiced by the Union's delay. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (refusing to apply laches where a 27-year delay did not prejudice petitioner's access to evidence). For instance, the arbitrator did not find that witnesses became unavailable or evidence was lost. Instead, the arbitrator simply stated the IRS should not be liable for three years of back pay because the Union failed to schedule a hearing. To be sure, the Union's three year delay is inexplicable and might have barred Ms. Sihota's claim altogether if the IRS could show prejudice. Nevertheless, after allowing Ms. Sihota's claim to proceed, the arbitrator cannot rely on laches to reduce her back pay. On remand, the arbitrator may reduce back pay as a mitigated penalty if he sustains any alternate charges. Any reduction, however, must be within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ollett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 253 F.3d 692, 694-95 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (remanded again after a second arbitration award denying back pay, <span class="Italic">Ollett v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3001)), remanded a case to an arbitrator for clarification of whether an award directing reinstatement without back pay was intended as a mitigated penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) requires an award of back pay in a situation where the personnel action was entirely unjustified or unwarranted. If, however, the arbitrator finds that some form of personnel action was justified and warranted but that the particular penalty was unjustified or unwarranted, the arbitrator may mitigate the penalty, for example, from removal to suspension. Under these circumstances, an award of back pay is not required by the statute. <span class="Italic">Am. Fedn,</span> 768 F.2d at 350-51 (stating that &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) was intended for a situation "where the decisionmaker has <span class="Italic">reversed</span> an agency imposed removal or suspension action, precisely because the action was 'unjustified or unwarranted.' Plainly the section does not cover a situation where the arbitrator has mitigated a removal, has found the employee as much responsible for the removal action as the agency and has expressly denied back pay as part of a mitigated penalty.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, we upheld an arbitrator's decision denying back pay to an Immigration and Naturalization Service clerk who was found to be involved in a marriage fraud scheme. The arbitrator in that case determined that, although the grievant's actions did not rise to the level requiring removal, her actions nonetheless were dishonest and she had not cooperated fully with the investigation. Therefore, instead of sustaining the removal, the arbitrator reduced the grievant's penalty to a fifteen day suspension and denied her back pay for the remaining period that she was out of work. The arbitrator determined that "the fact that [the grievant] suffered over six months loss of income is as much attributable to her as it is to the Agency's erroneous conclusion of law. For that reason, the [arbitrator] cannot award [the grievant] any back pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 350. Because the arbitrator's decision was grounded in the finding that the grievant was at least in part responsible for the removal action and some personnel action was justified, we upheld the denial of back pay under &#x00A7; 5596. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 351.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the arbitrator reversed the agency's removal action. After finding that Mr. Ollett did not pose a threat to national security and that the incident that led to the charge against him would have no effect on his ability to perform his job, the arbitrator concluded that Mr. Ollett's <span id="Page_1854"></span>removal "was not for just cause [and] was [not] in the interest and efficiency of the service." In reversing the removal action, the arbitrator determined that Mr. Ollett was eligible to be reinstated to his former position. However, the arbitrator stated that because Mr. Ollett "does not now possess the required security clearance to work on that job, reinstatement to his former position cannot be granted as a remedy." The arbitrator continued: "In the event that [Mr. Ollett's] security clearance is reinstated by the Air Force board, he is entitled to resume his former duties." The arbitrator concluded his decision with the statement that "[I]n any event, [Mr. Ollett] is hot entitled to back pay or benefits."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator determined that Mr. Ollett's removal "was not for just cause [and] was [not] in the interest and efficiency of the service." In view of this determination, the statement in <span class="Italic">American Federation</span> that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) was intended to cover the situation "where the decisionmaker has <span class="Italic">reversed</span> an agency imposed removal or suspension action, precisely because the action was 'unjustified or unwarranted"' would seem to apply. The reversal of an unjustified removal by an arbitrator entitles a grievant to an award of back pay. On the other hand, the decision before us includes statements of the arbitrator's opinion that Mr. Ollett "exercised dreadfully poor judgment in his actions" and that Mr. Ollett's "lapse of judgment was so great that it overshadowed the otherwise good work record." These statements, as well as the arbitrator's conclusion that, "[I]n any event, the Grievant is not entitled to back pay or benefits," indicate that perhaps the arbitrator intended to mitigate the penalty of removal rather than to find that no penalty was appropriate. A complicating factor in the case is the fact that, at the time of the arbitrators decision, proceedings relating to the revocation of Mr. Ollett's security clearance were pending.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, having reviewed the arbitrator's decision, it is not clear to us whether the arbitrator declined to award back pay (i) because he incorrectly believed the statute allowed him to do so even if no personnel actions were justified or warranted; (ii) because he believed he was not empowered to do so in view of the revocation of the security clearance (which meant that Mr. Ollett could not be reinstated to his previous position); or (iii) because, in the context of a mitigation action, it was his intention not to award back pay (which, in view of the absence of findings like those in <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, however, is inconsistent with his statement that Mr. Ollett's removal was not for just cause). Only if the arbitrator made a finding of fault on Mr. Ollett's part which would justify a mitigated penalty could he properly deny back pay. Under these circumstances, we believe that the appropriate course is for us to remand the case to the arbitrator for clarification on the issue of back pay in light of applicable law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(l)(A)(i); <span class="Italic">Am. Fedn</span>, 768 F.2d at 351. Accordingly, the arbitrator's decision is vacated. The case is remanded to the arbitrator for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Greenstreet v. SSA</span>, 543 F.3d 705, 706-10 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Federal Circuit criticized use of a time-served suspension in arbitration, while allowing for the possibility that a suspension of that nature could be sustained based upon an articulated, convincing rationale by an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we are called upon to determine whether a "time served" disciplinary suspension is arbitrary. Petitioner Lance Greenstreet ("Greenstreet") was terminated from his position at the Social Security Administration ("SSA"). In a written decision issued 342 days after Greenstreet's termination, an arbitrator concluded that termination was an excessive penalty and ordered Greenstreet reinstated without back pay. <span class="Italic">In re Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees (AFGE) Local 1923,</span> Case No. BW-2007-R-0006, slip op. at 22-23 (July 5, 2007) ("<span class="Italic">Arbitrator's Decision</span>"). Greenstreet petitions for review of that decision, claiming that the effect of the arbitrator's decision was a 342-day "time served" suspension, the length of which was arbitrarily determined by the time that the arbitrator took to issue a decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the length of a suspension is arbitrary when it is based solely on the employee's "time served," we vacate the determination of the arbitrator in part, and remand for consideration of the appropriate length of Greenstreet's suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Greenstreet was an IT Specialist in the SSA's Division of Integration and Environmental Testing, where he had worked for eleven years. On March 15, 2006, in an apparently isolated outburst, Greenstreet damaged a computer and other office equipment. As a result of this outburst, Greenstreet was first placed on administrative leave and later terminated, effective July 28, 2006.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Greenstreet's union filed a grievance challenging the termination and requesting that Greenstreet be reinstated and granted back pay, leave, and benefits. The union also invoked the arbitration clause of its collective bargaining agreement, and the case was heard by an arbitrator on April 10, 2007. During the arbitration, Greenstreet conceded that his conduct was improper and that it warranted a "substantial suspension." Greenstreet argued, however, that termination was too severe a penalty. The parties agreed that the issues to be decided by the arbitrator were: "Was the discharge of [Greenstreet] for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service? If not, what should be the remedy?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 5, 2007, the arbitrator issued a decision granting Greenstreet's grievance in part. The arbitrator evaluated whether termination was an appropriate penalty, applying the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 303-08 (1981). The arbitrator concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, for the reasons set out above--noting, particularly, the absence of prior discipline, the restitution made for the damaged property, the Grievant's satisfactory work performance, and the Agency's failure to adequately consider Grievant's potential for rehabilitation, I conclude that the Grievant's termination exceeds the limits of reasonableness as required by the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and that a substantial suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty for the Grievant's misconduct and for the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator accordingly ordered, "The Grievance is granted, in part. The Grievant shall be reinstated without back pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Greenstreet timely petitioned for review of the arbitrator's decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7703(a)(1) and (b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), we review decisions of an arbitrator in a negotiated grievance proceeding "in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board." <span class="Italic">See also Cornelius v. Nutt,</span> 472 U.S. 648, 661 n.16 (1985). Thus, we "review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions" that we find to be:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;unsupported by substantial evidence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the arbitrator in this case did not expressly describe his award as imposing a "time served" suspension, that is precisely what the award did. By mitigating Greenstreet's termination to reinstatement without back pay, the arbitrator effectively converted Greenstreet's penalty to a suspension without pay for 342 days--from July 28, 2006 (the date that Greenstreet was terminated) to July 5, 2007 (the date of the arbitrator's decision). Neither party disputes that the arbitrator effectively imposed a 342-day "time served" disciplinary suspension. Greenstreet argues that a "time served" suspension is inherently arbitrary and capricious, because it is based solely on the length of time that elapses between the date of the termination and the date of the arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our predecessor court first addressed "time served" suspensions in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo v. United States,</span> 131 Ct. Cl. 60 (1955). John Cuiffo was a blocker and bracer at the New York Port of Embarkation in Brooklyn, who was terminated for taking from his worksite lumber that he believed had been discarded. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 61-62. Cuiffo appealed to a grievance review board, which recommended that he be reinstated as of the date of the board's decision, but that "the intervening period from his removal to his restoration be regarded as a non-pay status and just punishment for his attempt to remove Government property without proper authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 63. As a result, Cuiffo received in effect a "suspension without pay for 320 days"--the time that it took for his appeal to be resolved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Claims set aside the suspension as "arbitrary and unfair." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 70. The court found two problems with the suspension: (1) that it was "out of all proportion to the offense"; and (2) that it was "determined by accident." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 68, 69. Specifically, the court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We think that plaintiff's punishment was determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision. We have no doubt that, had the Review Board reached the plaintiff's case within 10 days or 30 days after his removal, they would have nullified his removal, as they did, and would have ordered his immediate reinstatement. But the Board did not reach the case for several months, and after it and the Acting Chief of Transportation had acted, the agency did not get around to reinstating the plaintiff for several more months. This casual attitude toward the livelihood of a working man, found by the Review Board to be "a veteran of World War I, 55 years of age, who enjoyed an enviable record at the port" and having "a good reputation for honesty, sobriety, integrity and veracity" was a complete departure from fair dealing and tolerable personnel policy. We think it was so arbitrary and unfair that it should be set aside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 69-70. <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span> did not expressly hold that any "time served" suspension is necessarily arbitrary. Rather, the court reasoned that Cuiffo's <span id="Page_1855"></span>"time served" suspension was "arbitrary and unfair" because it was solely "determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Cuiffo,</span> the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") has consistently and repeatedly held that mitigating a termination to a "time served" suspension--without articulating a basis for the length of the suspension--is inherently arbitrary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fulks v. Dep't of Def.,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 228, 239 (2005) (holding that arbitrator "erred as a matter of law in interpreting civil service law pertaining to mitigation authority, and that his mitigation of the appellant's removal to a 'time served' suspension of 20 months and 13 days is not entitled to deference"); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 14 M.S.P.R. 61, 65 (1982) (rejecting mitigation of removal to 164-day "time served" suspension when "the presiding official offered no reasonable basis for such penalty"); <span class="Italic">Morris v. Naval Weapons Support Ctr.,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 31, 34 (1981) (rejecting 162-day "time served" suspension because "the presiding official in this instance did not articulate a reasonable basis" for the length of the suspension); <span class="Italic">Belldina v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 497, 501 (1991) (rejecting arbitrator's imposition of a 435-day "time served" suspension, because length of suspension was not based on analysis of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and arbitrator had "articulated no reasonable basis for the selection of such a suspension period"); <span class="Italic">see also Fulks,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. at 237-39 (collecting MSPB cases following <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA makes no attempt to distinguish this long line of MSPB cases. Instead, the SSA simply points out (correctly) that we are not bound by the decisions of the MSPB. Nevertheless, we proceed with caution when asked to depart from twenty-five years of MSPB precedent, particularly since the express purpose for judicial review of arbitrators' decisions in the negotiated grievance context is to bring those decisions into conformity with the decisions of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius,</span> 472 U.S. at 661 n.16 ("Congress made arbitral decisions subject to judicial review in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board, expressly to assure conformity between the decisions of arbitrators with those of the Merit Systems Protection Board." (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The SSA instead relies on decisions of this court under the Back Pay Act to support its argument that "time served" penalties are not arbitrary. Under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i), an employee who has been "affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action" is entitled to receive back pay when the action has been corrected. In the first of the two cases that the SSA cites--<span class="Italic">American Federation</span>--an employee appealed his termination to an arbitrator, who mitigated the termination to a suspension without back pay. <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 2718 v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 768 F.2d 348, 350 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The employee argued on appeal that he was entitled to back pay under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court disagreed, reasoning that, because the arbitrator expressly found that the employee had not "acted honestly and with integrity," the employee's suspension was not "unjustified or unwarranted" within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 350-51. The court did not, however, hold that a suspension determined solely by "time served" is not arbitrary; to the contrary, the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">American Federation</span> expressly considered the employee's misconduct and concluded that the test articulated in the Back Pay Act had not been met, and that suspension without back pay was warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ollett v. Department of the Air Force</span>--the second case that the SSA cites--an arbitrator similarly mitigated an employee's removal to suspension and denied back pay. 253 F.3d 692, 693 (Fed. Cir. 2001). On appeal, the court was unable to discern from the arbitrator's decision the basis on which back pay was denied, and it therefore remanded for further findings, so that the arbitrator could determine whether the denial of back pay was inconsistent with the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 695. Like <span class="Italic">American Federation,</span> <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> did not involve an arbitrariness challenge to the length of a suspension. Thus, neither <span class="Italic">American Federation</span> nor <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> holds that the length of a suspension can be determined solely on the basis of "time served."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the SSA relies on the persuasiveness of this court's nonprecedential decision in <span class="Italic">Stilley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 225 Fed. Appx. 889 (Fed. Cir. 2007), to support the arbitrator's decision. In <span class="Italic">Stilley,</span> a Department of Veterans Affairs nurse was terminated for improperly ordering laboratory tests for herself and providing fraudulent documentation to excuse absences. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 889. An arbitrator mitigated the penalty to a "time served" suspension, because the terminated employee had not been permitted to have a union representative present during questioning concerning her misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 890. On appeal, relying on the MSPB's decision in <span class="Italic">Fulks,</span> Stilley argued "that a 'time-served' suspension is an inappropriate penalty." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> panel rejected this argument and affirmed the arbitrator's imposition of a "time served" suspension, relying on <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> and <span class="Italic">American Federation.</span> <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find the SSA's reliance on <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> persuasive, for several reasons. First, in <span class="Italic">Stilley,</span> the arbitrator expressly considered "factors such as [Stilley's] twenty-four years of exemplary and discipline-free service and her willingness to admit her actions were wrong" in setting the length of her suspension. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The arbitrator in this case made no such findings concerning the appropriateness of the length of Greenstreet's suspension. Second, Stilley did not challenge the length of her suspension as arbitrary because it was based solely on "time served." Instead, the Stilley panel characterized Stilley's argument as one that her "time served" suspension was an "inappropriate"--i.e., disproportionate--penalty. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> By contrast, Greenstreet squarely argues that his suspension was arbitrary in length because it was based solely on "time served." Finally, because the <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> panel cites and relies on this court's Back Pay Act decisions in <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> and <span class="Italic">American Federation,</span> the panel understood Stilley's argument to be premised on the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Here, however, Greenstreet's argument is not based on the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Cuiffo,</span> consistent with the holdings of the MSPB, is sound and hold that the length of a suspension is arbitrary when it is based solely on the suspended employee's "time served" awaiting decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fulks,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. at 239. As the Court of Claims made clear in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo,</span> "punishment...determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision" is inherently arbitrary. <span class="Italic">Cuiffo,</span> 131 Ct. Cl. at 69. There are many factors that a reviewing authority may and should take into account when determining the appropriate length of an employee's suspension. <span class="Italic">See Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. at 303-08. But it may not set the length of a suspension based solely on the time that it takes the reviewing authority to reach a decision. To permit the length of a suspension to be based solely on "time served" would make the penalty depend not on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, which reflect the individual employee's particular situation, but on the speed with which (1) the employee or his representative handled the case, and (2) the tribunal rendered its decision. Our holding should not be read to foreclose a reasoned decision of suspension based on a proper application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors simply because it may be coincident with or nearly coincident with "time served." We make no such artificial rule. Instead, we hold only that the length of a suspension is arbitrary when it is based solely on the employee's "time served."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the arbitrator based the length of Greenstreet's suspension solely on "time served." Although the arbitrator conducted an analysis under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, his analysis was directed entirely to whether termination was an appropriate penalty. The arbitrator's opinion contains no findings or analysis concerning the appropriate length of Greenstreet's suspension. The arbitrator's imposition of a "time served" suspension is therefore arbitrary and must be vacated. Neither party has asserted that the arbitrator erred by concluding that termination was not an appropriate remedy; that aspect of the arbitrator's determination is therefore affirmed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we <span class="Italic">vacate</span> the arbitrator's decision in part, and <span class="Italic">remand</span> for consideration of the appropriate length of Greenstreet's suspension under <span class="Italic">Douglas.</span> In all other respects, the arbitrator's decision is <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, <span class="Italic">Borza v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1873.Opinion.5-29-2019.pdf">774 Fed. Appx. 653</a>, 655-56 (Fed. Cir. 2019 NP), remanded for redetermination of the penalty what amounted to a time-served suspension when the arbitrator referenced a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis but did not explain how he determined the duration of the suspension substituted for a removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal concerns whether the arbitrator imposed a time-served suspension solely based on the time elapsed between Ms. Borza's removal and her reinstatement. Our decision in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet v. Social Security Administration</span>, 543 F.3d 705 (Fed. Cir. 2008) controls our decision here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In all legally-relevant respects, the facts of <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span> are virtually indistinguishable from the facts of this case. Mr. Greenstreet, an IT specialist for the Social Security Administration, damaged a computer and other office equipment in an isolated outburst. <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 706. As a result, Mr. Greenstreet was placed on administrative leave and then terminated. Mr. Greenstreet's union subsequently filed a grievance challenging the termination and invoked the arbitration clause of its collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The arbitrator issued his decision roughly three months after hearing the case, concluding that Mr. Greenstreet's termination was unreasonable in view of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and ordering that Mr. Greenstreet be immediately reinstated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, this court concluded that "[b]y mitigating Greenstreet's termination to reinstatement without backpay, the arbitrator effectively converted Greenstreet's penalty to a suspension without pay for 342 days." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 707. The court then held that "the length of a suspension is arbitrary when it is based solely on the suspended employee's 'time served' awaiting decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 709. We therefore vacated the arbitrator's decision and remanded for consideration of the appropriate length of suspension based on the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 710.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government attempts to distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>. <span id="Page_1856"></span>It argues that unlike the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, here, the arbitrator actually performed a <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor analysis to determine that extended suspension was a reasonable punishment for the misconduct. For support, the government focuses on the portion of the arbitrator's decision that addresses the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and then states that "<span class="Italic">[i]n view of the foregoing</span>, the disciplinary action of extended suspension,...<span class="Italic">based on the entire record</span> in this matter, appears to be reasonable punishment." J.A. 35 (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the arbitrator applied the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine that suspension (as opposed to termination) was the appropriate penalty. But <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span> requires more. To be sure, <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span> dictates that the arbitrator must also provide a reasoned and principled analysis as to the appropriate length of that suspension. 543 F.3d at 710. The arbitrator's analysis in this case undeniably falls short of this requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That said, the government's argument that Ms. Borza's 561-day suspension is commensurate with the penalty applicable to an employee who received an overpayment of 900 hours for time she claimed but did not work on at least 564 different occasions, carries some force. As the government noted, "the arbitrator may come back, and he may say, 'she stole time on 564 occasions, leading to 900 hours, I think the penalty of one day per occasion is appropriate'...so we may end up right [where] we are with the exact same suspension." Moreover, as we have said previously, our holding in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span> "should not be read to foreclose a reasoned decision of suspension based on a proper application of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors simply because it may be coincident with or nearly coincident with 'time served.'" <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 710.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, a gap exists in the arbitrator's reasoning, and it should not be minimized. Simply concluding, without explanation, that 561 days is the appropriate length for Ms. Borza's suspension is inadequate. She is entitled to know why.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the arbitrator's decision that suspension, rather than termination, is the appropriate remedy for Ms. Borza's misconduct. We vacate, however, the arbitrator's decision in all other respects and remand for a principled analysis of the appropriate length of Ms. Borza's suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The mixed review of the Board and Federal Circuit of time-served suspensions was applied by the Board in <span class="Italic">Davis v. SSA</span>, CB-7121-14-0015-V-1 (NP 8/21/2014), attempting--not particularly successfully, and without substantive guidance to arbitrators--to harmonize the decisions on the subject as the Board revised a time-serve suspension from over 400 days to 120 days based on a charge of misuse of the employee's position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her request for review, the appellant asserts that the Board should not defer to the penalty ordered by the arbitrator because he failed to explain how he arrived at the penalty imposed, i.e., a time-served suspension. Our reviewing court's predecessor, the Court of Claims, first addressed time-served suspensions in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo v. United States</span>, 137 F. Supp. 944 (Ct. Cl. 1955). There, the court set aside Mr. Cuiffo's time-served suspension as "arbitrary and unfair" because it was "determined by accident, and not by a process of logical deliberation and decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 950. Relying on <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span>, the Board and its reviewing court have held that mitigating a removal to a time-served suspension without articulating a basis for the length of the suspension is inherently arbitrary, and that the arbitrary penalty is not entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Greenstreet v. Social Security Administration</span>, 543 F.3d 705, 707-10 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Fulks v. Department of Defense</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23, 29 (2005); <span class="Italic">Belldina v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 497, 501-02 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, who suffered from narcolepsy, was removed from his position as an Education Technologist at a high school for sleeping while on duty and failing to follow established leave procedures, resulting in his being absent without leave. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 2. The arbitrator found that Mr. Fulks should be reinstated as of the date of his decision, thereby effectively mitigating the removal to a time served suspension of 20 months and 13 days. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 22. On review, the Board noted that in <span class="Italic">Cuiffo, Belldina</span>, and <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 48, 50-51 (1991), the Court of Claims and the Board had found time-served suspensions inappropriate because the penalty in those cases was determined by accident, i.e., by reference to the length of time taken by the appeal or other administrative review process. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 27. The Board found that the arbitrator's mitigation of Mr. Fulks's removal to a time-served suspension was not entitled to deference because the record "le[ft] no doubt that the unusual length of the suspension to which the arbitrator mitigated the appellant's removal was determined by reference to the time that had elapsed since that removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29. In particular, the Board found that the arbitrator appeared to have relied on his analysis of the factors for determining the appropriateness of a penalty set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981), only as a basis for finding that Mr. Fulks was entitled to reinstatement in his former position. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 28. The Board found, however, that the arbitrator's decision that mitigation was warranted was entitled to deference, and it mitigated the penalty to a 120-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29, 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, the petitioner was terminated from his position as an Information Technology Specialist with the Social Security Administration for damaging a computer and other office equipment in an apparently isolated outburst. <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 706. Mr. Greenstreet conceded that his conduct had been improper but argued that termination was too severe a penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Applying the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the arbitrator found that termination was an excessive penalty and ordered Mr. Greenstreet reinstated without back pay, thereby effectively mitigating the termination to a time-served suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit vacated the arbitrator's imposition of a time-served suspension, finding that the length of the suspension was arbitrary because it was based solely on time served. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 710. In that regard, the court noted that, although the arbitrator conducted an analysis under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, his analysis was directed entirely toward whether termination was an appropriate penalty, and his opinion contained no findings or analysis concerning the appropriate length of Mr. Greenstreet's suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded, "[T]he reasoning of <span class="Italic">Cuiffo</span>, consistent with the holdings of the MSPB, is sound and [we] hold that the length of a suspension is arbitrary when it is based solely on the suspended employee's 'time served' awaiting decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. at 239).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In opposition to the appellant's request for review, the agency asserts that the appellant "principally relies" upon <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> to support her argument that the time-served suspension imposed by the arbitrator is not entitled to deference. The agency contends that <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> is distinguishable from the present matter for two reasons. First, the agency asserts that, in <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> there was a relationship between the appellant's illness and his misconduct, whereas the appellant in this case "has no excuse of medical issues for her admitted actions, her misconduct is not one that could be avoided through medical intervention, and there was no external force, such as a medical issue, that would mitigate the penalty." Second, the agency contends that the arbitrator's analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in the present appeal was much more extensive than the arbitrator's analysis of those factors in <span class="Italic">Fulks. Id</span>. at 10-12. In particular, the agency asserts that the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> considered only five of the twelve <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors; however, in this case, the arbitrator considered all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find these arguments unpersuasive. Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the factual distinctions between <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> and this case support the agency's apparent argument that the appellant should receive a more severe penalty than Mr. Fulks, those distinctions have no bearing on the issue of whether the arbitrator's chosen penalty of a time-served suspension is arbitrary and, thus, not entitled to deference. Moreover, contrary to the agency's apparent assertion on review, the Board in <span class="Italic">Fulks</span> did not find the penalty of a time-served suspension inappropriate because the arbitrator's analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors was inadequate. <span class="Italic">See Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6; 27 (explaining that the Board and the Court of Claims had not found time-served suspensions inappropriate because of a failure to consider appropriate factors in deciding whether mitigation was appropriate). Rather, the Board found that the imposition of a time-served suspension was inappropriate because the penalty was "determined by accident" insofar as the length of the suspension was determined by reference to the time that had elapsed since the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Fulks</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 228, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument that the time-served suspension at issue in this case is not arbitrary, the agency also relies on our reviewing court's nonprecedential decision in <span class="Italic">Stilley v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 225 F. App'x 889, 890 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In that case, an arbitrator mitigated Ms. Stilley's removal penalty to a time-served suspension because she had not been permitted to have a union representative present during questioning concerning her misconduct. <span class="Italic">Stilley</span>, 225 Fed. App'x at 890. On appeal, the panel in <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> rejected Ms. Stilley's argument that "a 'time-served' suspension is an inappropriate penalty" and affirmed the arbitrator's imposition of a time-served suspension, relying on the Federal Circuit's Back Pay Act decisions in <span class="Italic">Ollett v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 253 F.3d 692, 693 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2718 v. Department of Justice</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 350 (Fed. Cir. 1985).[6] <span class="Italic">Stilley</span>, 225 Fed. App'x at 890.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In both <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> and <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, an arbitrator mitigated an employee's termination or removal to a suspension and denied back pay. <span class="Italic">Ollett</span>, 253 F.3d at 693; <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, 768 F.2d at 350. On appeal to the Federal Circuit, each of these employees claimed that he was entitled to back pay pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Back Pay Act, which provides that an employee who has been subjected to an unwarranted and unjustified action is entitled to back pay. <span class="Italic">See Ollett</span>, 253 F.3d at 693; <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, 768 F.2d at 350. As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, neither of these cases involved an arbitrariness challenge to the length of the suspension, <span id="Page_1857"></span>and neither case holds that the length of a suspension can be determined solely on the basis of "time served." <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 709.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, our reviewing court rejected the agency's argument that the time-served suspension at issue in that case should be upheld pursuant to <span class="Italic">Stilley</span>. <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, 543 F.3d at 709. The court found that the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> was not persuasive for various reasons, including the following: unlike Mr. Greenstreet, who argued that his suspension was arbitrary in length because it was solely based on time served, Ms. Stilley argued that her time-served suspension was an inappropriate, i.e., disproportionate, penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the court found, because the <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> panel cited and relied on the court's Back Pay Act decisions in <span class="Italic">Ollett</span> and <span class="Italic">American Federation</span>, the panel understood Ms. Stilley's argument to be premised on the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. By contrast, the court noted, Mr. Greenstreet's argument was not based on the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The aforementioned reasons cited by the court in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span> for finding the agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> unpersuasive also apply here. As in <span class="Italic">Greenstreet</span>, the appellant in this case argues that her suspension is arbitrary because it was solely based on the time served; she does not claim that the time-served suspension is a disproportionate penalty for her misconduct. Further, the appellant's argument is not based on the Back Pay Act, i.e., she is not contending that she is entitled to back pay because she was subjected to an unwarranted action. Thus, the agency's argument regarding <span class="Italic">Stilley</span> is unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, and in light of the precedent discussed above, we agree with the appellant that the suspension imposed by the arbitrator is arbitrary. The unusual length of the suspension in this case was determined by accident as it was based on the length of the arbitration proceedings and the amount of time it took the agency to reinstate the appellant to her position following those proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Cuiffo</span>, 137 F. Supp. at 950 (finding that the length of a suspension ordered by a grievance review board was arbitrary and unfair, in part because it was dependent on the amount of time it took the agency to "get around to reinstating" the employee). Accordingly, we do not defer to the penalty ordered by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">We defer to the arbitrator's judgment to mitigate the appellant's removal to a lengthy suspension.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We defer, however, to the arbitrator's conclusion that the evidence presented in this case warrants mitigation of the appellant's removal. As discussed above, the arbitration decision reflects that the arbitrator weighed the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including numerous mitigating factors such as the appellant's lengthy service, satisfactory work record, remorse for her actions and potential for rehabilitation, and the lack of notoriety of the offense. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 303-08.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the arbitrator found, however, "the offense was a very serious matter involving the elements of public trust, honesty, reputation of the agency, and conformance to agency policies." Further, the appellant's misconduct directly related to her duties, position, and responsibilities. In addition, the appellant had prior discipline for misuse of a government credit card, which also implicated the appellant's trustworthiness. Under these circumstances, we find that a 120-day suspension is the maximum reasonable penalty for the appellant's misconduct.</p>
