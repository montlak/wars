<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-115"><span class="space">4.</span> State Law Defines Marital Status; Common Law Marriage; Qualifying Widow</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">State law controls the marital status of the claimant seeking a survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">Slate v. OPM</span>, 10 MSPR 658, 659 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official concluded that appellant was not a widow within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(aXD, since she had not been married to the decedent for at least one year immediately before his death and there was no issue by that marriage. The presiding official, noting that OPM consults state law in order to define those terms not settled by federal statute, held that the law of the state of Hawaii, where the Slates had resided, does not recognize common-law marriages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, appellant argues that a recent Hawaii state court decision recognized the doctrine of common-law marriage in that state, and therefore she is entitled to a survivor's annuity. However, we find appellant's argument to be without merit. The unpublished decision cited by appellant, <span class="Italic">Artiss v. Artiss,</span> Civil No. 58973, 1st Circuit, Hawaii, merely recognizes property rights for couples living together without the benefit of marriage, and cannot be interpreted as recognizing common-law marriage. Therefore, appellant has not shown that she was married to the decedent for at least one year prior to his death, under the laws of Hawaii. Accordingly, we find that appellant is not entitled to a survivor's annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A claim to common law marriage is assessed under state law for purposes of determining the duration of the marriage for a claimant to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldbach v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 57 (1989) (considering state court judicial order recognizing the appellant's common law marriage). For a widow or widower to receive death benefits under 5 USC 8442(b)(1), the marriage must have lasted an aggregate of nine months. In <span class="Italic">Charmack v. OPM</span>, 93 MSPR 667 (2003), the Board determined that the appellant did not establish a common law marriage to qualify for the statutory death benefits under 5 USC 8442(b)(1). The Board examined the law of the state of the couple's principal domicile as well as the law of other jurisdictions that they had lived in for short periods. <span class="Italic">See Donati v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 30, 2006 MSPB 321 (2006) (Member Rose dissenting) (awarding survivor annuity based on state law recognition, after death, of common law marriage in existence for three years), <span class="Italic">stay granted,</span> <span class="Italic">Donati v. OPM</span>, 2007 MSPB 44, 104 MSPR 658 (2007), <span class="Italic">rev'd on reconsideration,</span> <span class="Italic">Donati v. OPM</span>, 106 MSPR 508, 2007 MSPB 204 (2007) (determining that state law did not create a retroactive common law marriage status); <span class="Italic">Huizar v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 256, 259 (1984) (recognizing legitimacy of common law marriage under Texas law; not a "deathbed marriage" that the duration of marriage provision of 5 USC 8341(a)(1) was designed to avoid).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beckett v. OPM</span>, DC-0831-13-0639-I-1 (NP 7/7/2014), considered the impact of the law of the state of residence, not generally recognizing common law marriage, on the law of another state where a common law marriage allegedly occurred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "marriage," for FERS death benefits purposes, means a marriage recognized in law or equity under the whole law of the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the marital status of the employee. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. Here, the decedent resided in Virginia prior to his death, therefore, we find Virginia to be the state with the most significant interest and analyze the appellant's claims under Virginia law.[2] The appellant and the decedent were ceremonially married on July 17, 2011. The appellant alleged that in July 2010, the appellant and decedent entered into a common law marriage on a vacation to Montana, a state which recognizes common law marriage. The state of Virginia does not recognize common law marriages. <span class="Italic">Offield v. Davis</span>, 40 S.E. 910, 914 (Va. 1902). However, the state of Virginia does recognize the validity of a common law marriage that was valid under the laws of the state where the common law marriage was created. <span class="Italic">Farah v. Farah</span>, 429 S.E.2d 626, 629 (Va. Ct. App. 1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the administrative judge found the appellant's state of residence to be the state with the most significant interest, contrary to the language of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 843.102. However, the administrative judge noted that her decision would have been the same if she relied on Virginia law. We modify the initial decision to the extent that it applied Maryland law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Montana law, to establish a common law marriage, the party asserting the marriage existed must prove that: (1) the parties were competent to enter into a marriage; (2) the parties assumed a marital relationship by mutual consent and agreement; and (3) the parties confirmed their marriage by cohabitation and public repute. <span class="Italic">In re Estate of Ober</span>, 62 P.3d 1114, 1115 (Mont. 2003). The elements must all take place immediately; the marriage cannot be created piecemeal over time. <span class="Italic">In re Estate of Sartain</span>, 686 P.2d 909, 912 (Mont. 1984). The administrative judge found the appellant did not prove that she and the decedent entered into a common law marriage in Montana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in her petition for review that the administrative judge made errors in not finding a common law marriage, including when she considered the appellant's maintenance of a residence in Maryland, that the appellant did not receive wedding gifts, and that the appellant had not applied for other survivor benefits. The appellant states that she and the decedent lived together, but she submitted affidavits from others that reflected she and the decedent had two residences for the time period referenced in the affidavits. The administrative judge did reference that no gifts were exchanged in Montana, but we do not find that she considered the lack of gifts in determining whether the parties were married; instead, the administrative judge focused on the fact that the decedent's parents did not refer to the appellant as their son's wife. The appellant states that she is not eligible to apply for survivor benefits <span id="Page_4247"></span>with Social Security due to her age and because the decedent's military survivor annuity was left to the decedent's former spouse. The appellant's eligibility for other survivor annuities is not relevant to our determination as to whether the appellant entered into a common law marriage in Montana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's evidence does not support her claim that she entered into a common law marriage in July 2010. The appellant argues that the domestic partnership affidavit she filed was necessary to allow her to care for the decedent under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). If the decedent was the appellant's common law spouse, this form would not be necessary as the FMLA's regulations define spouse to include common law spouses if recognized under state law.[3] 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 825.122(b). We also note that the affidavit signed by the appellant includes a specific certification that stated she was not married to anyone. Therefore, the domestic partnership affidavit does not support the appellant's argument that she entered into a common law marriage with the decedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Because the appellant maintained a residence in Maryland, we note that the state of Maryland, like Virginia, does not recognize common law marriages but does recognize common law marriages formed in other states where the marriage is valid when formed. <span class="Italic">Port v. Cowan</span>, 44 A.3d 970, 976-77 (Md. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's application to OPM for survivor benefits included the date of the ceremonial marriage as the date of marriage and not the date of the trip to Montana. She signed the application form which included a statement that affirmed the information she provided was true to the best of her knowledge. The appellant cites to websites and regulations from the Social Security Administration in support of her common law marriage claim. However, this information is not relevant; the applicable regulations for determining eligibility for a FERS survivor annuity are issued by OPM and, under those regulations, Montana law ultimately defines the applicable requirements for common law marriage in this case. The appellant also alleges in her petition for review that she and the decedent were announced as married on a vacation in February 2010. This event was 5 months before their trip to Montana, reflecting that the elements of the common law marriage occurred piecemeal and did not occur at a single time as required under Montana law. <span class="Italic">See Sartain</span>, 686 P.2d at 912. Finally, we note the appellant's letter to OPM included with her benefits application. The appellant closed the letter stating, "I hope you will arrange any needed exceptions." The appellant would not need an exception if her common law marriage was valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not doubt the appellant's statement that the parties were in a committed relationship in 2010; however, we find that the appellant has not proven that she and the decedent entered into a common law marriage in Montana during their time in the state in July 2010.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to when an annuitant separated but not divorced from his wife had to make an election for a survivor annuity, <span class="Italic">King v. OPM</span>, 16 MSPR 175, 176-77 (1983), concluded that state law controlled the marital status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in this case are not in dispute. When appellant retired in 1980, he was separated from his wife in contemplation of divorce. Because he did not want his estranged wife to receive any portion of his annuity in the event he should die before the divorce, he did not elect survivor benefits. Subsequently, appellant remarried and unsuccessfully sought to amend his election to provide survivor benefits for his new wife.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether an annuitant can elect survivor benefits for a spouse acquired after retirement depends on the annuitant's marital status at retirement. If the annuitant was unmarried, survivor benefits may be elected for a new spouse within one year of marriage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k). In contrast, if the annuitant was married, survivor benefits for a new spouse may not be elected unless the annuitant had previously elected them at retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j); <span class="Italic">Holliday v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 MSPB 75 (1981). The issue in this case, then, is whether appellant, who was separated pending divorce, should be considered married or unmarried when he retired. If considered unmarried, OPM's rejection of his election for survivor annuity was an error, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k); if considered married, OPM's rejection was correct. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marital status is a question of state law. <span class="Italic">Ensminger v. C.I.R.,</span> 610 F.2d 189 (4th Cir. 1979). In this case, New Jersey was the state where the marriage was contracted, as well as being the place of the marital domicile. Consequently, New Jersey law controls on the question of marital status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The New Jersey statute provides that a final judgment for divorce shall be entered, after hearing, upon the court's determination of entitlement. 2 N.J. Stat. Ann. &#x00A7; 34-18. Moreover, the New Jersey Supreme Court has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]e...rely upon the longstanding, clear, and commonly accepted definition of a spouse that recognizes that once a person is legally married, that person remains a spouse until the marriage is legally terminated by a conclusive judicial determination that a party is entitled to a divorce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Allstate Insurance Co. v. Skolny,</span> 86 N.J. 112, 429 A.2d 1045, 1047 (1981). Consequently, under New Jersey law, appellant was married until his divorce became final in October 1981. Therefore, he does not come within the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k) as an "unmarried person" at the time he retired. Instead, he was a "married person" covered by &#x00A7; 8339(j) and cannot now elect to provide survivor benefits for his new wife.</p>
