<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-96"><span class="space">a.</span> Exception to Exhaustion Requirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">LKQ Corp. v. GM Global Tech. Ops., LLC</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), stated the exhaustion rule and the exceptions:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As a general proposition, a federal appellate court does not consider issues not raised before the lower tribunal. <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 120 (1976). The exact phrasing of the argument need not have been used below "so long as it can be said that the tribunal was 'fairly put on notice as to the substance of the issue.'" <span class="Italic">Nike Inc. v. Adidas AG</span>, 812 F.3d 1326, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing <span class="Italic">Consolidation Coal Co. v. United States</span>, 351 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Nelson v. Adams</span>, 529 U.S. 460, 469 (2000) ("But [issue preservation] does not demand the incantation of particular words; rather, it requires that the lower court be fairly put on notice as to the substance of the issue."))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But even if an issue was not presented below, there is no absolute bar to considering and deciding the issue on appeal, as forfeiture is a matter of discretion. <span class="Italic">Harris Corp. v. Ericsson Inc</span>., 417 F.3d 1241, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("An appellate court retains case-by-case discretion over whether to apply waiver."). In <span class="Italic">Icon Health and Fitness, Inc. v. Strava, Inc</span>., we set forth some relevant considerations to guide the exercise of such discretion. 849 F.3d 1034, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (citing <span class="Italic">Automated Merch. Sys., Inc. v. Lee</span>, 783 F.3d 1376, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2015)). These considerations include whether the issue involves a pure question of law and refusal to consider it would result in a miscarriage of justice, and whether the issue presents significant questions of general impact. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kananowicz v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), added as to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants:</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We have held that arguments not presented to the administrative judge are forfeited. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Sistek v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 955 F.3d 948, 953 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2020). But we have discretion to overlook forfeiture. <span class="Italic">In re Google Tech. Holdings LLC</span>, 980 F.3d 858, 863 (Fed. Cir. 2020). We elect to do so here. Because we liberally construe the pleadings of <span class="Italic">pro se</span> petitioners, and because neither party included Mr. Kananowicz's filings before the Board in the various appendices filed before this court--making it difficult to discern what Mr. Kananowicz did or did not present to the administrative judge--we will overlook any potential forfeiture of his arguments premised on alleged violations of the APA and the Constitution. <span class="Italic">See Durr v. Nicholson</span>, 400 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("<span class="Italic">[P]ro se</span> pleadings are to be liberally construed.") (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Forshey v. Principi</span>, 284 F.3d 1335, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (superseded by statute on other grounds by Pub. L.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White v. DOJ</span>, 328 F.3d 1361, 1372 n.8 (Fed. Cir. 2003), summarized prevailing exceptions to the exhaustion requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Case law suggests only three circumstances under which this court will not observe the rule that arguments not presented to the Board cannot be raised on appeal: (1) where an argument challenging statutory construction requires no review of factual evidence, no reliance on agency expertise, and no exercise of administrative discretion; (2) where an argument represents a constitutional challenge to the agency's action; and (3) where making an argument to the Board would be an exercise in futility because the Board's view of its lack of authority to review the question is well-settled. <span class="Italic">Beard v. GSA</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1986)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Almanza v. United States</span>, <a href="https://cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/18-1803.Opinion.8-21-2019.pdf">935 F.3d 1332</a>, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2019), involving a pay claim brought in the Claims Court, reiterated the theme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Almanza now asks us to consider the validity of &#x00A7; 551.423(a)(2). Almanza attempts to avoid waiver by claiming he relied on &#x00A7; 551.423(a)(2) only "in the alternative," and only after the Government "invoked" that section. We are unpersuaded. Almanza does not provide any authority or further explanation for his assertion that we should decline to find waiver on either basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject Almanza's argument that his challenge to the validity of &#x00A7; 551.423(a)(2) constitutes one of the exceptional situations in which we consider an argument in the first instance on appeal. While Almanza argues that finding waiver would "result in a miscarriage of justice," we believe the opposite is true. Fairness and other policy considerations compel us to find Almanza's untimely challenge to &#x00A7; 551.423(a)(2) waived because Almanza previously sought relief from the Claims Court under that exact provision. <span class="Italic">See HTC Corp. v. IPCom GmbH &#x0026; Co</span>., 667 F.3d 1270, 1281-82 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (explaining that our rule against considering new arguments on appeal ensures finality, conserves judicial resources, and "discourages parties from inviting an alleged error below only to raise it on appeal"); <span class="Italic">Finnigan Corp. v. Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 180 F.3d 1354, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("A party's argument should not be a moving target. The argument at the trial and appellate level should be consistent."); <span class="Italic">Sierra Club v. Yeutter</span>, 926 F.2d 429, 438 (5th Cir. 1991) (finding the government's argument waived because the government originally "sought review under the standard it now challenges").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The cases cited by Almanza do not persuade us otherwise. For example, Almanza cites <span class="Italic">Forshey v. Principi</span> for the proposition that "appellate courts may apply the correct law even if the parties did not argue it below and <span id="Page_5316"></span>the court below did not decide it." Reply Br. 10 (quoting 284 F.3d 1335, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). But Almanza's quotation omits a critical aspect of the <span class="Italic">Forshey</span> holding, which states in full that "appellate courts may apply the correct law even if the parties did not argue it below and the court below did not decide it, <span class="Italic">but only if an issue is properly before the court</span>." 284 F.3d at 1356 (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Forshey</span>, we explained that an issue is not properly before the court where, for example, the appellant argued to this court that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims applied the wrong standard of review, yet "raised no issue below concerning the correct standard of review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. For these reasons, we find that Almanza waived his challenge to the validity of &#x00A7; 551.423(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Issues first raised with the appellate court--if they can be first raised there--must be properly developed, <span class="Italic">Torrez v. McDonough</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">...As a general rule, this court will not consider an argument raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Boggs v. West</span>, 188 F.3d 1335, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 1999). This rule ensures that the parties and tribunal have an opportunity to provide or respond to all the evidence and relevant issues, as well as avoid unfair surprise on appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This court has held that it has discretion to entertain arguments for the first time on appeal, and we do so in this case. <span class="Italic">See Mobility Workx, LLC v. Unified Patents</span>, LLC, 15 F.4th 1146, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (citing <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976) ("The matter of what questions may be taken up and resolved for the first time on appeal is one left primarily to the discretion of the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual cases."). We conclude this argument lacks merit. The Veterans Court's opinion specifically acknowledged that self-represented appellant arguments are to be construed liberally. It found, however, that Mrs. Torrez's evidence neither sufficiently supported her claim for several disabilities for VA purposes nor satisfied her burden to prove prejudicial error. GApp'x 5 (citing <span class="Italic">De Perez v. Derwinski</span>, 2 Vet.App. 85, 86 (1992)). As we understand Mrs. Torrez's informal brief, she argues a due process violation. Mrs. Torrez provides no further detail or support for her claim other than restating her disagreement with the Board's decision. Our court lacks jurisdiction over assertions that are "constitutional in name only." <span class="Italic">Helfer v. West</span>, 174 F.3d 1332, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 1999)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Considering an appeal involving application of a recent decision from the court relating to penalty determinations for VA employees, <span class="Italic">Harrington v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20201207125">981 F.3d 1356</a> (Fed. Cir. 2020), stated as to an argument, rejected by the court, that an argument not raised to MSPB could not be raised with the court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, we also held that &#x00A7; 714 does not apply retroactively. <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, 954 F.3d at 1380. Though the parties did not brief this issue, Mr. Harrington requests we consider retroactivity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Waiver is a discretionary issue. <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976). This court has recognized several reasons for considering issues raised for the first time on appeal: (i) the issue involves a pure question of law; (ii) the proper resolution is beyond any doubt; (iii) the appellant had no opportunity to raise the objection before appeal; (iv) the issue presents significant questions of general impact; or (v) the interest of substantial justice is at stake. <span class="Italic">L.E.A. Dynatech, Inc. v. Allina</span>, 49 F.3d 1527, 1531 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most of these elements apply here. Whether or not a statute applies retroactively is a pure question of law, and neither party disputes the fact that the relevant events transpired before enactment of &#x00A7; 714. The proper resolution is beyond any doubt. Our opinion in <span class="Italic">Sayers</span> directly states that "&#x00A7; 714 cannot be applied retroactively." 954 F.3d at 1372. While Mr. Harrington could have argued before the Board that the statute does not apply retroactively, before <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>, such a defense would have been difficult for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant to mount. This is not a situation in which sophisticated counsel could have anticipated <span class="Italic">Sayers</span>. Further, Mr. Harrington "had a right to the substantive civil service protections from improper or unjustified removal in effect at the time of his alleged misconduct." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1381. To ignore this right would not be in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the existence of various factors that support excusing waiver here, the government argues that we should not consider an issue that has not been briefed. We agree that as a general matter an issue not raised until a supplemental filing typically should not be reached. But the unique facts of this case counsel against holding Mr. Harrington to a strict waiver. This is particularly true because a remand is required in any event for the scope of penalty review issue, which Mr. Harrington has adequately preserved....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bannister v. VA</span>, 26 F.4th 1340, 1343 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2022), considered an argument, not made to MSPB, but that depended on a Federal Circuit ruling on evidentiary analysis that post-dated MSPB's appealed decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At oral argument, the government contended that Ms. Bannister forfeited her <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span> argument because she raised it for the first time in her reply brief (which was filed about two months after <span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span> was decided). We disagree. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">In re Micron Tech., Inc</span>., 875 F.3d 1091, 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("[A] sufficiently sharp change of law sometimes is a ground for permitting a party to advance a position that it did not advance earlier in the proceeding when the law at the time was strongly enough against that position."). Here, pre-<span class="Italic">Rodriguez</span>, our case law did not directly resolve whether the VA was permitted to prove misconduct under section 714 merely by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Sayers v. Dep't of Veterans Affs</span>., 954 F.3d 1370, 1374 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 2020).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A court considered an argument advanced for the first time that was based on constitutional grounds, specifically the denial of due process through an allegedly deficient adverse action notice. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1538 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Briggs v. MSPB</span>, 331 F.3d 1307, 1312-13 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (considering constitutionality of Hatch Act; recognizing practice of MSPB not to consider constitutional challenges to statutes; there was no need for development of a factual record, and there was no need for Board expertise to decide the issue). It is unnecessary for a petitioner to frame his issue in constitutional terms at the initial stages. Preservation of petitioner's rights occurred when respondent was put on notice of petitioner's position. <span class="Italic">Franco v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3567) (relying on <span class="Italic">Conley v. Gibson</span>, 355 U.S. 41, 48 (1957)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Vivint v.

Cir. 2021 NP) (considering when an issue can be raised on appeal based on new law if prior law during the pendency of earlier proceedings was firmly against the appellant: "[W]e cited, among many other cases, <span class="Italic">Blonder-Tongue</span>, 402 U.S. at 350 for the proposition that forfeiture can be forgiven where an argument would have been futile under controlling precedent, and <span class="Italic">Curtis Publishing Company v. Butts</span>, 388 U.S. 130 (1967) for the proposition that waiver can be forgiven where at the time of trial there was "strong precedent" indicating that the opposite of the new ruling was the law. <span class="Italic">Micron</span>, 875 F.3d at 1098; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bennett v.

<p class="Body-Text">That constitutional issues may be raised initially on appeal does not mean there is an inflexible rule requiring their consideration, <span class="Italic">Harding v. U.S. Naval Academy</span>, 567 Fed. Appx. 920, 924 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reviewing court has discretion to consider issues not raised below under certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121 (1976); <span class="Italic">Forshey v. Principi</span>, 284 F.3d 1335, 1353-59 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). However, there is no strict rule requiring the court to consider any constitutional issue raised on appeal even though it was not raised below. <span class="Italic">See Singleton v. Shinseki</span>, 659 F.3d 1332, 1334 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Beard v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 801 F.2d 1318, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1539 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harding has not offered any explanation for her failure to raise her due process claims before the arbitrator, and for that reason, we see no justification for excusing her failure to preserve those issues below. Nor has she shown that the asserted errors that she seeks to raise in this court for the first time on appeal rendered the disciplinary proceedings in this case fundamentally unfair. We therefore conclude that this is not an appropriate case in which to exercise our discretion to excuse the failure to raise those claims before the arbitrator.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Fourth Circuit added to the administrative exhaustion doctrine in its review of a mixed case appeal arriving from a district court, <span class="Italic">Rana v. United States</span>, 812 F.2d 887, 889, 890 (4th Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will not bar the assertion of constitutional claims in all cases in which they are not first raised before an administrative tribunal involved in the case.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The rule on administrative waiver of claims later raised before the courts is a flexible one. <span class="Italic">See</span> K. Davis, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Text</span>, sec. 20.06, at 391 (1972), and properly so. Many administrative claimants, including those before the MSPB, lack legal assistance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Developments in the Law--Public Employment</span>, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1611, 1637, n.55 (1984) ("Approximately 25% of those who appealed to the Board in fiscal year 1980...were represented by private attorneys; an additional 27% were represented by their unions"). It would be unduly harsh to limit <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigants to arguments raised at the administrative level as an unbending matter of law. In this case, however, Rana was apparently represented by counsel before the MSPB...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5317"></span>Here, however, Rana is essentially arguing that the Department of Defense failed to follow its own rules in dismissing him. That argument calls for precisely the sort of inquiry to which the MSPB is accustomed. When an argument concerns procedural rights within the purview of agency expertise, and a plaintiff fails to raise the argument before the agency, courts will entertain the argument on appeal only if it is "jurisdictional" or if there are compelling reasons for its novelty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A jurisdictional issue may gain the court's attention for the first time on judicial review, as in <span class="Italic">Wright v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3328), considering whether the appellant was a probationer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to this court, Mr. Wright raises, apparently for the first time, the question of whether he should be considered a probationary employee at all, asserting that "[a]ccording to USERRA, I should have been considered as reemployed having no break in service." An appellate court generally will not hear on appeal issues that were not clearly raised in the proceedings below. <span class="Italic">Boggs v. West</span>, 188 F.3d 1335, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 1999). This rule ensures "that litigants may not be surprised on appeal by final decision there of issues upon which they have had no opportunity to introduce evidence." <span class="Italic">Hormel v. Helvering</span>, 312 U.S. 552, 556, (1941). However, there is in fact no general rule on what questions may be taken up for the first time on appeal<span class="Italic">. Singleton v. Wulff</span>, 428 U.S. 106, 121, 96 S. Ct. 2868, 2877 (1976) ("The matter...is one left primarily to the courts of appeals, to be exercised on the facts of individual cases. We announce no general rule.") Courts of appeals have occasionally considered questions of only legal, not factual, interpretation raised for the first time on appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bellotti v. Baird</span>, 428 U.S. 132, 143-44 n.10 (1976); <span class="Italic">White</span> v. <span class="Italic">Department of Army</span>, 720 F.2d 209, 211 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Pegues v.

<p class="Body-Text">Other exceptions to the usual exhaustion rule are: first, a petitioner need not file a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> objection at the Board level to preserve his right to challenge the holding of one of the court's decisions binding the Board, <span class="Italic">Mousseau v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2673); second, an issue of law need not be raised before the Board if the Board already settled the issue, making further administrative litigation futile; and third, a statutory issue may be resolved for the first time on appeal if the issue does not require the development of a factual record, the application of agency expertise, or the exercise of administrative discretion. <span class="Italic">Beard v. GSA</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1323 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (issue of the proper application of rules concerning deference to agency penalty decisions).<span class="Italic"> Hatcher v.

The court did not state to what extent exhaustion is required if the Board has not yet firmly decided a legal issue. Otherwise, an issue not raised before the Board will not be considered on appeal. <span class="Italic">Lewis v.
