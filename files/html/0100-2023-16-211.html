<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-211"><span class="space">d.</span> EEO Proceedings: Postcomplaint Settlement Discussions and Adjustments; Mediation</h5>
<p class="noindent">For a time, after the <span class="Italic">Fresno Serv. Ctr.</span> decision, <span class="Italic">supra, </span>FLRA concluded that a meeting held to resolve an EEO complaint was not a formal meeting subject to mandatory union representational rights when the meeting was required by EEOC regulations, was not confrontational, proceeded according to a fixed agenda, and was conducted by an agency official who was required by regulation to be essentially neutral in the resolution process. <span class="Italic">SSA and Chauvin</span>, 16 FLRA 1021, 1032-33 (1984) (ALJ Decision). Management did not bypass the union by meeting with an employee to achieve informal adjustment of an EEO complaint. It was the employee's right to pursue the complaint under EEOC regulations, and those regulations provided for an adjustment process. The regulations did not provide for the presence of the exclusive representative unless that union was the complainant's designated representative. The union had no statutory rights or obligations as to the employee in the statutory EEO process. If the EEO adjustment resulted in a change in the conditions of employment for unit employees, the agency would then have an obligation to notify the union of that change and to give the union the opportunity to bargain as required by statute. Because Congress determined that the rights of identifiable victims of discrimination take priority over the interests of the bargaining unit, the union's right to bargain upon receiving notice of an EEO complaint settlement cannot conflict with or overturn the substance of those settlements. <span class="Italic">GPO and Columbia Typographical Union No. 101</span>, 23 FLRA 35, 38-41 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base and AFGE Local 1482</span>, 52 FLRA 1039, 1045-48 (1997), FLRA considered the impact, and adopted the analysis, of <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985), concluding that 5 USC 7121, referencing a grievance, includes both those complaints filed pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure and those filed pursuant to alternative statutory procedures. Based on the D.C. Circuit decision, FLRA determined that EEO postcomplaint settlement discussions are formal meetings requiring notice to the union and an opportunity for the union to be represented at the discussion of a unit employee's complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1023-24, to support its position that section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not apply to any EEOC proceeding, whether at the informal or the formal complaint stage. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">Fresno</span>, the Ninth Circuit held that the union's right to representation at formal discussions pursuant to section 7114(a)(2)(A) "do[es] not apply to the EEO precomplaint conciliation conference involved in [that] case." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1021. The court held that, by the terms of the applicable EEOC regulation, the meeting was "informal" and it noted the confidentiality requirements of EEO complaints at the informal stage. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1023-24. The court further held that the EEO complaint was not <span id="page_1460"></span>a "grievance," because the regulatory EEOC procedures involved in the case were unrelated to the contractual grievance process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1024. In support of this conclusion, the court pointed out that the parties' collective bargaining agreement excluded discrimination complaints from its grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1024-25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously fully considered the conflict between this decision and the D.C. Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, which disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's construction of the term "grievance." In <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, the Authority concluded, consistent with the rationale in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, that a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal. Accordingly, to the extent that the Respondent is relying on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, we reject such reliance for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Ray</span> <span class="Italic">Brook. See Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 589-90.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> on three grounds. First, as the Judge found and the Respondent does not dispute, the EEO proceeding here was at the formal complaint stage. Although formal complaint procedures are governed by regulations promulgated by the EEOC, they lack certain features that the <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> court found "critical" in the informal proceedings at issue there. For example, in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the applicable regulations required that an EEO counselor "seek a resolution of the matter on an informal basis" before the formal complaint system could be activated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1024 (quoting from 29 CFR 1613.213(a)). The meeting at issue in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> was convened by the counselor for this purpose. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In contrast, the meeting in this case took place after the filing of a formal complaint and was convened not by an EEO counselor, but by the Respondent's General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the confidentiality concerns associated with the precomplaint proceedings noted by the <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> court are absent here. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Denver, Colorado v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.3d 1386, 1391 (10th Cir. 1993) (court found meeting concerning Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) proceeding to be a formal discussion, distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> in part by noting the absence of confidentiality concerns). At the precomplaint stage, the EEO counselor is prohibited from revealing the identity of a person consulting him. <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d at 1023 (citing 29 CFR 1613.213(a)). In this case the complainant's identity had already been revealed prior to the first meeting attended by Leader, the Respondent and the Union to discuss the settlement of Leader's EEO complaint. The Union was invited and did attend two settlement discussions concerning Leader's EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, it is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> and its progeny to find that the discrimination complaint at issue is a "grievance" for the purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Under Ninth Circuit precedent, an employee complaint processed under a statutory process is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> excluded under the definition of "grievance" for the purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See VA, Long Beach</span>, 16 F.3d at 1533-34 (meeting with bargaining unit employees in preparation for MSPB proceeding concerned a "grievance"). In distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> found relevant that there was no indication that the dispute was excluded from the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and therefore, the complaint could have been brought either under the grievance procedure or under the statutory appeal process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded that the case concerned a matter intimately connected with the union's collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1534. There is no indication in this case that discrimination complaints are excluded from the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Respondent mistakenly relies on dicta in <span class="Italic">VA, Long Beach</span> characterizing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> as holding that "the protections of the Statute [do not] apply to proceedings conducted by EEOC." <span class="Italic">Id. VA, Long Beach</span> concerned the applicability of section 7114(a)(2)(A) to discussions regarding MSPB proceedings. In distinguishing <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>, the court in VA, <span class="Italic">Long</span> <span class="Italic">Beach</span> unnecessarily overstated the prior holding. We find nothing in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> that supports such a broad reading. Rather, the court in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> limited its holding to the specific circumstances of that case, namely that "5 U.S.C. 7114(a)(2)(A) does not apply to <span class="Italic">precomplaint</span> <span class="Italic">conciliation conferences such as that involved here</span>[.]" 706 F.2d at 1025 (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's argument that EEO settlement agreements under the EEO Statute are excluded from the definition of "conditions of employment" under section 7103(a)(14)(C) of the Statute, and, therefore, discussions of these agreements are not formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Section 7103(a)(14)(C) excepts from the definition of conditions of employment personnel policies, practices, and other matters (hereinafter matters) to the extent that they are "specifically provided for" by Federal statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1897 and Department of the Air Force, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida</span>, 24 FLRA 377, 378-79 (1986). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 653 F.2d 669, 670 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Mere reference to a matter in a statute is not sufficient to exclude it from the definition of conditions of employment under section 7103(a)(14)(C). <span class="Italic">See International Association of Machinist and Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135, et al. and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, 50 FLRA 677, 681 (1995), <span class="Italic">affirmed</span>, 88 F.3d 1279 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Under the terms of section 7103(a)(14)(C), the statute must "specifically provide[&#8197;] for" the matter, and the exception applies only "to the extent that" it does so<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent has not identified any statutory provision that specifically provides for the conduct of settlements of EEO complaints.&#x2003;The statute cited by the Respondent, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, provides that the Federal Government shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in effecting personnel actions; grants the EEOC authority to enforce these provisions; and grants employees or applicants the right to file civil actions. Nothing in these provisions addresses employee representation, the role of exclusive representatives, or the settlement of complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">INS</span> in this context is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the court held that a collective bargaining agreement provision that would establish standards for employer liability for sexual harassment, a form of discrimination based on sex, was outside the agency's obligation to bargain. <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 4 F.3d at 273-74. The court found that employer liability for acts of sexual harassment is specifically provided for by 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 and, therefore, under section 7103(a)(14)(C), is not a condition of employment subject to collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court's determination was limited to finding that liability for discrimination was provided for by statute and could not be altered through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 274 n.10 ("42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16's comprehensiveness and exclusivity are enough to preclude <span class="Italic">negotiation about federal sector employment discrimination</span>[.]") (emphasis added). Nothing in the court's holding implies that the relevant statutory provisions affect a union's right to represent employees or otherwise be involved in complaints arising under those provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find no basis on which to conclude that discussions of EEO settlement agreements do not concern conditions of employment within the meaning of section 7103(a)(14)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we conclude, in agreement with the Judge, that the meeting was a discussion, which was formal, between one or more representatives of the Respondent and a bargaining unit employee concerning a grievance (the settlement of a pending EEO complaint), without affording the Union notice and an opportunity to be represented at the discussion, as required by section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA and Chauvin</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished as not involving a mandatory EEO settlement meeting, and <span class="Italic">Columbia Typographical Union No. 101</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished on the technical basis that the case did not directly involve a claimed violation of 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(A) (violation alleged was apparently of 5 USC 7116(a)(1), (5))</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 54 FLRA 716, 723-34 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 208 F.3d 221 (9th Cir. 1999 NP) (Table), <span class="Italic">post</span>, again employed a multi-factor analysis to determine that meetings designed to mediate and investigate EEO complaints were formal discussions, warranting notice to the union and an opportunity for union participation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was a Discussion</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Respondent engaged in a "discussion" with the employee about her EEO complaints, within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), and, thus, we will not address this requirement. However, the Respondent argues that this discussion was not "formal" and concerned neither a "grievance" within the meaning of the Statute nor a matter affecting other unit employees. The Respondent additionally argues that neither the OCI investigator nor its chief EEO counselor were "representatives of the agency" for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was Formal</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, the Authority held that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In determining whether a discussion is formal within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), [the Authority has] advised that the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined, but that a number of factors are relevant: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) how long the discussions lasted; (6) whether a formal agenda was established for the discussions; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355. These factors are illustrative, and other factors may be identified and applied as appropriate in a particular case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyoming</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 157 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Warren</span>). Therefore, in determining formality, the Authority considers the totality of the facts and circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OCI investigator presided at, and the chief EEO counselor facilitated, <span id="page_1461"></span>the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints. The Respondent disputes the Judge's finding that the OCI investigator and the chief EEO counselor were agents of management on January 19. It asserts that the chief EEO counselor is a "neutral." However, the Respondent does not deny that management was represented at all times by an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's office. The Judge Advocate General attorney participated in the initial settlement discussions of January 18 as well as on January 19. In addition, the Judge Advocate General attorney ultimately drafted and signed the agreement with the employee on January 19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the concession by the Respondent that management was represented at all times by an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's office, we, therefore, find it unnecessary to address, and do not adopt, the Judge's findings that the OCI investigator and the chief EEO counselor are also "representatives" of the Agency within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Similarly, we do not address the Respondent's contention that the chief EEO counselor is a "neutral." In addition, we do not address the Respondent's contention that the OCI investigator is not a representative of the Agency because of her organizational location.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that since the Judge Advocate General attorney was not the employee's first level supervisor, the mediation session was not attended by an Agency representative of the sort that would indicate a "formal" meeting. Although there is no doubt that she was not the employee's first level supervisor, it is clear that the Judge Advocate General attorney represented a high level of management. The Judge identified the attorney as "the Chief of Civil Law" in the Judge Advocate General's office. The attorney identified herself at the hearing as "chief of adverse actions."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an attempt to support its contention of "informality," the Respondent describes the back and forth nature of the mediation/investigation session. The record does not show that the Judge Advocate General attorney was physically present at the January 19 mediation/investigation session with the employee, and the Judge made no finding as to that point. The attorney testified that she was never in the room with the employee on that day. The employee testified that she remembered that the attorney brought the proposed settlement agreement into the room but "didn't say a word to anybody" and then left.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the evidence is inconclusive that the employee and the Judge Advocate General attorney ever spoke directly to each other on January 19, they communicated extensively through the chief EEO counselor. The record shows that at that mediation/investigation session, the chief EEO counselor was "in and out of the room" relaying the employee's position regarding a proposed settlement agreement to the Judge Advocate General attorney and returning to present the Respondent's position to the employee. Moreover, this process ultimately produced a settlement agreement signed by the Judge Advocate General attorney.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if they were communicating exclusively through the chief EEO counselor, it is clear that both the employee and the Judge Advocate General attorney were engaged in responding to each other's settlement positions, and that they were no less engaged than if they had been speaking face-to-face as they had been speaking the previous day.[7] A normal mediation technique is to have people in different rooms with someone going back and forth conducting the negotiation. The Union's interest and right to be represented at face-to-face negotiations of a grievance, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355-56, applies as well, in our view, to a negotiation conducted through a mediator. Under these circumstances, the Judge Advocate General attorney was effectively present at the January 19 mediation/investigation session. Thus, the nature of the communication during the mediation/investigation session on January 19 does not undermine the overall formality. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center, Long Beach California</span>, 41 FLRA 1370, 1379-80 (1991), (<span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach)</span>, <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994) (an interview conducted by telephone was "formal" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We find no merit to the Respondent's contention that the Union's right to be present at an OCI-conducted mediation/investigation session "where [the Union] is not the personal representative of the complainant" would interfere with management's internal deliberative process. Exceptions at 14. The Union seeks to be present only at the discussions between the management representative and the employee and not at any intra-management meetings where negotiation strategy or settlement authority is discussed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints took place outside of the employee's work area indicates that it was formal. The Judge found that it took place "a mile or more away from [the employee's] work site." The Respondent does not dispute this finding, but describes the meeting site as "a neutral location outside of the employee's work area." Meetings held outside an employee's immediate work area are associated with formality, while those held in the work area are not. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 45 FLRA 1332, 1335-36 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>) (shop floor discussion not formal); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Depot Tracy, Tracy, California</span>, 37 FLRA 952 (1990) (meeting held in employee lunchroom formal); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and Social Security Administration Field Operations, Region II</span>, 29 FLRA 1205, 1216 (1987) (meeting at supervisor's desk near employee's seat assignment not formal). In view of the fact that the mediation/investigation session was held on the Respondent's premises, it is not clear whether it is properly characterized as having been at a "neutral location," as the Respondent maintains. In any event, even if this location were viewed as "neutral," it does not outweigh the fact that it was an Agency location outside the employee's immediate work area.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The length of the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints similarly indicates that it was formal. The Judge found that the January 19 mediation/investigation session culminating in the settlement agreement lasted three hours. As the Respondent describes it, "[t]he mediation process lasted over a two day period covering a period of seven and a half hours." The Respondent presents no basis, and none is apparent given all the other evidence in the case, for describing a three hour mediation/investigation session--much less a seven and one half hour session extending over two days--as impromptu or spontaneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that an agenda was established for the January 18 and January 19 mediation/investigation sessions of the EEO complaints. The Judge found that "there clearly was a pre-established agenda for the meeting." The Respondent asserts that "there was no formal agenda for the informal mediation session." The Authority has relied on a variety of evidence to conclude that a particular meeting had or did not have an "agenda." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 159 (message received by one military command from another found to be agenda for formal discussion); <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 45 FLRA at 1336 (no agenda where supervisor "thought through his plans for the meeting," but did so only five or ten minutes in advance); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C. and VA Medical Center, Brockton Division, Brockton, Massachusetts</span>, 37 FLRA 747, 754 (1990) (agenda found where supervisor distributed old and new shift schedules and asked employees to choose new shifts).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Judge does not say precisely what he found to be the "agenda" in this case, the record shows that the OCI investigator sent the employee a memorandum some two weeks prior to the mediation/investigation session. This memorandum referred to the issues in the employee's complaints, explained the general plan of the meeting, and laid out certain ground rules. The investigator sent a copy of this memorandum to the Respondent's chief EEO counselor. To the extent that the OCI investigator's memorandum shows that the mediation/investigation session to discuss the employee's EEO complaints was planned in advance and had a set of clearly-defined objectives and procedures that were communicated to all the participants, we find that this memorandum was an "agenda" for the mediation/investigation session.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the employee's attendance may not have been mandatory in the sense that she could face discipline for refusing to meet with the OCI investigator, the evidence shows that she had reasonable grounds to conclude that her complaints could be adversely affected if she did not attend. The Judge found that the employee "considered the meeting to be mandatory." The Respondent contends that "[t]he meeting was conducted by mutual consent[,]" presumably meaning that it was voluntary. The OCI investigator testified that the employee's attendance was "not mandatory" and that she had never heard of a complainant being disciplined for refusing to speak with an OCI investigator. However, the OCI investigator's memorandum to the employee, discussed above, states that "[f]ailure to cooperate in the investigation...will not stop the investigation. It will, however, result in recommendations based on available information and may be the basis for an adverse inference concerning the position of the nonresponding party." Based on this, we find that attendance by the employee at the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was, in effect, mandatory. Nevertheless, even if attendance were not mandatory, the other indicia of formality support our conclusion that the session on January 19 was a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 159.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge found that "the meeting resulted in a signed settlement agreement[,] reflecting the results of the meeting." The Respondent asserts merely that "no notes [were] taken." The record does not indicate that anyone took notes or minutes during the actual settlement on January 19, but it is unclear whether notes or minutes would have been expected. In her memorandum to the employee, the OCI investigator stated that "[t]he entire mediation conference is confidential, except for information which I would be required to report by law[,]" and "[a]side from minimal notes and the actual [settlement] agreement, if any, no report or testimony unique to the mediation conference will be included <span id="page_1462"></span>in the discrimination complaint file." To the extent that the initial focus of the January 19 mediation/investigation session had shifted from mediation to investigation, however, the record shows that the OCI investigator was in the process of transcribing the employee's statement into her computer when the Respondent presented its settlement offer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On balance, and considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, we are persuaded that the evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was a "formal discussion" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA I</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355-56 (settlement negotiations of an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board between an agency and the employee and her private attorney constituted formal discussions within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 16 FLRA at 1033-34, is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority adopted a Judge's conclusion that meetings to settle an EEO complaint were not formal. In that case, the Judge viewed as dispositive that the presiding official was a facilitator, attendance was not mandatory, and the manner of the discussion was not confrontational. As explained above, for the purpose of determining whether the discussion was formal, we view the January 19th session as, in effect, mandatory. In any event, to the extent that <span class="Italic">SSA</span> implies that a facilitated discussion in general, or a mediated negotiation in particular, can never be "formal" under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, we reject that conclusion. In our view, a union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to be present during a discussion is not diminished when the discussion between employees and agency representatives is conducted in a nonconfrontational manner through a neutral third party. <span class="Italic">SSA</span> will no longer be followed to the extent it implies that a discussion conducted in this way will never be found "formal" within the meaning of the Statute. We will continue to look at the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a discussion is formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's reliance on the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> to support its position that meetings may be found informal when the "regulatory framework" of the EEOC characterizes them that way. The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 52 FLRA 1039 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Barstow</span>) issued after the Judge's decision in this case. In <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, the Authority concluded that a meeting, at which management presented an employee with a proposed settlement agreement of a formal EEO complaint, was a formal discussion of a grievance that the union should have been permitted to attend. In reaching this conclusion, the Authority pointed to its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution (Ray Brook, New York)</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 589-90 (1987), <span class="Italic">affirmed sub nom.</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>). In <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, the Authority decided to follow the reasoning of the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> over that of the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span> and held that a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) can encompass a statutory appeal. For the reasons stated in <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, we reject the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Was Between a Representative of the Agency and a Unit Employee</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, the Respondent concedes that the attorney from the Judge Advocate General's Office was its representative and had settlement authority for purposes of this case. The Respondent asserts that the Judge Advocate General attorney was not a supervisor of the employee. However, nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute requires that a "representative" be a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach, California</span>, 41 FLRA at 1379 (undisputed that respondent's attorney who conducted telephone interview was respondent's representative); and <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 39 FLRA 298, 311-12 (1991) (finding respondent "responsible for the acts and conduct of its agent, regardless of the organizational location of its agent"). Thus, we conclude that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was between a "representative" of the Agency and a unit employee within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Concerned a Grievance</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge correctly concluded that the formal EEO complaints filed by the employee constituted a "grievance" within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1045-46. We reject the Respondent's assertion that section 7114(a)(2)(A) cannot recognize as a "grievance" any matter that the parties have excluded from their own negotiated grievance procedure. The statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. Agencies and unions remain free to exclude from their grievance procedures any matters they choose. This does not preclude matters they exclude from their grievance procedures from being "grievances" under the Statute if they otherwise meet the elements of section 7103(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument that the Union had no right to be present at the "mediation" in this case because that mediation affected only the employee herself, not the bargaining unit as a whole, is also misplaced. Section 7114(a)(2)(A) does not require that a "grievance" manifest some effect on other employees in the bargaining unit before it may become the subject of a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1045-46; <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Charleston Naval Shipyard, Charleston, South Carolina</span>, 32 FLRA 222, 230 (1988) ("[S]ection 7114(a)(2)(A) requires that a formal discussion be connected with a grievance of a bargaining unit employee or with any personnel policy or practices or other general conditions of employment affecting bargaining unit employees."). The Authority's determinations under section 7114(a)(2)(A) are "guided by that section's intent and purpose--to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit--viewed in the context of a union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Ray Brook</span>, 29 FLRA at 589.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, we conclude that the grievance did affect the bargaining unit as a whole. This conclusion is supported by testimony from the employee and from the Respondent's own witnesses about the employee's concern that she not be placed in a job for which other employees may have been competing. The Respondent concedes that the employee herself insisted on modifying the proposed settlement agreement to provide that it would have no "impact" on other bargaining unit positions. The Respondent consented to this modification and created a new position for the employee. Its present argument that the settlement discussions had no effect on other unit employees because the discussions resulted in an agreement that other employees would not be affected is without merit. For example, the allocation of a position to the employee would necessarily deprive other employees from bidding on that position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Presence of a Union Representative at the January 19 Mediation/Investigation Session of the EEO Complaints Would Not Conflict With EEOC Regulations or the ADR Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">EEOC regulations</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the General Counsel points out, the Respondent does not contend that 29 CFR Part 1614 and EEO MD 110 actually prohibit the presence of a union representative at the formal discussion of an employee's EEO complaint. Rather, the Respondent asserts only that those regulations do not provide for the union's presence: "[n]owhere in 29 CFR Part 1614 does that regulation allow for the exclusive representative's presence, unless the exclusive representative is the complainant's designated representative." The fact that 29 CFR Part 1614 does not mention the right of a union to be present at a formal discussion of an EEO complaint does not mean that the union's presence is forbidden or that that regulation necessarily conflicts with the protections of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Barstow</span>, 52 FLRA at 1046. Indeed, the Respondent points to no such conflict in this case. The Respondent does assert that the Authority is not "entitled to deference in interpreting the law involving the processing of individual EEO complaints." However, in the absence of any apparent inconsistency between section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and "the law involving the processing of individual EEO complaints[,]" nothing in this case requires the Authority to make such an interpretation<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Further, because we find no conflict between the EEOC regulations and the Statute, it is not necessary to determine whether those regulations would trump the Statute in general, or section 7114(a)(2)(A) in particular.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also relies on <span class="Italic">dictum</span> by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189, that Congress has explicitly decided that a conflict between the rights of identifiable victims of discrimination and the interests of the bargaining unit must be resolved in favor of the former. Again, however, the Respondent identifies no conflict between the rights of the employee in this case and those of the Union or the rest of the bargaining unit. In particular, it does not dispute the Judge's finding that the employee not only never objected to the Union president's presence at the settlement discussions but, "[o]n the contrary, she had wanted him to be present."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Administrative Dispute Resolution Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 574 of the ADR Act, titled "Confidentiality," deals with circumstances under which certain communications made during dispute resolution proceedings may not be disclosed by the parties or by the neutral outside those proceedings. An exclusive representative that is a "party" to the proceedings would presumably be bound by the nondisclosure provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 574. The focus of section 574 of the ADR Act is on the protection of the confidentiality of alternate dispute resolution proceedings and not on who may attend such proceedings. Thus, the mere presence of a union representative at a dispute resolution proceeding where all the elements of section 7114(a)(2)(A) were met, in and of itself, would not conflict with those provisions of the ADR Act. Further, because we find no conflict between the ADR Act and the Statute, we need not determine whether the ADR Act, if applicable, would trump the Statute in general, or section 7114(a)(2)(A) in particular.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on such cases as <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, 51 FLRA 115, in which the Authority found that the Privacy Act precluded the disclosure <span id="page_1463"></span>of an EEO settlement agreement, is misplaced. In contrast to those cases, the Union here has not requested any information and the Respondent has not been charged with refusing to provide any. Further, the fact that section 7114(b)(4) may not require an agency to disclose an EEO settlement agreement to a union does not mean that a union has no right under section 7114(a)(2)(A) to attend the formal discussion of an EEO complaint, whether that discussion results in a settlement agreement or not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that either EEOC regulations or the ADR Act conflicts with section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute or otherwise precludes the Union's right to be represented at the discussion in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Summary</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the January 19 mediation/investigation session of the EEO complaints was a discussion, which was formal, between a representative of the Respondent and a bargaining unit employee concerning a grievance, within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In addition, we find that the Respondent has failed to establish that the presence of a Union representative at the mediation/investigation session would conflict with EEOC regulations or the ADR Act. Therefore, by holding a formal discussion with a bargaining unit employee without affording the Union notice and an opportunity to be represented at the discussion, as required by section 7114(a)(2)(A), the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> was set aside by the Ninth Circuit through a nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Luke Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 208 F.3d 221 (9th Cir. 1999 NP) (Table):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1547, is the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit at Luke Air Force Base ("Luke"). The collective bargaining agreement between the union and Luke excludes discrimination claims from the grievance procedure provided in the agreement. Tillie Cano, a member of the union's bargaining unit, filed her claims pursuant to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC") regulations rather than the grievance procedure. For the mediation and the investigation scheduled in connection with these complaints, Cano designated Paul King, president of the union, as her personal representative. On January 18, 1995, Cano, King, and representatives from Luke and the Office of Complaint Investigation met for the first time. King left the meeting early. At the end of the first meeting, a second meeting was scheduled for the next day; however, no one from Luke's management attempted to contact King or the rest of the union regarding the second meeting. At the January 19 meeting, Cano signed a settlement agreement without King's presence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In May and October of 1995, the union filed unfair labor practice charges against Luke before the Office of Administrative Law Judges, part of the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA"). The Chief Administrative Law Judge found that Luke failed to comply with Section 7114 of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ("Labor Statute") because Luke did not give the union notice and an opportunity to be represented at the January 19 meeting.[2] In August 1998, the FLRA adopted the ALJ's conclusion in a decision and order. We have jurisdiction under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7123. We may set aside a decision issued by the FLRA only if it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr. v. FLRA</span>, 16 F.3d 1526, 1529 (9th Cir. 1994). Because we conclude that the FLRA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in deciding that Luke violated Section 7114 of the Labor Statute, we REVERSE.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Section 7114(a) of the Labor Statute provides in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance....&#8197;5 USC &#x00A7; 7114 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for the union to possess a right to representation at a meeting, the following elements of Section 7114(a)(2)(A) must exist: There must be (1) a discussion, (2) which is formal, (3) between the representatives of the government employer and the unit employee or her representatives (4) concerning a grievance<span class="Italic">. See General Serv. Admin. v. American Fed'n of Gov't Employees</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994). Under <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019, 1024 (9th Cir. 1983), "grievances" within the meaning of Section 7114(a)(2)(A) do not include Cano's complaints because they were brought pursuant to EEOC procedures, which are "discrete and separate from the grievance process to which 5 USC [&#x00A7;]...7114 [is] directed." The fact that the collective bargaining agreement explicitly excludes discrimination claims from the grievance procedure also suggests that these claims are not "grievances." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Because the January 19 meeting did not concern "grievances" within the meaning of Section 7114, the meeting did not satisfy the fourth element of Section 7114. The union therefore had no right of representation at the meeting. As such, Luke did not violate Section 7114 when it failed to give the union notice of the January 19 meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v64/64-158.html">64 FLRA 845</a>, 848-50 (2010), reaffirmed FLRA's approach that ADR or mediation sessions following the filing of a formal complaint are formal discussions entitling the union to notice and an opportunity to be present at the mediation even if (absent exceptional circumstances) the employee does not want the union present:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The mediation of a formal EEO complaint concerns a "grievance" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have a right to be represented under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Boston</span>, 59 FLRA at 878; <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 306; <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, 54 FLRA at 723.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the mediation session was a discussion, which was formal, between a representative of the Respondent and a unit employee. There also is no dispute that the Respondent did not give the Union notice and an opportunity to attend the session. Rather, the Respondent disputes the Judge's finding that the mediation of the formal EEO complaint concerned a grievance. As stated by the Judge, although the Ninth Circuit agrees with the Respondent's position, <span class="Italic">see Luke Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, the D.C. Circuit and the Authority have repeatedly rejected this approach and held that a formal EEO complaint is a grievance within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 316 F.3d 280 (D.C. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">affirming</span> 57 FLRA 304; <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, 54 FLRA at 723. Consistent with this D.C. Circuit and Authority precedent, we deny the Respondent's cross-exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Judge did not err by finding that the Union's presence at the mediation would not conflict with the Civil Rights Act, the Privacy Act, the ADR Act, EEOC statutory and regulatory authority, or EEOC rules and guidelines.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Respondent's claim that the Union's presence would violate the Civil Rights Act, the Privacy Act, the ADR Act, EEOC statutory and regulatory authority, or EEOC rules and guidelines, the Authority and the D.C. Circuit previously considered and rejected such claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Luke II</span>, 58 FLRA at 534-36; <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 316 F.3d at 286-87; <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 310. As found by the Judge, the Respondent has "presented nothing persuasive that has not already been considered and rejected by the Authority." Accordingly, consistent with the above-cited precedent, we deny the Respondent's cross-exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;In the particular circumstances of this case, the employee's objection to the Union's presence at the mediation did not provide a basis for the Respondent to deny the Union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to be present.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Union was not entitled to be present at the mediation, the Judge relied on the fact that the employee objected to the Union being present, effectively finding that such an objection, standing alone, is sufficient to trump the Union's formal-discussion rights. For the following reasons, we find that the Judge's decision is not supported by applicable law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, there are "important policies and purposes behind the Statute's formal discussion right." <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309. In this connection, "unions have an established interest in how allegations of discrimination are dealt with and resolved[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. Accord NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188. In addition, "the processing of an individual complaint through EEO procedures can have an effect on the entire bargaining unit, which the union represents[.]" <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309. In this connection, "by providing formal discussion rights for discrete grievances and not just general personnel policies, the Statute recognizes that the resolution of an individual employee complaint may have an impact on the rights of other unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id. Accord Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Denver, Colo. v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.3d 1386, 1390 (10th Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although "neither the Authority nor the courts have ruled that unions have an <span class="Italic">absolute </span>right to attend discussions about EEO complaints[,]" <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309 (emphasis added), the Authority and the courts also have not held that an employee's objection, without more, is sufficient to deprive a union of its formal-discussion right.[5] In this connection, as noted previously, the D.C. Circuit has stated that "a <span class="Italic">direct </span>conflict between the rights of an exclusive representative under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and the rights of an employee victim of discrimination should...<span class="Italic">presumably </span>be resolved in favor of the latter." 316 F.3d at 286 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12 (emphasis added)). The D.C. Circuit also has stated that it did not "foreclose the possibility that an employee's objection to union presence <span class="Italic">could </span>create a 'direct' conflict that should be resolved in favor of the employee <span class="Italic">as described in footnote 12 of NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12." <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 316 F.3d at 287 (emphasis added). The referenced footnote from <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>states that "Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, provides that <span class="Italic">the right of an aggrieved employee to complete relief <span id="page_1464"></span></span>takes priority over the general interests of the bargaining unit." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, the Authority noted the judge's undisputed finding that the employee did not object to the union president's presence at EEO settlement discussions. <span class="Italic">See </span>54 FLRA at 733. However, the Authority did not hold that an employee's mere objection, without more, would provide a sufficient basis for denying a union's statutory right to be present at EEO settlement discussions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, the Judge found, based on credited testimony, that the employee told the Respondent's EO Director that "the Union's presence would be a waste of time[,]" and the employee checked a box on an ADR election form to indicate that he did not want the Union to be present. Neither the employee's comments to the EO Director nor his marking on the ADR election form cites any statutory "rights" or explains why the Union's presence would interfere with any such rights. We find that, absent such an explanation, the employee's comments to the EO Director and his marking on the form are not sufficient to demonstrate a direct conflict between the Union's statutory right to be present and any individual rights, including the right to complete relief in the EEO process. Thus, we find that the Respondent had no basis for relying on the employee's comments to find such a direct conflict and to thereby deny the Union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to attend.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, at the hearing, the employee testified that he did not want the Union to be present at the mediation session because he: (1) was upset that the Union previously had refused to take one of his grievances to arbitration; and (2) believed that the Union was entitled to be present and the mediation and was curious to see how the Respondent would react to his objection. As discussed above, the Judge found that these alleged motivations were "of no consequence[&#8197;]" because the employee did not communicate them to the Respondent. Even assuming that it is appropriate to consider these alleged motivations in assessing whether there was a direct conflict between the respective rights of the Union and the employee, they do not establish the requisite direct conflict. In this connection, the employee's testimony demonstrates a personal preference that the Union not be present, as well as a desire to see how the Respondent would respond to his objection. It does not cite any individual right or explain how the Union's presence would interfere with, must less <span class="Italic">directly </span>interfere with, any right. Moreover, we note that, during the hearing, the employee specifically testified that his objection was "not based on any concerns over confidentiality, privacy interests, or that the Union's presence would disrupt the mediation process." Thus, to the extent that it is appropriate to consider the employee's hearing testimony, that testimony does not demonstrate the requisite direct conflict between any identified employee rights and the Union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to attend the mediation session.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed above, we find that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the employee's objection to the Union's presence at his mediation session did not demonstrate a direct conflict between any identified, individual right of the employee and the Union's statutory right to notice and an opportunity to be present.[6] As there is no dispute that the Respondent failed to give the Union notice and an opportunity to be present, as required by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, we conclude that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute as alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The dissent's claim that this case demonstrates "at least two specific 'conflicts' between the employee's rights and those of the Union" is unpersuasive. As for the first asserted conflict--that the employee "chose not to have the Union present as an exercise of his rights under Title VII to seek his own resolution of his own claim of discrimination[,]" <span class="Italic">id.</span>--there is no basis to conclude that the Union's presence during the mediation session would affect the employee's pursuit of his discrimination claim. In this regard, the Union would not attend as the employee's representative and would have no right to interfere with settlement efforts. As for the second asserted conflict--that the employee had the right under &#x00A7; 7102 of the Statute to "refrain from" assisting the Union--no party has raised this statutory argument. In addition, there is no basis for concluding that an employee does anything to "assist" a union when an <span class="Italic">agency </span>complies with its obligation under the Statute to afford a union its right to attend a formal discussion.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA also affirmed its commitment to treating EEO mediation sessions as formal meetings, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 436th Air Lift Wing, Dover AFB and AFGE Local 1709</span>, 57 FLRA 304, 306-10 (2001), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 436th AW v. FLRA</span>, 316 F.3d 280 (D.C. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained below, we find that the mediation session of the EEO complaint was a formal discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In addition, we find that the Respondent has failed to establish that the presence of a union representative at a mediation session would conflict with EEOC regulations or the ADR Act. Therefore, we hold that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) by failing to provide the Union notice and an opportunity to be represented at that mediation session.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Mediation Session Was a "Formal Discussion" Within the Meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), there must be (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 723; <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs.</span> <span class="Italic">Admin., </span>48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) <span class="Italic">(GSA). </span>It is undisputed that the Respondent engaged in a discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), and, thus, we will not address this requirement. However, the Respondent does challenge the Judge's conclusions regarding the other three requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The Mediation Session Was "Formal"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's argument that a mediation session, by its very nature, cannot be a formal discussion lacks merit because the Authority has already determined otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Luke, </span>54 FLRA 716. The fact that the EEOC has required agencies to establish ADR procedures in an effort to informally resolve complaints is not determinative of whether a meeting to discuss such a complaint is a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). Rather, that determination can be reached only after application of the Authority's formal discussion criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the EEOC has opined, in the comments announcing its ADR rule, that the activity conducted in connection with an agency ADR program during the EEO process would not be a formal discussion within the meaning of the Civil Service Reform Act. 64 Fed. Reg. 37,644, 37,645 (1999). However, we reject the Respondent's argument that <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>requires that we defer to the EEOC's view in this regard. First, interpretations which lack the force of law--do not warrant <span class="Italic">Chevron-</span>style deference. <span class="Italic">Christensen v. Harris County, </span>120 S. Ct. 1655, 1657 (2000). The EEOC's comments in its Federal Register notice do not have the force of law. Second, <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>only grants an agency deference when it is offering a permissible construction of the statute which it administers. 467 U.S. at 837. The passage quoted from the Federal Register reflects that the EEOC has interpreted the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute which is administered by the Authority, not the EEOC.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether this particular mediation was a formal discussion, the Authority has advised that the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined and has listed a number of relevant factors: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) the length of the discussions; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">GSA, </span>48 FLRA at 1355. We note that [t]hese factors are illustrative. <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, 54 FLRA at 724.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining the totality of the circumstances, we find that the discussion in this case closely parallels the one that occurred in <span class="Italic">Luke. </span>In both cases: the meetings were scheduled more than a week in advance; the established purpose of the meetings was to mediate and resolve an EEO complaint; the attendees were provided information concerning the mediation by the mediator in advance of the meeting; the meetings were held away from the employee's work site; attendees at the meetings included an attorney from the Judge Advocate's Office, who was not the bargaining unit employee's supervisor, and a facilitator, who attempted to resolve the EEO complaint at issue; and, the meetings followed a traditional mediation format. <span class="Italic">See Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 724-28. In addition, in this case the attendees signed a confidentiality agreement in advance of the meeting a fact that evidences the formal nature of the mediation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">Luke</span> fail. First, the Respondent points out that unlike the mediation in <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, attendance at the mediation here was voluntary. However, in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the Authority concluded that the discussion was formal even if attendance were not mandatory. 54 FLRA at 728. Second, the Respondent notes that unlike the mediation in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the meeting here was held off of agency premises. Again, this is beside the point because both here and in <span class="Italic">Luke </span>the relevant fact is that the meeting was held outside the employee's immediate work area. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 726. As the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>[m]eetings held outside an employee's immediate work area are associated with formality, while those held in the work area are not<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Respondent states that the agency's EEO Counselor attended the mediation in <span class="Italic">Luke </span>but did not do so here. However, in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the Authority did not find that the EEO counselor was a management representative and therefore did not find the counselor's attendance relevant to the formality factor regarding what management representatives attended the meeting. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 724. Fourth, the Respondent points out that here, unlike in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the complainant called for the mediation session. Although it is correct that pursuant to EEO regulations, Mr. Jones initiated the mediation of his complaint, the Respondent was involved in setting up the mediation, e.g., coordinating available dates, scheduling the <span id="page_1465"></span>meeting at least a week in advance, arranging for the session to take place at a local hotel. Accordingly, the meeting was called with extensive involvement by the Respondent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent argues that the one hour during which the parties were all together actually consisted of four separate sessions spread throughout the day, each lasting approximately 15-minutes. The fact that the parties met jointly for several short periods does not undermine the formality of the meeting. Pursuant to Authority precedent, even one meeting of short duration has been held to be a formal discussion under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Office of Program Operations</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 15 FLRA 70, 73 (1984) (finding a meeting that only lasted about 15 minutes to be formal). Indeed in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the mediation had no sessions involving all participants and was still found to be a formal discussion. <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 725.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, considering the totality of the circumstances and Authority precedent, we are persuaded that the evidence supports the Judge's conclusion that the mediation session of the EEO complaint was a formal discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Respondent's Attorney Was a "Representative of the Agency"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Just as in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the Respondent's representative during the discussion was an attorney from the Judge Advocate General's Office...[who] had settlement authority to resolve the case. 54 FLRA at 730. As such, Captain Rockenbach is appropriately characterized as a representative of the agency in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that Captain Rockenbach was not Mr.&#x2003;Jones's supervisor and that attorneys representing a client do not become representatives of the agency. As the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>nothing in section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute requires that a 'representative' be a supervisor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. And, consistent with the Authority's longstanding precedent, attorneys who are representing clients can be representatives of the agency for the purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See VAMC, Long</span> <span class="Italic">Beach, Cal., </span>41 FLRA 1370, 1379 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd, </span>16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The Mediation Concerned a "Grievance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Complaints Pursued Through the EEOC's Procedures Are "Grievances"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on the 9th Circuit's reversals of the Authority in <span class="Italic">Luke</span> and <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Service Center, Fresno, California v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1983), the Respondent argues that EEO complaints pursued through a statutory procedure are not grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority has heretofore rejected this argument. <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 730; <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal</span>., 52 FLRA 1039 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the 9th Circuit's recent reversal of <span class="Italic">Luke,</span> we take this opportunity to thoroughly review this issue in this case. Our review of the language, legislative history, and purpose of the Statute supports the conclusion that complaints pursued through the EEOC procedures are grievances. Accordingly, we reject the Respondent's arguments regarding this issue and do not acquiesce in the 9th Circuit's view of the scope of the term grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;The Express Language of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute broadly provides for union attendance at meetings concerning any grievance. To ascertain the scope of the term grievance in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the first place to look is the Statute's express definition of grievance in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The express language of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) provides no basis for limiting the definition of grievance, as the Respondent argues here, so as to exclude complaints brought pursuant to EEO statutory procedures. To the contrary, the Statute defines grievance as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">any </span>complaint--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;by any employee concerning <span class="Italic">any</span> matter relating to the employment of the employee[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9)(A) (emphasis added). By its plain terms, the Statute's broad definition of grievance encompasses <span class="Italic">any</span> employment-related complaint, regardless of the forum in which the complaint may be pursued. Congress's repeated use of the modifier any underscores its intent that the definition be as inclusive as possible. In this case, Mr. Jones's complaint that he was the victim of illegal discrimination by his employing agency is undeniably a complaint by [an] employee concerning [a] matter relating to [his employment], i.e., a grievance under the Statute's definition. In light of the above analysis, we do not acquiesce in the Ninth Circuit's determination that the formal discussion right does not apply during EEOC proceedings because they are discrete and separate from the grievance process to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103 and 7114 are directed, <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> <span class="Italic">Fresno v. FLRA, </span>706 F.2d at 1024. Further, we reject the Respondent's argument that the provisions of the Statute have no bearing upon EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Respondent's arguments, &#x00A7; 7121 also provides no basis for limiting the definition of grievance. On the contrary, &#x00A7; 7121 indicates specifically that a grievance includes both those complaints filed through the NGP and those filed through alternative statutory procedures. Subsections 7121(d) and (e) provide that aggrieved employees affected by illegal discrimination may raise these matters under either a statutory procedure or a NGP, but not both. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(d), (e). As the D.C. Circuit held with regard these subsections:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]f the term "grievance" referred only to disputes pursued through [NGPs], &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) would not be worded to require an <span class="Italic">"aggrieved </span>employee" (emphasis supplied) to elect to pursue a remedy under either a negotiated procedure or a statutory procedure. An "aggrieved employee"--<span class="Italic">i.e., </span>one with a grievance--would by definition necessarily pursue his grievance under a negotiated procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d 1181, 1187 (D.C. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(a)'s reference to &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) in discussing the scope and exclusivity of NGPs also indicates that a grievance includes complaints filed under statutory procedures. Section 7121(a) provides that any collective bargaining agreement shall include procedures for the settlement of grievances. These procedures, however, are not entirely exclusive. Section 7121(a) states in this regard that NGPs are the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances that fall within the NGP's coverage, [e]xcept as provided in subsections (d) [and] (e)...of this section. Accordingly, this section recognizes that discrimination complaints filed under statutory procedures are in fact grievances and provides that this class of grievances may be processed through either a contractual or a statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d at 1187-88 ([T]he statutory procedures referred to in &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) are also procedures for resolving <span class="Italic">grievances.).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the grievances referred to in &#x00A7; 7114 must be broader than the grievances that are processed through the NGP pursuant to &#x00A7; 7121. Union presence is already assured throughout the NGP, pursuant to &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C)(i) and (ii). If &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)'s grievance was limited to grievances processed through the NGP, then the formal discussion right set out in &#x00A7; 7114 would merely duplicate the rights provided in &#x00A7; 7121(b)(1)(C). Such a reading would render that portion of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) superfluous. <span class="Italic">See Kawaauhau v. Geiger, </span>523 U.S. 57, 63 (1998) (Court hesitant to adopt interpretation of statute that renders superfluous portion of same law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;The Legislative History of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute's legislative history also does not support the Respondent's position. The Respondent points to a passage in the House Report concerning &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). Commenting on what was to become the definition of grievance, the House Report stated that [i]t should be noted that, although this subsection is virtually all-inclusive in defining 'grievance' section 7121 excludes certain grievances from being processed under a negotiated grievance procedure, thereby limiting the net effect of the term. H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, at 40 (1978).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This passage, however, provides no support for the proposition that EEO complaints are not grievances within the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). First, although the passage indicates that &#x00A7; 7121 excludes <span class="Italic">some grievances</span> from coverage under the NGP, the term grievance is not limited to matters covered under the NGP. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d at 1188 ([t]he only plausible reading of this history is that &#x00A7; 7121 ensures that some <span class="Italic">grievances</span> cannot be processed under [an NGP].). By recognizing that some grievances are <span class="Italic">excluded </span>from the NGP, the passage makes clear that the term grievance should not be limited to matters covered by an NGP. Second, to the extent the passage supports a narrowed effect of the term grievance, it does so with respect only to the NGP in &#x00A7; 7121, not regarding the formal discussion right provided for by &#x00A7; 7114.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;The Purpose of the Statute's Provisions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent and the Ninth Circuit narrowly view the union's role in the workplace, relegating unions to the role of mere grievance-processors.<span class="Italic"> See IRS, Fresno, </span>706 F.2d at 1024-25. This perspective ignores important policies and purposes behind the Statute's formal discussion right. First, contrary to the Respondent's argument, unions have an established interest in how allegations of discrimination are dealt with and resolved, regardless of the forum in which the employee chooses to lodge the complaint. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d at 1188. Here, the union has an undeniable representational interest in, among other things, disciplinary action taken against Mr. Jones even though Jones did not challenge the matter through the NGP<span class="Italic">. See AFGE, Local 1345 v. FLRA, </span>793 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (recognizing union's &#x00A7; 7114 interest in discipline afforded bargaining unit employees, even though the employees did not file a grievance or seek union representation concerning the discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the processing of an individual complaint through EEO procedures can have an effect on the entire bargaining unit, which the union represents. <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, 54 FLRA at 731. As explained by the Tenth Circuit, by providing formal discussion rights for discrete grievances and not just general personnel policies, the Statute recognizes that the resolution of an individual employee complaint may have an impact on the rights of other unit employees. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Denver, Colorado v. FLRA, </span>3 F.3d 1386, 1390 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1466"></span>Finally, contrary to the Respondent's suggestion, neither the Authority nor the courts have ruled that unions have an absolute right to attend discussions about EEO complaints. Both the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Authority have recognized that an appropriate resolution is required in the event of a direct conflict between individual and institutional rights. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d at 1189 n.12; <span class="Italic">see U.S. Dep't of Justice (Ray Brook, NY),</span> 29 FLRA 584, 590 (1987) (if there is a conflict between rights under section 7114(a)(2)(A) and those under other statutes, we will consider that conflict in determining whether section 7114(a)(2)(A) has been violated), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA, </span>865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Here, the Respondent does not assert that such a direct conflict exists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;EEO Complaints, when Contractually Excluded from the NGP, Remain "Grievances" under the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's reliance on the CBA's exclusion of EEO complaints from the NGP is misplaced. As the Authority has previously held, [t]he statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, 54 FLRA at 730. A particular subject matter may be a grievance for the purpose of a union's formal discussion right even though it cannot be processed through the contractual grievance procedure. As noted above, the language of &#x00A7; 7121(a) fully supports this analysis through the use of the phrase grievances which fall within [an NGP's] coverage. This wording necessarily means that there may be grievances that are outside the NGP's coverage. Any other interpretation would render the phrase meaningless.<span class="Italic"> See United States v. Nordic Village, Inc., </span>503 U.S. 30, 36 (1992) ([A] statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect.) (citations omitted). In this case, EEO matters remain grievances for the purpose of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), they just cannot be processed through the NGP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, there is no support for the Respondent's assertion that the exclusion of EEO disputes from the NGP equates to a waiver of the Union's interest in such matters. Given the availability of the federally subsidized EEO statutory procedure, the Union might have agreed to exclude such matters from the NGP in order to avoid the expenditure of resources required to process an EEO grievance to arbitration. A union might well be willing to agree to exclude such matters from the NGP in reliance on its &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) right to attend formal discussions concerning EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Presence of a Union Representative at the Mediation of an EEO Complaint Would Not Conflict with EEOC Regulations or the ADR Act</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Luke</span>, the Authority specifically concluded that the presence of a union representative at the mediation of an EEO complaint was not inconsistent with either EEOC regulations or the ADR Act. 54 FLRA at 732-33. The Respondent's arguments do not undercut the Authority's previous determination. Specifically, the Respondent has pointed to no provision in the EEOC's regulations or the ADR Act that precludes union attendance at the mediation of an EEO complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we reject the Respondent's argument that the Union is not a party to the dispute under the ADR Act and therefore not entitled to attend mediation sessions. Under that Act, party includes those entitled as of right to be admitted. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(3) (incorporated by reference in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 571(10)(A)). As discussed above, we have determined that this mediation session was a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and therefore the Union has a statutory right to be admitted. Alternatively, even if the Union is not a party, the ADR Act contemplates the participation of nonparty participants in mediation sessions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 574(a)(1), (e). Although the term nonparty participants is not defined in the ADR Act, we see no reason why the term could not include the Union in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent does, however, raise a number of hypothetical problems not present in this case which might arise in another ADR session involving EEO complaints. For example, the Respondent argues that a union might not agree to confidentiality. But this argument is mere conjecture because the Respondent did not offer the Union the opportunity to attend this ADR session on the condition of agreeing to confidentiality, and as such, the Union did not refuse to agree to confidentiality. Similarly, the Respondent suggests that union representation might chill candid discussions. However, there is no evidence of any such potential chilling effect in this case. Finally, the Respondent argues that some ADR discussions might implicate private information protected from disclosure under another statute. Again, there is no evidence that any such improper disclosure would have occurred here had a union representative attended the discussion. Such issues are more appropriately addressed in an actual case when squarely presented. <span class="Italic">See Navegar, Inc. v. United States, </span>103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (declining to decide cases before they are ripe avoids adjudicating abstract disagreements, enhances judicial economy, and ensures that an adequate record exists to support an informed decision) (internal quotations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also FAA,</span> <span class="Italic">Renton, Wash</span>., 51 FLRA 986, 992 n.8 (1996) (leaving certain questions unanswered and noting that these issues could be resolved when an appropriate case is presented).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 436th AW v. FLRA</span>, 316 F.3d 280, 281-87 (D.C. Cir. 2003), enforced FLRA's ULP decision, firmly confirming that the union should have been on notice of, and had the opportunity to participate in, the EEO settlement process:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The 1972 amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act extend coverage of the Act to include the employment practices of the federal government.&#x2003;Pub. L. No. 92261, &#x00A7; 11, 86 Stat. 111 (1972) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 (2000)). The authority for enforcing the Civil Rights Act resides with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"). 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-4 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under EEOC regulations, an employee is required to attempt to resolve his complaint on an informal basis (e.g., pre-complaint counseling) before filing a formal complaint. Pursuant to the federal sector EEO program, agencies are responsible for investigating complaints filed against them by their employees. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(a) (2002). Mediation is often available in appropriate cases to assist the parties in resolving their disputes. In this case, the Air Force had a contract with Resolution Group to provide mediation services. The contract provides that Resolution Group will provide its services pursuant to the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 571 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (2000) ("ADR Act").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations encourage agencies to settle EEO cases.&#x2003;They are encouraged to "incorporate alternative dispute resolution [ADR] techniques into their investigative efforts" in order to promote early resolution of disputes. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.108(b). They are instructed to make "reasonable efforts" to voluntarily settle disputes as early as possible. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.603.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC regulations provide that when a complaint of discrimination is covered by a collective-bargaining agreement ("CBA") that permits such complaints to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, the person filing the complaint "must elect to raise the matter under either part 1614 or the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a). On the other hand, "[w]hen a person is not covered by a [CBA] that permits allegations of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, allegations of discrimination shall be processed as complaints under [EEOC regulations part 1614]." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 1614.109(e) provides that attendance at hearings is limited to those with direct knowledge relating to the complaint. Furthermore, "[h]earings are part of the investigative process and are thus closed to the public." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">EEOC Management Directive 110 ("MD 110") is a document issued by the EEOC to provide federal agencies with EEOC policies, procedures, and guidance relating to the processing of employment discrimination complaints governed by part 1614 of EEOC regulations. EEOC regulations and MD 110 require that all agencies establish an ADR program to be utilized during the pre-complaint process as well as during the formal complaint process. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.102(b)(2); MD 110, Ch. 3, &#x00A7; I.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">MD 110 also provides that agencies must be mindful of the information disclosure prohibitions imposed by the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a (2000). Pre- and post-complaint information is contained in a system of records that are subject to the Privacy Act. This information "cannot be disclosed to a union unless the complaining party elects union representation or gives his/her written consent." MD 110, Ch. 3, &#x00A7; II(A)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Confidentiality is an essential component to the success of agency ADR proceedings.&#x2003;MD 110, Ch. 3, &#x00A7; VII(A)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Parties who know that their ADR statements and information are kept confidential will feel free to be frank and forthcoming during the proceeding, without fear that such information may later be used against them. To maintain that degree of confidentiality, there must be explicit limits placed on the dissemination of ADR information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id. </span>Agencies are encouraged to issue their own written policies to protect the confidentiality of ADR proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (the "Act"), provides a general framework for regulating labor-management relations for the federal government. The Act provides that CBAs shall contain procedures for the settlement of grievances. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). However, the parties to a CBA can exclude any subject from the coverage of the CBA and its grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Act regulates the manner in which CBAs are negotiated as well as the manner in which a bargaining unit employee may challenge adverse personnel actions.&#x2003;Section 7114 of the Act defines the right of representation of the employees in the grievance process. It provides that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]n exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their <span id="page_1467"></span>representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other general condition of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2). Section 7103(a)(9) defines what constitutes a "grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"[G]rievance" means any complaint (A) by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;by any labor organization concerning any matter relating to the employment of any employee; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(C)&#x2003;by an employee, labor organization, or agency concerning--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(i)&#x2003;the effect or interpretation, or a claim of breach, of a [CBA]; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The matters to be processed under the CBA's grievance procedures are expressly limited by section 7121(d) of the Act, which preserves the employee's right to proceed with a discrimination claim through existing statutory schemes. Section 7121(d), similarly to part 1614 of EEOC regulations, provides for the aggrieved employee to elect his means of seeking relief. If an "aggrieved employee" is affected by a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) (2000) (incorporating the Civil Rights Act) that also falls within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure, the employee "may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Section 7121(d) notes that selection of the negotiated grievance procedure does not preclude the aggrieved employee from requesting EEOC review of a final decision in a matter "involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the [EEOC]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d). Thus, section 7121(d) provides for alternative avenues of relief, and the EEOC has final review authority over any decision resulting from the grievance procedure involving discrimination within the EEOC's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Elizey Jones, Jr., a member of the bargaining unit of employees at Dover AFB, filed a formal EEO complaint of discrimination pursuant to part 1614 of the EEOC regulations in November of 1999 in connection with a suspension that had been imposed upon him. Jones did not file a complaint pursuant to the CBA grievance procedure because the CBA explicitly excludes claims of discrimination from the grievance procedure. Labor-Management Contract between Dover Air Force Base, Delaware and Local 1709, AFGE at Art. 22, &#x00A7; 3 ("The negotiated Grievance procedures will not cover/pertain to grievances or appeals concerning...EEO complaints.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Jones requested that the Air Force initiate mediation of his complaint pursuant to EEOC regulations.&#x2003;The Air Force referred this request to the Resolution Group. Kathy Fragnoli, owner of the Resolution Group, was assigned to mediate the dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the mediation, Jones and the agency representative, Captain Rockenbach, signed a confidentiality agreement in order to preserve the confidentiality of the mediation. On January 18, 2000, mediator Fragnoli, Jones, and Rockenbach participated in a mediation proceeding for approximately six hours. About 20% of the time was spent in joint sessions, the rest in individual caucuses. The parties failed to reach a settlement. Jones' union, Local 1709 of the American Federation of Government Employees, was neither notified of, nor given the opportunity to attend, the mediation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Local 1709 filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the FLRA, and a hearing was held before Administrative Law Judge Garvin Lee Oliver (the "ALJ"). The ALJ concluded that the mediation proceedings constituted a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Act and that the Air Force violated that section by failing to provide Local 1709 notice and an opportunity to be represented at the mediation. The ALJ found that the mediation concerned a grievance within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), relying on an FLRA decision that formal EEO complaints are grievances within section 7114(a)(2)(A) notwithstanding a negotiated grievance procedure that excludes discrimination complaints. <span class="Italic">See Luke Air Force Base, Ariz</span>., 54 F.L.R.A. 716, 1998 WL 537325 (1998), <span class="Italic">rev'd, </span>208 F.3d 221 (9th Cir. 1999) (Table). The ALJ also concluded that the presence of a union representative at the mediation of an EEO complaint would not conflict with EEOC regulations or the ADR Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force filed exceptions to the decision of the ALJ.&#x2003;The FLRA agreed with the ALJ that the Air Force violated the Act by failing to provide Local 1709 with notice and an opportunity to be heard. The FLRA found that the mediation concerned a grievance. In doing so, the FLRA focused on the language of section 7103(a)(9) which states that a grievance is "any complaint...by any employee concerning <span class="Italic">any </span>matter relating to the employment of the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9) (emphasis added). The FLRA found that this broad definition included any employment-related complaint, regardless of the forum chosen.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA rejected the Ninth Circuit's determination that the formal discussion right does not apply during EEOC proceedings because those complaints are "discrete and separate from the grievance process to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103 and 7114 are directed<span class="Italic">." IRS Fresno, </span>706 F.2d at 1024. The FLRA also rejected the Air Force's argument that section 7121 provides a basis for limiting the definition of grievance. The FLRA relied on this Court's decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1985) <span class="Italic">("NTEU"), </span>in which this Court held that section 7121 provides that a grievance includes both those complaints filed pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure and those filed pursuant to alternative statutory procedures. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1187. The FLRA, after reviewing the legislative history of the Act, concluded that the term grievance should not be limited to matters covered by a negotiated grievance procedure. Moreover, the FLRA held that to the extent the legislative history supports a narrower definition of grievance, it does so only with respect to section 7121, not the formal discussion right provisions of section 7114.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA rejected the Air Force's arguments that unions have no institutional interest in the processing of EEO complaints. The FLRA stated that unions have an interest in how such complaints are resolved and that their interest does not depend on the forum in which the employee files his complaint. The FLRA, citing <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs v. FLRA, </span>3 F.3d 1386, 1390 (10th Cir. 1993), noted that the resolution of one individual complaint may bear on the rights of other bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also rejected the Air Force's argument that the exclusion of EEO disputes from the negotiated grievance procedure amounts to a waiver of any rights Local 1709 has with respect to such matters. The FLRA remarked that Local 1709 may have excluded these matters simply to avoid some of the expenses related to processing EEO grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA found no conflict between Local 1709's formal discussion right and EEOC regulations or the ADR Act. The FLRA found no EEOC regulation precluding union attendance. With respect to the ADR Act, the FLRA found that Local 1709 was a party under the ADR Act because it was "entitled as of right to be admitted," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(3), pursuant to its formal discussion rights under section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Act. In the alternative, the FLRA ruled that the ADR Act contemplates the attendance and participation of "nonparty participants." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 574(a)(1), (e). Lastly, the FLRA dismissed the Air Force's remaining arguments as conjectural. The Air Force had cited potential problems with the FLRA's rule that the FLRA thought purely hypothetical in the present case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force petitioned for review here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(9) defines "grievance" as "any complaint...by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). Although the Air Force contends that the EEO proceeding initiated by Jones is not a grievance within the meaning of section 7103(a)(9), our decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>demonstrates otherwise. <span class="Italic">See</span> 774 F.2d at 1186-87 (holding that a grievance includes both those complaints filed pursuant to a negotiated grievance procedure and those filed pursuant to alternative statutory procedures). The Air Force suggests that <span class="Italic">NTEU is </span>distinguishable because it involved a Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") proceeding rather than an EEO proceeding; however, our analysis in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>relied upon the text, structure, and legislative history of the Act and did not rest on the type of grievance in question. <span class="Italic">See</span> 774 F.2d at 1185-88. We find no reason to distinguish <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>; accordingly, we will read the term "grievance" as we did in that case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the present case involves a "grievance" as defined in section 7103, Local 1709's section 7114 formal discussion rights are triggered, and we turn to the issue of whether the FLRA's construction of section 7114(a)(2)(A) passes <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> muster. In interpreting an agency's enabling or organic statute, we "employ[&#8197;] traditional tools of statutory construction" to determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural</span> <span class="Italic">Res. Def. </span>Council, 467 U.S. 837, 842, 843 n.9, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 2782 n.9, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984). We "must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress"; if the statute is unambiguous on the question at issue, our inquiry ends there. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 842-43, 104 S. Ct. at 2781 (<span class="Italic">Chevron </span>step one). Where "the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 843, 104 S. Ct. at 2782 (<span class="Italic">Chevron </span>step two). The Supreme Court has stated that the FLRA is entitled to "considerable deference when it exercises its special function of applying the general provisions of the [Act] to the complexities of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">National Fed'n of Fed. Employees, Local 1309 v. Dept of the Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 99, 119 S. Ct. 1003, 1011, 143 L. Ed.2d 171 (1999) (quotation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(A) provides that a union has a right to be represented at "any formal discussion between one or more representatives of the agency and one or more employees in the unit or their representatives concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practices or other <span id="page_1468"></span>general condition of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). The FLRA has construed this language as providing Local 1709 the right to have a union representative present at the mediation of a formal EEO complaint filed by Jones, one of Local 1709's members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of section 7114(a)(2)(A) is quite broad. Because it does not yield a clear and unambiguous interpretation, we move past step one to step two of the <span class="Italic">Chevron </span>inquiry. The FLRA's construction is a natural reading of the broad statutory language. In addition, the FLRA's construction is supported by our decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>774 F.2d at 1189 (holding that section 7114(a)(2)(A) provides "that an exclusive representative has the right to be present at <span class="Italic">any </span>formal discussion of a grievance between management and a bargaining unit employee"). Nevertheless, the Air Force argues that FLRA's construction is impermissible, urging the Court to follow the Ninth Circuit's reading of section 7114(a)(2)(A) in <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno, </span>706 F.2d 1019. In that case, the Ninth Circuit held that a pre-complaint conciliation conference was not a grievance, explaining that EEOC procedures are not controlled by [section] 7114(a)(2)(A) because they are discrete and separate from the grievance process to which [sections] 7103 and 7114 are directed<span class="Italic">." IRS Fresno, </span>706 F.2d at 1024. The problem with this argument is that we previously disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's narrow reading of section 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188. Furthermore, as we pointed out in <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno </span>appears "to be based primarily on its conclusion that the precomplaint conference did not constitute a 'formal' discussion" rather than on its brief analysis of the grievance issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As it did with the grievance issue, the Air Force attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> on the grounds that EEO proceedings utilized by Jones here are a different vehicle than MSPB proceedings utilized in <span class="Italic">NTEU. </span>The Air Force notes that the Ninth Circuit has treated EEO proceedings and MSPB proceedings differently. <span class="Italic">Compare IRS Fresno</span>, 706 F.2d 1019 (finding no formal discussion right in EEO proceeding) <span class="Italic">with Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr. v. FLRA, </span>16 F.3d 1526 (9th Cir. 1994) (finding a formal discussion right in MSPB proceeding). However, the Ninth Circuit itself has noted that our reasoning in <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>rejecting the <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno </span>analysis, is more persuasive than that court's own reasoning in <span class="Italic">IRS Fresno. Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., </span>16 F.3d at 1534 n.4.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force also attempts to evade <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>by emphasizing the primacy of an aggrieved employee's rights in the context of a discrimination claim. The Air Force notes that in <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>we acknowledged in a footnote that "in the case of grievances arising out of alleged discrimination...Congress has explicitly decided that a conflict between the rights of identifiable victims of discrimination and the interests of the bargaining unit must be resolved in favor of the former." 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12. However, the point we made in footnote 12 of <span class="Italic">NTEU </span>is that "a <span class="Italic">direct</span> conflict between the rights of an exclusive representative under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and the <span class="Italic">rights </span>of an employee victim of discrimination should...presumably be resolved in favor of the latter<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Such a direct conflict is not present here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force argues that there is a conflict between the FLRA's construction of section 7114(a)(2)(A) and the confidentiality protections of both sections of the ADR Act (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 574(a) &#x0026; (b)) and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a. This argument fails because neither of the statutes cited by the Air Force prohibits union attendance at ADR proceedings. The provisions of the ADR Act cited by the Air Force concern only the confidentiality of communications made at an ADR proceeding and do not address what persons or parties may attend an ADR proceeding. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 574. Similarly, the Privacy Act concerns the confidentiality of records rather than what parties may attend an ADR proceeding, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, and this case does not present a situation where the presence of a union representative in an ADR proceeding would result in the revelation of confidential information in violation of the Privacy Act. In other words, neither the ADR Act nor the Privacy Act creates a conflict (much less a direct conflict) with section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Air Force also argues that the FLRA's construction of section 7114(a)(2)(A) is impermissible because of EEOC regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.109(e), which provides that attendance at agency hearings is "limited to persons determined by the administrative judge to have direct knowledge relating to the complaint." However, as the Air Force acknowledged at oral argument, this regulation says nothing about what happens at ADR proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Left without a statute or regulation as a hook, the Air Force attempts to hang its hat on an agency manual, MD 110. Section VII of Chapter 3 of MD 110 addresses what it refers to as ADR "core principles." It states: "Confidentiality must be maintained by the parties, by any agency employees involved in the ADR proceeding and in the implementation of an ADR resolution...." MD 110, Ch. 3, &#x00A7; VII(A)(3). The Air Force contends that union presence at ADR proceedings would undermine the confidentiality of the process. This argument amounts to nothing more than the Air Force's doubt that union representatives can keep confidential matters confidential. Union representatives are often in the position of having to maintain confidentiality. More importantly, even assuming that an inconsistency between an agency manual and a statute constitutes a conflict, the Air Force again fails to show a conflict with the FLRA's construction of section 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is important to note one other reason why there is no direct conflict in this case.&#x2003;As the Air Force conceded, there is no evidence that Jones (the employee) objected to union presence at the mediation proceeding. We do not foreclose the possibility that an employee's objection to union presence could create a "direct" conflict that should be resolved in favor of the employee as described in footnote 12 of <span class="Italic">NTEU, </span>774 F.2d at 1189 n.12. As there is no conflict present in the case before us, the FLRA's construction is permissible. Accordingly, the Air Force committed an unfair labor practice in failing to give Local 1709 notice of and the opportunity to be present at the mediation.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA restated its position regarding postcomplaint settlements and mediation in EEO cases in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Luke AFB and AFGE Local 1547</span>, 58 FLRA 528, 531-36 (2003), perpetuating the rule of the original <span class="Italic">Luke AFB</span> decision in the controversy over EEO settlements and formal discussion requirements, and likely perpetuating the split in the circuits:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>57 FLRA at 306; <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 723; <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., </span>48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) <span class="Italic">(GSA). </span>The Respondent challenges the Judge's decision on the following grounds: (1) the Authority lacks jurisdiction to address this matter since it involves proceedings governed by EEOC and its regulations; (2) the mediation and settlement discussions did not meet the formality requirements under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A); (3) the mediation and settlement discussions did not relate to or concern a grievance under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A); and (4) the Union's presence at such mediation and settlement sessions conflict with the ADRA and other statutes concerning confidentiality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first claim, we find that the Authority has jurisdiction to resolve the unfair labor practice complaint before us alleging a violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second claim, we find that the meetings at issue here meet the formality requirement of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the third claim, we conclude that the meetings concern a "grievance" for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the fourth claim, we reject the Respondent's claim that there is a conflict between the Union's institutional rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and the employee's individual rights under the ADRA and other statutes governing confidentiality that warrants exclusion of the Union from these sessions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Respondent violated the Statute as alleged in the complaint by failing to provide the Union notice of, and an opportunity to attend, the meetings in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Jurisdiction</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's claim that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to address this matter. Under &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(G) of the Statute, the Authority is authorized to conduct hearings and resolve complaints of unfair labor practices. Under &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute, the Authority has responsibility to investigate and conduct hearings regarding unfair labor practice allegations and to resolve such allegations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Charging Party filed a charge alleging that the Respondent committed an unfair labor practice by violating &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8). The General Counsel issued a complaint based on the charge. Nothing in the Respondent's arguments regarding the authority of the EEOC to examine allegations of discrimination limits or diminishes the Authority's responsibilities to determine, as authorized by the Statute, whether an agency has committed an unfair labor practice in the course of conducting formal discussions relating to a unit employee's formal EEO complaint<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Luke Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force Base, Ariz., </span>57 FLRA 730, 732 (2002). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Formality of the Meetings</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether meetings constitute formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined and the following illustrative factors are considered: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) the length of the discussions; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>57 FLRA at 307.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining the totality of the circumstances, we find that the three meetings at issue constitute formal discussions. Regarding the first meeting with the employee (the November 9 meeting), the following factors are persuasive on this point. First, the meeting was held by a JAG attorney, who the Respondent stipulated was management's representative with respect to this EEO complaint. Second, the Civilian <span id="page_1469"></span>Personnel Officer, who the Respondent stipulated was acting on behalf of the Respondent, was also present at the meeting. Third, the meeting had an agenda to discuss and resolve the EEO complaint. Fourth, the meeting was held in the Respondent's Legal Offices, away from the employee's work site.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the second meeting facilitated by the mediator on February 9, this meeting is similar to the mediation sessions held in <span class="Italic">Dover and Luke. </span>In this respect, the meeting had an agenda to mediate and resolve the EEO complaint; the meetings were held in the Respondent's Legal Offices, away from the employee's work site; attendees at the meeting included a Commander with authority to sign a settlement agreement on the Respondent's behalf, and a mediator, who attempted to resolve the complaint; the meeting followed a traditional mediation format, primarily consisting of individual caucuses with the parties and joint sessions; and the meeting was scheduled well in advance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, the third meeting on February 10 between the employee and JAG attorney was undisputably a continuation of the mediation session on February 9 and was held so that the employee could sign the settlement agreement, which had already been signed by the Commander the day before. Further, like the other two meetings, the February 10 meeting was held by a management representative (the JAG attorney who conducted the November 9 meeting); the meeting was held in the Respondent's Legal Offices, away from the employee's work site; the meeting was scheduled in advance; and the meeting had an agenda of resolving the EEO complaint and signing the settlement agreement by the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's arguments that the mediation sessions were not formal because the mediator was not an employee, supervisor or management representative of the Respondent and had no authority to change unit employees' conditions of employment. In <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the Authority found that since the respondent was represented at all times by a JAG attorney during the mediation sessions, it was unnecessary to address the respondent's contentions that the OCI investigator was not a management representative<span class="Italic">. Luke, 54 </span>FLRA at 724-25; <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>57 FLRA at 307. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Luke,</span> we find it unnecessary to determine the status of the OCI mediator in this case given the presence and involvement of the JAG attorney and Commander in the mediation sessions, both of whom the Respondent had stipulated were management representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we reject the Respondent's claim that the discussions were not formal because there was no management representative present during the mediation sessions except when the settlement agreement was signed and the mediator otherwise held individual sessions with the parties in separate rooms. As in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>the stipulation here reflects that in addition to short joint sessions during the course of the mediation, the mediator primarily held separate meetings with the parties in which she relayed their respective positions regarding proposed settlement terms. Moreover, it is evident that the employee and Commander were "engaged in responding to each other's settlement positions, and that they were no less engaged than if they had been speaking face-to-face," in the same room<span class="Italic">. Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 725-26.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, we reject the Respondent's claim that the mediation and settlement discussions were not formal because there was no formal agenda. As we previously held in <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>the agenda requirement is met to the extent the record evidence demonstrates that the mediation session to discuss the EEO complaint was planned in advance and had a set of clearly-defined objectives and procedures that were communicated to all the participants. 54 FLRA at 727-28. It is undisputed that all three meetings were planned in advance and that the objective in all three sessions was to resolve the EEO complaint. Lastly, we reject the Respondent's claim that the mediation and settlement discussions were not formal since attendance was not mandatory at any meeting. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>even if attendance were not mandatory, the other indicia of formality, as discussed above, support our conclusion that the three sessions were formal discussions. 54 FLRA at 728. Accordingly, we deny the Respondent's exception that these meetings were not formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Mediation Concerned a "Grievance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In asserting that EEO complaints pursued through a statutory procedure are not grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the Respondent maintains that the Ninth Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Luke AFB v. FLRA and IRS,</span> <span class="Italic">Fresno v. FLRA </span>should be controlling in this case. In <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>the Authority revisited and thoroughly reviewed the issue of whether EEO complaints pursued through a statutory appeals procedure are grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and decided to adhere to its view that the scope of the term "grievance" encompasses such complaints, based on the express language of the Statute, the legislative history of the Statute, and the purpose of the Statute's provision for union representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See Dover, </span>57 FLRA at 308-09. Similarly, in its recent decision affirming the Authority in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>the D.C. Circuit rejected the Ninth Circuit's precedent and reaffirmed its decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>that "grievance" encompasses complaints filed pursuant to a NGP and those filed pursuant to alternative statutory procedures. 316 F.3d at 285-86.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reaffirm the Authority's previous view set forth in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>as affirmed by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dover</span> <span class="Italic">AFB v. FLRA, </span>that the broad definition of "grievance" under the Statute encompasses complaints filed under a NGP as well as complaints filed under alternative statutory procedures of the EEOC.[12] For the reasons set forth in those decisions, and those that follow, we respectfully disagree with the Ninth Circuit's determination to the contrary that the formal discussion right under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) does not apply to complaints filed under EEOC's statutory procedure because they are discrete and separate from the grievance process.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;Since we find that the mediation and settlement discussions concerning the employee's formal EEO complaint concerned a "grievance" for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), we do not address the Respondent's claims that the mediation and settlement discussions did not involve general conditions of employment affecting the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's assertion that the D.C. Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>that the term "grievance" encompasses statutory appeal procedures is distinguishable from the Ninth Circuit cases since it involved an MSPB proceeding and not an EEO complaint under Title VII. In <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>the D.C. Circuit recently rejected this very argument, noting that its "analysis in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>relied upon the text, structure, and legislative history of the [Statute] and did not rest on the type of grievance in question." 316 F.3d at 285 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA, </span>774 F.2d at 1185-88).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's contention that when an employee elects under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute to pursue an EEO complaint pursuant to a statutory appeals procedure, the EEO complaint is no longer considered a "grievance" under the Statute for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). In particular, we affirm our finding that &#x00A7; 7121 demonstrates that a grievance encompasses complaints filed through the NGP as well as those filed under alternative statutory procedures, in light of the fact that &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) specifically provide that "aggrieved employees affected by illegal discrimination may raise these matters under either a statutory procedure or a NGP, but not both." 57 FLRA at 308. Section 7121(a) "recognizes that discrimination complaints filed under statutory procedures are in fact grievances and provides that this class of grievances may be processed through either a contractual or a statutory procedure<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 118788) ("[T]he statutory procedures referred to in &#x00A7; 7121(d) and (e) are also procedures for resolving grievances.") In <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>the D.C. Circuit affirmed our interpretation and its holding in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>that based upon the text, structure and legislative history of the Statute, the term grievance includes both complaints filed pursuant to a NGP and those filed pursuant to alternative statutory procedures. 316 F.3d at 285.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the same vein, we reject the Respondent's claim that the EEO complaint here does not concern a grievance given the exclusion of EEO claims from coverage under the parties' NGP. 57 FLRA at 309-10. In this regard, the Respondent maintains that by virtue of this exclusion of EEO claims from coverage under the NGP, "the [U]nion by contract had no right to be involved in the mediation" sessions in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Luke and Dover, </span>we affirm our previous holding that the statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Luke, </span>54 FLRA at 730; <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>57 FLRA at 309. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>a particular subject matter may be a grievance for the purpose of a union's formal discussion right even though it cannot be processed through the contractual grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, as previously explained in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>we reject any claim that the exclusion of EEO claims from the NGP is tantamount to a waiver of the Union's interest in such claims. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 310. Rather, the Union's agreement to exclude such matters from the NGP may represent the Union's decision to avoid the expenditure of funds in pursuing EEO grievances to arbitration given the availability of the federally subsidized EEO statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this regard, we have found that a union may agree to exclude such matters from the NGP in reliance on its right under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) to attend formal discussions involving EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny the Respondent's exceptions that for purposes of the formal representation right under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the term grievance does not include EEO complaints filed under EEOC's statutory appeal procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;ADRA and Other Laws Concerning Confidentiality</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's claims that affording the Union its &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) right to representation at mediation and settlement discussions concerning the formal EEO complaint in this case creates a conflict with the employee's right to confidentiality as reflected in the ADRA and other laws, rules or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addressing the ADRA and EEOC regulations in <span class="Italic">Luke and Dover, </span>the Authority concluded that the presence of a union representative at the mediation of an EEO complaint was not inconsistent with either the ADRA or EEOC regulations. In this respect, the Authority in <span class="Italic">Dover </span>concluded that, under the terms of the ADRA, whether a union is deemed a "party" <span id="page_1470"></span>or a "nonparty participant," the ADRA does not prohibit the union's attendance at a mediation session. Here, as in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>the Respondent "has pointed to no provision in the EEOC's regulations or the [ADRA] that precludes union attendance at the mediation of an EEO complaint<span class="Italic">." Id. </span>at 310. We also note that in its recent decision in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>the D.C. Circuit stated that it was not clear whether the ADRA was applicable, noting that the ADRA is voluntary and merely supplements, rather than limits, other available ADR techniques. <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>316 F.3d at 286 n.1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More specifically, we address the Respondent's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>and its argument that there is a direct conflict between the rights of the employee and the Union that must be resolved in favor of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, the Authority noted that "the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Authority have recognized that an appropriate resolution is required in the event of a direct conflict between individual and institutional rights." <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12).[13] <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Corr. Inst. (Ray Brook N.Y.)</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 590 (1987) (if there is a conflict between rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and those under other statutes, the Authority will consider that conflict in determining whether section &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) has been violated), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA,</span> 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[13]&#x2003;As relevant here, the court stated in note 12 that "a <span class="Italic">direct</span> conflict between the rights of an exclusive representative under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and the <span class="Italic">rights </span>of an employee victim of discrimination should also presumably be resolved in favor of the latter." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12 (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's finding that the facts of this case do not present any conflict, let alone a direct conflict, between the Union's institutional rights and the employee's rights to confidentiality in mediation and settlement discussions. Further, the Respondent's arguments on this point do not dispute the lack of a direct conflict. Rather, the Respondent presents hypothetical situations where the Union's presence at mediation and settlement discussions could create potential conflicts with certain laws governing confidentiality. Moreover, we also note that, as the D.C. Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA </span>in response to "the Air Force's doubt that union representatives can keep confidential matters confidential[,] [u]nion representatives are often in the position of having to maintain confidentiality." <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA,</span> 316 F.3d at 287. Here, the Respondent makes no claim, and there is no indication in the stipulated record, that the Union would have objected to or failed to comply with any confidentiality requirements imposed by the mediator in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;The record reveals that while the mediator was meeting separately with the Commander on February 9, the employee unexpectedly met the Union Vice President in the atrium of the building in which the mediation conference took place. The employee willingly discussed her complaint and the proposed terms of the settlement agreement with the Union Vice President. The employee's demonstrated willingness to discuss her complaint with, and to seek advice from, the Union regarding proposed terms of the settlement agreement strongly indicates that the employee would not have objected to the Union's presence at the mediation and settlement discussions on confidentiality grounds. Moreover, the employee actively sought the Union's assistance in ensuring compliance with the terms of the settlement agreement. Thus, these facts show the lack of a "direct" conflict even more so than in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>where the D.C. Circuit stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">It is important to note one other reason why there is no direct conflict in this case. As the Air Force conceded, there is no evidence that Jones (the employee) objected to union presence at the mediation proceeding. We do not foreclose the possibility that an employee's objection to union presence could create a 'direct' conflict that should be resolved in favor of the employee as described in footnote 12 of <span class="Italic">NTEU. </span>774 F.2d at 1189 n.12. As there is no conflict present in the case before us, the FLRA's construction is permissible.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA, </span>316 F.3d at 287.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's claim that the Union's presence at a mediation session would violate the Privacy Act. In essence, the Respondent maintains that the Union's presence at such mediation and settlement discussions would necessarily result in the disclosure of the nature or substance of the complaint in violation of the Privacy Act. In rejecting these claims, we adhere to the D.C. Circuit's view that the Privacy Act concerns the confidentiality of records and does not address what parties may attend an ADR proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 286.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Authority addressed and rejected analogous claims in <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin.</span>, 53 FLRA 925, 933-36 (1997) <span class="Italic">(GSA II). </span>In addressing those claims, the Authority noted that "[t]he Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a, restricts the disclosure, and redisclosure, of personally identifiable records." [15] 53 FLRA at 933. As relevant here, the Authority noted that the courts hold that a "disclosure" within the meaning of the Privacy Act is the actual retrieval of any information from a "record" within the meaning of the Act. 53 FLRA at 934. In this respect, the Authority noted that in the leading case involving this "actual retrieval" standard, the court held that for a disclosure to be covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b), 'there must have initially been a retrieval from the system of records which was at some point a source of the information<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. <span class="Italic">(citing Savarese v. United Slates</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health, Education and Welfare, </span>479 F. Supp. 304, 308 (N.D.

Harris, </span>620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1078 (1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;The Authority also noted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b) provides, with certain exceptions, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Union's presence was not inconsistent with the Privacy Act, the Authority found that under the actual retrieval standard "the [a]gency ha[d] not established that the Union's acquiring knowledge of th[e] [nature of the employee's complaint appealing an adverse action] as a result of the [a]gency providing notice of, and the Union's attendance at, settlement negotiations would be related to information in, or retrieved from, a 'record' within the meaning of the Privacy Act." 53 FLRA at 935. Similarly, with respect to the agency's contention that sensitive information would be disclosed to the Union at such meetings, the Authority found that the agency had not demonstrated that "such sensitive information would be information contained in or retrieved from a 'record' within the meaning of the Privacy Act<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the actual retrieval standard applied by the courts and the Authority in <span class="Italic">GSA II, </span>we find in this case that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Union's acquisition of knowledge of the issues raised in the complaint would be related to the actual retrieval of such information from a "record" within the meaning of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we reject the Respondent's claims the Union's presence at the mediation session conflicts with the confidentiality provisions under the Public Health Services Act, protecting an employee's drug and alcohol abuse records; Executive Order 13145, protecting an employee's genetic information; or the Rehabilitation Act and EEOC regulations protecting an employee's medical records. The Respondent presented no evidence that this case involved any information or records protected from disclosure by agencies by these laws, and in turn that any such improper disclosure would have occurred here had a Union representative attended the mediation and settlement discussions. In this respect, we find "the Union's statutory right to be represented at such [mediation and settlement discussions] cannot be nullified on the speculative grounds of potential privacy problems under the Privacy Act." <span class="Italic">GSA II,</span> 53 FLRA at 936. Rather, such hypothetical issues are more appropriately addressed in an actual case when squarely presented. <span class="Italic">See Navegar, Inc. v. United States,</span> 103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (declining to decide cases before they are ripe avoids adjudicating abstract disagreements, enhances judicial economy, and ensures that an adequate record exists to support an informed decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, we find, in agreement with the Judge and for the reasons stated above, that the Respondent committed the unfair labor practices alleged in the complaint in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Once more to the mat, in <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv. and NFFE Local 2023</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-128.html">60 FLRA 644</a>, 648-54 (2005), FLRA declined to revisit, and instead reaffirmed, the right of the union to notice and an opportunity to be present at postcomplaint settlement discussions and mediations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained below, we find that the mediation sessions involving employees Crespin and Genzmer, which occurred after they filed formal EEO complaints and sought to resolve such complaints, were formal discussions within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Similarly, we find that the mediation session involving employee Benton's formal EEO complaint was a formal discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In addition, we find that the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the presence of a Union representative at these mediation sessions would conflict with EEOC regulations, ADRA, Privacy Act and the host of other laws and regulations cited by the Respondent. Therefore, we find that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) by failing to provide the Union notice and an opportunity to be represented at these mediation sessions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Crespin and Genzmer's Complaints</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order for a union to have the right to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) which is formal; (3) between a representative of the agency and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at <span id="page_1471"></span>306; <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, 54 FLRA at 723; <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., Region 9,</span> 48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent contends that Crespin and Genzmer's mediation sessions were not formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) because their filed complaints were not part of the formal EEO complaint process as of the time of the mediation sessions since the DOA had not yet issued letters accepting the complaints under its EEO regulations. For the following reasons, we reject the Respondent's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, in agreement with the Judge, that the employees' complaints were part of the formal EEO process as of the time of the mediation sessions. Under EEOC regulations and directives, the formal EEO complaint process begins with the filing of a formal complaint after the issuance of the notice of right to file a discrimination complaint, not with the agency's subsequent acceptance of the filed complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1614.105 (informal pre-complaint processing) and &#x00A7; 1614.106 (filing of complaints after receipt of notice of right to file a discrimination complaint). Thus, the fact that letters of acknowledgment and/or acceptance of the filed complaints were not issued by the DOA until after the mediation sessions is not a relevant factor in determining whether the filed complaints were part of the formal EEO process. In this respect, we reject the Respondent's claims that the Judge erred in relying on EEO MD-110 in determining the effective filing date for formal complaints as prior to the issuance of acceptance and/or acknowledgment letters by DOA. We find that Judge's reliance on EEO-MD-110 was in line with EEOC's Regulations that require agency procedures to be consistent with instructions for complaint processing in EEOC's management directives, such as EEO MD-110. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1614.104 (a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also, we reject the Respondent's claims that it had no knowledge that formal complaints had been filed by the employees as of the time of the mediation sessions since copies of the acknowledgment or acceptance letters had not yet been issued by DOA's OCR. In this respect, we note that the Respondent was represented by management officials in the Forest Service who were notified of the mediation sessions in advance. As such, these officials had the opportunity to confirm whether formal complaints had been filed by the employees and to ensure that the Union received notice and an opportunity to attend the mediation sessions. Thus, the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Judge erred in finding that the mediation sessions involved formal EEO complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, as stated in <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, in order to determine whether meetings constitute formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the totality of the circumstances presented must be examined and the following illustrative factors are considered: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) the length of the discussions; (6) whether a formal agenda was established; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 307.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will apply these factors to the three mediation sessions at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the Judge that the discussions involving Crespin and Genzmer are like the discussions that occurred in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, <span class="Italic">Dover,</span> and <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>. With regard to both employees, the meetings were scheduled more than two weeks in advance; the established purpose of the meetings was to mediate and resolve their EEO complaints; the attendees were provided information concerning the mediation in advance of the meetings; the meetings were held in locations away from their work sites; and attendees at the meetings included management representatives/officials with full authority to settle the EEO complaints. Also, we note that the parties did not dispute the Judge's finding that the meetings followed a traditional mediation format consisting of joint and/or separate discussions between the parties facilitated by a mediator. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that the Judge erred in finding that Crespin and Genzmer's mediation sessions were formal discussions under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Benton's Complaints</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's exception that the Judge erred in finding that the mediation session involving employee Benton was a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) since one of her complaints was filed pursuant to a court-approved settlement agreement and not the negotiated grievance procedure or EEO procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the record reveals the following.&#x2003;On June 19, 2001, Benton filed a complaint with the designated non-Agency Complaint Administrator under the settlement agreement. By letter dated October 22, 2001, the DOA acknowledged and accepted for investigation Benton's complaint. Benton subsequently requested mediation. The Respondent coordinated the date and time of the mediation session and made the location arrangements. By letter dated March 26, 2002, the EIP Manager confirmed that the mediation session to resolve Benton's complaints was scheduled for April 8, 2002. The confirmation was sent to the following attendees: Benton, her personal representatives, and management representatives (the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Forest Supervisor with full authority to resolve the complaints and a Technical representative), and the mediator. The mediation session was held as scheduled at a hotel and lasted approximately 8 hours. The parties signed an "Agreement to Mediate," which provided that participation in the process was voluntary and specified measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we agree with the Judge that the mediation session constituted a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). Applying the formality criteria set forth above, we note that the mediation was scheduled two weeks in advance; attendees at the mediation included the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit Supervisor who had full authority to settle the EEO complaint on behalf of the Respondent and a technical representative; the meeting had an agenda to discuss and resolve the EEO complaints; the mediation occurred in a hotel, away from the employee's work site; and the mediation lasted approximately 8 hours.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we reject the Respondent's claim that Benton's mediation session was not a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) because the complaint was filed in accordance with the terms of the court-approved settlement agreement in the <span class="Italic">Donnelly v. Glickman</span> class action suit. Based on our review of the process prescribed by the terms of the settlement agreement, we find no meaningful basis for distinguishing Benton's formal EEO complaint in this case from <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, <span class="Italic">Dover,</span> and <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Complaint Administrator refers all eligible complaints to the Respondent and DOA for "normal" informal and formal processing in accordance with EEOC Regulations, 29 C.F.R. Part 1614, and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, like any other EEO complaint that is filed directly with the DOA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we reject the Respondent's assertion that Benton's mediation was not held as part of its EIP to resolve EEO complaints. The Respondent has not demonstrated, and the record does not show how availability of ADR through the EIP under the settlement agreement is substantially different from the mediation of other EEO complaints under the EIP that are not filed pursuant to the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> &#x00A7; 11.6 at 23-24 (settlement agreement does not specify any changes to the EIP process). We note that the Respondent's provision of ADR under the EIP for complaints filed pursuant to the settlement agreement is consistent with EEOC's Regulations that require agencies to provide ADR at all stages of the pre-complaint and formal EEO process. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 1614.102(b)(2). Thus, we agree with the Judge that Benton's mediation session was a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) that the Union had a right to attend.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Formality Criteria under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's contention that the Authority should reverse or overturn its precedent governing formality and that the Authority has eviscerated the principles or concept of a formal discussion. We find that the Authority's application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) in <span class="Italic">Luke I</span>, <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, and <span class="Italic">Luke II</span> to EEO mediation sessions is fully consistent with the section's statutory purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In considering the application and scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the Authority has stated that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[I]n examining each of the[&#8197;] elements [of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)], we will be guided by that section's intent and purpose--to provide the union with an opportunity to safeguard its interests and the interests of employees in the bargaining unit--viewed in the context of a union's full range of responsibilities under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, (Ray Brook, N.Y.)</span>, 29 FLRA 584, 588-89 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, in considering the statutory purpose of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the Authority found that "unions have an established interest in how allegations of discrimination are dealt with and resolved, regardless of the forum in which the employee chooses to lodge the complaint." <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1188). The Authority found that the union in <span class="Italic">Dover</span> had "an undeniable representational interest in, among other things, disciplinary action taken against [the complainant] even though [the complainant] did not challenge the matter through the NGP." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1345 v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 1360 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (recognizing union's &#x00A7; 7114 interest in discipline imposed on bargaining unit employees, even though the employees did not file a grievance or seek union representation concerning the discipline)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that "the processing of an individual complaint through EEO procedures can have an effect on the entire bargaining unit, which the union represents." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, in <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, the Authority noted the Tenth Circuit's explanation that "by providing formal discussion rights for discrete grievances and not just general personnel policies, the Statute recognizes that the resolution of an individual employee complaint may have an impact on the rights of other unit employees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Denver, Colorado v. FLRA</span>, 3 F.3d 1386, 1390 (10th Cir. 1993)). Here, the Respondent does not dispute <span id="page_1472"></span>that the settlement of an EEO complaint could have an impact on the rest of the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to its request that the Authority reconsider the application of the formality criteria under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), the Respondent raises substantively identical arguments to those that have been previously raised and rejected by the Authority. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has not presented a basis for reconsideration of or departure of the Authority's precedent in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;The Mediation Sessions Concerned a "Grievance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's exception to the Judge's conclusion that these mediation sessions involving EEO complaints concerned a grievance within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Authority has already addressed and resolved this issue. As noted recently in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, the Authority has "revisited and thoroughly reviewed the issue of whether EEO complaints pursued through a statutory appeals procedure are grievances under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and decided to adhere to its view that the scope of the term 'grievance' encompasses such complaints, based on the express language of the Statute, the legislative history of the Statute, and the purpose of the Statute's provision for union representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A)." <span class="Italic">Luke II,</span> 58 FLRA at 533 (citing <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 308-09).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Respondent's exception that this case warrants a finding that the Union is not entitled to its representational rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) since EEO claims are not excluded from coverage of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. In <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, the Authority reaffirmed its holdings in <span class="Italic">Dover, </span>that were affirmed by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span>, that the "broad definition of 'grievance' under the Statute encompasses complaints filed under a NGP as well as complaints filed under alternative statutory procedures of the EEOC." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (footnote omitted). In this respect, the Authority has reaffirmed its previous holdings in <span class="Italic">Luke I</span> and <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, that the statutory definition of a grievance is not dependent on the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Luke II,</span> 58 FLRA at 534. The Respondent presents no new arguments that merit reconsideration of or departure from this precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;EEOC Regulations, ADRA, Privacy Act and Other Statutes</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Except for the arguments pertaining to EEO-MD-110 and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7332, which we address below, the Authority has considered and rejected arguments substantively identical to the remaining arguments made by the Respondent in this case; namely, that the Union's presence at mediation sessions conflicts with EEOC Regulations, ADRA, the Privacy Act and other statutes and regulations that protect the confidentiality of certain information and records. <span class="Italic">See Luke II</span>, 58 FLRA at 531 (respondent's exceptions that union's attendance would violate provisions of EEOC regulations, ADRA, Privacy Act, OPM's list of routine use exceptions; Public Health Services Act, Executive Order 13145; Rehabilitation Act and Americans with Disabilities Act). As in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, we find that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Respondent presents hypothetical situations where the Union's presence at mediation and settlement discussions could create potential conflicts with certain laws governing confidentiality. Moreover, we also note that, as the D.C. Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span> in response to "the Air Force's doubt that union representatives can keep confidential matters confidential[,] [u]nion representatives are often in the position of having to maintain confidentiality." <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span>, 316 F.3d at 287. Here, the Respondent makes no claim, and there is no indication in the stipulated record, that the Union would have objected to or failed to comply with any confidentiality requirements imposed by the mediator in this case....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In addition, we reject the Respondent's claims [that] the Union's presence at the mediation session conflicts with the confidentiality provisions under the Public Health Services Act, protecting an employee's drug and alcohol abuse records; Executive Order 13145, protecting an employee's genetic information; or the Rehabilitation Act and EEOC regulations protecting an employee's medical records. The Respondent presented no evidence that this case involved any information or records protected from disclosure by agencies by these laws, and in turn that any such improper disclosure would have occurred here had a Union representative attended the mediation and settlement discussions. In this respect, we find "the Union's statutory right to be represented at such [mediation and settlement discussions] cannot be nullified on the speculative grounds of potential privacy problems under the Privacy Act." <span class="Italic">GSA II</span>, 53 FLRA at 936. Rather, such hypothetical issues are more appropriately addressed in an actual case when squarely presented. <span class="Italic">See Navegar, Inc. v. United States</span>, 103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (declining to decide cases before they are ripe avoids adjudicating abstract disagreements, enhances judicial economy, and ensures that an adequate record exists to support an informed decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, 58 FLRA at 535, 536.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the same vein, we reject the Respondent's contention that Section II(A)(6) of EEO-MD-110 specifically prohibits the Union's attendance at EEO mediation and settlement discussions. Section II(A)(6) provides in pertinent part that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Agencies must also be mindful of the prohibitions on the disclosure of information about individuals imposed by the Privacy Act. All pre- and post-complaint information is contained in a system of records subject to the Act. Such information, including the fact that a particular person has sought counseling or filed a complaint, cannot be disclosed to a union unless the complaining party elects union representation or gives his/her written consent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Respondent's assertion, this provision of EEO-MD-110 does not specifically address or prohibit the Union's attendance at EEO mediation and settlement discussions. Rather, the provision represents the EEOC's interpretation of the Privacy Act that an agency's disclosure of certain information to a union would violate the Privacy Act. As relevant here, although not in the context of EEO-MD-110, in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, the Authority has previously addressed and rejected claims that a union's presence at mediation and settlement discussions would necessarily result in the disclosure of information in violation of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting these claims, the Authority noted "the D.C. Circuit's view that the Privacy Act concerns the confidentiality of records and does not address what parties may attend an ADR proceeding." <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, 58 FLRA at 535 (citing <span class="Italic">Dover AFB v. FLRA</span>, 316 F.3d at 286). Moreover, as the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, "courts hold that a 'disclosure' within the meaning of the Privacy Act is the actual retrieval of any information from a 'record' within the meaning of the Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this respect, the Authority noted that in the leading case involving this actual retrieval standard, the court held that for a disclosure to be covered by the Act, "'there must have initially been a retrieval from the system of records which was at some point a source of the information." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Savarese v. United States Dep't of Health, Education and Welfare</span>, 479 F. Supp. 304, 308 (N.D. Ga. 1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem. sub nom</span>, <span class="Italic">Savarese v. Harris</span>, 620 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1980), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 449 U.S. 1078 (1981)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the actual retrieval standard applied by the courts above and by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, and noting the absence of any reliance by the Respondent on court decisions dealing with the Privacy Act, we find that the Respondent in this case has not demonstrated that the Union's acquisition of knowledge of the nature of the complaint as a result of the agency providing notice of, and the Union's attendance at, mediation and settlement discussions would require a retrieval of information in violation of the Privacy Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 535-36. Accordingly, for the reasons explained above, we find no basis for finding a violation of the Privacy Act in this case, and in turn, no basis for finding a violation of EEO-MD-110.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent does not assert or point to any evidence in the record that the employees in this case are patients of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). As such, the Respondent has not demonstrated how the Union's presence at the mediation and settlement discussions in this case could have violated 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7332, which protects the confidentiality of certain medical records of VHA patients.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Luke II </span>and <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, we reject the Respondent's exception that this case warrants a finding that the Union is not entitled to its representational rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">F.&#x2003;Inherent and Direct Conflicts of Interest</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and the Authority have recognized that an appropriate resolution is required in the event of a direct conflict between individual and institutional rights.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Luke II,</span> 58 FLRA at 535;<span class="Italic"> Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 309 (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 774 F.2d at 1189 n.12). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice</span>, Bureau of Prisons, Federal Corr. Inst. (<span class="Italic">Ray Brook, N.Y.</span>), 29 FLRA 584, 590 (1987) (if there is a conflict between rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and those under other statutes, the Authority will consider that conflict in determining whether section &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) has been violated), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. AFGE, Local 3882 v. FLRA</span>, 865 F.2d 1283 (D.C. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's exception in this case that the fact that the Union objected to the proposed settlement agreements in EEO class action law suits that were filed against DOA poses an inherent and direct conflict of interest that precludes the Union's participation in EEO mediation sessions. As relevant here, the record reveals that in the <span class="Italic">Donnelly v. Glickman</span> law suit, the Union objected to the settlement agreement because it did not require bargaining with the Union. In this respect, the court found that none of the terms of the settlement agreement that affect the Union's rights can be implemented unless proper notice and an opportunity to bargain are provided to the Union and that the bargaining provisions of the parties' Master Labor Agreement are followed. The court also noted that "the parties [in the lawsuit] ha[d] agreed that none of the procedures of the settlement which affect conditions of employment will be implemented without engaging in bargaining with the Union." The court noted that as a result of the Union's objections regarding the insufficient level of privacy and confidentiality <span id="page_1473"></span>for unit members, the parties in the lawsuit had agreed on revisions to the agreement that addressed the Union's concerns. Essentially, the Union's objections sought to protect its bargaining rights over changes in conditions of employment and to protect the confidentiality of its members. As such, we find nothing in these circumstances that creates any conflict, much less a direct conflict, between the Union's institutional rights and the employees' individual rights that would have necessitated disallowing the Union's presence at the mediation sessions in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Respondent's claim that the Union's representation of alleged wrongdoers in hostile work environment claims, which frequently involve the actions of numerous unit members who may be subject to discipline, constitutes a basis for precluding the Union from attending EEO mediation sessions in this case. The Respondent makes no specific claim, and there is no indication in the stipulated record, that there any such conflict existed in this case. Hence, we reject the Respondent's hypothetical claims. <span class="Italic">Luke II</span>, 58 FLRA at 536 ("hypothetical issues are more appropriately addressed in an actual case when squarely presented").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we reject the Respondent's contention that had the employees in this case desired the Union's presence at the mediation sessions they would have chosen a union representative as their personal representative. The Respondent's reliance on this fact is misplaced. The employees' choice of personal representative under the EEOC regulations does not have any bearing on the separate right of the Union to attend such mediation hearings under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Moreover, the fact that the employees did not choose a union representative as their personal representative does not suggest or prove that the employees would have objected to the Union's presence at their mediation sessions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">G.&#x2003;New Policy for Dealing with Union Involvement in EEO Disputes</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's contention that the Union should only be granted the right to bargain over the impact and implementation, and substance if appropriate, of settlement agreements of EEO complaints reached in mediation sessions. The Statute grants the Union the right to be present at formal discussions, including mediation sessions of EEO complaints as the Authority and D.C. Circuit have found, under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A). As we have stated above, the Authority has found that this is not an absolute right and that considerations of direct conflicts will be taken into account. The Authority cannot nullify the Union's statutory right under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) in favor of, or in subordination to, its right to bargain over the impact and implementation regarding changes that an effect on the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, we find, in agreement with the Judge and for the reasons stated above, that the Respondent committed the unfair labor practices alleged in the complaints in violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute.</p>
