<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-113"><span class="space">2.</span> Hearing Recording Omission; Transcript Error</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Once upon a time, in the early days, the Board transcribed its hearings through paper transcripts that were made available to the parties. Transcripts are expensive. The Board now uses audio recordings in almost all its cases, leaving the parties to purchase the transcript from the commercial firm that records the hearing. <span class="Italic">Mastrullo v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 123 MSPR 110, 123 &#x00B6; 28, 2015 MSPB 67 (2015), suggested that an AJ ought to ensure an adequate hearing record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of this matter revealed problems with the audio recording of the hearing. Some of the testimony was inaudible at times, and we were entirely unable to hear a portion of the appellant's cross-examination. The Board has held that when the verbatim hearing record omits material evidence necessary to adjudicate an appeal, the evidence must be taken again. <span class="Italic">Walker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 101, 104 (1991). Therefore, on remand, the administrative judge shall take steps to ensure that the record is properly preserved and, if necessary, take the omitted testimony again. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Department of the Army</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 241, 249 n.3 (1989) (finding that limited readjudication was appropriate to obtain the testimony of witnesses whose original testimony was missing from the hearing tape).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.53(a) (2022) ("A recording of the hearing is generally prepared by a court reporter, under the judge's guidance.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the existence of a transcript, a party complaining of transcript errors must state in the PFR "how or where the record is lacking or inaccurate." <span class="Italic">Tibbits v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 61, 64, 5 MSPB 136 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jack v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> 143 Fed. Appx. 331, 335 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) ("Mr. Jack's conclusory assertion that he was prejudiced by the alleged incompleteness of the tape recording of the hearing is insufficient to satisfy his burden to establish prejudice with the requisite specificity."); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. OPM</span>, 109 MSPR 529, 532 n.1, 2008 MSPB 191 (2008) (there were problems with portions of a hearing tape, but the parties did not challenge the AJ's characterization of the testimony and there was no indication that the garbled portion of the tape contained significant testimony); <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 563, 570 (1989) (appellant failed to show how the AJ mischaracterized the testimony or closing arguments; missing portions of the testimony consisted of the appellant confirming on cross and redirect examination his testimony on direct examination; the appellant did not contend the AJ's characterization of the testimony differed from what he presented); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 259, 261 (1982) (appellant failed to identify the scope of transcript errors or how they affected the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is an omission in the transcript, but the recordings are complete, the recordings are sufficient; they constitute the verbatim record of the proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 58, 59 n.2 (1985). That some portions of the recordings are inaudible will not furnish a basis for reversal unless the appellant explains the nature of the evidence omitted and the effect of the evidence (or its omission) upon his appeal. <span class="Italic">Simon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 301, 302-03 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dunn v. OPM</span>, 60 MSPR 426, 434-35 (1994) ("Our review of the hearing tape in this case does not disclose any apparent omission of testimony or inaudible testimony. Further, the appellant does not specify what testimony was omitted and how it was material[.] "); <span class="Italic">Kane v. Defense Personnel Support Ctr.</span>, 21 MSPR 358, 360 (1984) (omissions from the transcript were not material because the AJ did not consider the testimony of the witness significant); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of State</span>, 12 MSPR 555, 557 (1982) (despite the apparent omission of several pages of a transcript of the appellant's testimony and her allegation that the deletion of the testimony was deliberate, the Board found no reversible error because "she has not identified any evidence not considered by the presiding official as a result of the omission"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Preston v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 179, 180 (1982) (incomplete transcript: the case was remanded to the AJ to permit the parties to supplement the record with oral or written testimony and additional closing arguments).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is no showing or claim by the appellant that the testimony was different than that reflected in the AJ 's decision, the appeal will not be remanded on the basis that the undisputed testimony was not audible. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Allison v. TVA</span>, 32 MSPR 251, 254 (1987) (decision that was later modified when the EEOC complained that it needed to review testimony that was inaudible on the tapes); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Boechler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 222 Fed. Appx. 969, 970 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("we discern no denial of due process in the erratic performance of the Board's audiovisual teleconferencing system, for it was not shown that evidence or argument on Mr. Boechler's behalf was thereby excluded").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That unavailability of a transcript is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> harmful error was reaffirmed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morales v. MSPB</span>, 932 F.2d 800 (9th Cir. 1991) (although testimony of two witnesses was unavailable because of a malfunction of the tape recorder, the appellant did not argue that the decision inaccurately reflected the testimony as the AJ described it); <span class="Italic">Watkins v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2507) (citing <span class="Italic">Harp, supra</span>); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 525, 535 n.14 (1989) (although the tapes were poor in spots, the essential information was available to the Board). In <span class="Italic">Dal Santo v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3248), the court determined that in order to merit a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing, an appellant must do more than allege generally that his case was prejudiced by the lack of a hearing transcript. Citing <span class="Italic">Harp</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the court observed that there was no specific allegation as to the difficulties posed because of the lack of transcript. Once the appellant learned of the problems with the hearing tapes, he did not pursue transcript reconstruction, a relatively simple task, given that the hearing before the AJ lasted only one day.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The situation is more drastic if the hearing recordings cannot be understood well enough to obtain any reasonable transcript--a problem that may occur when recordings are made by people without proper training or equipment. Should that occur, the record is inadequate for just resolution of the case. The appeal must be reheard and properly recorded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 100 MSPR 500, 503 &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (appeal remanded for rehearing when, because the audiotapes of the hearing were wholly inaudible, the appellant's arguments that the AJ's determinations were contrary to the evidence were essentially unreviewable); <span class="Italic">Ioannou v. OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 426, 431 (1993) ("Where, as here, the verbatim record of a hearing contains material omissions of evidence necessary for the just adjudication of the appeal, the evidence must be taken again. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Washington v. GSA</span>, 46 MSPR 537, 539 (1991), explained that testimony had to be reheard on the agency's PFR complaining of the missing testimony of two of its principal witnesses, whose credibility determined the case. The appeal had to be remanded because "[T]he absence of the...hearing tapes renders the agency's allegations regarding the administrative judge's summary of the testimony given by these witnesses, and his subsequent credibility findings, essentially unreviewable." If a hearing recording containing essential information concerning the issues on appeal is destroyed, the Board will remand the case to retake the testimony and, if necessary, the rebuttal testimony. <span class="Italic">Boone v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 589 (1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Walker v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 101, 103 (1991) (remanding for rehearing: "The Board tried to improve the quality of the tape, by sending it to a service for enhancement. Unfortunately, the proprietor of the service, which is a one-person operation, left this country suddenly without returning the tape.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the lack of an audible recording does not always require a remand. The record was sufficient for a decision on PFR in <span class="Italic">Farrington v. Dept. of Transp</span>., AT-1221-09-0543-B-2 (NP 3/15/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Importantly, the appellant does not contend that the administrative judge was incapacitated or otherwise unable to take notes during the hearing or observe the testimony of witnesses, which might call her <span id="Page_1404"></span>credibility determinations into question, nor does the appellant provide any authority to support her assertion that the administrative judge erred by failing to include any quoted testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to the extent that the appellant may be arguing that her rights were harmed by the virtual inaudibility of the hearing tapes, we disagree. In <span class="Italic">Harp v. Department of the Army</span>, 791 F.2d 161, 163 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected a petitioner's claim that the unavailability of a hearing transcript constituted harmful error<span class="Italic"> per se</span>, requiring reversal of the Board's decision. The court found that "such loss is not fatal" to the court's ability to review a Board appeal. The court analyzed several factors to determine whether a fatal flaw occurred, such as whether the appellant established that he was prejudiced by the loss of the hearing transcript, whether the appellant showed that the administrative judge failed to consider or misused any particular testimony from the hearing, and whether other evidence existed in the record that would support the administrative judge's findings. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Kemp v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 154 F. App'x 912, 914 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2008). Here, we find that the appellant did not show that she was prejudiced by the virtual inaudibility of the hearing tapes and she did not demonstrate that the administrative judge failed to consider or misused any particular testimony of the witnesses that might have caused a different result in this case. Furthermore, although some or all of the hearing tapes may have been virtually inaudible, the record in this case was sufficiently developed to provide a meaningful review of the issues raised by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dooley v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 577, 579 (1984), reached an unusual result as it departed from cases requiring that there be some record of the Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the hearing, a written transcript was not made, apparently because the tape recordings were unintelligible. Appellant asserts that it is his right to be able to refute the presiding official's factual conclusions or to refer to errors by the presiding official in conducting the hearing by direct reference to the record. However, we are not persuaded that appellant has shown any harm to his substantive rights due to lack of a transcript. <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114 (1981)<span class="Italic">. See also Davis v. Department of Education,</span> 12 MSPB 130 (1982), setting forth the nature of the showing an appellant must make to cause the Board to review the factual findings of the presiding official in the absence of a transcript.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Harp v. Dept. of Army</span>, 791 F.2d 161 (Fed. Cir. 1986), that the transcript was lost was not sufficient either for reversal or remand to the Board. The court determined that the extant record was sufficient for meaningful review. The petitioner did not allege that, had there been a transcript, any particular testimony would have been revealed that was either not considered or misconstrued by the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrow v. DOD</span>, PH-0752-13-3305-I-1 (NP 5/11/2022) ("Here, we find that the appellant did not show that he was prejudiced by the absence of the telephonic hearing tapes and he did not allege that the administrative judge failed to consider or misused any particular testimony of the two approved witnesses that might have caused a different result in this case. In addition, while the hearing tapes may not have been available, the record in this case was sufficiently developed to provide a basis for a meaningful review of the issues raised by the appellant."). As to the loss of a recording of a hearing, the AJ may establish a record sufficient for Board adjudication, <span class="Italic">Burgess v. OPM</span>, AT-0831-16-0098-I-1 (NP 6/22/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge held a telephonic hearing, the recording of which was lost. Because the recording was lost, the administrative judge scheduled a second telephonic hearing, but the appellant did not participate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the appellant failed to show good cause for that failure, the administrative judge informed the parties that he would decide the case on the basis of the written submissions and his notes from the first hearing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the recording of the first telephonic hearing was lost, we find that a remand is unnecessary because the appellant has not alleged that the initial decision failed to accurately summarize all the arguments and evidence he presented. <span class="Italic">See Harp v. Department of the Army</span>, 791 F.2d 161, 163 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (rejecting a claim that the unavailability of a hearing transcript constituted harmful error<span class="Italic"> per se</span>; the court noted that "such loss is not fatal" to the court's ability to review a Board appeal, depending upon whether the appellant can establish that he was prejudiced by the loss of the hearing transcript, whether the appellant can show that the administrative judge failed to consider or misused any particular testimony from the hearing, and whether other evidence existed in the record that would support the administrative judge's findings); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 500, &#x00B6; 6 (2005) (finding that remand is generally unnecessary if the existing record is sufficient for meaningful review and the appellant has not alleged that any particular testimony was misconstrued by the administrative judge). Nor did the appellant otherwise allege that he was prejudiced by the loss of the recording. <span class="Italic">See Jezouit v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12 (2004) (finding that, to obtain reversal of an initial decision on the ground that the administrative judge abused his discretion in excluding evidence, the petitioning party must show on review that relevant evidence, which could have affected the outcome, was disallowed), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F. App'x 865 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A problem in a computerized recording of a telephonic hearing involving one witness was remedied by the AJ offering a rerun of the hearing or the opportunity to the appellant to offer corrections to the AJ 's summary of the proceedings, <span class="Italic">Sleet v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-11-0841-I-1 (NP 10/18/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record reflects that, on November 22, 2011, the appellant testified as the only witness in a 30-minute phone hearing. According to the administrative judge, he verified that the transcript file was listed in the Board's computer system to ensure that a proper recording was made of the proceedings, but that, notwithstanding, the Board's computer system failed to record the hearing. As soon as this was apparent, the administrative judge phoned the parties to explain what had happened and to explain that the appellant had the option to reconvene the hearing or respond to the administrative judge's summary of the proceedings. According to the administrative judge, the appellant's attorney advised that he did not wish to repeat the hearing based on the emotional nature of the appellant's testimony and that he wished to proceed in writing based on the administrative judge's notes and the written record. The administrative judge ordered the parties to review the summary of his notes that he provided them and to timely respond. To the extent the parties disagreed with this summary, the administrative judge permitted them to submit their objections and directed that they do so with specificity within 10 days. The appellant provided 14 such objections, and, as to each, set forth the correct nature of her testimony. In his initial decision, the administrative judge stated that the corrections of the parties were incorporated into the record and carefully considered in the analysis that followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the administrative judge failed to make a revised summary of her testimony and that, without it, the Board does not have access to an accurate account of the hearing. The appellant argues that, because she was denied the procedures to which she is entitled under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) (a hearing for which a transcript will be kept), the initial decision must be reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations provide that a verbatim record of every hearing under the supervision of an administrative judge will be kept and will be the sole official record of the proceeding. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.53; <span class="Italic">see Ioannou v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 426, 431 (1993). Generally, remand or reversal is unnecessary if the existing record is sufficient for meaningful review, and the appellant has not alleged that any particular testimony was either inconsistent or misconstrued by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Morales v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 932 F.2d 800, 802 (9th Cir. 1991). While the appellant argues that the administrative judge failed to make a revised summary of her testimony, the fact is that her corrected testimony, as she has presented it, is a part of the record. That the administrative judge did not refer to that revised testimony does not mean that he did not consider it. <span class="Italic">See Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). The revisions to the appellant's testimony correct factual statements. However, the issue in this case is a legal one, that is, whether the divorce decree provided a survivor annuity for her. None of the statements the appellant provided address that issue. Even as corrected, they do not constitute evidence necessary for the just adjudication of the appeal. Therefore, the appellant has not provided a basis for reversal or remand of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant asserts that rehearing permits collaboration by adverse witnesses, the appellant must develop that argument during the rehearing by doing anything he can to show inconsistencies with prior (untranscribed) testimony or prior written statements. The AJ must retake material missing testimony, e.g., that of the principal witness against the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. VA</span>, 40 MSPR 219, 223 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ may exercise some creativity when a portion of the hearing record is lost, as occurred in <span class="Italic">Samuels v. VA</span>, NY-0752-14-0293-I-1, n.2 (NP 2/24/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The recording of the second day of the hearing became inaccessible, and the administrative judge issued an order reopening the record to set forth the relevant testimony from the second day of the hearing and inquired whether the parties wished to stipulate to the testimony. The agency did so by pleading, and the appellant did so during a telephonic conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dooley v. OPM</span>, 22 MSPR 577, 579 (1984), reached an unusual result as it departed from cases requiring that there be some record of the Board hearing:</p>
