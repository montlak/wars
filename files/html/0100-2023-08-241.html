<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-237"><span class="space">M.</span> EFFECT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING CONTRACT GRIEVANCE OR RELATED PROCEDURES; 5 USC 7121</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdictional issues would be sufficiently complex were one only required to interpret ambiguous statutes, complex regulations, and occasionally opaque passages from Board or court decisions. But we now boldly quest into another area: the collective bargaining contract. The negotiated agreement almost always encompasses a grievance procedure, and therein lies the trouble. The grievance procedure may not expand on, but may detract from, Board appellate jurisdiction. The Board applies the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in effect when the agency took the challenged action to determine if a negotiated grievance procedure deprives the Board of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Villante v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 542, 545 (1987) (RIF); <span class="Italic">see Cooper v. Dept. of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COOPER_EUGENE_SE_0351_03_0036_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248616.pdf">98 MSPR 313</a>, 317 &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (applying unit definition at the time of a RIF). No case should be reviewed by any appellant's representative without asking four (or more) questions: Is the appellant a member of a bargaining unit? What rights does he have under his collective bargaining contract? Does use of the contract grievance impair the ability to appeal to the Board? Given the choice between the grievance process and the Board, what choice should be made? Some choices are based on an understanding of the law; some are strategic. We discuss the law; the strategy we leave to our readers. [Refer to Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-014.html#sec11-15">Collective Bargaining Contract Violation</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-18-015.html#sec11-16">Disputed Coverage</a>; refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-086.html#sec13-88">Grievance or MSPB appeal</a>," for election of remedies issues arising in Individual Right of Action (whistleblower) appeals; and refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When we speak of grievances, we refer to grievances arising under provisions of negotiated labor agreements. 5 CFR 1201.4 (2022), provides the definition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(o)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Grievance</span>. A complaint by an employee or labor organization under a negotiated grievance procedure covered by 5 U.S.C. 7121.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What other grievance systems are there? Agencies generally have internal administrative grievance or other ADR procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 771.101 (2022), and OPM Final Rule, Agency Administrative Grievance System, 60 FR 47039 (Sept. 11, 1995). Those do not affect Board jurisdiction, although most administrative grievance systems exclude matters that can be appealed to the Board. Also, there are grievance procedures in collective bargaining contracts covering Postal Service employees. Those grievance systems are not covered by 5 USC 7121. They are covered by the National Labor Relations Act. The election of remedies provisions of 5 USC 7121 do not require a choice between MSPB and grievances of Postal Service employees who have Board appeal rights. The treatment of grievances of those employees, to the extent they affect Board jurisdiction, are subsequently discussed. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-245.html#sec1-240">Administrative Grievance System</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-08-242.html#sec1-238">Postal Service Employees</a>."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Reform Act provides choices between Board appeals and grievance procedures for some types of actions--establishes grievance procedures as the exclusive process for other types of actions--and generally provides to an appellant Board review as to any matter that would have originally been within the Board's jurisdiction if an allegation of discrimination is involved at the grievance level. 5 USC 7121 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>

The negotiated grievance procedures were broadened by that statute, Pub. L. 103-424 &#x00A7; 9(a)(2), to permit arbitrators both to order stays of personnel actions in whistleblowing reprisal cases and to direct agencies to take disciplinary actions against other employees as a result of covered prohibited personnel practices.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Choice of procedure</span>. When an employee has an option of pursuing an action under the Board's appeal procedures or under negotiated grievance procedures, the Board considers the choice between those procedures to have been made when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board or timely files a written grievance, whichever event occurs first. When an employee has the choice of pursuing an appealable action involving a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination under 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1) in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the Board considers the choice among those procedures to have been made when the employee timely files an appeal with the Board, timely files a written grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, or seeks corrective action from the Special Counsel by making an allegation under 5 U.S.C. 1214(a)(1), whichever event occurs first.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Not just any allegation of discrimination preserves Board review jurisdiction over a final (arbitration) decision (usually referred to as an "award"). The jurisdiction defined by 5 USC 2302(b)(1) encompasses discrimination:</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board described the election scheme, and its consequences, in the preamble to a proposed rule designed to require an agency to spell out available elections in the notice of appeal rights issued to an employee, 64 Fed. Reg. 58798-99 (11/1/99):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Many Federal employees who may appeal an agency personnel action to the Board may also have the right to pursue the matter under a statutory grievance procedure or a negotiated grievance procedure (NGP) under a collective bargaining agreement (CBA)...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most Executive Branch agencies and their employees are subject to the Federal Labor-Management Relations Statute (5 USC 7101, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, hereafter the Statute). Under 5 USC 7121, most matters appealable to the Board that are also covered under the NGP of a CBA may only be challenged through the NGP (5 USC 7121(a)(1)). There are certain exceptions, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;If the employee is challenging an adverse action under 5 USC 7512 or an action based on unacceptable performance under 5 USC 4303, the employee may choose to appeal to the Board or file a grievance but may not do both (5 USC 7121(e)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;If the employee raises a claim of prohibited discrimination in connection with an action that is appealable to the Board, the employee may choose to appeal to the Board (or to raise the matter under any other applicable statutory procedure, such as an EEO complaint filed with the agency under the regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) or file a grievance but may not do both (5 USC 7121(d)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;If the employee raises a claim that an action appealable to the Board was based on a prohibited personnel practice other than discrimination, the employee may choose to appeal to the Board, file a prohibited personnel practice complaint with the Special Counsel, or file a grievance but may choose only one of these procedures (5 USC 7121(g)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The employee's choice of procedure is determined by his first filing. If he chooses to file a grievance, he may not subsequently file an appeal with the Board. Once the grievance procedure is chosen, there is no further opportunity for Board consideration of the matter, except that in matters that include a claim of prohibited discrimination, the employee may obtain Board review of the final decision of an arbitrator in accordance with 5 USC 7121 (d) and 5 USC 7702....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For employees not covered by the Statute (<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7103(a)(2)-(3) and (b)), the rules governing the choice between appeal and grievance procedures are far less uniform. The choices of such employees may be governed by statute, the NGP in a CBA, or both. The provisions of CBAs, of course, are particularly subject to change as new agreements are negotiated. The following are three examples of the different rules that apply outside the coverage of the Statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;A preference eligible employee in the U.S. Postal Service (which is excluded from the coverage of the Statute pursuant to the Postal Reorganization Act) may be able to file both an MSPB appeal and a grievance on the same matter under the terms of the applicable CBA. If an appeal is filed first, a grievance may still be filed as long as a hearing on the MSPB appeal has not begun or the record has not been closed if there was no hearing. If a grievance is filed first, an appeal may still be filed with MSPB but must be filed within the Board's filing time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;Employees in the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) may appeal certain RIF actions to MSPB. TVA preference eligible employees may also appeal adverse actions. Under the terms of the current CBAs at TVA, if an employee files an appeal with MSPB and subsequently files a grievance, the grievance will not be accepted. If the employee files a grievance and subsequently files an appeal with MSPB, the processing of the grievance will terminate. As is the case with the USPS, filing a grievance has no effect on the time limit for filing a MSPB appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022;&#x2003;&#x2003;Foreign Service employees in the State Department and other designated agencies are also excluded from the Statute. Career and career-candidate Foreign Service employees have the right to appeal RIF actions to MSPB. Such employees also have the option but only under specific circumstances to file a grievance on a RIF matter with the Foreign Service Grievance Review Board (FSGRB). If the employee files a grievance with the FSGRB first, the Board has no jurisdiction over any subsequent MSPB appeal. If the employee appeals to MSPB first, a grievance is precluded. (20 USC 4010a(c).) Again, filing a grievance has no effect on the time limit for filing a MSPB appeal.</p>

Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Goodwin</span> went on to consider the effect of use of EEO complaint procedures, involving another choice of remedies at 5 USC 7121(d):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;An aggrieved employee affected by a prohibited personnel practice under section 2302(b)(1) of this title which also falls under the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise the matter under either a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure at such time as the employee timely initiates an action under the applicable statutory procedure or timely files a grievance in writing, in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated procedure, whichever event occurs first. Selection of the negotiated procedure in no manner prejudices the right of an aggrieved employee to request the Merit Systems Protection Board to review the final decision pursuant to section 7702 of this title in the case of any personnel action that could have been appealed to the Board, or, where applicable, to request the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to review a final decision in any other matter involving a complaint of discrimination of the type prohibited by any law administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Because the applicable CBA in this appeal permits grievances alleging unlawful discrimination,<span class="Italic"> see supra,</span> &#x00B6; 16, &#x00A7; 7121(d) is relevant to our determination of which remedy was binding upon the appellant,<span class="Italic"> see Giove v.

This statutory provision states that an employee, who was subject to a personnel action which she is entitled to grieve under a CBA, and who alleges a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), may "raise the matter under a statutory procedure or the negotiated procedure, but not both." The statutory procedure includes a Board appeal or an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See Weslowski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a), the EEOC regulations provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a person is employed by an agency subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that permits allegations of discrimination to be raised in a negotiated grievance procedure, a person wishing to file a complaint or a grievance on a matter of alleged employment discrimination must elect to raise the matter under either part 1614 [Federal Sector Equal Employment Opportunity regulations], or the negotiated grievance procedure but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hence, just as an aggrieved employee may elect between the negotiated grievance procedure and a Board appeal, the employee also may elect between the negotiated grievance procedure and an EEO complaint pursuant to 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301. Here, we note that contrary to the AJ's finding, the appellant first elected to contest her reassignment through the EEO process rather than through the negotiated grievance procedures. She filed a formal EEO complaint contesting her reassignment on October 17, 2004, 2 days before she filed her first grievance on October 19, 2004. Accordingly, we find that the appellant made a binding election under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.301(a), to remedy the agency's actions through "the applicable statutory procedure" and not through the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having elected to first file a formal EEO complaint with the agency concerning her reassignment and reduction in pay, the appellant would be entitled to have her EEO complaint processed in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(d). Specifically, for mixed cases, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)-(2) and its implementing regulations provide for an election between: (1) filing a direct Board appeal, and (2) filing a formal EEO complaint with the agency, followed by a right to file a Board appeal upon exhaustion of the agency EEO procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), (b); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b). Regardless of whether an employee elects to file a direct Board appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), or elects to file a Board appeal after exhausting the agency EEO procedure under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b), she is entitled to the same <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review before the Board. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)-(2). For the reasons set forth above, we find that the appellant's grievances concerning her reassignment did not deprive the Board of jurisdiction over the allegedly involuntary reduction in pay the appellant suffered as a result of her reassignment.</p>

The appellant filed this Board appeal only after the agency issued an adverse decision regarding his step 2 grievance, on February 27, 2014. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege jurisdiction over his removal appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The preclusive effect of a collective bargaining agreement's grievance procedure is jurisdictional. It may be raised at any time. Even if an agency does not establish that the documents it submits for the first time on PFR were previously unavailable, the Board will consider those documents if they implicate the Board's jurisdiction through a remedial election. <span class="Italic">See Sonneborn v.

The jurisdictional implications of a negotiated grievance procedure may lead the Board to examine cases of the Federal Labor Relations Authority to determine whether there exists a grievance procedure that has the effect of divesting the Board of jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Munson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 83 MSPR 80, 83-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-16 (1999), reflecting imaginative interpretation of federal sector labor law, the Board granted preclusive effect to a grievance process that was informally followed by the parties, as opposed to a grievance <span id="Page_392"></span>procedure that was a component of a collective bargaining contract approved by an agency head or imposed by the Federal Service Impasses Panel. The result was the Board's refusal to consider the appellant's WIGI appeal. <span class="Italic">Munson</span> was reversed on judicial review, <span class="Italic">Munson v. MSPB</span>, 216 F.3d 1037, 1041 (Fed. Cir. 2000), based on the court's determination that 5 USC 7121(a) "restricts the Board's jurisdiction only when a collective bargaining agreement is in place." <span class="Italic">See Oulianova v. PBGC,</span> DC-531D-11-0217-I-1 (NP 11/9/2011) (WIGI appeal: "We find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the parties' MOU-based agreement, that the grievance procedures in the expired CBA would continue in effect until a new CBA was adopted, meant that the grievance procedures provided the appellant with her exclusive remedy in this case. In <span class="Italic">Munson v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 216 F.3d 1037 (Fed. Cir. 2000), our reviewing court rejected precisely that analysis and found that the exclusive remedy provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a) 'restricts the Board's jurisdiction only when a collective bargaining agreement is in place.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1040-41. Because it is undisputed that there has been no CBA in place since February 2009, the exclusive remedy provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a) does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction in this case. <span class="Italic">See Munson</span>, 216 F.3d at 1041."); <span class="Italic">cf. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 67 FLRA 63 (2012) (aftermath of Oulianova's case before an arbitrator and the FLRA).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the unusual case of <span class="Italic">Yates v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 115 Fed. Appx. 57, 58-59 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), the court determined that an arbitrator's jurisdiction was more limited than the Board's as to an employee who would have qualified, despite being a probationer, for Board appeal rights, but who the arbitrator determined, as affirmed by the court, to be excluded from the contract grievance procedure, defined by law to exclude grievances concerning probationers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Before accepting this appointment, Ms. Yates had served in the agency for over three consecutive years in nonprobationary positions. During the probationary period, the agency proposed to remove Ms. Yates for failure to request leave properly, leaving work without permission, and making false statements. Under the terms of the Master Labor Agreement between the agency and the American Federation of Government Employees, Ms. Yates grieved her removal. The agency rejected the grievance as non-grievable and non-arbitrable "by statute."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Ms. Yates then had a choice. Because probationary employees are entitled to an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") if they have completed more than one year of continuous service under the holding of <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1999), she could appeal the agency's removal action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (following <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>). In the alternative, she could appeal the removal to arbitration and have her case decided by an arbitrator. The law, however, expressly provides that the employee may choose one avenue or the other, but not both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) (2000). When the employee takes one appeal route, she is barred from later seeking relief pursuant to the other. <span class="Italic">See Whitaker v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 784 F.2d 1109, 1110 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the arbitrator, Ms. Yates argued that she should have the benefit of <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> because the law requires that an arbitrator apply the same substantive law to the appeal as would be applied by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 660, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985) ("Congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the Board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision."). In <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, this court held that an employee in the competitive service who was serving a probationary period at the time of her removal but who had completed more than one year of current continuous service had a right to appeal her grievance to the Board. 307 F.3d at 1342-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator recognized that under <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, the Board would have had jurisdiction over a timely appeal by Ms. Yates. But the arbitrator declined to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to Ms. Yates's arbitration, and instead agreed with the agency that Ms. Yates grievance was not subject to arbitration because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4) expressly excludes from arbitration any grievance concerning "any examination, certification or appointment." In doing so, the arbitrator concluded that a probationary period is considered by law to be an extension of the examination process, and therefore arbitration cannot by law extend to any matters arising during an employee's probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, such is the law. In <span class="Italic">Department of Justice v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court faced the very question of whether a probationary period is an "examination" for purposes of section 7121(c)(4). The court held that "Congress clearly linked the agency's right to discharge summarily a probationary employee to the probationary period." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 727. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on explicit legislative history of the statute, which provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The probationary...period...is an extension of the examining process to determine an employee's ability to actually perform the duties of the position. It is inappropriate to restrict an agency's authority to separate an employee who does not perform acceptably during this period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 45 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2767.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Congress has explicitly forbidden the arbitration process from addressing issues concerning employee actions taken during probationary periods, the arbitrator dismissed Ms. Yates's case. Her timely appeal to this court followed, and we have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703, and 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that on the facts of this case, the Board would have entertained jurisdiction. Ms. Yates, however, did not file with the Board first, and her later attempt to file with the Board was correctly rejected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Yates's argument that this court should require an arbitrator to apply <span class="Italic">McCormick</span> to arbitration proceedings must fail for the same reason that the argument was rejected by the arbitrator. Congress has spoken with abject clarity with regard to the jurisdictional reach of arbitration. We agree that the law is clear: adverse employment actions taken during probationary periods are not subject to arbitration. The arbitrator correctly dismissed Ms. Yates's case.</p>
