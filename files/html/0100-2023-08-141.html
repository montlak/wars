<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-140"><span class="space">a.</span> Exceptions</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An exception to the usual bar to appeal rights of separated reemployed annuitants involves individuals who receive CSRS discontinued service annuities. Distinctions exist among the rights of reemployed annuitants, depending on how they became annuitants, as <span class="Italic">Tropiak v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 274, 277 n.4 (1993), involving an individual covered under CSRS, implied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an annuitant whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation, including discontinued service retirement...is reemployed in a position subject to 5 USC Chapter 83, subchapter III, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 8344(b); <span class="Italic">Colbert v. Department of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 492, 495 (1992). Therefore, the appellant's reemployment after discontinued service retirement would not be as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of Defense</span>, 33 MSPR 165, 168-69, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 828 F.2d 769 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colbert v. Dept. of Army</span>, 54 MSPR 492, 495 (1992), added as to CSRS annuitants reemployed after accepting discontinued service retirement and as to individuals reemployed following receipt of OWCP benefits in lieu of approved CSRS disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the Board had no jurisdiction over the agency's refusal to grant retained grade and pay because the appellant was a reemployed annuitant and, as such, an employee at will. That finding was incorrect. If an annuitant whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation including discontinued service retirement, such as the appellant, is reemployed in a position subject to 5 USC chapter 83, subchapter III, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8344(b); <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of Defense,</span> 33 MSPR 165, 168, <span class="Italic">aff[']</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">d,</span> 828 F.2d 769 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Therefore, the appellant's reemployment after discontinued service retirement would not be as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Spiegel,</span> 33 MSPR at 168-69....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, if an appellant is reemployed following receipt of Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits elected in lieu of approved disability retirement, the agency may not treat the employee as a reemployed annuitant terminable at will. The Board explained in <span class="Italic">Ochoa v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 39, 42-45 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with 5 USC 8337(f)(1), an employee or former employee is not entitled to receive both an annuity under 5 USC Chapter 83 and compensation for an injury under Chapter 81. The appellant was entitled to elect the greater benefit, however. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 8337(f)(3) (stating that the law does "not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of Chapter 81"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Appel v. OPM</span>, 777 F.2d 691, 692 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Vacchiano v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 1, 5 (1991), the Board specifically held that an individual who, like the appellant, otherwise qualifies as an annuitant, does not cease to be an annuitant by electing to receive OWCP benefits in lieu of annuity benefits under CSRS. Thus, the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant's selection of one benefit over the other does not change his legal status as an annuitant finds support in the Board's case law. We therefore agree with the conclusion that he was an annuitant at the time he was appointed in 1992.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 8331(9), defining an annuitant as "a former employee or Member who, on the basis of his service, meets all requirements of this subchapter for title to annuity and files claim therefor." We agree, too, that pursuant to 5 USC 3323(b)(1), a reemployed annuitant generally has no right to appeal his separation to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an annuitant, as defined by section 8331, receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed...serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant's argument that he was never off the agency's rolls is without merit. The record shows without question that he was retired from the agency and receiving OWCP benefits before he was reemployed. Nonetheless, for the reasons discussed, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, we conclude that this finding is not dispositive of his rights during his reemployment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, under section 3323, a reemployed annuitant generally serves at the will of the appointing authority. In a situation such as i[s] presented by the instant appeal, however, where the appellant was also entitled to OWCP benefits on the basis of the same injury or illness that caused him to qualify for disability retirement, his rights under 5 USC Chapter 81 must be effectuated, as well. Under 5 USC 8151(a), as to a person who receives OWCP benefits and resumes federal employment, "the entire time during which [he] was receiving compensation...shall be credited for...rights and benefits based on length of service." An appointment that accorded such credit, however, would be inconsistent with the at-will employment provision generally applicable to disability and other annuitants. Further, pursuant to chapter 81 and 5 CFR Part 353, an OWCP recipient is entitled to significant restoration rights that do not attach to a disability annuitant separated for a non-compensable injury or illness. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 353.301(b) (providing mandatory restoration right for employees who fully recover from a compensable injury within one year); 5 CFR 353.303 (granting priority consideration for restoration to an employee whose full recovery takes longer than one year); and 5 CFR 353.304 (requiring that "[a]gencies must make every effort to restore" a partially recovered employee who is able to return to limited duty). Thus, in <span class="Italic">Brumley v. Dept. of Transportation</span>, 46 MSPR 666, 670-75 (1991), the Board found that where the appellant was entitled to both OWCP benefits and a disability annuity under Chapter 83, his selection of the latter should not prejudice his entitlement to seek restoration to duty in accordance with his asserted claim of recovery from his compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in a decision issued after the date of the initial decision now at issue, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that reemployed annuitant status alone is not dispositive of the question of whether the annuitant must serve as an at-will employee. Rather, in <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court found that it is only an annuitant who is "receiving annuity from the...Fund" who serves in such a status. In <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, the appellant offered to waive his annuity payments for the period of the appointment he sought, and the court found that by doing so he would avoid the statutory requirement for at-will employment that attaches to an annuitant who draws his annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Giving consideration to both Chapters 81 and 83, and the court's decision, we conclude that to the extent that there is any inconsistency between the two authorities, they must be resolved in favor of the more specific provisions of Chapter 81, which is remedial in nature. It is axiomatic that statutes should be construed to give effect to every provision, and must be construed to be in harmony, if possible. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2B Singer, <span class="Italic">Sutherland Statutory Construction</span>, &#x00A7; 51.02, (5th ed.). Moreover, similar to the situation in <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, although the appellant was found entitled to a disability annuity, and was separated from his earlier appointment because of this entitlement, the record indicates that he never received retirement payments. Thus, he too was not an annuitant "receiving annuity from the...Fund." Accordingly, looked at on either basis, we conclude that the appellant was entitled to appointment to his Clerk position without the limitation of being an at-will employee. To hold otherwise would create an irreconcilable conflict between Chapters 81 and 83 that could interfere with employees' statutory rights to seek both benefits and to elect the more beneficial of them. In addition, it would violate the court's direction in <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Throughout his appeal, the appellant has argued that he was improperly subjected to a RIF action. We find, though, that the record shows that the agency removed the appellant prior to the time when it may have decided to conduct a RIF, apparently to assist in downsizing the work force without affecting employees who had status and could not be terminated at will. In the absence of evidence that the separation actually was part of a RIF, rather than part of the agency's pre-RIF planning, we find that it constituted an adverse action, which was effected without adherence to any of the requirements of 5 USC Chapter 75. We find, as well, that although the appellant's separation occurred less than a year after his reemployment, he is entitled to appeal that action on the basis of his constructive occupancy of a position at the agency since he began receiving OWCP benefits. Finally, we hold that an adverse action effected without the minimum due process protections required by the law must be reversed for that reason.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colbert</span> was applied, with elaboration on the relation between reemployment and continued receipt of CSRS discontinued service discontinued service retirement, in <span class="Italic">Luna v. VA,</span> DA-0752-14-0378-I-1 (NP 4/29/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective June 30, 2003, the appellant separated from her position with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Standard Form (SF) 50 documenting her separation indicated that the appellant had separated under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) pursuant to the "early out" retirement provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2). The agency hired the appellant effective February 5, 2006, and she continued to receive her CSRS annuity during her reemployment. Effective February 23, 2010, the agency terminated the appellant for various misconduct without notice of appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an individual's reemployment after a DSR under the CSRS is not as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Colbert v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 492, 495 (1992). The appellant has consistently maintained that she separated from the FDA in 2003 pursuant to a DSR. At the time of the appellant's prior appeal, HHS had not yet documented that her separation was pursuant to a DSR. Consequently, there was no evidence to support her claim that she retired under a DSR. Moreover, the evidence in the record contradicted her claim, as the SF-50 documenting her separation indicated that she retired under the early-out provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(d)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In assessing whether the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, we are guided by the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 495, and <span class="Italic">Garza v. Department of the Navy</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 9 (2012). In <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, the Board addressed the issue of whether an individual's reemployment after a DSR under the CSRS is as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 495. The Board noted that if an annuitant whose annuity is based on an involuntary separation, including a DSR, is reemployed in a position subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 83, subchapter III, payment of the annuity stops on reemployment. <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 495 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(b); <span class="Italic">Spiegel v. Department of Defense</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 165, 168, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 828 F.2d 769 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). Therefore, the Board found that the individual's reemployment after a DSR would not be as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 495<span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, the Board in <span class="Italic">Garza</span> noted that, when an individual who receives a discontinued service annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) is reemployed, the annuity continues and the amount of the annuity that applies to the period of reemployment is offset from the reemployed annuitant's salary. <span class="Italic">Garza</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 91, &#x00B6; 9. The Board held that, under these circumstances, the individual's reemployment after a DSR under FERS is as a reemployed annuitant and he therefore has no right to appeal his separation to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board has clearly indicated that the critical factor in determining whether a reemployed individual is a reemployed annuitant is not whether the individual previously separated from federal service under a DSR, but, rather, whether the individual's annuity stopped upon reemployment. In that regard, we note that in <span class="Italic">Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 605 (Fed. Cir. 1994), our reviewing court emphasized that actual receipt of an annuity is a significant factor in determining the at-will status of a reemployed individual.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it now appears that the appellant separated from the FDA pursuant to a DSR, the appellant does not dispute that she received a retirement annuity throughout her reemployment period and at the time of her termination in 2010. Because the appellant continued to receive a retirement annuity upon reemployment, she is a reemployed annuitant regardless of whether she retired under a DSR and, therefore, has no right to appeal her termination to the Board. Accordingly, we conclude the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Similar analysis was</span> applied, for a FERS annuitant who secured a discontinued service annuity and was later reemployed, <span class="Italic">Garza v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 119 MSPR 91, 92-94 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-9, 2012 MSPB 131 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective October 1, 2003, the appellant separated from federal service with the National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration. There is no dispute that he has received an annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) since that time. By letter dated September 15, 2010, the agency confirmed its selection of the appellant for the position of Engineering Technician. Effective February 3, 2012, the agency rescinded the appointment, explaining that when the appellant was hired it had failed to comply with its own requirements and procedures for hiring reemployed annuitants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal. Without holding the appellant's requested hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the appellant failed to make nonfrivolous allegations of fact which, if proven, would establish that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the appellant was employed as a reemployed annuitant and, as such, served at the will of the appointing authority and possessed no Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1), an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401 of title 5, is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed, however, serves at the will of the appointing authority. <span class="Italic">Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 604 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Bovay v. Small Business Administration</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). Generally, such an employee has no right to appeal an adverse action to the Board. <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, 29 F.3d at 604; <span class="Italic">Bovay</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 175, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Hays v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that he was receiving a discontinued service annuity at the time of his appointment and that he continued to receive it thereafter. In <span class="Italic">Colbert v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 492, 495 (1992), the Board considered whether an individual's reemployment after discontinued service retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) would be as a reemployed annuitant. It noted that, if the annuity is based on an involuntary separation, including discontinued service retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment in a position subject to 5 U.S.C. chapter 83, subchapter III. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8344(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 837.202(b)(ii); <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management (OPM) CSRS and FERS Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 100A1.1-3. The Board held that such an individual's reemployment after discontinued service retirement would therefore not be as a reemployed annuitant. <span class="Italic">Colbert</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 495; <span class="Italic">see also Spiegel v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, however, the appellant alleges that he received a discontinued service annuity under the FERS, not the CSRS. When a FERS annuitant such as the appellant is reemployed, the annuity continues, and the amount of annuity that applies to the period of reemployment is offset from the reemployed annuitant's salary. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8468(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 837.201; <span class="Italic">OPM CSRS and FERS Handbook</span>, &#x00A7; 100B1.1-2. Under these circumstances, the appellant's reemployment after discontinued service retirement under FERS was as a reemployed annuitant. As such, he "serve[d] at the will of the appointing authority" and had no right to appeal his separation to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3323(b)(1).</p>
