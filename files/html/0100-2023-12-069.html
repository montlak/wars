<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-69"><span class="space">d.</span> Change in Law</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tipsword v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 53, 54-58 (1994), attempted to clarify, or redefine, the parameters for reopening petitions based on changes in the law. The Board concluded that ordinarily the appellant must demonstrate the change in law and that the reopening petition was filed soon after the Board's underlying decision was issued:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 26, 1993, the agency proposed the appellant's removal based on a charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment: to obtain and maintain a CDL. The appellant received both a Notice of Proposed Termination and a Notice of Decision as to that proposed adverse action, to be effective May 8, 1993. On May 5, the appellant submitted a request to change his "involuntary retirement date" from May 29 to May 8, and on May 8, he retired from federal service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, construing the case as an involuntary retirement matter, ruled that the fact that the appellant faced an unpleasant choice between retiring or facing removal did not make his decision to retire involuntary, and that the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction to review his retirement on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board denied the appellant's petition for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 10, 1994, the appellant mailed a request to reopen his case, based on the decision in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1577. The appellant stated that on July 11, 1994, while reading the Federal Times, he discovered an article about the <span class="Italic">Mays</span> case (which had been decided on June 23). Stating that the <span class="Italic">Mays</span> case was "almost a carbon copy of what transpired" in his own case, the appellant requested a reopening and rehearing<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that the Board has statutory and regulatory authority to reopen, on its own motion, appeals in which a final Board decision has been rendered. A change in controlling law after the issuance of the Board's final decision is one of the reasons for reopening such a decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stevenson v. Department of Defense</span>, 55 MSPR 625, 629 (1992). However, because the policy of achieving the right result competes with the policy favoring finality of decisions, the Board and the courts have consistently held that any reopening and reconsideration must be obtained within a short and reasonable time period. <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Government Printing Office</span>, 43 MSPR 346, 350 (1990), and authorities cited therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]lthough the appellant filed a motion to reopen within one month of his learning of <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, and within two months of the issuance of the decision itself, it nevertheless is uncontested that <span class="Italic">Mays</span> was not issued until more than eight months after the Board decided the appellant's appeal, and that the appellant himself did not exercise his right to appeal to the court following the Board's issuance of its final decision. By analogy, we note that in reviewing untimely petitions for review, the Board has held that the fact that others successfully advanced an argument not pursued by the appellant does not show good cause for waiver of a filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See West v. Equal</span> <span class="Italic">Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 63 MSPR 233, 235 (1994) (petition for review filed untimely by three months); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Schlachter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 22 MSPR 318, 319 (1984) (petition for review filed untimely by five months); <span class="Italic">Schwartz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 34 MSPR 217, 219 (1987) (the same, untimely by eight months); <span class="Italic">Shiansky v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation</span>, 33 MSPR 103, 104-05, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 831 F.2d 306 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table) (the same, untimely by nine-and-a-half months); <span class="Italic">Deem v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 58 MSPR 468 (1993) (the same, untimely by two years).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing motions to reopen, the Board applies a balancing test. <span class="Italic">See Golden v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 268, 273 (1994) (a determination of whether to reopen an appeal involves balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result). In <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Rhode Island Air National Guard</span>, 56 MSPR 144, 148 (1992), the Board refused to reopen a restoration claim against a state national guard, because it held that the passage of approximately one and one-half years from the issuance of the Board's final decision to the appellant's motion for reopening required a finding that the desirability of finality outweighed the public interest in correcting the error of the Board's earlier decision. It stated that "[a] significant limitation on an agency's power to reconsider is that such authority must be exercised within a reasonable period of time," and that "absent unusual circumstances, the time is generally measured in weeks rather than years." <span class="Italic">Moriarty</span>, 56 MSPR at 148.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a series of recent cases, the Board has refused to reopen when appellants, relying on a subsequent change in law, make dilatory filings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Veterans Administration</span>, 65 MSPR 363, 365 (1994) (petition for review filed over four months after the OWCP hearing representative reversed OWCP's earlier decision);<span class="Italic"> Lauer v. Department of Transportation</span>, 65 MSPR 224, 226 (1994) (lapse of nearly five years from Board decision until issuance of new law, although reopening requested shortly thereafter); <span class="Italic">Devine v. US Postal Service</span>, 64 MSPR 289, 290 (1994) (petition for review filed more than one year after initial decision became final); and <span class="Italic">Pearce v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 52 MSPR 251, 253 (1992) (request for reconsideration filed over eleven years after the regional office's initial decision had been issued).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stephens v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 292 (1987), the Board did reopen four consolidated cases in order to apply retroactively a ruling awarding attorney fees in employee-initiated disability retirement cases. Significantly, however, the Board did not address the issue of timeliness which, as discussed above, may be an overriding consideration. Instead, it emphasized that the case being applied retroactively did not overrule clear precedent or overturn a long-established rule of law. Such a situation is distinguishable from the matter at hand, in which the court in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1581, clearly signalled its "disagreement" with <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 441 (1992) ("We find no basis in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) or its legislative history for making the distinction found by the Board in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> between employees whose retirement is effective after their removal and those whose retirement is effective the same day as their removal. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> holds otherwise, we disagree with it.")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In another case in which reopening was granted, <span class="Italic">Woodall v.</span> <span class="Italic">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 195 (1985), the change in the law occurred while the appeal was pending. <span class="Italic">See Moriarty</span>, 56 MSPR <span id="Page_1655"></span>at 149. Finally, <span class="Italic">Golden</span>, 60 MSPR at 273, in which the Board also granted reopening, involved what the Board itself characterized as "unique circumstances" and a lapse of only four months between the pertinent final decision of the Board and the appellant's submission of a motion to reopen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since none of the above factors are present in the case at hand, we find that any interest in correcting an error is outweighed by an interest in finality, and by the fact that the advancement by others of arguments that the appellant chose not to pursue does not establish good cause for reopening the Board's decision, which remains final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of a reconsideration request that was granted based on a change in law is <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 195 (1985). The question was whether Woodall's enforced leave was properly within the Board's jurisdiction. The Board decided it was not. At the time the Board issued its final decision, the Federal Circuit recently issued <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985), deciding that the Board had jurisdiction over appeals from enforced leave. Woodall's counsel wrote to the Board suggesting that it should pay more attention to recent court decisions (<span class="Italic">Thomas</span> had not been mentioned in the final <span class="Italic">Woodall</span> decision) and requesting that the Board reopen the case on its own motion. The Board did so, citing <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 7 MSPR 357, 7 MSPB 239 (1981), and stating that it may reopen and reconsider if there is clear and material legal error and a conflict between the holding of the decision and a controlling precedent or statute, either because of oversight or a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and the reopening request. The Board opined that "we find that the need for finality of Board decisions is outweighed by the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Seeley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board issued its decision in the instant appeal, the Federal Circuit issued a decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of whether to reopen a case is discretionary, and involves balancing the desirability of finality and the public interest in reaching what ultimately appears to be the right result. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Welber v.

A reasonable amount of time is normally measured in weeks and not years. <span class="Italic">Payne v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 503, 506 (1996). Further, the appellant must show that he exercised due diligence in seeking reopening. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied the appellant's petition for review on June 27, 2006. <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. at 143 (Table). Just over eight months later, on March 7, 2007, the Federal Circuit handed down its <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>. Only nine days thereafter, the appellant filed his request for reconsideration with the Board. Although the appellant's request for reconsideration, having been filed eight months after our decision in this appeal, stretches the bounds of a reasonable time period, he has displayed great diligence in prosecuting his appeal by promptly requesting reconsideration only nine days after the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> decision. <span class="Italic">See McDowell</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 284 (reopening where the appellant requested reopening shortly after Federal Circuit's ruling changing the controlling law); <span class="Italic">but cf. Tipsword</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 56-58 (denying a request for reconsideration that was filed eight months after the Board's decision and two months after a Federal Circuit decision that changed the controlling law). Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the desirability for finality is outweighed by the public's interest in reaching what appears to be the right result.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The Chairman bases his dissenting opinion on the appellant's failure to appeal to the Federal Circuit the Board's prior dismissal of this case for lack of jurisdiction, and on the assumption that the appellant cannot prevail in any event. First, before the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span>, equitable tolling of the DoL filing deadline for VEOA complaints was not available. Therefore, the appellant would have had no basis on which to seek further review until <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> was issued. Second, although the agency contends that the selectee for the position in question was from the merit promotion list, the appellant has consistently argued that the open competitive and merit promotion lists were merged during the selection process. If true, the agency may not have actually filled the vacancy using the merit promotion process, in which case the appellant would have been entitled to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">See Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 21 (2005) (preference eligible current competitive service employees are entitled to veterans' preference when participating in open competitive examinations). If the appellant can establish that the filing deadline should be equitably tolled, it is not a foregone conclusion that he would be unable to prevail on the merits. The record has been insufficiently developed on this issue, so the appellant should be apprised of his burdens and given an opportunity to develop the record further on this matter. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Devine v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 289, 292-93 (1994), suggested that the Board is less likely to reopen when law develops, rather than significantly changes, after issuance of an initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant's request that we reconsider his appeal could be construed as a request to reopen. Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117, the Board has authority to reopen and reconsider the decision of an administrative judge on its own motion at any time. The Board has used this authority on occasion to reopen appeals in which there was a change in the controlling law between the date of the original decision and the request for reopening, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Stephens</span> <span class="Italic">v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 292 (1987); <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192 (1985), but in general the Board will not reopen an appeal to cure an untimely filing, <span class="Italic">Deem</span>, 58 MSPR at 470.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case the facts do not warrant reopening. The appellants in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> were seeking reopening on the issue of the remedy they should be granted (attorney fees), not the merits of their appeals. Moreover, while the new law on which the request in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> was based did not overturn longstanding precedent (the cases relied on in denying the appellants' appeals), it did reverse precedent of both the Board and its reviewing court that directly addressed precisely the same legal issue; in contrast, here the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Di Pietro</span> for the first time established Board law on the precise issue of the appellant's appeal. There was thus less reason for the instant appellant to rely on the finality of the initial decision. In <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, the appellant had timely petitioned for review of the decision he later sought to reopen because of a change in the law, and he filed his request within three weeks of the decision that changed the law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Woodall</span>, 28 MSPR at 192, 194 and n.4. Here, by contrast, the appellant was fully apprised of his appeal rights but chose not to exercise them until more than a year after the deadline for filing a petition for review had passed. Moreover, he did not request reopening of his appeal until ten months after the Board had issued the decisions that set the precedent on which he now seeks to rely. In these circumstances, we decline to reopen the case on our own motion pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.117.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1656"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Olson v. USDA</span>, 91 MSPR 525, 529 &#x00B6; 8 (2002) (reopening was denied when a decision relied upon by the appellant did not reverse any legal precedent and did not constitute a controlling precedent creating conflict with the appellant's initial decision); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0432-10-0558-I-1 (NP 1/23/2023) (declining to reopen a settled case, 11 years after the final decision, when, years after the decision, the law changed on a matter involving performance actions).

<p class="Body-Text">If the law changes, but on the facts the change in the law would not be of benefit to the appellant, the Board will not reopen the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bagunas v.

Here, although in <span class="Italic">Hau II</span> the Board changed its application of collateral estoppel, the change in its law was not one that would have changed the outcome of the instant matter. <span class="Italic">See Bryant</span>, 878 F.3d at 1327 (explaining that the appellants would have been precluded from relitigating identical issues under the Board's precedent before or after the change in law, in concluding that the change-of-law exception to collateral estoppel was not applicable to the appellants' appeals)....</p>
