<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-270"><span class="space">1.</span> Issues Litigable Under an Appeals Procedure; MSPB, EEO Complaint, and ULP Elections</h4>
<p class="noindent">The first sentence of 5 USC 7116(d) states that if an issue can "properly" be raised under an appeals procedure, normally the MSPB, the issue may not be raised through a ULP charge and complaint. The second sentence of the statutory provision allows issues, other than those that can be brought to the MSPB, to be pursued through a grievance process, or through a ULP case, but not through both. The result is that if there is an issue that can be developed through a statutory appeals process, that issue cannot be raised through a ULP proceeding. If the issue is not subject to adjudication by MSPB, it goes through the grievance or ULP process, but not through both. [Refer to discussion concerning elections involving cases that assert whistleblowing reprisal, Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-034.html#sec9-35">Other Prohibited Personnel Practices; Whistleblowing Reprisal; 5 USC 7121(g)</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">The general parameters of the statutory ULP and grievance elections are summarized. A statutory violation under &#x00A7; 7116(d) may be raised at the discretion of the party either through the grievance procedure or the ULP procedure, but not both. <span class="Italic">FAA, Spokane Tower and PATCO</span>, 15 FLRA 668, 669 (1984). In addition:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) effectively provides that when in the discretion of the aggrieved party, an issue has been raised under the ULP procedure, the issue subsequently may not be raised as a grievance. The elements of section 7116(d) which must attach in order for a grievance to be precluded are: (1) the issue which is the subject matter of the grievance is the same as the issue which is the subject matter of the unfair labor practice; (2) such issue was earlier raised under the unfair labor practice procedures; and (3) the selection of the unfair labor practice procedures was in the discretion of the aggrieved party....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODDS, Pac. Region and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 17 FLRA 1001, 1002 (1985) (immaterial that charging party withdrew ULP charge prior to its dismissal; initiation of charge served as election of remedies), <span class="Italic">reversed and remanded sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 66 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (FLRA improperly concluded grievance was predicated on same factual basis as ULP; ULP challenged plan to eliminate position; grievance challenged subsequent termination of employee), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">DODDS</span>,<span class="Italic"> Pac. Region and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 29 FLRA 1225 (1987) (reinstating arbitration award).</p>
<p class="noindent">The election is a matter of jurisdiction that the parties cannot waive. If FLRA determines that an election of a grievance procedure occurred, it dismisses a ULP complaint, even though the respondent did not raise the election as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden and IBEW Local 640</span>, 27 FLRA 268, 272 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Coatesville and NAGE Local R3-35</span>, 57 FLRA 663, 666 (2002) (ALJ should not have used sanctioning authority to strike evidence and argument concerning election of remedies issue with jurisdictional import, even though respondent failed to raise issue in answer, prehearing disclosure or opening statement). An ALJ considering a ULP complaint must decide &#x00A7; 7116(d) preclusion issues to determine if the ULP complaint is barred. <span class="Italic">Lowry AFB, Denver and AFGE Local 1974</span>, 29 FLRA 566, 569-70 (1987). [Refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-17-022.html#sec9-23">Grievance or ULP Filings; 5 USC 7116(d)</a>," concerning arbitrators' treatment of the &#x00A7; 7116(d) bar, and to <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic and IBPO Local 800</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-104.html">70 FLRA 512</a> (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (recon. den., 70 FLRA 860 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting)), for FLRA's position on bargaining failures challenged under both ULP and contract grievance procedures.]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA permits individuals to litigate to the MSPB appeals that involve facts or defenses related to ULPs based on, for example, contract repudiation arguments, and for ULP complaints to be pursued if the union and General Counsel present institutional rather than individual interests in the litigation of the ULP. The split approach is based, in part, on differences in remedies available from MSPB and FLRA to address ULPs. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 64 FLRA 355, 361 (2009), explained (over dissenting opinion of Member Beck):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge declined to consider the claims of, or remedies for, the individual employees named in the ULP complaint on the ground that <span id="page_1546"></span>their claims had already been addressed in the negotiated grievance procedure and the MSPB appeals process. <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan, </span>60 FLRA at 909. The Judge stated that he considered evidence of the employee terminations only in relation to the Charging Party's institutional claims because "jurisdiction of removals from federal service is vested exclusively in the MSPB or negotiated grievance procedure and may not be brought as unfair labor practices." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan,</span> 60 FLRA at 909.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that "when an issue is properly raised as [a ULP] under section 7116, nothing therein would prevent the Authority from remedying any violation found." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Air Force Sys. Command, Elec. Sys. Div.,</span> 14 FLRA 390, 392 (1984) <span class="Italic">(Elec. Sys.)</span> (finding that a prior MSPB ruling did not bar a remedy of back pay in ULP case). In the course of rendering his decision on the repudiation issue raised by the Charging Party, the Judge found that the termination of Employees C and N constituted a clear and patent violation of &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan,</span> 60 FLRA at 918-19.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Judge was not barred by &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute from considering a remedy for Employees C and N. <span class="Italic">See Elec. Sys., </span>14 FLRA at 392. In this regard, the purpose of ULP remedies is to restore, "as far as possible, the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained if the violation had not been committed." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Danbury, Danbury, Conn.,</span> 55 FLRA 201, 205 (1999) (citations omitted). As applied here, restoring the "<span class="Italic">status quo</span> that would have obtained" if the Agency had not repudiated the parties' agreement by terminating two employees requires consideration of the impact of the repudiation on those individuals.[10] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, in considering the remedy for this ULP, it is appropriate to take into account the remedies awarded in other appeals processes. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Elec. Sys., </span>14 FLRA at 392 (taking MSPB decision into account in assessing remedy). As the record does not reflect the changes that have occurred since the outset of this proceeding, we leave for compliance proceedings the determination of any specific losses and other appropriate relief for Employees C and N. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Def. Dependents Sch., </span>54 FLRA 259, 270 (1998) (Authority left for compliance proceedings specifics of remedy to compliance proceedings when it reversed judge's finding that remedy was not warranted and appropriate remedy could not be determined due to passage of time).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;As the remedy ordered flows from the institutional claim of contract repudiation--and not from the employees' individual claims--there is no inconsistency with &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Judge's decision is deficient as to its denial of a remedy for Employees C and N, and we grant Employee C and N a "make whole" remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to ULP and MSPB elections, and the background of the <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan AFB </span>approach, through 1994 and 1995, FLRA developed a series of decisions avoiding statutory bars by permitting simultaneous litigation of related cases before the MSPB and before FLRA by distinguishing "issues" and theories of liability and by drawing distinctions based on the identities of the charging party or the appellant. The most recent case law abandons distinctions based on theories of litigation and instead concentrates on the operative events leading to the related claims.</p>
<p class="noindent">The revision in FLRA theory began in 1991 with an FLRA decision that later would be reversed in court. FLRA addressed the distinction in proposed and final actions, the similarity or dissimilarity of issues presented, and its authority to adjudicate ULP charges arising out of proposals that later ripen into final, challenged, actions reviewable by MSPB in <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census and Hanlon</span>, 41 FLRA 436, 437-39 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 885-90 (4th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">post</span>. FLRA's decision first summarized the sequence of events:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hanlon was employed by the Respondent from May 31, 1978, to January 8, 1988, as a statistician/demographer in the Respondent's Population Division. Paula Schneider served as Chief of the Population Division and Hanlon's third-line supervisor. Hanlon was a member of the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2782, the exclusive representative of the Respondent's unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">From April 1985 to November 1987, Hanlon was actively engaged in union organizational and representational activities--including the solicitation of union membership and the distribution of union literature--at the Respondent's Suitland, Maryland location. The Respondent was aware of Hanlon's union activities. From 1985 through 1987, Hanlon filed, in his individual capacity, an unspecified number of ULP charges against the Respondent with the Authority. During this same time period, Hanlon also filed grievances under the applicable collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On or about November 23, 1987, Schneider issued Hanlon a written record of infraction. A record of infraction is not a disciplinary action and is not a grievable matter under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Rather, it is "a precursor to discipline and is used by supervisors to document and report employee violations of Respondent's regulations or standards of conduct." The record of infraction listed four charges, including one that cited Hanlon's "[m]isuse of administrative/judicial procedures" between 1985 and November 23, 1987, by his filing of, among other things, numerous ULP charges and grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hanlon filed a ULP charge with the Authority on November 27, 1987. The charge alleged that the Respondent had committed a ULP by, among other things, basing the record of infraction on Hanlon's statutorily protected right to file ULP charges and grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On or about December 4, 1987, Schneider issued Hanlon a letter of proposed removal. The letter listed four categories which outlined conduct by Hanlon that the Respondent claimed supported the proposed action. These categories were: (1) unauthorized use of the Respondent's computer equipment; (2) unauthorized conduct of personal business while in a duty status; (3) insubordination; and (4) misuse of administrative/judicial procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the fourth category, the letter of proposed removal alleged that between 1985 and December 4, 1987, Hanlon filed "numerous actions[,]" including ULP charges and grievances, "with the intent and effect of impeding the efficiency of the agency and of intimidating agency officials in the pursuit of their official responsibilities." No grievance was filed by Hanlon over the letter of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hanlon filed an amended ULP charge on December 16, 1987. In his amended charge, Hanlon added, among other things, an allegation that the December 4, 1987, letter of proposed removal constituted a ULP because it referenced Hanlon's statutorily-protected right to engage in union activities by filing ULP charges and grievances. The amended charge alleged that the Respondent's letter of December 4, 1987, interfered with the rights of all employees under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 8, 1988, Hanlon was removed from his position. On January 11, 1988, Hanlon filed a grievance challenging his removal. On February 18, 1988, Hanlon invoked arbitration of the grievance. The record does not contain the result of the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Hanlon</span> next addressed the statutory bar or election issue, 41 FLRA at 445-48:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent and OPM, noting that Hanlon was subsequently removed from his position, contend that the Judge erred in concluding that section 7116(d) of the Statute does not preclude the Authority's consideration of the issues presented by the ULP complaint. According to the Respondent, such conclusion is erroneous because the issues presented by the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal may be raised under a statutory appeals procedure involving the removal action. We disagree with the Respondent's contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted earlier, the first sentence of section 7116(d) provides: "Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). Because this case presents a question concerning the statutory bar of section 7116(d), it is necessary to determine whether the issues sought to be resolved in the ULP forum could have been invoked under an appeals procedure. If the issues presented in the ULP proceeding are the same as the issues that could have been raised under the statutory appeal procedure, then section 7116(d) would preclude the matter from being raised in the ULP proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the issues before us are whether the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal contain statements that interfere with employees' rights to engage in protected activity in violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. The evidence reveals that a record of infraction is not a disciplinary action and is not a grievable matter under the parties' contract. Rather, it is a precursor to discipline and is used by supervisors to document and report employees' violations of the Respondent's regulations or standards of conduct. Therefore, the record of infraction could not be appealed to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the letter of proposed removal, under MSPB regulations and case law, proposed actions are not appealable to the MSPB....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, we find that the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal are not actions appealable to the MSPB. As such actions are not appealable, the issues presented in the ULP complaint are not issues that could properly be raised in a statutory appeals procedure. We find, therefore, that the ULP complaint, which concerns only the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal, and not the removal action itself, is not barred by the first sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute from consideration in the ULP forum. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Department of Interior, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Government Comptroller for the Virgin Islands</span>, 11 FLRA 521, 529-531 (1983) (where the Authority adopted a Judge's decision finding that the first sentence of section 7116(d) did not bar his consideration of a ULP complaint alleging a section 7116(a)(1) violation because the removal action, which had been appealed to MSPB and was pending at the time of the ULP hearing, was not before him).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in interpreting the second sentence of section 7116(d), relying on the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association v. FLRA</span>, <span id="page_1547"></span>824 F.2d 61, 72 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (<span class="Italic">OEA</span>), we have developed a test for determining whether issues raised in an arbitration proceeding are the same as the issues that are raised in a ULP proceeding. For purposes of applying the jurisdictional bar set forth in the second sentence of section 7116(d), we examine whether the subject matter of a ULP charge is the same, in terms of the factual predicate and theory, as the subject matter of a grievance....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that test to the first sentence of section 7116(d), we conclude that the ULP complaint in this case is not barred by the Statute. Although the factual predicate of the ULP charge might also have been a basis of the final removal action, the theory of the ULP charge is different from that that would be applicable to review of the final removal action. As noted above, the ULP charge presented issues pertaining to the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal, which are not subject to review in a statutory appeals procedure. The theory advanced in the ULP charge is that the Respondent, by the statements contained in the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal, violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, while the removal concerns the termination of the employee and the application of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. Consequently, the theory that applies to our consideration of the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal is different from the theory that is applicable to the final removal action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is therefore distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Army Finance and Accounting Center</span>. In that case, we set aside an arbitrator's award finding that a grievant's 10-day suspension was not for just cause. We concluded that the grievance concerning a 10-day suspension presented the same issue as a ULP charge concerning a proposed suspension and, therefore, that section 7116(d) barred the grievance. In so concluding, we noted that the factual predicates and theory for the ULP charge and the grievance were the same. In this case, however, the theory of the violation presented in the ULP charge is different from that applicable to the matters at issue in the final removal action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the Respondent's reliance on Authority arbitration decisions involving section 7121(f) of the Statute to support its position that the complaint is barred from our consideration under section 7116(d) is misplaced. The cases cited by the Respondent all involved exceptions to arbitration awards "relating to a matter described in [section] 7121(f)," such as a removal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a). In each case, the Authority found that it was without jurisdiction under section 7122(a) of the Statute to resolve the exceptions because the subject involved "relat[ed] to" a matter described in section 7121(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7116(d) of the Statute, however, a ULP complaint alleging a violation of the Statute is not precluded from the Authority's consideration under the ULP procedure simply because it "relates to" a matter that is the subject of an appeals procedure. Rather, section 7116(d) bars processing of an issue as a ULP only if that same issue can be properly raised under an appeals procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">DOI Virgin Islands</span>. As discussed above, the issues involved in this ULP could not be properly raised in a statutory appeals procedure. Therefore, section 7116(d) does not bar our consideration of the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's views in <span class="Italic">Hanlon</span> did not survive scrutiny by the Fourth Circuit. That court decided, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 885-90 (4th Cir. 1992), that Mr. Hanlon's MSPB challenge to the removal precluded indirect resort to FLRA to challenge the events leading to and relating to the removal:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1978 Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) to replace the prior "patchwork" system of laws governing federal employment with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 668, 672, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988). Prior to CSRA, federal employees could bring employment actions in a variety of administrative and judicial forums, sometimes leading to confusing and contradictory results. Under the simplified scheme provided by Congress, employment matters that involve employees' rights to engage in union-related activities generally may be brought before the FLRA as ULP charges, while matters involving hiring, firing, "failure to promote," and the like, are delegated generally to the jurisdiction of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Chapter 71 of CSRA, it is an ULP for any federal government agency, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to "interfere with, restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right" granted by the Chapter. 5 U.S.C.A. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) (1980). One such union-related right is to be free from discipline for filing "a complaint, affidavit, or petition...." &#x00A7; 7116(a)(4). A victim of an alleged ULP may petition the General Counsel of the FLRA, and, after investigation, the General Counsel may conduct hearings to resolve the employee's complaint. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7118, 7105(a)(2)(G). Once it determines that a governmental employer has committed an ULP, the FLRA is empowered to order broad remedial action forbidding the agency to engage in similar activity as to all of its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7501(g)(3); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Judicial review of FLRA decisions may be had in either the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the aggrieved party resides or conducts business, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CSRA precludes the FLRA from adjudicating certain types of employment actions.&#x2003;Specifically, "issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised [before the FLRA] as unfair labor practices...." &#x00A7; 7116(d) (first sentence). The "appeals procedure" relevant to this case is provided by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which, under CSRA, is granted responsibility for adjudicating employees' appeals from various types of "adverse personnel actions." &#x00A7; 7513(d). The adverse personnel actions over which the MSPB has exclusive jurisdiction, include: "(1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than fourteen days; (3) a reduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough of thirty days or less." &#x00A7; 7512.[1] Decisions rendered under the MSPB procedure are reviewable only by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;If a government agency's collective bargaining agreement provides a negotiated grievance procedure, the government employee who challenges an adverse personnel action may, in his discretion, seek a remedy from either the MSPB, or, as an alternative, under the negotiated grievance procedure. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 652, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2885, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985). In the instant case, Hanlon chose to pursue his challenge to his removal under the negotiated grievance procedure. For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to both of these options collectively as "the MSPB procedure."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Edward Hanlon was employed as a statistician/demographer by the Bureau of the Census, an agency of the Department of Commerce, between 1978 and 1988. From 1985 to 1987 he was actively engaged in union organizational and representational activities of which the Bureau was aware. During his three and one half years as a union organizer Hanlon filed fifty-five ULP charges against the Bureau on his own behalf. Of those charges, four resulted in final FLRA decisions in his favor, and an undetermined number of charges were withdrawn after negotiation. The General Counsel of the FLRA agreed to pursue a total of twelve of his claims, and expressly declined to pursue ten, apparently finding that they were without merit. During the same time period, Hanlon brought six lawsuits against his employer, and filed dozens of Freedom of Information Act requests.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In November of 1987 Hanlon's supervisor issued him a written "record of infraction," listing four charges against him: (1) unauthorized use of the Bureau's computer equipment; (2) unauthorized conduct of personal business while on duty status; (3) insubordination; and, (4) misuse of administrative/judicial procedures between 1985 and 1987 "by filing numerous actions including Privacy Act Requests, FOIA requests, ULPs, grievances and lawsuits with the intent and effect of impeding the efficiency of the agency...." A record of infraction acts as warning to an employee, and is not statutorily required as a precursor to discharge. Immediately after receiving the record of infraction Hanlon filed a new ULP charge with the FLRA, alleging that the Bureau had committed an ULP by disciplining him for exercising his statutorily protected right to file ULP charges and other employment actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In early December of 1987, before the FLRA General Counsel had taken action on Hanlon's most recent ULP charge, he received from the Bureau a letter of proposed removal, listing as grounds for removal the same four charges that appeared in the earlier record of infraction. A letter of proposed removal is a statutorily mandated precursor to dismissal of a federal employee in Hanlon's class. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hanlon amended his earlier-filed ULP charge to add a claim that the letter of proposed removal constituted an ULP because it was grounded in part on his statutorily protected right to file ULP charges and grievances. In addition to alleging that the letter interfered with his own rights, Hanlon claimed in his amended ULP charge that the Bureau's actions interfered with the rights of all Bureau employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On January 8, 1988, Hanlon was removed from his position. Three days later he filed a grievance challenging his removal. Because removal from employment is an "adverse employment action," <span class="Italic">see</span> &#x00A7; 7512, Hanlon was constrained to challenge it under the MSPB procedure. However, by so grieving his removal, he initiated a second administrative procedure: the first, his ULP charge, was aimed at the events leading up to his discharge, the second, his grievance, was aimed at his actual discharge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In February of 1988, after Hanlon's removal, and after he had initiated a MSPB procedure, the FLRA's General Counsel issued an ULP complaint alleging that the Bureau's references to Hanlon's earlier filings of ULP complaints violated the command of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) of CSRA that no government agency "interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter." Sitting in judgment on Hanlon's ULP claim, an administrative law judge (ALJ) rendered a decision in his favor, rejecting, among other things, the <span id="page_1548"></span>Bureau's contention that the FLRA was jurisdictionally barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d) from entertaining Hanlon's ULP charge, and that, once the Bureau initiated discharge procedures against Hanlon, his sole remedy lay in the MSPB procedure. The ALJ agreed with Hanlon that although his ultimate removal was the sort of "adverse personnel action" over which the MSPB has exclusive jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see</span> 7116(d) (first sentence), his ULP charge did not challenge his removal, rather, it challenged only the initial record of infraction and letter of proposed removal. Because the record of infraction and the letter of proposed removal were divisible from Hanlon's ultimate removal, and because the MSPB did not have jurisdiction to review a challenge to either of those preliminary actions, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240,1243 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (MSPB has no jurisdiction to consider proposals to remove because they are not listed in 5 USC 7512 and are thus not appealable adverse actions in themselves), both were properly adjudicated by the FLRA as ULP complaints.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ALJ issued a cease and desist order which included directions to the Bureau to remove from Hanlon's record of infraction and letter of proposed removal any reference to his earlier filing of ULP charges and grievances. The ALJ's order explicitly stated that the Bureau was free to proceed with its discharge of Hanlon, but that in doing so it could not rely on information regarding his earlier employment actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sitting in review of the ALJ's administrative ruling, the FLRA affirmed, finding that jurisdiction lay in the FLRA to consider Hanlon's ULP claim, and that the Bureau had committed an ULP against Hanlon. The Bureau petitioned for review, arguing that because Hanlon's ULP complaint is inextricably linked to his MSPB challenge to his removal, exclusive administrative jurisdiction over his entire case lies in the MSPB, requiring invalidation of the ruling already rendered by the ALJ and affirmed by the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, prior to CSRA, administrative and judicial review of federal government personnel actions was unpredictable and inconsistent. "The general perception was that 'appeals processes [were] so lengthy and complicated that managers [in the civil service] often avoid[ed] taking disciplinary action' against employees even when it was clearly warranted." <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 445, 108 S. Ct. at 672 (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 9 (1978)). One important element of Congress's plan to simplify federal employees' personnel actions was</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the primacy of the MSPB for administrative resolution of disputes over adverse personnel actions, and the primacy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review. This enables the development, through the MSPB, of a unitary and consistent Executive Branch position on matters involving personnel action, avoids an unnecessary layer of judicial review in lower federal courts, and encourages more consistent judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 449, 108 S. Ct. at 674 (citations omitted). In accordance with its desire to streamline the administrative adjudication of personnel matters and give the MSPB power over adverse personnel actions, Congress promulgated 7116(d), which states that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section. Except for matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The import of the second sentence of this provision is clear: federal employees generally have the right to choose between bringing their employment-related complaints as ULP charges, or as grievances under the employees' negotiated grievance procedure. The second sentence also clearly mandates that once an employee has chosen between a negotiated grievance procedure and an ULP procedure, the other avenue is foreclosed....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the second sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d) does not afford a choice of administrative forums to all aggrieved employees. Excluded from the flexibility of the second sentence are "matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure." In the instant case, Hanlon's removal falls within this exception: it was an "adverse personnel action," and thus was a matter that he could either appeal to the MSPB or pursue via a negotiated grievance procedure. As such, it was a matter "under section 7121(e) and (f)," and fell within the exception to the second sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d). Hanlon therefore did not fall into the general category of those who may choose between pursuing an employment action under the grievance procedure or as an ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of 7116(d) dictates the appropriate forum for Hanlon's challenge to his removal. Because his discharge was one of the adverse employment actions enumerated in &#x00A7; 7512, his challenge to his discharge "can be properly raised under an appeals procedure," (i.e., the MSPB procedure), and thus "may not be raised as an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 7116(d) (first sentence).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Hanlon and the FLRA concede that he had no choice of administrative forum when it came to challenging his ultimate removal: under the first sentence of 7116(d) he was constrained to bring his discharge challenge under the MSPB procedure. They contend, however, that Hanlon's earlier challenges to the initial record of infraction and letter of proposed removal were matters sufficiently separate from his ultimate removal that, in his challenge to those initial administrative actions, he retained the option, afforded by the second sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d), to bring his challenge either as an ULP or as a grievance. In the instant case, Hanlon and the FLRA claim, he chose to present his challenge as an ULP, the ULP was decided in his favor, and that favorable ruling should stand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, as Hanlon and the FLRA frame the argument, the central issue to be decided on appeal is whether Hanlon's earlier challenges to the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal are sufficiently discrete from his challenge to his ultimate removal, that he may maintain them in two separate administrative proceedings. We believe that both Congress's clear intent, as reflected in the language and statutory history of CSRA, and prior decisions of the FLRA, compel a finding that the actions are inseparable, and, therefore, that sole jurisdiction lies in the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, a Union filed an ULP on an employee's behalf, challenging a government agency's proposed suspension of the employee. Later, following the employee's suspension, the employee initiated a grievance procedure. The government agency contended that, under the second sentence of 7116(d) the employee was barred from initiating a grievance procedure, given that the employee had already elected to challenge the proposed suspension in an ULP charge. A central issue in the case was whether the employee's grievance over an actual suspension presented the same factual and legal issues as the earlier ULP charge relating to the proposed suspension. The FLRA found that the same issue was raised in both procedures and that the later-filed procedure was therefore jurisdictionally barred under &#x00A7; 7116(d):</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[W]e do not believe that the fact that the suspension was proposed at the time of the ULP charge was filed, but was definite when the grievance was filed, is dispositive. In determining whether the procedures involved the same issue, the [FLRA] looks at whether the ULP charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the ULP charge and the grievance are substantially similar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1350-51. Although <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> focused on the second sentence of 7116(d), whereas the instant case focuses on the first sentence, the bedrock logic of the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> holding is transferable: an employee may not separate a proposed adverse personnel action from an actual adverse personnel action when both are based on the same underlying facts and legal theories.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In Hanlon's case there is no doubt that the essential issue presented in his ULP claim was in almost every respect the same as the issue presented in his later grievance. In both procedures he objected to the Bureau's reliance on his alleged misuse of administrative and judicial personnel procedures, and in both he claimed that such reliance violated his right to seek redress for wrongs perpetrated by his employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA argues that the legal bases of Hanlon's two administrative procedures were different. The FLRA notes that Hanlon's ULP complaint relied explicitly on &#x00A7; 7116(a), which lists actions that an employee may challenge as unfair labor practices, while his MSPB challenge to his removal was legally grounded on &#x00A7; 7701, which sets forth MSPB procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not find dispositive the fact that Hanlon cited one statutory provision for his ULP complaint and another for his MSPB procedure.&#x2003;All that this reveals is the obvious: that the statutory provisions governing the adjudication of ULPs before the FLRA and grievances under the MSPB procedure are different. The fact that the separate forums are governed by separate statutory provisions cannot change the essential fact that the legal arguments Hanlon presented to each body were substantially the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA also contends that the legal issues presented in Hanlon's ULP claim were distinct from those presented in the MSPB procedure in that the ULP complaint was lodged on behalf of all Bureau employees, while the MSPB procedure raises only Hanlon's rights as an individual employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A similar contention was raised and rejected in <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>. There, the Union filed an ULP charge, claiming that the government agency's disciplinary action of an employee would have a chilling effect on Union activities. After the FLRA resolved the ULP in favor of the agency, the <span id="page_1549"></span>employee in her individual capacity tried to grieve the discipline. Pointing to &#x00A7; 7116(d), the FLRA determined that the employee was barred from filing a grievance, since the factual predicate and legal theories of her argument were the same as those already raised by the Union in the ULP procedure. The FLRA specifically found that "while portions of the ULP charge appear to address the Union's institutional interest, it is clear that the ULP charge was not filed solely in the Union's institutional interest." <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> at 1352-53. The FLRA concluded that the individual employee was actually the aggrieved party in the ULP action, and, therefore, that she could not maintain a second administrative action in the form of a grievance....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, an examination of Hanlon's complaint reveals that, although in his amended ULP charge he invoked the rights of all employees, the charge focused on his individual right, and thus was essentially the same as his later grievance under the MSPB procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we are unswayed by the policy argument put forward by the FLRA. The FLRA contends that to reject its position in this case will be to leave federal employees without a means of challenging preliminary disciplinary actions such as records of infraction and letters of proposed removal. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in our ruling prevents employees from lodging ULP charges to complain about unfair disciplinary actions.&#x2003;Only where those initial disciplinary actions ripen into full-blown "adverse employment actions" will sole jurisdiction vest in the MSPB under the first sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d). Moreover, where the government agency does initiate a full-blown removal procedure, and where jurisdiction thus vests in the MSPB (or in the negotiated grievance procedure), the aggrieved employee may raise in the MSPB procedure the exact arguments that he would have raised before the FLRA; for, although the MSPB cannot adjudicate an ULP charge <span class="Italic">per se</span>, <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Small</span>, 840 F.2d 972, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1988), facts underlying an ULP charge may also be challenged under the MSPB procedure as "prohibited personnel practices." <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7; 2302. In the instant case, for example, Hanlon's challenge to his record of infraction and letter of proposed removal may be raised in an MSPB procedure under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(a), which prohibits personnel action due to the "exercise of any appeal, complaint or grievance right granted by any law, rule or regulation." In other words, Hanlon and other employees can find equivalent relief before the MSPB and should not be heard to complain that the FLRA is the sole forum capable of granting meaningful relief.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Hanlon deviated from Congress's intent, as expressed in CSRA, when he attempted to maintain two simultaneous administrative challenges to his removal, each relying on essentially the same facts and legal arguments. If permitted to pursue both claims, Hanlon's legal arguments would be tried to two separate forums, and would follow separate paths of appeal--exactly the result that Congress intended to avoid when it streamlined federal employment law in CSRA. Accordingly, we vacate the FLRA's decision and remand to that Agency with directions to dismiss Hanlon's ULP complaint for lack of jurisdiction to entertain it.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA adopted the Fourth Circuit's analysis when it considered <span class="Italic">SBA and Wildberger</span>, 51 FLRA 413, 418-22 (1995), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. FLRA</span>, 132 F.3d 784, 787-95 (D.C. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 54 FLRA 837 (1998) (sustaining factual and procedural rulings of ALJ). In <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, FLRA adopted a rule that "when the factual predicate of the ULP and the statutory appeal is the same, and the legal theory supporting the statutory appeal has been or could properly be raised to the MSPB, we will decline to assert jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice pursuant to section 7116(d)." FLRA reserved to its own jurisdiction a ULP that focuses on a union's institutional interest in protecting the rights of other employees. The essence of the decision was that FLRA will assert its jurisdiction when the ULP focuses on the union's institutional interest in protecting the rights of other employees. Through its deferral, FLRA ceded to the MSPB a large measure of protection established by the labor relations title of the Reform Act for individuals subjected to adverse actions resulting as reprisals against their union activities. The MSPB, no champion of union rights, will not likely wield the same remedial power possessed by FLRA. <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This consolidated case presents the Authority with an opportunity to reexamine previous Authority precedent interpreting the statutory bar set forth in the first sentence of section 7116(d): "Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section." Our review is prompted by the decision of the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, in which the court reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Census I</span> [41 FLRA 436 (1991)], and held that a record of infraction and letter of proposed removal were inseparable from an employee's subsequent challenge to a removal before MSPB and that the MSPB had sole jurisdiction to consider the merits of any challenge to these actions. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 888.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons more fully explained below, we find that we lack jurisdiction over the subject matter of the complaints in this case because the same factual predicate and legal theories underlie each unfair labor practice complaint and Wildberger's challenge of his removal before the MSPB. Accordingly, we dismiss the unfair labor practice complaints in this consolidated case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Precedent</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, as relevant here, an individual filed an unfair labor practice charge challenging the agency's reference to protected activities in a record of infraction and a letter of proposed removal issued to him. The Authority determined that the question presented was whether "issues presented in the ULP proceeding are the same as the issues that could have been raised under the statutory appeal procedure...." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 445. If so, "then section 7116(d) would preclude the matter from being raised in the unfair labor practice proceeding<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the jurisdictional bar in the first sentence of section 7116(d) was inapplicable in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, the Authority relied on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Indiana and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411</span>, 38 FLRA 1345 (1991), <span class="Italic">petition for review denied sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Army Finance). Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 447. In <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, the Authority had developed a test for determining whether the jurisdictional bar in the second sentence of section 7116(d)[6] applied, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the issues raised in an arbitration proceeding are the same as the issues that are raised in the unfair labor practice charge. <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1351. In adapting the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test to the <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span> case, the Authority held that the jurisdictional bar in the first sentence in section 7116(d) would correspondingly be invoked if "the subject matter of an unfair labor practice charge is the same, in terms of the factual predicate and theory, as the subject matter of a grievance." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, 41 FLRA at 446-47 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The second sentence of section 7116(d) states as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Except for matters wherein, under section 7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test to the facts presented in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, a scenario which implicated the first sentence of section 7116(d), the Authority held that the unfair labor practice allegation was not barred by the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 447. Although the Authority found that the factual predicate of the unfair labor practice charge might also have been a basis of the final removal action, the Authority concluded that the theory of the unfair labor practice charge was different from the theory applicable to review of the final removal action because the unfair labor practice charge presented issues relating to the record of infraction and letter of proposed removal--matters that are not subject to review in a statutory appeals procedure. Consequently, two distinct sections of Title 5 of the United States Code provided the basis for the respective legal theories. The unfair labor practice charge was premised on a violation of section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute, whereas the removal implicated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. Thus, the Authority found the statutory bar inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Section 7116(d) Statutory Bar</span> <span class="Italic">in the Commerce Decision</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal to the Fourth Circuit, the court reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>, and determined that the first sentence of section 7116(d) barred the Authority from asserting jurisdiction over the record of infraction and a notice of proposed removal. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 888.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court agreed with the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(d) as articulated in <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>. However, the court disagreed with the Authority's application in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>. Specifically, the court rejected the Authority's finding that the underlying legal theories supporting the unfair labor practice charge and the removal action were different. The court stated that the employee could raise the same legal arguments before the MSPB that he could raise in an unfair labor practice allegation before the Authority. In this connection, an employee may challenge the agency's actions as a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 890. Thus, the court held that a proposed adverse personnel action may not be separated from an actual adverse personnel action when both are based on the same underlying facts and legal theories. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 889.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court reasoned that its holding was consistent with the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) and its legislative history. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 885. The court noted that in enacting the CSRA, Congress sought to replace a "'patchwork' system of laws governing [F]ederal employment" that "sometimes [led] to confusing and contradictory results" with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of [F]ederal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, <span id="page_1550"></span>484 U.S. 439, 445 (1988)). In the court's view, under the CSRA scheme of adjudication, Congress intended that the jurisdiction of the Authority and MSPB be limited to distinct employment-related matters. The court pointed out that under Chapter 71 of the CSRA, the Authority adjudicates issues that relate to employees' rights to engage in union-related activities; the MSPB, on the other hand, is responsible for adjudicating employees' appeals from various types of adverse personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such adverse actions include, among other things, a removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court made two additional points.&#x2003;First, it stated that "[n]othing...prevents employees from lodging ULP charges to complain about unfair disciplinary actions. Only where those initial disciplinary actions ripen into full-blown 'adverse employment actions' will sole jurisdiction vest in the MSPB under the first sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d)." <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 890. Second, the court found that the employee's ULP "charge focused on his individual right and thus was essentially the same as his later grievance under the MSPB procedure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 889. As a result, the ULP allegation did not address the union's institutional interests. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Clarification of the Test to Determine If the Section 7116(d) Bar Applies</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> decision, we take this opportunity to clarify how the Authority will apply its <span class="Italic">Army</span> <span class="Italic">Finance</span> test in cases analogous to <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span>. Where an employee has attempted to raise related issues both in an unfair labor practice proceeding and under either an appeals procedure or a negotiated grievance procedure, we will apply the <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> test in order to determine whether to invoke the jurisdictional bars set forth in section 7116(d). We will examine the subject matter of the ULP charge to determine if the factual predicate and legal theory are the same as the matter raised in the appeals procedure or grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this examination, however, we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">Bureau of Census I</span> insofar as that decision held that the legal theories upon which an unfair labor practice allegation is based are different from the legal theories underlying a removal proceeding before the MSPB merely because different statutory review provisions are applicable in each instance. The <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> decision held that the legislative history underlying the enactment of the CSRA discussed above--to avoid potentially inconsistent results between Authority and MSPB decisions--compels this determination. As the Fourth Circuit noted, an employee may raise an affirmative defense before the MSPB that the agency committed a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 890. We agree with the Fourth Circuit and conclude that in some circumstances the same legal theory that can be raised as a "prohibited personnel practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) can also be raised as an "unfair labor practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a). Accordingly, when the factual predicate of the ULP and the statutory appeal is the same, and the legal theory supporting the statutory appeal has been or could properly be raised to the MSPB, we will decline to assert jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice pursuant to section 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, we will apply this rule only in cases when the matter raised in the ULP allegation ripens into or is inseparable from the matter appealable to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 889-90. Additionally, unlike the Authority's statutory jurisdiction to review unfair labor practice allegations of, and grant relief to, individuals <span class="Italic">and</span> labor organizations, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a)(1) &#x0026; 7118(a)(1), (7), the MSPB's statutory jurisdiction is limited, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) &#x0026; (b)(2)(A), to reviewing appeals by, and granting relief to, employees or applicants. <span class="Italic">Reid v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("[I]t would be contrary to the plain and unequivocal language of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)] to say that the term 'employee'...encompasses a labor organization[.]"). Accordingly, we will decline jurisdiction in cases where the ULP focuses on the rights of an individual employee; conversely, we will assert jurisdiction when the ULP focuses on the union's institutional interest in protecting the rights of other employees. <span class="Italic">See Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 889; <span class="Italic">cf. Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1353 (construing and applying second sentence of section 7116(d), where individual employee is actually the aggrieved party in the ULP action, employee cannot maintain separate action in the form of a grievance).</p>
<p class="noindent">The result in <span class="Italic">SBA and Wildberger</span> was essentially adopted, although limited to the facts before the court, in <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. FLRA</span>, 132 F.3d 784, 787-95 (D.C. Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 54 FLRA 837 (1998), exploring the interplay of remedies available through ULP procedures of FLRA and appellate procedures of MSPB:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Civil Service Reform Act, codified at Title 5 of the U.S. Code, the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "the Authority") is authorized to address charges of unfair labor practices against federal employers, <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 (1994); &#x00A7; 7116(a)-(c) (defining unfair labor practices), while the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "the Board") is authorized to adjudicate employees' appeals from "adverse personnel actions," including suspensions and terminations of employment<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501-7543, 7701-7703. At issue in this case is the Authority's interpretation of the first sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d), which provides that "[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure [before the MSPB] may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant Robert W.&#x2003;Wildberger, Jr., seeks review of the Authority's order dismissing three consolidated unfair labor practice complaints against his former employer, the Small Business Administration ("SBA"), for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to section 7116(d). In addressing Wildberger's claims, the Authority first clarified its rule for determining whether section 7116(d)'s jurisdictional bar applies. On this point, the FLRA held that when the factual predicate and the legal theory underlying an unfair labor practice complaint and a MSPB appeal are the same, the Authority will decline to assert jurisdiction over the unfair, labor practice complaint. <span class="Italic">United States Small Business Admin. and Robert Wildberger</span>, 51 FLRA 413, 1995 WL 648828, at *7 (F.L.R.A. Oct. 31, 1995) (<span class="Italic">"Wildberger [FLRA]</span><span class="Italic">"). </span>Purporting to apply this rule, the Authority dismissed all three of Wildberger's consolidated complaints on jurisdictional grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We can find no basis for overturning the Authority's rule for denying jurisdiction under the first sentence of section 7116(d) where: (1) the complaining employee has raised all of the issues that underscore his unfair labor practice charges--in terms of both the factual predicate and the legal theories raised--in his appeal before the MSPB; (2) these issues are within the compass of the MSPB's jurisdiction; and (3) the MSPB has not declined jurisdiction over any of the claims raised by the employee. We find that the Authority correctly applied this rule in two of the three consolidated complaints. Our holding is narrowly tailored to the facts of this case and does not address the application of section 7116(d) where the factors emphasized here are not present.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I.&#x2003; BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Statutory Scheme</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1978, Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act to replace the prior "patchwork" system of laws governing federal employment with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S. Ct. 668, 672, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988). Prior to the Act, federal employees could bring employment actions in a variety of administrative and judicial forums, sometimes leading to confusing and contradictory results. Under the Act's simplified scheme, employment matters involving federal employees' rights to engage in union-related activities generally may be raised with the FLRA as unfair labor practice charges, while matters involving hiring, firing, failure to promote, and the like are within the jurisdiction of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A victim of an alleged unfair labor practice may petition the FLRA's General Counsel, who determines whether the allegations constitute an unfair labor practice and, if so, files a complaint on behalf of the party making the allegations. 5 U.S.C. 7118. The FLRA may conduct hearings to resolve such complaints. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(6)-(8). Once it determines that a federal employer has committed an unfair labor practice, the FLRA is empowered to order broad remedial action prohibiting the agency from engaging in similar activity as to all of its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(g)(3), 7118(a)(7); <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 910 F.2d 964, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). Judicial review of FLRA decisions may be had in either the U.S. Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the aggrieved party resides or conducts business, or in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. &#x00A7; 7123(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The adverse personnel actions over which the MSPB has exclusive jurisdiction include: "(1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than fourteen days; (3) a reduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough of thirty days or less." &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7701. Decisions rendered by the MSPB regarding appeals of such actions are reviewable only by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Chapter 23 of Title 5 sets forth Merit System Principles, including prohibited personnel practices, to guide the MSPB. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301-2305. These principles prohibit any person who has authority to take an adverse action against a subordinate employee from doing so in retaliation for the subordinate employee's "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation," &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), including the exercise of rights referenced in &#x00A7; 7116(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bodinus v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 7 MSPB 385, 7 M.S.P.R. 536, 540-41 (1981) (construing &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) to include union representational activities,); <span class="Italic">id</span>. 7 M.S.P.R. at 541-42 ("[W]hile the Board is without jurisdiction to adjudicate an unfair labor practice allegation based on anti-union animus,...the Board may properly consider appellant's alleged evidence of anti-union animus if it is pertinent to showing his affirmative defense of a violation of 2302(b)(9).").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(d) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(d)&#x2003;Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section. Except for matters wherein, under section <span id="page_1551"></span>7121(e) and (f) of this title, an employee has an option of using the negotiated grievance procedure or an appeals procedure, issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice under this section, but not under both procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision is intended to simplify adjudication of employee rights and avoid the confusing and contradictory outcomes which could result if parties were permitted to adjudicate the same issue in a variety of administrative and judicial forums with overlapping, jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Carter v. Kurzejeski</span>, 706 F.2d 835, 839-40 (8th Cir. 1983) ("Th[e] procedural framework [of the Civil Service Reform Act] indicates the care taken by Congress to preserve the rights of aggrieved employees while avoiding the problems of overlapping and inconsistent jurisdiction. Congress obviously recognized multiple possibilities for jurisdiction by arbitrators, the FLRA, the MSPB, and the courts in fashioning this framework.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Wildberger's Claims</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Appellant Wildberger was employed by the SBA as a program analyst from June 1980 until September 1992 when his employment was terminated.&#x2003;In the year immediately preceding his termination, Wildberger, a former president of the American Federation of Government Employees local that represents SBA employees, formed a rival union, Solidarity, USA ("Solidarity"). Wildberger spent considerable time that year trying to recruit SBA employees to join Solidarity. Wildberger engaged in his Solidarity-related union organizing activities during work hours, using agency resources and equipment such as the SBA e-mail system and SBA telephones.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Due to clashes between Wildberger and SBA management over the manner in which he carried out his Solidarity-related activities, Wildberger filed unfair labor practice charges against the SBA, which resulted in the FLRA's issuance of the three complaints at issue here. The threat complaint, issued July 29, 1992, addressed Wildberger's claim that SBA supervisor James Charney had threatened to deny Wildberger's training requests and to fire him unless "the conflict created by the labor organization Wildberger had formed" stopped. The proposed removal complaint, issued October 13, 1992, challenged the SBA's issuance on August 3, 1992, of a letter proposing to terminate Wildberger on numerous grounds, including his willful refusal to comply with SBA directives not to use SBA equipment and official work time to conduct Solidarity-related business. The disparate treatment complaint, issued November 20, 1992, alleged that the SBA had discriminated against Wildberger for engaging in protected activity by inundating him with memoranda, prohibiting him from using SBA equipment for personal use, and imposing other restrictions on him, even though other employees in his bargaining unit were not subject to such restrictions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 16, 1992, the SBA terminated Wildberger for the reasons specified in the notice of proposed removal. Wildberger appealed his termination to the MSPB. Wildberger argued to the MSPB that his termination was unlawful because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, (1) the termination was indicative of retaliation and discrimination based on his exercise of statutorily protected rights, as alleged in the disparate treatment and proposed removal complaints, and (2) the SBA official who proposed his removal, James Charney, was motivated by personal animus against Wildberger. In alleging animus on the part of Charney, Wildberger referenced the same incidents alleged in the threat complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 7, 1994, an Administrative Law Judge for the FLRA ("FLRA-ALJ") held hearings on Wildberger's unfair labor practice complaints. The FLRA-ALJ recommended that the threat complaint and the disparate treatment complaint be dismissed on the merits, based on his findings that the evidence presented as to each failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the SBA had engaged in an unfair labor practice. The FLRA-ALJ recommended that the proposed removal complaint be dismissed pursuant to section 7116(d) for lack of jurisdiction. (citing <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992)). Both Wildberger and the General Counsel for the FLRA filed exceptions to the FLRA-ALJ's recommendations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The MSPB Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On May 4, 1995, the Administrative Law Judge hearing Wildberger's MSPB appeal ("MSPB-ALJ") concluded that the SBA had just cause for terminating Wildberger's employment. The Board affirmed the MSPB-ALJ's decision, in relevant part, on March 6, 1996. <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 667 (1996) (modifying in part and affirming in part). One of the bases for termination upheld by the MSPB-ALJ was Wildberger's willful refusal to comply with SBA directives not to use SBA equipment official work time to conduct Solidarity-related business. The MSPB-ALJ also considered and rejected Wildberger's affirmative defenses, including his claim that the proposing official, James Charney, was motivated by personal animus and his claim that the removal action was taken in retaliation for protected union activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Authority's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 31, 1995, the Authority reviewed the FLRA-ALJ's recommendations and dismissed all three unfair labor practice complaints on jurisdictional grounds. After first reviewing its own precedents as well as circuit law interpreting section 7116(d), the Authority clarified its test for determining whether the jurisdictional bar imposed by the first sentence of section 7116(d) applies: when the factual predicate and the legal theory underlying an unfair labor practice complaint and a MSPB appeal are the same, the Authority will decline to assert jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice complaint. <span class="Italic">Wildberger [FLRA]</span>, 1995 WL 648828, at *7. The Authority clarified that, because the FLRA--unlike the MSPB--has jurisdiction to review unfair labor practice charges brought by labor organizations as well as individuals, it would retain jurisdiction over charges brought by labor organizations that focus on the organization's institutional interests, as opposed to the rights of an individual employee, notwithstanding any related MSPB appeals brought by individual employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority then dismissed all three of Wildberger's consolidated complaints as subject to section 7116(d)'s jurisdictional bar. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *8-9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Wildberger, acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, appealed the Authority's decisions to this court, and the court appointed <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> ("<span class="Italic">Amicus</span>") to present arguments on his behalf.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Standard of Review</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[T]he Authority is entitled to considerable deference when it exercises its special function of applying the general provisions of [the Civil Service Reform] Act to the complexities of federal labor relations." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S. Ct. 439, 444, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983) (internal quotations omitted). We defer to the FLRA's construction of its enabling statute, including its interpretation of its statutory jurisdiction, so long as it is reasonable and not contrary to congressional intent. <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. FLRA</span>, 967 F.2d 658, 665 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842-44, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781-83, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984)); <span class="Italic">see also Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. FERC</span>, 28 F.3d 1281, 1283-84 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (applying <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to agency's determination of its statutory jurisdiction). Section 7123(c) provides for judicial review of the Authority's orders on the record in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC 706. Accordingly, we "set aside the FLRA's order only if it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit</span>, 967 F.2d at 665.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Clarifying Section 7116(d)'s Jurisdictional Bars</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Finance &#x0026; Accounting Ctr. and American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1411</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 1345 (1991) ("<span class="Italic">Army Finance</span>"), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom. American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>"), the Authority developed a test for determining whether a grievance brought under a contractual grievance procedure raises the same issue as an earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge for the purpose of applying the jurisdictional bar imposed by the second sentence of section 7116(d) (requiring an aggrieved party to choose between a contractual grievance procedure and filing an unfair labor practice charge with the FLRA). Under this test,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n determining whether the procedures involved the same issue, the Authority does not focus on whether the action was proposed or definite. Rather, the Authority looks at whether the [unfair labor practice] charge arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the grievance and the theory advanced in support of the [unfair labor practice] charge and the grievance are substantially similar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1350-51. The Authority found that the basic principles of preclusion outlined in <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> should be adopted here in applying the jurisdictional bar imposed by the first sentence of section 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Wildberger [FLRA]</span>, 1995 WL 648828, at *7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We can find no quibble with the Authority's rule, insofar as it is limited to circumstances where (1) the complaining employee has raised all of the issues that underscore his unfair labor practice charges in his appeal before the MSPB; (2) these issues are within the compass of the MSPB's jurisdiction; and (3) the MSPB has not declined jurisdiction over any of the claims raised by the employee. Consistent with the test articulated by the Authority in <span class="Italic">Army Finance</span> and affirmed by this court in <span class="Italic">Local 1411</span>, the question of whether a complaining employee raises the "same issues" in both proceedings does not focus on whether the action was proposed or definite, but rather on whether the issues raised in the appeal arose from the same set of factual circumstances as the unfair labor practice complaint and the theory advanced in support of the unfair labor practice charge and the appeal are substantially similar. <span class="Italic">Cf. Army Finance</span>, 38 FLRA at 1350-51, <span class="Italic">affirmed sub nom. Local 1411</span>, 960 F.2d at 178.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our holding is limited to the facts of this case.&#x2003;We decline to endorse the Authority's rule more broadly, because, frankly, we are unsure just how the rule might be applied in situations not raised in this case. We also mean to make clear that we are not placing additional restrictions <span id="page_1552"></span>on the MSPB. When an employee raises issues for adjudication by the MSPB, it is for the MSPB to consider how each of the issues raised bears on the employee's appeal of the employer's adverse action, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the adverse action was taken in retaliation for Appellant's exercise of protected activities or whether instead the adverse action is to be upheld or reversed on some other ground.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both Wildberger and <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> argue that this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Small</span>, 840 F.2d 972 (D.C. Cir. 1988), requires a different interpretation of section 7116(d). We disagree. In <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, as here, the plaintiff attempted to raise the same issues in both an MSPB appeal and an unfair labor practice complaint. However, the General Counsel for the FLRA declined to issue a complaint to prosecute the unfair labor charges alleged by the plaintiff, upon finding that the plaintiff "'had knowingly engaged in flagrant misconduct falling outside of the protection of the [Civil Service Reform Act].'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 980-81 (quoting FLRA General Counsel). The MSPB subsequently declined to exercise jurisdiction over affirmative defenses that reiterated the unfair labor practice charges that the FLRA General Counsel had declined to prosecute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 981. Significantly, in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, the decision not to prosecute the unfair labor practice charges was <span class="Italic">on the merits</span>, not on jurisdictional grounds pursuant to section 7116(d). In other words, the court in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> affirmed the MSPB's decision to decline jurisdiction in a situation in which the FLRA General Counsel had already rejected the unfair labor practice charges for lack of merit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, both the facts and the legal issues in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> were substantially different from those at issue here. <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> did not involve review of the FLRA's interpretation of its jurisdiction under section 7116(d), the issue presented in the case before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to the extent that language in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> can be read to suggest that the MSPB can never consider matters that could <span class="Italic">properly</span> be raised as unfair labor practices before the FLRA, such language is dicta. Taken out of context, this language probably suggests more than the court intended. It is certainly clear that the MSPB not only can but <span class="Italic">must</span> address issues that could properly underlie unfair labor practice charges where such issues are raised as affirmative defenses alleging "prohibited personnel practices" <span class="Italic">See </span>5 USC 2302(b)(9) (1994); <span class="Italic">Ireland v. Department of Health and Human Servs., Social Security Admin.</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 614 (1987); <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span>, 7 MSPB 385, 7 M.S.P.R. at 540-42<span class="Italic">. Barnes </span>does not foreclose this possibility. The decision in <span class="Italic">Barnes </span>would be problematic only if the FLRA had dismissed the unfair labor practice complaints at issue in that case <span class="Italic">under section 7116(d) </span>and then the MSPB had declined to consider the affirmative defenses raised by the employee. In such a situation, the employee would be without a forum in which to raise his complaints. That did not happen.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding the Authority's stated exception for retaining jurisdiction over unfair labor practice charges focusing on the institutional interests of labor organizations, <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> argues that, by refusing to exercise jurisdiction over unfair labor practice complaints focusing solely on individual rights, the Authority disregards its responsibility to provide systemic remedies for unfair labor practices. By so doing, <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> contends, the Authority impermissibly frustrates the congressional intent of the Civil Service Reform Act. In addition, <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> argues that the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(d) "provides agencies with an incentive to fire employees in order to avoid unfair labor practice charges<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 32-34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> contends, the FLRA's broad remedial powers are a central feature of the Civil Service Reform Act. To the extent that 7116(d)'s jurisdictional bar lessens the FLRA's role in cases where an individual raises the same issues in both an unfair labor practice charge and a MSPB appeal, however, the Authority's interpretation of section 7116(d) remains consistent with the Supreme Court's general understanding that Congress, in enacting the Civil Service Reform Act, sought to "balance the legitimate interests of...federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration" within an "integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review' replacing the complicated, patchwork" system that preceded the Civil Service Reform Act. <span class="Italic">See Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 445, 108 S. Ct. at 672. Although <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> did not focus on the Authority's jurisdiction to hear unfair labor practice complaints in light of section 7116(d), the Court recognized in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> that "the primacy of the MSPB for administrative resolution of disputes over adverse personnel action," with judicial review by the Federal Circuit, is an important "structural element" evident in the framework of the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 449, 108 S. Ct. at 674 (citations omitted). It is likely that Congress' effort to balance competing concerns in the course of its comprehensive overhaul of the civil service system entailed various trade-offs. The Authority's interpretation of how section 7116(d) strikes the balance between the FLRA's jurisdiction to provide systemic remedies to vindicate the public interest in preventing unfair labor practices and the MSPB's exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of adverse actions is neither unreasonable nor contrary to the purpose of the Act as articulated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Wildberger also contends that a number of due process errors on the part of the MSPB support his claim that the FLRA should assert jurisdiction over his unfair labor practice complaints.&#x2003;However, the proper course for remedying such alleged errors is to seek review of the MSPB decision by the Federal Circuit. Such errors on the part of the MSPB would not render 7116(d)'s jurisdictional bar inapplicable or otherwise provide a basis for collateral review of the MSPB decision by the FLRA or this court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;Whether Section 7116(d) Bars the Authority from Exercising Jurisdiction over Wildberger's Unfair Labor Practice Charges</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that Wildberger raised all of the issues that underscored his consolidated unfair labor practice charges in his appeal before the MSPB.&#x2003;However, in a prehearing conference, the MSPB-ALJ stated that she declined jurisdiction over Wildberger's allegations of unfair labor practices because unfair labor practice charges are outside the Board's jurisdiction. The Board had instructed the MSPB-ALJ to allow Wildberger "an opportunity to present any and all nonfrivolous affirmative defenses." <span class="Italic">Wildberger v.</span> <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 673, 678 (1994). In a subsequent decision, the MSPB-ALJ did, in fact, consider Wildberger's affirmative defenses, including his claim that the proposing official, James Charney, was motivated by personal animus, and his claim that the removal action was taken in retaliation for protected union activities. The MSPB-ALJ ultimately decided that the SBA had good cause to terminate Wildberger's employment and rejected Wildberger's affirmative defenses, and thus dismissed Wildberger's appeal on the merits. The Board affirmed this decision. <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. SBA</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 667 (1996) (affirming relevant parts of MSPB-ALJ's decision).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the sequence of events before the MSPB, it appears that the MSPB-ALJ's statement in the prehearing conference was meant to indicate that the ALJ would not exercise jurisdiction over Wildberger's allegations of unfair labor practices <span class="Italic">per se</span>, even though she was required to address the <span class="Italic">issues</span> underlying Wildberger's unfair labor practice charges to the extent that the same issues underscored his affirmative defenses. Accordingly, section 7116(d) would only bar the Authority's jurisdiction over Wildberger's unfair labor practice charges <span class="Italic">if</span> the same issues underlying these charges--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the same factual predicates and legal theories were considered by the MSPB as affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;The Proposed Removal Complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The SBA's final letter of removal terminating Wildberger's employment essentially reiterated the same charges and specifications set forth in its letter proposing to remove him. Thus, the factual predicate underlying Wildberger's proposed removal complaint and his MSPB appeal are the same. <span class="Italic">See Local 1411</span>, 960 F.2d at 178 (holding that the distinction between proposed and actual agency action is a distinction without a difference which, if credited for the purposes of applying &#x00A7; 7116(d), "would drain &#x00A7; 7116(d) of much of its utility").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposed removal complaint alleges that the SBA committed an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) (prohibiting federal employers from interfering with, restraining, or coercing any employee in the exercise, of any right under chapter 71 of Title 5) by referencing Wildberger's protected activity as a union organizer. In addressing Wildberger's affirmative defense that his employment was terminated in retaliation for protected union activity in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), the MSPB-ALJ applied the analysis articulated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Ireland</span>, 34 MSPR at 618-19. Under the <span class="Italic">Ireland</span> analysis, to establish a claim of reprisal for union activities in violation of section 2302(b)(9), an employee must demonstrate that he engaged in an activity protected by statute, that he subsequently was subject to an adverse action, that the proposing and deciding officials knew that the employee was engaged in the protected activity, and that there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The MSPB-ALJ found that, contrary to Wildberger's assertion, he did not possess a statutorily-protected right to utilize official time or other SBA resources for his union organizing activity. Moreover, the MSPB-ALJ determined that Wildberger had failed to show a sufficient causal connection between any statutorily-protected activities in which he was engaged and the termination decision. Thus, the same legal theory--that the termination was in retaliation for Wildberger's protected activities--was argued to both the FLRA and the MSPB, and this theory was rejected by the MSPB in the context of considering Wildberger's affirmative defenses. Accordingly, the Authority's determination that it was barred by the first sentence of section 7116(d) from exercising jurisdiction over Wildberger's proposed removal complaint was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;The Threat Complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threat complaint alleges that Wildberger's supervisor, James Charney, committed an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by threatening to deny Wildberger's training requests and to fire Wildberger if "the conflict created by the labor organization Wildberger had formed" did not stop. These same issues were considered by the MSPB in the context of Wildberger's affirmative defense claiming that the proposing official (Charney) was motivated by personal animus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record indicates that Wildberger alleged as an affirmative defense that Charney was motivated by personal animus because Wildberger served <span id="page_1553"></span>him with the threat complaint one work day before Charney issued the letter proposing Wildberger's removal. The MSPB-ALJ reasoned that this allegation "may be analyzed in two ways--as a claim that Mr. Charney's impartiality had been compromised and as a claim that Mr. Charney retaliated against [Wildberger] for filing the FLRA complaint." The MSPB-ALJ rejected the suggestion that Charney proposed Wildberger's removal in retaliation for Wildberger's filing of the threat complaint. Furthermore, the MSPB-ALJ determined that "to prevail on the allegation of personal animus the appellant would have to show actual bias or the existence of an intolerably high risk of unfairness." Turning to Wildberger's assertion that Charney had illegally threatened him as evidence of Charney's alleged bias, the MSPB-ALJ considered the conflicting testimony of Charney and Wildberger and concluded that Wildberger had not shown, by credible evidence, that Charney had ever threatened him. Thus, the MSPB addressed the central issue underscoring Wildberger's threat complaint in the context of considering his affirmative defenses. Accordingly, the Authority's determination that it was barred by the first sentence of section 7116(d) from exercising jurisdiction over Wildberger's threat complaint was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;The Disparate Treatment Complaint</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The disparate treatment complaint alleges that the SBA committed an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by inundating Wildberger with memoranda, by prohibiting him from using various agency resources (such as e-mail) for personal reasons, and by imposing a number of other restrictions on him. In addition, the complaint alleged that the SBA committed an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 USC 7116(a)(2) (prohibiting federal employees from discouraging membership in any labor organization through discrimination in working conditions) by imposing the itemized restrictions on Wildberger while not applying the same restrictions to other bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When this complaint was initially considered by the FLRA, the General Counsel for the FLRA emphasized the <span class="Italic">discriminatory nature</span> <span class="Italic">of the restrictions </span>imposed upon Wildberger, and the FLRA-ALJ decided the claim against Wildberger on the merits, not on jurisdictional grounds. The Authority, however, rejected the ALJ's determination and dismissed this claim under section 7116(d). <span class="Italic">Wildberger [FLRA]</span>, 1995 WL 648828, at *89.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the MSPB-ALJ's determination that Wildberger's use of agency resources for union organizing purposes was not statutorily-protected activity might be construed as a preclusive determination of Wildberger's claim that SBA orders prohibiting such use violated section 7116(a)(1), the MSPB never addressed Wildberger's allegations of discriminatory treatment in violation of section 7116(a)(2). Moreover, the record does not clearly indicate that these issues necessarily came into play in the affirmative defenses considered by the MSPB. Thus, although to some extent the factual predicate underlying Wildberger's disparate treatment complaint was addressed by the MSPB, the MSPB did not consider--and indeed declined jurisdiction over--one of the legal theories raised in this complaint. Accordingly, this complaint is remanded to the Authority for a decision on the merits.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">4.&#x2003;Wildberger's Complaints Focus on Individual, not Institutional, Interests</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, the FLRA maintained that it will assert jurisdiction over unfair labor practice charges which affect union organizing on a larger scale, as opposed to the activities of a single individual who brings unfair labor practice charges, subsequently suffers an adverse action, and raises the same issues underlying the unfair labor practice charges in appealing the adverse action to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span> <span class="Italic">[FLRA]</span>, 1995 WL 648828, at *7. Whether or not a particular unfair labor practice charge fits within this exception in any given case is for the Authority to determine in the first instance. Although Wildberger suggests that he has "institutional interests as National President of SOLIDARITY U.S.A.," the unfair labor practice complaints were filed in Wildberger's name, not Solidarity's, and assert only Wildberger's <span class="Italic">individual rights </span>to "'form, join, or assist any labor organization...freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal...,'" not Solidarity's institutional interests <span class="Italic">per se. Id</span>. (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102). <span class="Italic">Cf. Local 1411</span>, 960 F.2d at 179 ("'[Section 7116(d) does not preclude a union in its institutional capacity as an aggrieved party from filing an unfair labor practice charge to enforce its own independent rights merely because an employee has initiated an appeal or grievance...based on the same factual situation to enforce his individual rights.'") (quoting <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 665 n.20, 105 S. Ct. 2882, 2892, 86 L. Ed.2d 515 (1985) (alterations in original)). Thus, the Authority's determination that Wildberger's unfair labor practice complaints do not come within its stated exception for charges filed by labor organizations asserting their own institutional interests was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Matters Not Reached</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, our holding in this case does not purport to resolve how section 7116(d) might be applied in other situations which do not closely comport with the facts of this case. In particular, this case should <span class="Italic">not</span> be interpreted to mean that all unfair labor practice charges involving an employee who subsequently appeals an adverse action to the MSPB should necessarily be subsumed into the MSPB proceeding. For example, suppose an employee who allegedly suffered harassment from his employer for engaging in union organizing activities and filed unfair labor practice charges alleging such harassment was subsequently removed for alleged theft. If, in appealing the termination to the MSPB, the employee argues only that the employer's claim of theft cannot be sustained, not that the action was taken in retaliation for his union organizing activities, it is not clear whether section 7116(d) should apply. Where the employee did not raise the issues underlying his unfair labor practice charges before the MSPB, the question of whether his unfair labor practice charges could be or should be subsumed into his MSPB appeal, or whether instead they are sufficiently separate to preserve the FLRA's jurisdiction over them notwithstanding the MSPB appeal, are questions that must be addressed by the FLRA in future cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also want to make it clear that our holding here is not intended as either an endorsement or a rejection of the Fourth Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992) ("<span class="Italic">Commerce</span>"). The Authority's judgment in this case appears to rest on <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>; this is hardly surprising, given that the decision in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> is broad enough to support the result reached by the FLRA here. But, on this record, we are not prepared to venture beyond the facts at hand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> court held that, under section 7116(d), once an employee had commenced a MSPB appeal, he was constrained to bring all his administrative claims in the MSPB proceeding and the FLRA was barred from adjudicating any unfair labor practice charges which are not "sufficiently discrete from his challenge to his ultimate removal<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 888. Both the facts and the holding in <span class="Italic">Commerce </span>are distinct from the case before us. The issues underscoring the unfair labor practice charges in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> were adjudicated by the FLRA after a related MSPB appeal was filed but before the MSPB had adjudicated the appeal<span class="Italic">. See id. </span>at 886. Therefore, the <span class="Italic">Commerce</span> court could not frame its opinion in terms of issues <span class="Italic">actually</span> presented to and considered by the MSPB, but instead reached the question of whether the issues underlying the unfair labor practice charges were necessarily subsumed into the pending MSPB proceeding. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 890 (noting that, while the MSPB is barred from adjudicating ULP charges <span class="Italic">per se</span>, the issues underlying the employee's ULP charge "may be raised in an MSPB procedure" as affirmative defenses) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">cf. id</span>. ("Only where [&#8197;] initial disciplinary actions ripen into full-blown 'adverse employment actions' will sole jurisdiction vest in the MSPB under the first sentence of &#x00A7; 7116(d)."). The fact that the Fourth Circuit reached a question that this court reserves does not make this court's decision inconsistent with that in <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>; the Fourth Circuit had a different case before it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">The Fourth Circuit decision in Dept. of Commerce</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished in<span class="Italic"> FLRA v. Michigan Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 878 F.3d 171, 179-80 (6th Cir. 2017), determining that the availability of an administrative tribunal to review a termination did not bar a ULP based on the agency's improper directive to the union to have no contact with personnel who might be involved in the administrative proceeding:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Guard's second argument is that the FLRA was precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this case by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d), which provides that "[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices." The Guard contends that, because the union could have challenged the communications ban in the administrative appeal, &#x00A7; 7116(d) prohibits the union from challenging the ban via an unfair-labor-practice complaint. This argument is also unpersuasive in the context of an all-encompassing interpretation of the letter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA has interpreted &#x00A7; 7116(d) to preclude it from exercising jurisdiction when "the factual predicate and the legal theory underlying an unfair labor practice complaint and a[n]...appeal are the same." <span class="Italic">Wildberger v. FLRA</span>, 132 F.3d 784, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1998). The Guard argues that the union could have attacked the communications ban in the Guard's internal administrative proceedings on a similar legal theory to the one it raised before the FLRA--namely, that the ban was overbroad in light of the Guard's legitimate need to limit <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. However, this argument fails because the union advanced legal theories before the FLRA that are different from those it would have been able to argue in the administrative appeal. Before the FLRA, the union contended that the ban violated the FSLMRS. Before the hearing examiner, by contrast, the union would have been limited to arguing that the Guard misapplied its own personnel regulations. These are different legal arguments that present different issues. Whether the Guard complied with its own personnel regulations is not related to the separate question of whether its actions violated federal labor law. <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, 132 F.3d at 794, analogously held that &#x00A7; 7116(d) did not preclude the FLRA from exercising jurisdiction over an unfair-labor-practice claim when the employee's prior appeal before the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB") did not involve the same <span id="page_1554"></span>legal theory. The fact that one legal argument was open to the union in the administrative proceedings did not foreclose it from pursuing a different argument before the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response, the Guard argues that it is immaterial that the union would have had to rely on different sources of law in the FLRA proceedings and the administrative appeal. It bases this argument on <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882 (4th Cir. 1992), but this reliance is misplaced. In that case, an employee of the Bureau of the Census challenged his termination both before the MSPB and via an unfair-labor-practice complaint. In holding that &#x00A7; 7116(d) denied jurisdiction to the FLRA, the court rejected the FLRA's argument that jurisdiction was appropriate because the employee relied on different statutory provisions before the FLRA and the MSPB. The Guard highlights the following statement of the court:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We do not find dispositive the fact that [the employee] cited one statutory provision for his [unfair-labor-practice] complaint and another for his MSPB procedure. All that this reveals is the obvious: that the statutory provisions governing the adjudication of [unfair labor practices] before the FLRA and grievances under the MSPB procedure are different.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span>, 976 F.2d at 889. However, the court's very next sentence demonstrates why <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> is different from this case: "The fact that the separate forums are governed by separate statutory provisions cannot change the essential fact that <span class="Italic">the legal arguments [the employee]</span><span class="Italic"> presented to each body were substantially the same</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). The same cannot be said here. As discussed above, the union's legal arguments before the FLRA were not "substantially the same" as those it could have made in the Guard's internal proceeding. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce</span> is not on point.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Hanlon</span> and <span class="Italic">Wildberger</span>, although &#x00A7; 7116(d) provides that issues may properly be raised under an appeals procedure that may not be raised as ULPs, FLRA would review ULP allegations in a disciplinary case that was taken to MSPB, assuming that the Board did not entirely reverse the penalty. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Sys. Command, Elec. Sys. Div. and NAGE Local R1-8</span>, 14 FLRA 390, 392 (1984). In <span class="Italic">DHEW, SSA, Great Lakes Program Serv. Ctr., Chicago and AFGE Local 1395</span>, 2 FLRA 115, 122 (1979), FLRA adopted the recommended decision of one of its ALJs, interpreting &#x00A7; 19(d) of Executive Order 11491, paralleling 5 USC 7116(d), stating that "'[i]ssues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised under this section.'" The question was whether conduct that may be construed as a ULP is an "issue" so as to preclude FLRA jurisdiction if that conduct can be reviewed in an adverse action appeal to MSPB. FLRA determined that if the appeals procedure is not one allowing the ULP issue to be raised, the use of an appeals procedure to contest a termination did not foreclose consideration of a ULP complaint concerning the discharge. The precedent cited by FLRA involved the dismissal of a probationer, who clearly had no real appeals procedure. FLRA would consider unfair labor practices arising from facts leading to terminations appealed to the Board. FLRA apparently could do nothing in those circumstances about the termination, but FLRA had remedial (cease and desist) authority over the unfair labor practices committed by the employer. Under &#x00A7; 7116(d), the issues of a ULP may be somewhat related to actions appealed through statutory appeals procedures, because they may all have their genesis in protected activity. If the personnel actions were separate, there was no bar to litigation before the FLRA and MSPB. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Office of Sec'y, Comptroller for Virgin Islands and AFGE Local 3514</span>, 11 FLRA 521, 529-30 (1983) (ALJ Decision) (removal appealed to MSPB; ULP complaint evaluated as to short suspension, performance appraisal, denial of sick leave). As to a possible remedial conflict between actions of MSPB and FLRA, when an issue was properly raised as a ULP under &#x00A7; 7116, nothing prevented FLRA from remedying a violation. <span class="Italic">VA, W. Los Angeles Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 1061</span>, 23 FLRA 278, 280 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provided more explanation of its jurisdiction over issues tangentially raised before the MSPB in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Long Beach and AFGE Local 1061</span>, 41 FLRA 1370, 1378-79 (1991). The agency's lawyer interviewed a unit employee who was a potential witness in a case before the MSPB, on appeal from the removal of another unit employee. There was no prior notice of the interview to the union. The employee's representative requested the MSPB to exclude the evidence developed by the agency; MSPB declined to exclude the evidence. In the ensuing ULP case, FLRA concluded that it had jurisdiction to determine whether the agency committed a ULP by its questioning the unit employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge that this case is properly before the Authority and not barred by section 7116(d) of the Statute. Section 7116(d) provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(d)&#x2003;Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent claimed before the Judge and in its exceptions that the matter could be, and in fact was, raised before the MSPB and is therefore barred from being raised as an unfair labor practice. To the contrary, the matter raised before the MSPB was the propriety of the underlying disciplinary action taken by Respondent. Although the MSPB ruled on the Union's motion to exclude the testimony of bargaining unit employees on the ground that they were interviewed without the presence of the Union, the MSPB made no findings regarding whether the Respondent's conduct constituted an unfair labor practice. The MSPB does not have jurisdiction to decide unfair labor practices under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Small</span>, 840 F.2d 972, 981 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Kuahine v. Department of the Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 346 (1980).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that the MSPB will consider illegal actions by agencies, such as unfair labor practices, as affirmative defenses in actions properly brought before it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 296 (1982). In so doing, however, it addresses only the prejudice to the appellant/employee, and not whether there have been violations of the rights of the union or the employees subject to the interviews. The issues here, which concern the Union's right to be present at formal discussions and the rights of unit employees to be free from coercion, were not, and could not have been, brought before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Western Region, San Francisco, California</span>, 9 FLRA 480 (1982) (consideration by MSPB of whether employee/appellant, represented by a union attorney, was entitled to information alleged to be relevant to a disciplinary action did not and could not constitute a determination as to the union's right to the same information under section 7114(b)(4) under the Statute). <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>, 41 FLRA 436, 446-47 (1991) (to determine whether a complaint is barred by section 7116 of the Statute, Authority examines whether the subject matter of the unfair labor practice charge is the same, in terms of the factual predicate and theory, as the subject matter of a grievance).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude, as did the Judge, that section 7116(d) does not deprive us of jurisdiction in this matter.</p>
<p class="noindent">Underlying the Fourth Circuit decision in <span class="Italic">Hanlon</span> was the notion that the FLRA and MSPB could be relied upon to dispense equal justice to those adversely affected through reprisals based on their union activities. In the words of the court, "Hanlon and other employees can find equivalent relief before the MSPB and should not be heard to complain that the FLRA is the sole forum capable of granting meaningful relief." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 882, 890 (4th Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. As to MSPB's views, the Board's first treatment of ULP issues appeared in <span class="Italic">Kuahine v. Dept of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 346, 347 (1980). The Board did not discuss the underlying facts, but stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The presiding official found that the agency had not committed an unfair labor practice under the circumstances of the case....&#8197;The Board does not have jurisdiction to decide allegations of unfair labor practices, and, to the extent that the initial decision implied jurisdiction, we find its holding overly broad. It is not our intention here to foreclose the possibility that such an allegation might be raised and considered as an affirmative defense of an appellant. However, in this case, the initial decision should reflect the limits of the jurisdiction granted to this Board.</p>
<p class="noindent">It was later suggested that the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal requesting it to consider, independently of an appealable action, the claim that an employee was subjected to an agency ULP under 5 USC 7116. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 135, 136 n.1 (1983). The Board clearly rejects jurisdiction to determine whether an agency action constitutes a ULP<span class="Italic">. Clarry v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 147, 153 (1983) (citing <span class="Italic">Polk v. IRS</span>, 11 MSPR 482 (1982)); <span class="Italic">Bodinus v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 7 MSPR 536, 542, 7 MSPB 385, 388 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 676, 678 (1986) ("Nothing in law, rule, or regulation grants the Board authority to determine whether an action constitutes an unfair labor practice. That authority rests with the FLRA"). <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span> has a twist: although the Board may not adjudicate a ULP, it may reckon with a prohibited personnel practice encompassing the same conduct. In <span class="Italic">Bodinus</span>, the Board's judge improperly excluded evidence that might have shown that the appellant was treated adversely as to work load and evaluation because of protected union activities. The Board concluded that a complaint of anti-union animus on the part of an agency may constitute a ULP and, as such, is not a matter within MSPB jurisdiction. Although the Board is without jurisdiction to adjudicate that ULP, evidence of animus may establish a retaliatory motive for an otherwise appealable adverse action taken in alleged reprisal for the exercise of rights protected by &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). An appellant's testimony would be relevant on that point if it demonstrated that his union representation activities were so extensive as to warrant a reduction in his case load, but the agency refused to reduce his case load in reprisal for the union activities. In <span class="Italic">Triplett v. DLA</span>, 19 MSPR 93 (1984), the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9) by removing the appellant in reprisal for use of a negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ireland v. DHHS, SSA</span>, 34 MSPR 614, 619 (1987) ("We find...that the evidence of record establishes a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action, and that the protected activity was a significant factor in the decision to remove the appellant.").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA jurisdiction is not precluded by conduct that arguably constitutes a prohibited personnel practice apart from a ULP if the conduct is not subject to MSPB jurisdiction. FLRA explained its point in <span class="Italic">SSA Inland Empire Area and AFGE</span>, 46 FLRA 161, 170-72 (1992), concluding that a ULP occurred when two <span id="page_1555"></span>union officials failed to obtain participation in a "gainsharing" program (a form of profit-sharing or group sharing of program savings) equal to their nonunion counterparts:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Judge's conclusion that section 7116(d) of the Statute does not preclude the Authority's consideration of the issues raised in the unfair labor practice complaint. As noted previously, the first sentence of section 7116(d) provides: "Issues which can properly be raised under an appeals procedure may not be raised as unfair labor practices prohibited under this section." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d). In its supplemental brief, the Respondent asserts that, despite MSPB's dismissal of Wooten's petition for lack of jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Wooten II</span>, the first sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute precludes the litigation of this case before the Authority. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent asserts that the fact that the MSPB determined that Wooten's protected activities did not constitute whistleblowing disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) does not change "the fact that the [MSPB] also concluded that the issue presented by the employee <span class="Italic">could</span> have been raised under the statutory appeal procedure[,]" that is, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). In our view, the Respondent has misconstrued MSPB's statement with respect to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the MSPB found, as relevant here, that Wooten's actions "of performing [U]nion-related duties and...making...protected filings on behalf of [U]nion members are cognizable under the prohibited personnel practice set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)." <span class="Italic">Wooten II</span>, 54 MSPR at 146. Without more, the fact that Wooten's actions described by the MSPB are cognizable under the prohibited personnel practice set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) does not mean that the issue in the instant case could be properly raised before the MSPB. MSPB has jurisdiction over only certain personnel actions and, as demonstrated below, the awarding of gainsharing awards is not one of the personnel actions over which the MSPB has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) "is not an independent source of appellate jurisdiction for the [MSPB]; that provision itself authorizes no appeals. Therefore, the personnel action which is the subject of the appeal must first be brought within the [MSPB's] appellate jurisdiction under some other 'law, rule, or regulation,'...before the [MSPB] may consider" a 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 prohibited personnel practice allegation. <span class="Italic">Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Maddox v. MSPB</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 632, 638-39 nn.5, 6 and 7 (1991). Thus, an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice is reviewable by the MSPB only in connection with an appealable action. Without an appealable action, the MSPB lacks jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the action in dispute is the Respondent's decision not to distribute full gainsharing awards to Wooten and Quinones. The statutory authority for the payment of gainsharing awards is contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4502(d) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5407(d). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.101(b) and (c); Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Letter 451-6, April 10, 1989. The Respondent has not demonstrated that an agency's action in distributing gainsharing awards is an action that is appealable to the MSPB. Based on our review of the actions that are appealable to the MSPB under its regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3, and based on our review of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4502(d) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5407(d), we find that the Respondent's action in distributing the gainsharing awards to its employees is not an action that is appealable to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the distribution of gainsharing awards is not a matter that is appealable to the MSPB, Wooten's and Quinones' allegations with respect to the Respondent's distribution of the awards could not properly be raised under a statutory appeals procedure within the meaning of section 7116(d) of the Statute. Therefore, we conclude that the first sentence of section 7116(d) does not preclude us from deciding the instant unfair labor practice complaint....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find that the instant case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Department of Commerce, Bureau of the</span> <span class="Italic">Census v. FLRA</span>, No. 91-2188 (4th Cir. Oct. 2, 1992) (<span class="Italic">Commerce</span>), in which the court denied the Authority's application for enforcement of <span class="Italic">Bureau of the Census</span>, 41 FLRA 436 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Census</span>). In <span class="Italic">Census</span>, the unfair labor practice complaint alleged that the agency violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute by issuing a record of infraction and a letter of proposed removal to an employee that were based in part on the employee's protected activity. In agreement with the agency, the court found that the complaint was barred under the first sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute because the agency had ultimately removed the employee and, therefore, the initial disciplinary actions had "ripen[ed] into full-blown 'adverse employment actions'" which could properly be raised in an MSPB statutory procedure. <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, slip op. at 12 (referring to adverse actions enumerated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512). In contrast, the instant case concerns the Respondent's reduction of employees' gainsharing awards, a matter which could not properly be raised under a statutory appeals procedure within the meaning of the first sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute. Moreover, the reduction in the awards is not related to any matter which could be raised under a statutory appeals procedure within the meaning of the first sentence of section 7116(d) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A grievance seeking a determination of an employee's proper pay rate is not excluded from an arbitrator's jurisdiction on the theory that the grievance challenges a reduction in pay with MSPB's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 and VARO Winston-Salem</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-159.html">71 FLRA 812</a>, 813-14 (2020) (grievant challenged the pay rate received when she moved to another position; FLRA cited <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Small Bus./Self Employed Operating Div.,</span> 65 FLRA 23, 23 (2010) (grievance challenged agency's calculation of grievant's rate of pay upon her permanent promotion)); <span class="Italic">SEC and NTEU Chap. 293</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-049.html">61 FLRA 251</a>, 253-54 (2005) (5 USC 7121(c)(5) does not preclude an arbitrator from determining whether an agency is required to pay a special statutory pay rate to employees; setting aside award because of a different statutory issue).
