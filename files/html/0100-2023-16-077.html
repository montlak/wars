<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-78"><span class="space">f.</span> Impact of Unit Size, Number of Affected Employees</h5>
<p class="noindent">In 1985 FLRA began dismissing increasing numbers of impact bargaining ULP charges because the changes were no more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Among the factors considered in these cases was the number of employees involved compared to the size of the bargaining unit. The chances of dismissal were inverse to the ratio between employees involved and unit size. This was a peculiar result. Larger units were encouraged by FLRA to enhance efficiency of agency operations through bargaining. The application of the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> rule to a larger unit arguably enhanced agency freedom to make changes in working conditions. Unions would have done better to fragment units to enhance their bargaining positions. Prior to the rule developed by FLRA, there were few dismissals of ULP charges on a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theory, although one court of appeals denied enforcement of an FLRA bargaining order without reaching the negotiability issue, because the court did not find that modification of a large regional office to accommodate some 62 transferred employees, in a space that formerly held 50 employees, constituted a material change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 717 F.2d 1174, 1177 (7th Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA modified the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> formulation in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1760</span>, 24 FLRA 403, 406-08 (1986). The case involved the reassignment of a single employee. Although FLRA concluded there was no bargaining obligation, it decided not to consider the size of the unit as a factor in its analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The use of a standard to distinguish between changes which require bargaining and those which do not is fully supported by the Statute and its purposes and policies.&#x2003;Section 7101 of the Statute reflects Congress' finding that collective bargaining is in the public interest, as well as the direction that the Statute be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the requirement of an effective and efficient Government. In cases such as these, the Authority must accommodate Congress' provisions both for consultation and negotiation concerning working conditions of Federal employees, and for the effective and efficient operation of Government agencies through the exercise of management rights or through other actions required or permitted by law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, section 7105(a)(1) requires the Authority to provide "leadership in establishing policies and guidance" relating to labor relations in the Federal sector. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Authority must take care that its adjudicative processes not be unnecessarily burdened with cases that do not serve to bring meaning and purpose to the Federal labor-management relations program. While we seek to ensure that the rights of agencies, unions, and employees under the Statute are protected in situations involving changes in conditions of employment, we must also seek to discharge our responsibilities in a fashion that promotes <span class="Italic">meaningful</span> bilateral negotiations. Interpreting the Statute to require bargaining over every single management action, no matter how slight the impact of that action, does not serve those aims. The limited scope of Federal sector bargaining caused by external laws, rules, and regulations also demands that the Authority not impose further limitations unless they are based on clear statutory authority and buttressed by sound policy considerations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two standards have been used to date to identify those changes which require bargaining.&#x2003;The old standard required a "substantial" impact....&#8197;The more recent standard required that the impact be more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. In discussing the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard in <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Region V, Chicago, Illinois</span>, 19 FLRA No. 101 (1985), the Authority identified a number of factors to be considered in determining whether a particular change in conditions of employment was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. The factors identified were (1) the nature of the change (for example, the extent of the change in work duties, location, office space, hours, loss of benefits or wages, and the like); (2) the duration and frequency of the change (that is, the temporary, recurring, or permanent nature of the change); (3) the number of employees affected or foreseeably affected by the change; (4) the size of the bargaining unit; and (5) the extent to which the parties established, through negotiations or past practice, procedures and appropriate arrangements concerning analogous changes in the past.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have reassessed and modified the recent <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> standard. In order to determine whether a change in conditions of employment requires bargaining in this and future cases, the pertinent facts and circumstances presented in each case will be carefully examined. In examining the record, we will place principal emphasis on such general areas of consideration as the nature and extent of the effect or reasonably foreseeable effect of the change on conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. Equitable considerations will also be taken into account in balancing the various interests involved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the number of employees involved, this factor will not be a controlling consideration. It will be applied primarily to expand rather than limit the number of situations where bargaining will be required. For example, we may find that a change does not require bargaining. However, a similar change involving hundreds of employees could, in appropriate circumstances, give rise to a bargaining obligation. The parties' bargaining history will be subject to similar limited application. As to the size of the bargaining unit, this factor will no longer be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the above analysis and based on the facts and circumstances in this case, we conclude that the Respondent was under no obligation to bargain with the Union concerning implementation procedures or appropriate arrangements pertaining to the reassignment of the employee. While there was some change in the conditions of employment of the employee as a result of her reassignment...review of the relevant facts and circumstances establishes that the change did not give rise to a bargaining obligation. In reaching this result, we note the limited nature of the change involved, i.e., the reassignment of the <span id="Page_1316"></span>employee from a position she had held for less than three months back to the position she had previously held, based on the operational needs of the Respondent. The employee's reassignment involved no loss in pay or grade, nor did it involve a change in her hours. Although the new position involved some changes in duties and tasks...the duties of the two positions were substantially similar. Moreover, the anticipated effect on the remaining...clerks...due to [the] reassignment should be minimal since the reassignment was directed as a result of a decrease in workload.</p>

The Authority stated that in order to determine whether a change in conditions of employment requires bargaining, it would carefully examine the pertinent facts and circumstances presented in each case. It further stated that in examining the record, principal emphasis would be placed on such general areas of consideration as the nature and extent of the effect or reasonably foreseeable effect of the change on conditions of employment. It also stated that equitable considerations would be taken into account in balancing the various interests involved: that the number of affected employees and the parties' bargaining history would be given limited application; and that the size of the bargaining unit would no longer be a consideration.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether a change in conditions of employment gives rise to a duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change, we will carefully examine the facts and circumstances of each case, placing principal emphasis on such general areas of consideration as the nature and extent of the reasonably foreseeable effects of the changes in the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, including temporary and transitory effects<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">Applying those standards here, we conclude that the record establishes that the changes in the employees' tours of duty gave rise to a duty to bargain. By changing the days of the week that Shawley and Lovin were required to report for duty, the Respondent required Shawley to report for duty on two of the days that he was previously scheduled to be off-duty and required Lovin to report for duty on one of his former days off. In our view, if an agency changes the days on which an employee is required to report to work as part of the employee's regularly established weekly tour of duty, that change clearly has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on the employee's working conditions which is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agency makes the change. Moreover, if an agency makes such a change, it should also reasonably foresee that its action will disrupt responsibilities and commitments that the employee has made predicated on the previously scheduled days off. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sacramento Air Logistics Center</span>, 39 FLRA at 1372 (an agency's action in doubling the time an employee was required to participate in training exercises gave rise to a duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of that change because the reasonably foreseeable effect of the change "might well be an intrusion on an employee's family, travel and/or educational plans, which were predicated on periods when the employee was not scheduled to be a participant in [training] exercises").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we find that it was reasonably foreseeable at the time that the Respondent changed the employees' tours of duty that requiring Shawley and Lovin to report for duty on days that they had previously been scheduled to be off-duty would have an effect that was sufficient to give rise to a duty to bargain over the impact and implementation of the change in their workweeks. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Nellis AFB</span>, 41 FLRA at 1028 (an agency was obligated to bargain over the impact and implementation of a change in employees' shifts that, among other things, resulted in transportation problems and required some employees to obtain babysitters at considerable expense; these and other factors demonstrated "that there existed a reasonably foreseeable effect on the condition of the [transferred employees] which was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain, if the change will have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan.,</span> 55 FLRA 704, 715 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Leavenworth</span>).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">[E]ven assuming that the Respondent's order requiring that Helwig vacate Room 132 was a result of its exercise of management rights, the Respondent was required to bargain with the Union over the impact and implementation of Helwig's move. An agency has an obligation to bargain over appropriate arrangements for unit employees adversely affected by a decision to exercise management rights, if the resulting changes have more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals, Region II, N.Y., N.Y.,</span> 19 FLRA 328 (1985) (agency violated duty to bargain when exercising management right to relocate offices without negotiating over impact and implementation and the relocation caused changes in conditions of employment of unit employees that were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>.); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Soc.

<p class="noindent-1">In applying the <span class="Italic">de minimis </span>doctrine, the Authority looks to the nature and extent of either the effect, or the reasonably foreseeable effect, of the change on bargaining unit employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See IRS,</span> 56 FLRA at 913. In determining whether the reasonably foreseeable effects of a change are greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis,</span> the Authority addresses what a respondent knew, or should have known, at the time of the change. <span class="Italic">See VA, Phoenix,</span> 47 FLRA at 423 (citation omitted).

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, the Judge found that the Respondent's order that Helwig vacate Room 132 had an adverse effect on Helwig's ability to perform his training duties. The Judge also concluded that the changes in Helwig's conditions of employment resulting from Respondent's order requiring Helwig to vacate Room 132 were more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Specifically, the Judge found that, when Helwig was given Room 132 to use as a second office, he was able to conduct face-to-face training, in addition to using the room's desks, its computer equipment, and storage space. The Judge also found that, after Helwig was ordered to vacate Room 132, the materials that were previously stored there were moved to Room 247, which was already crowded and became more strained for storage space. According to the Judge, because Helwig's computer, telephone, and fax machine at his new office were not functional for two weeks following the move, his ability to communicate training information to VO employees was much less effective than the face-to-face communication that he enjoyed when he occupied Room 132.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the extent and nature of these changes, we conclude that the Judge properly determined that the Respondent's order that Helwig vacate Room 132 resulted in a change in conditions of employment that was more than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. Consequently, we hold that the Respondent had a duty to bargain with the Union over the impact and implementation of Helwig's move from Room 132 and deny the Respondent's exception.</p>
