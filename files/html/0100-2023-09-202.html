<h3 class="h3" id="sec2-199"><span class="space">D.</span> STEPS TAKEN AFTER APPEAL IS FILED</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Things begin to move quickly once the appeal is filed. Regional offices try to adjudicate the cases within the 120 days officially allowed by the Board. Within the few months after the filing of an appeal, the parties will: respond to the appeal; conduct discovery; develop or respond to motions; negotiate concerning settlement; prepare prehearing submissions; participate in at least one prehearing conference; secure and prepare witnesses; complete a hearing; and possibly prepare posthearing briefs. The work is not excessive if the Board appeal happens to be the only project you are working on; if you have other cases, however, some planning (or additional time through a DWOP or suspension of proceedings) is required for the process to be completed without significant errors or omissions. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-148.html#sec2-146">Dismissal Without Prejudice to Refile ('DWOP')</a>"; refer to Chapter 3, "<a href="0100-2023-10-029.html#sec3-29">Case Suspension</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most AJs schedule hearings without first conferring with the parties' representatives, although some particularly considerate AJs show the parties the courtesy of attempting to work out hearing dates through a telephone conference call that seeks the parties' cooperative efforts to set a mutually convenient hearing date. There are AJs who, having sent out a hearing notice, <span id="Page_1181"></span>are reluctant to reset the hearing date. Some AJs believe that if a hearing date is set soon after the appeal is filed, the parties are under more pressure to settle when the AJs resist alteration in the hearing date. An AJ's complete inflexibility in meeting the needs of the parties as to a hearing date is abusive and could be brought to the attention of the regional director, who may privately caution the AJ to show greater consideration to the parties and their representatives.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 3 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> identifies the first steps taken when the appeal is received at the regional office--docketing of the appeal and assignment of the appeal to an AJ:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ASSIGNMENT TO ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE</span>. The CAJ (or designee) assigns cases to the AJs. In making case assignments (or reassignments), the CAJ considers the AJs' respective workloads, the geographical location if there is likely to be a hearing that may be held in-person, the complexity of the appeal, and other factors as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CAJ and AJ should also consider whether consolidation, joinder, class action, or intervenor issues are present. Prior to acknowledgment, an AJ may informally request that an appeal be reassigned on the basis of personal bias or other disqualifying reason. After acknowledgment, the procedure in section 2 should be followed. When a former employee of an RO or FO has filed an appeal, it has been deemed appropriate to assign the appeal to an AJ who was not employed at the RO or FO at the same time as was the appellant, or to reassign the appeal to a different office.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 2 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> describes other steps taken by the regional office after the appeal is received:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RECEIPT OF THE APPEAL</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Record of Receipt</span>. When an appellant files an appeal, the receiving office must date stamp the appeal on receipt. Appeals filed through e-Appeal are automatically date and time stamped.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Geographic Jurisdiction</span>. The RO must ascertain whether it has geographic jurisdiction over the appeal. In appeals from OPM reconsideration decisions and from adverse suitability determinations, the appellant's residence at the time the appeal is filed controls. For other appeals, the location of the appellant's duty station when the action was taken generally controls. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(d). A possible exception to this principle is an appeal involving a directed reassignment, in which geographic jurisdiction may be based on the appellant's previous duty station. Appeals filed by applicants for appointment or promotion, under the WPA/WPEA, the VEOA, or the USERRA, may be directed to the office with jurisdiction over the area in which the appellant lives or to the office with the closest ties to the case, but because the circumstances of each case may vary widely there is no rule as to the appropriate office for these appeals set out in the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the office has geographic jurisdiction, the appeal must be docketed and entered into the Case Management System (CMS) within 3 workdays. Except when the appeal is rejected for premature filing or some other deficiency, the docket date of the appeal is the date of receipt. If the office does not have geographic jurisdiction, the appeal must not be docketed. Instead, it must be transferred within 3 workdays to the office which has geographic jurisdiction. The sending office is to use express mail or accountable mail when sending the appeal if it was filed in hard copy. The receiving office will docket the appeal; for internal purposes the docket date is the date the second RO receives the appeal. The office transferring the appeal must notify the appellant of the transfer in writing. Consistent with the guidance concerning rejected appeals in section 3 of this chapter, in determining timeliness, the appeal is generally considered to have been filed as of the date of filing with the first office.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Content</span>. The CAJ (or designee) must review the appeal to ensure that it contains the information required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a). Deficiencies in the appeal may be cause for its rejection. Some bases for rejecting an appeal appear on the Board's public website under the file tab "The Appeal Process, Appeal Rejection Reasons":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;The appeal is premature because the Board received the appeal prior to the effective date of the action being appealed or prior to the agency issuing a final decision concerning the appellant's performance, conduct, or reduction-in-force status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). <span class="Italic">But see</span> subsection d. Premature Appeals, below, concerning appeals that will become ripe for review within 10 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">2.&#x2003;The appeal is filed by someone other than the appellant, his or her representative, or a party properly substituted under &#x00A7; 1201.35. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">3.&#x2003;The appeal does not contain the appellant's name, address, and telephone number, and/or does not identify the name and address of the agency that took the action being appealed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">4.&#x2003;The appeal does not contain a description of the agency's action and its effective date. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">5.&#x2003;If the appeal is not electronically filed, it lacks the signature of the appellant or, if the appellant has a representative, of the representative. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">6.&#x2003;If the appeal is not electronically filed, the appellant did not file two copies of the appeal and all attachments with the appropriate Board office. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">7.&#x2003;Pleadings and attachments were not filed on 8.5 by 11-inch paper, or electronic documents were not formatted so that they could be printed on that size paper, and no good cause was provided. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">8.&#x2003;The appellant checked multiple actions being appealed, and indicated only one effective date or no effective date at all for the appealed actions. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">9.&#x2003;The appellant filed a stay request but did not submit evidence that the employing agency was served a copy of the request. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.8(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Incomplete Appeals</span>. When the appeal and its attachments, although incomplete, provide enough information that the appeal can be docketed, it should be docketed based on that information. When the appeal lacks sufficient information essential to proper docketing, such as the name of the agency or a reasonable statement of the matter being appealed, or a necessary copy of the decision being appealed, efforts appropriate to the situation should be made to contact the appellant and/or the appellant's representative by telephone, e-mail, or fax to get the required information. If the agency is known, it may also be contacted. In any case, if the office can learn the essential information by phone, fax, or e-mail from either party, it can be docketed immediately. You need not wait to receive it by regular mail delivery, since issues such as timeliness and jurisdiction can be addressed after the initial acknowledgment order is sent and once the missing information is received in a more official form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Generally you need not document for the record such information contacts with the parties. Rather, the appeal and acknowledgment order can be placed at Tabs 1 and 2 of the record, respectively, as would normally be done, and if the appellant or representative submits something in writing, it can be appended to the otherwise incomplete appeal under Tab 1, even if there may then be documents with two different dates under the same tab. If the agency supplies a missing document, however, that submission should be placed under a separate tab, which would be Tab 2 if the document is the first information the office receives after the appeal itself, or Tab 3 if the acknowledgment order has already been issued. If the office cannot docket the appeal, and cannot reach a party or representative by phone, fax, or e-mail, or if it requests but does not receive the information necessary to docket the appeal within 2-3 business days, the appeal may be rejected using the standard notice listing the specific deficiency. That notice would be sent to the appellant and, if represented, the appellant's representative. If this happens, the rejection letter is Tab 1, and when the necessary information is received, the complete appeal then becomes Tab 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the appeal is not formally rejected, the receipt date of the incomplete submission is the date of receipt of the appeal for purposes of determining timeliness. Even if an appeal must be rejected despite efforts to complete the information needed to docket it, the date of the original filing remains the filing date of the appeal for purposes of its timeliness. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Taylor v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 142, 143 (1997) (wherein the FO returned the appellant's submission to her because it was technically deficient, the date that the appellant made her original, deficient submission rather than the date of resubmission is the filing date of the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness of the Appeal</span>. The CAJ (or designee) must review the appeal to determine if it was timely filed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). If the appeal appears untimely, the appropriate timeliness language, tailored to the situation when necessary, must be included in the acknowledgment or show cause order (<span class="Italic">see also</span> chapter 3, section 8). An appellant should be told what the timeliness issue is, and what must be shown to establish either that the appeal is timely or that there is good cause to waive the time limit. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434 (1998). Pursuant to <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>, if the appellant asserts that an untimely filing was due to a medical condition, he or she should be told that to establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, the party must: (1) identify the time period during which the party suffered form the illness; (2) submit medical <span id="Page_1182"></span>evidence showing that the alleged illness affected that party during that time period; (3) in the absence of medical evidence, the party must submit other supporting evidence and explain why medical evidence is not available; and (4) explain how the illness prevented him or her from timely filing the appeal or a request for an extension of time. In the absence of direct evidence, the AJ should inform the appellant of the date that the document that triggers the running of the appeal period will be presumed to have been received, and order both parties to produce whatever evidence they possess on the issue. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 144 (1997). Similarly, the AJ must notify the appellant of the date on which the appeal is presumed to have been filed when no postmark provides proof and of the postmark date when one does appear. For special considerations in determining the timeliness of retirement appeals sent from the Philippines, <span class="Italic">see</span> chapter 3, section 8(a) of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Note that if the appeal was filed by e-Appeal, the time that is automatically recorded on it is Eastern Time. Timeliness of a pleading will be determined based on the time zone from which the pleading was submitted, so Board offices in other time zones must adjust for the time difference in determining whether the appeal was timely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Premature Appeals</span>. The CAJ (or designee) must review the appeal to determine if it was prematurely filed. If it is premature by 10 days or less, the office should docket the case as a new appeal, using the receipt date of the premature appeal....&#8197;If the appeal is more than 10 days premature, the CAJ must reject the appeal using the appropriate standard form. This procedure also applies to premature compliance appeals and attorney fee motions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Jurisdiction</span>. The CAJ (or designee) must review the appeal to determine whether it appears to be within the Board's jurisdiction. If the appeal appears to fall outside the Board's jurisdiction, the appropriate jurisdiction paragraphs, tailored to the situation when necessary, must be included in the acknowledgment or show cause order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although it is true in all appeals wherein jurisdiction may be an issue, it is particularly true in IRA appeals that the AJ must adequately instruct the appellant regarding the burden to show both the exhaustion of administrative remedies before the OSC and the burden to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the alleged protected disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Kukoyi v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 404, 408 &#x00B6; 12 (2009). The appellant must receive "explicit information on what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue," including the means by which the appellant may show that the exhaustion requirement had been satisfied. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 409, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mootness</span>. The Board's jurisdiction is determined by the nature of an agency's action at the time an appeal is filed with the Board. <span class="Italic">Hagan v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 6 (2005). An agency's unilateral modification of its action after an appeal has been filed cannot divest the Board of jurisdiction unless the appellant consents to such divestiture or the agency completely rescinds the action being appealed.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> For the appeal to be deemed moot following the cancellation or rescission of the appealed action, the employee must have received all of the relief that he could have received "if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed." <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 (2007). Thus, restoration of the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, or placement in the position he would have been in if the action had never occurred, may not be sufficient to moot the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 446, n.1. Statements by a representative that the agency has provided relief or is in the process of doing so do not constitute evidence that the appeal has been rendered moot. <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 21 (2007). An appeal may not be dismissed as moot until the agency provides acceptable evidence showing that it has actually afforded the appellant all of the relief he could have received if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 22. An appellant's statement that the agency has not paid all appropriate back pay constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that the appeal is not moot. <span class="Italic">Fernandez</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although an outstanding claim for attorney fees does not preclude dismissal for mootness of an appeal brought under chapter 75, a request for fees in an IRA appeal is a claim for corrective action. <span class="Italic">Vick v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). Another consideration when the issue of mootness is raised in an IRA appeal is the requirement that after providing sufficient notice an AJ must afford an appellant a specific opportunity to raise a claim for consequential damages (and compensatory damages if the appeal is under the WPEA) before dismissing an IRA appeal as moot. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an appellant has an outstanding claim of discrimination and has raised what appears to be a further claim for compensatory damages before the Board, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford him all of the relief he could have received if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed; thus, the appeal is not rendered moot. <span class="Italic">Antonio v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 13 (2008). In fact, an appellant who has raised a claim of discrimination must be informed of the right to request compensatory damages before the appeal may be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6; 11 (2004). If an appeal is not truly moot despite cancellation of the action under appeal, the proper remedy is for the Board to retain jurisdiction and to adjudicate the appeal on the merits. <span class="Italic">Antonio</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 12. The matter cannot be dismissed as moot with the caveat that the appellant may file a petition for enforcement if all of the relief is not provided, since there is then no final order to enforce. <span class="Italic">Haskins</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Retirement cases distinguished</span>. Because the Board's jurisdiction in a retirement appeal is based on OPM's final decision, rescission of such a decision may lead to a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, not mootness. In <span class="Italic">Rorick v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 597, &#x00B6; 5 (2008), the Board explained that if OPM completely rescinds a reconsideration decision, its rescission divests the Board of jurisdiction over the appeal in which that reconsideration decision is at issue, and the appeal must be dismissed. Nonetheless, for an appeal to be deemed moot, the employee must have received all of the relief that he could have received "if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed," citing <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, above. When OPM had rescinded its decision and planned to issue a new final decision, the appeal was removed from the Board's jurisdiction but was not moot. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such an appeal must be dismissed without prejudice to its refiling after the issuance of the new final decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(<span class="Italic">See also</span> chapter 3, section 8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">REJECTION OF THE APPEAL</span>. Whenever an appeal is rejected, the standard rejection notice must be used. If the appeal was filed electronically, the appellant should be informed that it has been deleted from the repository and the actions necessary to accomplish that must be done</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Filing Date for Rejected Appeals</span>. If the appeal is initially rejected, the filing date of the rejected appeal will be used to determine the timeliness of the refiled appeal. The date of the filing will be included in the rejection notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Docket Date for Rejected Appeals</span>. The date the refiled appeal is received will be the docket date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Untimely Refiling of Rejected Appeals</span>. Whenever the appellant submits an untimely response to the standard rejection notice, it must be treated similarly to an untimely appeal by accepting it and issuing an acknowledgment order that requires the appellant to explain the untimeliness. Because the Board applies different criteria to determine good cause for an untimely refiling, the order must use the standard paragraphs specific to untimely refiled appeals. <span class="Italic">See Nelson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 644, &#x00B6; 8 (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Untimely Appeals and Untimely Refiling of Rejected Appeals</span>. If both the original appeal and the refiled appeal appear to be untimely, the acknowledgment order must contain the appropriate standard paragraphs to cover both situations.</p>
