<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-11"><span class="space">d.</span> Unscheduled but Approved Absence Following Failure to Follow Procedure to Request Leave</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A rule governing leave was developed for USPS employees (and is now extended to the rest of the civil service through <span class="Italic">Wilkinson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 4 (1995), <span class="Italic">post),</span> in <span class="Italic">Fleming v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 302, 304-05 (1986), <span class="Italic">followed</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> <span class="Italic">Atkins v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 162, 164-65 (1987). The essence of the rule is that an employee cannot be disciplined for approved leave, but she can be disciplined for failure to follow policies for taking or requesting leave, even if the leave is ultimately approved, if the employee is "clearly on notice of such requirements and of the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply." In <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, the appellant was removed for a charge of continued failure to be in regular attendance and AWOL. The AJ determined that part of the charges could not be sustained because leave was approved for some absences. The penalty was mitigated to a reprimand for a single sustained AWOL charge. On the agency's PFR in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, the Board set aside the initial decision and sustained removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Webb v. United States Postal Service</span>, 9 MSPB 749, 10 MSPR 536 (1982), the Board held that an adverse action based on approved leave is "...precluded by the laws (5 USC Ch. 63) and regulations (5 CFR Part 630) that entitle an employee to use annual and sick leave within prescribed circumstances and limitations."...&#8197;Further, the Board stated that to discipline an employee for use of approved leave is not such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service correctly asserts that 5 USC Chapter 63, and 5 CFR Part 630, are inapplicable to the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "employee" is defined in 5 USC 2105(e):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as otherwise provided by law, an employee of the United States Postal Service or of the Postal Rate Commission is deemed not an employee for purposes of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, in enacting the Postal Reorganization Act...Congress did not include 5 USC Chapter 63 among those laws specifically applicable to the Postal Service. Since 5 USC Chapter 63 is not made applicable to the Postal <span id="Page_2441"></span>Service by 39 USC 410, and because 5 USC 2105(e) specifically excludes Postal Service employees from Chapter 63, we conclude that Postal Service employees have neither a statutory nor regulatory entitlement to use of annual or sick leave under those provisions. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Webb</span> is modified to reflect our conclusion that 5 USC Chapter 63 and 5 CFR Part 630 are inapplicable to the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board determined that OPM leave regulations do not govern the Postal Service, the Board essentially endorsed the fundamental rule from <span class="Italic">Webb</span> that approved leave may not be used to invoke adverse action. <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> added, however, that employees may be removed for failure to follow procedures for requesting or scheduling leave, even if the leave they take is approved, 30 MSPR at 308:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the proposal and the decision to remove appellant emphasized the unscheduled nature of the numerous absences. Significantly, Postal Service Form 3971 (Request for, or notification of absence), requires the leave-Approving official to indicate whether the approved absence is "scheduled" or "unscheduled." The employee is thus aware from the outset that unscheduled absences are considered different from scheduled absences. An employer faced with an unscheduled absence is doubly burdened; once for the loss of the employee's services and, again, for the loss of the opportunity to plan for the absence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore hold that while an employee may not be disciplined on the basis of approved leave, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, it is yet permissible to predicate <span id="Page_2442"></span>discipline on failure to follow leave-requesting procedures, <span class="Italic">provided</span> the employee is clearly on notice of such requirements and of the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply. We emphasize the responsibility supervisors bear in this regard. The efficiency of the service is not promoted when employees are led to believe, through leave approvals, that their attendance patterns are acceptable--only to discover later that the approved leave is used as a basis for subsequent discipline. Confronted with an unscheduled absence, a supervisor, concluding that discipline is appropriate, must mark the employee AWOL or, if leave is approved, must make clear to the employee that the failure to schedule the leave in advance is not being disregarded.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;This can be accomplished by annotating the leave request form to such effect or by adopting a form similar to Postal Service form 3971 (requiring checking of "scheduled" or "unscheduled" boxes).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">An example of the application of <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> is <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 150, 154-56 (1995):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">An unscheduled absence from work is one not requested and approved "in advance." Nothing in the record further defines the term "in advance," or indicates how far in advance employees were required to request leave. As noted above, the agency charged the appellant with unscheduled absence on nine "occasions." The agency, however, did not define each "occasion." We infer that each absence of part of a day, of a single day, or of more than one day in succession is an "occasion." Thus we analyze the agency's evidence with regard to the nine charged "occasions" of unscheduled absence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Examination of the record reveals the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;On September 13, 1992, the appellant requested sick leave at 2250; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on September 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;On November 8, the appellant requested sick leave at 2280; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on November 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;On December 23, the appellant requested holiday leave during his shift. The leave was approved on December 23.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;On January 5, the appellant requested sick leave (injury) during his shift. The leave was approved on January 5. On January 6, 1993, the appellant requested sick leave from home at 0075. The leave was approved on January 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;On January 8, the appellant requested sick leave at 2233; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on January 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;On February 10, the appellant requested sick leave at 1220; his shift began at 2350. The leave was approved on February 11. On February 11, during the same "occasion," the appellant requested and received approved sick leave at 2340; his shift began at 2350. The leave was approved on February 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7.&#x2003;On March 30, the appellant requested sick leave at 2225; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on March 31. On April 2, the appellant requested sick leave at 935; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on April 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8.&#x2003;On April 4, the appellant requested sick leave until April 8 at an unspecified time; 16 hours of leave was approved on an unspecified date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">9.&#x2003;Tardiness. On December 1, 1992, the appellant requested LWOP at 2289; his shift began at 2300. The leave was approved on December 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To meet its burden to prove the charge of unscheduled absence, the agency must show that on each "occasion" the approved leave was not requested and approved in advance of its use. <span class="Italic">See generally Gunn v. US Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 513, 519 (1994). For "occasions" where leave was requested in advance of use, and leave approval was given on the same date as the leave request, absent a showing of the exact time of approval, we find that the agency did not meet its burden to prove that the leave was not approved in advance. Further, we find that for "occasions" on which leave was requested in advance, and approved without an indication of the approval date, the agency did not meet its burden to show that the leave was not approved in advance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to prove the charge of irregular attendance due to unscheduled absences by the requisite preponderance of the evidence on "occasions" 3, 4, and part of "occasion" 6, i.e., for February 11, where the leave was approved on the date that it was used, and on "occasion" 8, where the day that the leave was approved is unspecified. We find that the agency proved its charge of unscheduled absence for the remaining "occasions" because the leave was not approved until after the use had begun. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(B)]; <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. US Postal Service</span>, 45 MSPR 620, 626 (1990). In other words, by proving most of the specifications under the charge of unscheduled absence, i.e, that the appellant used 68 hours of unscheduled leave on five complete "occasions" and part of a sixth "occasion," the agency proved the charge of unscheduled absence by the preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of unscheduled absence was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Easterling v. USPS</span>, 110 MSPR 41, 48-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18, 2008 MSPB 214 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"To meet its burden to prove the charge of unscheduled absence, the agency must show that on each 'occasion' the approved leave was not requested and approved in advance of its use." <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 150, 156 (1995). The Board has held that the agency has not met its burden to prove absences were unscheduled where leave was requested in advance and the agency did not show the date or the time the supervisor approved the appellant's leave request. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the appellant's case, the leave requests show that all of his requested leave was approved, even though the agency considered them unscheduled absences. Also, the appellant made all of his leave requests, except two, prior to the start of his shift (although they were made very close in time to the start of his shift). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant's supervisor approved all of the requests and indicated that they were unscheduled, but he did not indicate the date or the time he approved each of the requests, so it is impossible to determine from this record whether or not he approved the appellant's leave in advance of the beginning of the appellant's shifts. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Williams</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 156. If the appellant's supervisor did approve the absences in advance, the appellant's absences were not unscheduled. <span class="Italic">See Williams</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 156.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board again explained <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> in <span class="Italic">Podrazik v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 380, 382-83 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding the charge of irregular and unsatisfactory attendance not sustained, the administrative judge acknowledged the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Fleming v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 302 (1986), which held that an agency may, under certain circumstances, take a disciplinary action against an employee based on his use of unscheduled leave. The administrative judge found <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> inapplicable, however, because he found that, considering the emergency nature of the appellant's absences, the agency had not shown that he failed to request leave in accordance with its leave requesting procedure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge has misinterpreted the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>. That case is controlling because the appellant's leave was unscheduled, that is, not requested in advance....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, the Board held that, while the Postal Service could not discipline an employee on the basis of approved leave by itself, it was permissible to predicate discipline on failure to follow leave-requesting procedures, provided the employee was on notice of such requirements and the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that the appellant was on notice that his absences were not acceptable and that, if there were repeated instances, discipline could ensue....&#8197;Under <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, therefore, the agency properly disciplined the appellant based on his irregular attendance. <span class="Italic">See also James v. US Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 97, 100 (1987).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit followed the Board's <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> analysis, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service considers leave "approved" even if it is approved after the leave has been taken. <span class="Italic">See Fleming v.

Specifically, the Postal Service may discipline an employee for use of unscheduled approved leave when: (1) leave is not requested in accordance with the agency's leave-requesting procedures; and (2) the employee is on clear notice that unscheduled absences caused by the failure to follow leave-requesting procedures can result in disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. at 642; <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, 30 MSPR at 308.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fleming</span> was initially limited to Postal Service employees. The limitation was explained, <span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 473, 476-77 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This Board has previously held that, as a general rule, an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking adverse action on the basis of those absences<span class="Italic">. See Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 24 MSPR 537, 541 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Board also found no error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency waived any objection to the appellant's failure to follow instructions regarding the administration of sick and annual leave by approving the appellant's leave in spite of the failure to follow instructions. The Board suggested that an agency could discipline an employee who failed to follow proper procedures for requesting leave by denying the leave. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 MSPR 610, 611-12 (1984), the Board recognized the primary exception to the general rule prohibiting adverse actions based on approved leave. Generally, that exception applies in situations in which an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay and the following three conditions are met: (1) The record shows that the employee was absent for a compelling reason beyond his or her control so that agency approval or disapproval of leave was immaterial; (2) the absence or absences continued beyond a reasonable time and the employee was warned that adverse action might be initiated unless the employee became available for duty; and (3) the agency showed that the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also Rabago v. Department of the Army</span>, 25 MSPR 530, 533 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the administrative judge failed to consider the principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">Williams, Cook and Rabago.</span> We will, therefore, review the record here to determine whether the agency action can be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the record discloses that the circumstances in the instant case do not meet any of the criteria for the exception to the general rule. The appellant's absence was not due to excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay. Nor was the appellant's absence for a compelling reason beyond her control. Similarly, the appellant's absence did not continue beyond a reasonable time. Finally, the agency failed to show that it needed the appellant's position filled by an employee available for duty on a regular basis; indeed, evidence of record indicates that the appellant was available for duty on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fleming v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 302, 308 (1986), this Board recognized a second exception to the general rule. In <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, we held that the Postal Service may discipline an employee for failure to follow leave-requesting procedures even though the appropriate supervisor had approved the leave requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, however, is inapplicable to the instant case for two reasons. First, the Postal Service...is not bound by the laws and regulations...which govern leave administration in the civil service....&#8197;Accordingly, our decision in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> relies on the Postal Service's regulations and collective bargaining agreement and is not applicable to an executive agency or department whose leave administration policies are governed by 5 USC Chapter 63 and 5 CFR Part 630.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the rationale of <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> appropriately applies to agencies other than the Postal Service, the facts in this appeal do not meet the conditions precedent we articulated in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, approved leave may form the basis for discipline for failure to follow leave-requesting procedures only if the employee is clearly on notice of such requirements and the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply....&#8197;We note that, in each instance, the appellant was charged with unauthorized absence and had completely failed to make any attempt to request leave or otherwise notify the agency of her absence. Thus, although the appellant has been counseled and disciplined concerning improper leave requests, the agency had also charged her with AWOL for her absences. Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to put the appellant on notice that continued failure to comply with its leave regulations alone could lead to disciplinary action even though her improper leave request was approved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">This limitation was also described in <span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. EPA</span>, 38 MSPR 403, 406-07 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As a general rule, an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking adverse action on the basis of those absences. <span class="Italic">Williams</span>....&#8197;Two recognized exceptions to this rule are set forth in <span class="Italic">Cook</span>...(where an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay) and <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>...(under certain conditions, the United States Postal Service may discipline an employee for failure to follow leave-requesting procedures even though the appropriate supervisor approved the request). In <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 473 (1988), the Board held that the holding in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> was limited to cases involving the Postal Service because Postal Service employees are not covered by the laws and regulations that govern leave administration in the civil service...and therefore do not have a statutory or regulatory entitlement to use annual or sick leave.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span> and <span class="Italic">Young</span> were modified by <span class="Italic">Wilkinson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 4, 6-7 (1995). Relying on <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, <span class="Italic">Wilkinson</span> broadened the scope of the USPS exception to all agencies: failure to follow leave-requesting or leave-reporting procedures is an acceptable basis for disciplining non-USPS employees as well as USPS employees, even if the leave is approved:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a general rule, an agency's approval of leave for unscheduled absences precludes the agency from taking adverse action on the basis of those absences. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Army</span>, 24 MSPR 537, 541 (1984). Two recognized exceptions to this rule are set forth in <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 MSPR 610, 611-12 (1984) (where an employee makes excessive use of unscheduled leave without pay), and <span class="Italic">Fleming v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 302, 308 (1986). In <span class="Italic">Fleming</span>, the Board held that "while an employee may not be disciplined...on the basis of approved leave, <span class="Italic">per se,</span> it is yet permissible to predicate discipline on failure to follow leave-requesting procedures, <span class="Italic">provided</span> the employee is clearly on notice of such requirements and of the likelihood of discipline for continued failure to comply." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 308 (emphasis in original; footnote omitted). The Board based this holding on the reasonable logic that an employer is "doubly burdened" by an unscheduled absence; once for the loss of the employee's services, and again for the loss of the opportunity to plan for the absence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board subsequently found that the holding in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> applied only to the Postal Service. In <span class="Italic">Yartzoff v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 38 MSPR 403, 407 (1988), the Board stated that in <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 36 MSPR 473 (1988), the Board found that the holding in <span class="Italic">Fleming</span> was "limited to cases involving the Postal Service because Postal Service employees are not covered by the laws and regulations that govern leave administration in the civil service...and therefore do not have a statutory or regulatory entitlement to use annual or sick leave." The Board then found that the non-Postal Service agency in <span class="Italic">Yartzoff</span> was precluded from maintaining its charge of failure to follow proper leave-requesting procedures when it granted the appellant's leave. <span class="Italic">See Yartzoff,</span> 38 MSPR at 407.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency required the appellant to request leave by calling the agency during the first two hours of his shift on each day for which leave had not been previously approved. Although the appellant was aware of this requirement, he failed to follow these procedures from August 11 through August 31, 1992. We find that non-Postal Service agencies should be able to discipline employees for such behavior. Such action will encourage agencies to grant compelling leave requests even though proper leave-requesting procedures were not followed, while allowing agencies to hold employees accountable for their failure to follow such procedures. An employee's failure to follow leave-requesting procedures can be serious where, for example, the employee improperly refuses to communicate with the agency as required for weeks at a time, even though he may be entitled to approved leave on the merits of his absence. We therefore announce that henceforth a charge of failing to properly request sick leave, annual leave, or LWOP can be maintained by an agency that is bound by the laws and regulations that govern leave administration in the civil service, even though the agency eventually approves the leave request (or the Board on review determines that the agency's denial of the leave request was unreasonable), so long as the employee is on notice of the agency's requirements. <span class="Italic">See Fleming,</span> 30 MSPR at 308.</p>

Dept. of Army,</span> SF-0752-14-0538-I-1 (NP 2/27/2015) ("Additionally, we find the denials of the appellant's leave requests were reasonable where the appellant had a pattern of arriving for work late and requesting either unscheduled leave or leave without pay to cover her unscheduled absences."); <span class="Italic">Valenzuela v.
