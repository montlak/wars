<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-114"><span class="space">b.</span> Partisan Political Reason</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sweeting v. Dept. of Justice</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SWEETING_AT315H09025_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253979.pdf">6 MSPR 715</a>, 717-19, 6 MSPB 598 (1981), observed that 5 CFR 315.806(b) contains no definition of "partisan political reasons." After a review of court decisions and legislative history, the Board concluded that "partisan political reasons" means discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate. This excludes activism in civil rights organizations or discrimination based on nonpartisan political beliefs--matters that may be addressed to OSC as prohibited personnel practice allegations. <span class="Italic">Sweeting</span> explained the genesis of the term "partisan political reasons":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the meaning of "partisan political reasons" in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b), since the regulation itself provides no hint, we shall look to its evolution. Before the regulation was amended in 1972, it stated that "an employee may appeal under this subparagraph a termination not required by statute which he alleges was based on <span class="Italic">political reasons...,"</span> (emphasis added) and the term "political reasons" in that context was construed in two reported judicial decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Peale v. United States,</span> 325 F. Supp. 193, 194-95 (N.D. Ill. 1971), the district court noted that the former Civil Service Commission (Commission) dismissed the probationer plaintiff's appeal because it found that wearing a black arm band to signify opposition to a war did not constitute a "partisan political reason" for which termination was prohibited. The court found the Commissioner's equation of "political reasons" with "partisan political reasons" to be a plainly erroneous construction of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) because the Hatch Act prohibits partisan political activity and permits non-partisan political activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Holden v.</span> <span class="Italic">Finch,</span> 446 F.2d 1311 (D.C. Cir. 1971), the court of appeals noted that the Commission dismissed the probationer plaintiff's appeal on the grounds that civil rights activity did not constitute a "partisan political reason" because it did not relate to "affiliation with or support of recognized partisan political parties, their candidates for public office, or their political campaign activities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 1314. The court strenuously disagreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Commission has seen fit to interpret its regulation as confined to partisan political activity in the Hatch Act sense. It appears to believe that it has in terms excluded from the concept of political discrimination any conduct which does not fit into the traditional partisan mold of organized contention for elective political office.... We think...that such a reading is at odds with the Congressional purpose, stated in the Hatch Act itself, that the statutory proscription of partisan political activity does not extend to the right of an employee to "express his opinion on <span id="Page_170"></span>political subjects," or to engage in political activity in connection with "a question which is not specifically identified" with political parties. We suggest, finally, that such an interpretation could not, compatibly with the First Amendment, be constitutionally maintained as against any and all activities involving speech and association relating to public policies of essentially political, albeit non-partisan, nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.,</span> 1316.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After these two decisions were rendered, the Commission amended 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) in 1972 by adding the word "partisan" before "political reasons" in order to "clarify appeal rights of probationers." 37 Fed. Reg. 26575 (1972). Since there is no question that the Commission acted within its authority in amending the regulations, the word "partisan" must be given full effect. <span class="Italic">United</span> <span class="Italic">States v. Larionoff,</span> 431 U.S. 864, 873, 97 S. Ct. 2150, 2156, 53 L. Ed.2d 48 (1977); <span class="Italic">cf. Zeigler Coal Co. v. Kleppe,</span> 536 F.2d 398, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM urged in its brief that the proper interpretation of "partisan political reasons" in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) is the same as the Commission's interpretation of "political reasons" in <span class="Italic">Holden,</span> namely:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">446 F.2d at 1314. OPM contended that this interpretation is rational when the regulation is viewed as a complement to the Hatch Act, and that discrimination against an employee because of more general nonpartisan political beliefs may be addressed by Special Counsel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1206. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2301(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The construction of "partisan political reasons" in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) by OPM and its predecessor is entitled to great deference as long as the interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the regulation. <span class="Italic">Larionoff,</span> 431 U.S. at 872, 97 S.

We believe that OPM's construction is indeed both reasonable and consistent with the regulation. Moreover, it is consistent with Civil Service Rule IV which specifies the type of political discrimination prohibited in Federal employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the executive branch of the Federal Government against or in favor of any employee in the competitive service, or any eligible or applicant for a position in the competitive service because of his race, <span class="Italic">political affiliation,</span> or religious beliefs, except as may be authorized or required by law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 4.2 (emphasis added). We find, therefore, that discrimination based on "partisan political reasons" under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 315.806(b) means discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allegations that appellant was terminated because her political views, or unwillingness to discuss those views, did not coincide with the views of her coworkers, and that the resultant lack of collegiality in the office led to her removal, were insufficient to establish jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Marynowski v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 118 MSPR 321, 323-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, 2012 MSPB 82 (2012) (Member Robbins dissenting on other grounds):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b), the Board follows a two-step process<span class="Italic">. See Burton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 2012 MSPB 73, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1344 (Fed. Cir. 2006)).[1] First, the appellant must make nonfrivolous claims of jurisdiction, i.e., factual allegations that, if proven, would establish that her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. An appellant who makes such nonfrivolous claims is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which she must then prove the basis for jurisdiction, i.e., that her termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status, by a preponderance of the evidence.[2] <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While <span class="Italic">Burton</span> addressed jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.908(b), the jurisdictional standards applicable to that regulation are also applicable to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6; 8 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge incorrectly advised the appellant that nonfrivolous allegations are sufficient to establish jurisdiction. However, as discussed below, the appellant failed to make even a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was based on partisan political discrimination, and she will have the opportunity on remand to prove her marital discrimination claim by preponderant evidence. We therefore conclude that she was not harmed by the error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was based on partisan political reasons</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her claim that she had been subjected to partisan political discrimination, the appellant made the following factual allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1. Appellant was often forced to endure negative political discussion about President Obama. Two of her coworkers, Wenzell Gadsden and Phillip Murray, would frequently try to engage her in a political discussion about President Obama.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2. When Mr. Gadsen and Mr. Murray mentioned President Obama, they never said "President Obama," but frequently referred to him as merely "Obama." They would say things like "I believe a lot of the problems with our country relate back to the Obama's decisions pertaining to the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy that Obama is changing.["]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3. For some reason, perhaps due to her Caucasian race, Appellant's coworkers thought she was a Republican and tried to get her to discuss politics so they could find out her political views. She told them she did not want to discuss politics and that she did not feel the office was the place to discuss politics.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4. Even though Appellant told her coworkers she did not want to discuss politics, they would always mention partisan politics when Appellant was around them. It was very oppressive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5. Appellant's supervisor said that the office was like a club and they got along well. They were people of color and Appellant needed to understand that. Appellant felt like the office was a political club, but Appellant was not part of the club and she was terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6. Ms. Nwuzor decided to terminate Appellant in part because Ms. Nwuzor thought Appellant did not get along with everyone else that was in the same racial and political club.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_171"></span>The Board and its reviewing court have held that discrimination based on "partisan political reasons" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b) means discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate. <span class="Italic">Mastriano v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 714 F.2d 1152, 1155-56 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Sweeting v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 715, 719 (1981). We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegations that coworkers would attempt to engage her in political discussions about President Obama, the "Don't Ask Don't Tell" policy, or their political beliefs do not fall within the meaning of partisan political reasons as the phrase is used in the regulation. The appellant's bare assertions that her termination was based on her coworkers' belief that she was a Republican is mere conjecture. Further, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegation about "people of color" or a "club" referring to African Americans does not indicate discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate. <span class="Italic">Cf. Mastriano</span>, 714 F.2d at 1156 (allegations of discrimination based on union affiliation do not state a cause of action within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b)). We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that her termination was based on partisan political reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Insufficient to establish jurisdiction was a team leader's reluctance to speak to appellant, apparently because of the appellant's discussion with others of political events. <span class="Italic">Parris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, CH-315H-12-0769-I-1 (NP 6/7/2013) ("In support of his claim that he had been subjected to partisan political discrimination, the appellant stated that his team leader would seldom talk to him because his team leader heard of his talks with one of the night crew in which they 'often discuss political and social events happening in the media.' We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegation that his discussions about politics do not fall within the meaning of partisan political reasons as the phrase is used in the Office of Personnel Management's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b)."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">LaLove v.

The appellant's bare assertion that his termination was based on his coworkers' belief that he was a Republican is mere conjecture. We therefore conclude that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that his termination was based on partisan political reasons.

<p class="Body-Text">A religious organization did not qualify as a political party or candidate, <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-315H-11-0080-I-1 (NP 9/16/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that he failed to non-frivolously allege that he was discriminated against for partisan political reasons. Specifically, he alleges that affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a <span class="Italic">de facto</span> political affiliation, and that he was discriminated against because he is not a member of that church. We agree with the administrative judge, however, that the appellant did not allege facts that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and its reviewing court have held that discrimination based on "partisan political reasons" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b) means discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate. <span class="Italic">Mastriano v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 714 F.2d 1152, 1155-56 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Sweeting v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 715, 719 (1981). Here, the appellant did not indicate that he was affiliated with a particular party or candidate, stating that he "is politically an independent and is not currently registered for any political party." Therefore, the appellant's claim fails because he did not allege that his termination resulted from his affiliation with, or support of, any political party, its candidates for public office, or its political campaign activities as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b) and prior Board precedent. The fact that the appellant is not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is immaterial.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nor did alleged concerns about union affiliation establish a nonfrivolous allegation of partisan political reasons, <span class="Italic">Crawford v. MSPB</span>, 557 Fed. Appx. 988, 992 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Crawford also asserts that she was discriminated against because of her political affiliations, thereby asserting jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b). She argues that "unions were strongly associated with the Democratic [P]arty," and "[s]ham political calls were directed to me. The Board misapplies rules--a non-frivolous allegation was made that politics motivated the discharge." Ms. Crawford does not provide any evidence that supports the assertion that her affiliation with a union or the Democratic Party was related to her termination. Even if Ms. Crawford had evidence of discrimination based on her union affiliation, that itself would not bring about a cause of action. <span class="Italic">See Mastriano v. Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 714 F.2d 1152, 1156 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The problem of defining partisan political reasons arose in <span class="Italic">Harris v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 577, 580 (1985). The appellant alleged he was terminated during probation so that the agency could terminate the nephew of a U.S. senator without acutely embarrassing the senator--the idea being that if several people were dismissed concurrently there would be less focus upon the senator's nephew. The Board saw no basis for disturbing the termination, concluding that a partisan political reason is personal to the appellant. It must be the appellant, not some other individual, who is terminated for that reason. Under <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> the reason must be one involving political influence, resulting from affiliation with or support of recognized political parties, candidates, or campaign activities. A hearing was ordered, however, for an employee who alleged that her probationary appointment was terminated because of "political influence" used to create a "power play atmosphere," resulting in discrimination against the appellant because of the appellant's political background predating her appointment. <span class="Italic">Black v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Poorsina v. MSPB</span>, 726 F.2d 507, 509 (9th Cir. 1984), involved a probationer who argued that the Board improperly refused jurisdiction of his appeal from a dismissal he contended was reprisal for whistleblowing. The appellant contended that his charges of waste and mismanagement stemmed from his political convictions about quality patient care within the Indian Health Service. The court affirmed the Board, deciding that the phrase "partisan politics" is "best interpreted in a common-sense way as relating to recognized political parties, candidates for public office, or political campaign activities." The only way the whistleblowing allegations could be addressed by the Board would be through OSC. The court relied on <span class="Italic">Cutts v. Fowler</span>, 692 F.2d 138 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Sawdey v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 89-3070), to establish jurisdiction over a probationer's appeal, it was insufficient to assert that the appellant was a zealous advocate of the proper conduct of government affairs. The term "partisan political reasons" meant discrimination based on affiliation with any political party or candidate. The court cited <span class="Italic">Mastriano v.

The appellant's generic allegations that his termination was "politically motivated by various high level politicians" and that he suffered a "political termination," etc., without any supporting factual allegations, are not nonfrivolous allegations that his probationary termination was based on partisan politics. The appellant thus has failed to allege a viable claim of partisan political discrimination.</p>
