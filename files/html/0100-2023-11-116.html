<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-117"><span class="space">10.</span> Last Chance Agreements; Settlements</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal for notice to the union of meetings convened with employees to discuss "last chance agreements" designed to avoid disciplinary action, coupled with the right of the union to attend those meetings, did not infringe the Privacy Act, because the last chance agreements were not part of designated records systems. The possibility that the meetings might entail disclosure of some information from records did not bar the negotiability of the proposal, although the proposal was nonnegotiable for other reasons. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 214 and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 38 FLRA 309, 327-334 (1990) (Proposal 3). But, as a result of <span class="Italic">TRACON</span>, the last chance agreement itself would not be subject to compulsory disclosure to a union that requested the agreement to determine whether the meeting leading to the agreement constituted a formal discussion that would have required notice to the union. Release of the agreement was precluded by the Privacy Act, for reasons explained in <span class="Italic">VARO, St. Petersburg and AFGE Local 1594</span>, 51 FLRA 530, 532, 534-40 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that the Respondent proposed the removal of a bargaining unit employee (hereinafter Employee A), based on her performance. In response to the proposal, Employee A submitted two doctors' letters and a written reply in which she discussed her performance, her medical conditions, and possible accommodations to those conditions that the Respondent could provide. Employee A met with management and orally replied to the proposed removal. Employee A declined Union representation at that meeting and in other matters connected to her proposed removal. Thereafter, the Respondent issued Employee A a decision on her proposed removal. Attached to the decision was a "last chance agreement" which Employee A subsequently signed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union subsequently informed the Respondent by letter that, in <span id="Page_381"></span>its view, the oral reply meeting constituted a formal discussion within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute and, therefore, the Respondent had violated the Statute and the parties' agreement by failing to give the Union the opportunity to be present at the meeting. The Union also requested the Respondent to provide it with copies of all agreements reached between Employee A and the Respondent concerning Employee A's employment or annual performance for the then current performance period. The Respondent denied the Union's request on the ground that the Privacy Act barred disclosure of the requested information. The Respondent noted that the Union did not represent Employee A in this matter, and that the document was releasable only with Employee A's consent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338, 345 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>), which involved the disclosure of performance appraisals of bargaining unit employees, we set forth the analytical approach we will follow in assessing an agency's claim that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. As we explained in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, an agency asserting that the Privacy Act bars disclosure is required to demonstrate: (1) that the requested information is contained in a "system of records" under the Privacy Act; (2) that disclosure of the information would implicate employee privacy interests; and (3) the nature and significance of those privacy interests. If the agency makes the requisite showings, the burden shifts to the General Counsel to: (1) identify a public interest that is cognizable under the FOIA; and (2) demonstrate how such disclosure will serve that public interest. Although the parties bear these burdens, we will, where appropriate, consider matters that are otherwise apparent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We held in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, for reasons fully explained there, that the only relevant public interest to be considered in this context is the extent to which the requested disclosure would shed light on the agency's performance of its statutory duties, or otherwise inform citizens as to the activities of the Government. More particularly, we held that the public interest in collective bargaining that is embodied in the Statute, or specific to a union in fulfilling its obligations under the Statute, will no longer be considered in our analysis under Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Once the relevant interests are established, we will balance the privacy interests of employees against the public interest in disclosure. Where this balance leads us to conclude that the privacy interests are greater than the public interest at stake, we will find that the requested disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 6 and, therefore, that disclosure is "prohibited by law" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute; accordingly, the agency is not required to furnish the information, unless disclosure is permitted under another exception to the Privacy Act. In contrast, where the balance tips the other way, because the public interest is greater than the privacy interests, we will conclude that disclosure would be required under the FOIA and, therefore, is not prohibited by the Privacy Act.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As we noted in <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, a finding that disclosure is not prohibited by law does not end the inquiry into whether an agency's failure to disclose requested information violates the Statute. In order to sustain such a violation, we must find that all of the requirements of section 7114(b)(4) have been met. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 345.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In applying this analytical framework to the case before us, we note that the parties have stipulated that the requested last chance agreement is contained in an OPM system of records, OPM-GOVT 3. In addition, we find that both the Respondent and the General Counsel have demonstrated, respectively, that disclosure of the information would implicate employee privacy interests and serve the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the employee's privacy interests, the courts and the Authority have recognized that release of unsanitized information about disciplinary and adverse actions implicates significant privacy interests. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA No. 41, slip op. at 10 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DOL</span>). This finding is consistent with the conclusions reached by courts reviewing claims under Exemption 6 of the FOIA. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Air Force </span>v. <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 425 U.S. 352, 377 (1976); <span class="Italic">Chamberlain v. Kurtz</span>, 589 F.2d 827, 841-42 (5th Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 444 U.S. 842 (1979). Moreover, Employee A refused to approve release of the last chance agreement to the Union and chose not to have the Union act as her representative. These facts indicate that the employee's privacy interests are implicated and that the employee wishes not to disclose such embarrassing and stigmatizing information to the Union. <span class="Italic">See Federal Aviation Administration, New York</span> <span class="Italic">TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 115, 122 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>, <span class="Italic">Westbury</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the public interest in disclosure, we find, in agreement with the General Counsel, that the release of the last chance agreement would shed light on how the agency accommodates employees with medical or handicapping conditions who are facing removal for performance reasons. In this regard, we note that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1988), imposes a duty on Federal agencies to make reasonable accommodations for such employees, unless an agency can show that to do so would impose undue hardship on its operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2921 and U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Dallas, Texas</span>, 50 FLRA 69, 72 (1994); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, Fort Bragg, North Carolina and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1770</span>, 42 FLRA 1186, 1192 (1991) (<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Rodgers v. Lehman</span>, 869 F.2d 253, 258 (4th Cir. 1989)). Thus, Congress has recognized a public interest in how Federal agencies accommodate employees with handicapping conditions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there is no indication that disclosure of the last chance agreement in a name-identified form would enhance the foregoing public interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOL</span>, 51 FLRA No. 41 at 10-11. <span class="Italic">See also FAA, Westbury</span>, 51 FLRA at 122-23 (disclosure of EEO settlement agreement with personally identifying information did not enhance the extent to which the public interest in monitoring agency actions is served). <span class="Italic">Cf. Norwood v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 993 F.2d 570, 575 (6th Cir. 1993) (disclosure of settlement agreements for reinstatement of fired air traffic controllers, redacted of directly identifying data, served the public purpose of monitoring agency operations). Moreover, because the last chance agreement was requested for only one name-identified employee, it is not possible to protect the identity of the individual whose privacy is at stake. <span class="Italic">See FAA, Westbury</span>, 51 FLRA at 122; <span class="Italic">Schonberger v. National Transportation Safety</span> <span class="Italic">Board</span>, 508 F. Supp. 941, 945 (D.D.C. 1981). Although disclosure of the unsanitized last chance agreement might assist the Union in performing its representational functions, this interest is specific to the Union as the requesting party and, as such, may not be considered in assessing the public interest under FOIA Exemption 6. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 349.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the weight of judicial and Authority precedent supports a conclusion that the public interest that would be served by disclosure of the last chance agreement is outweighed by the invasion of privacy that would result therefrom. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the agreement would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure of the Requested Information Is Not</span> <span class="Italic">Authorized Under the Routine Use Exception to</span> <span class="Italic">the Privacy Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM's routine use statement for the OPM-GOVT 3 system of records, identified as routine use "a," provides that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation." 57 Fed. Reg. 35710 (1992). Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the requested information, we must decide whether the requested information is "relevant and necessary," within the meaning of routine use "a."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">OPM issued "guidance to agencies" for interpreting these terms in FPM Letter 711-164, which was published on September 17, 1992. When the FPM was abolished on December 31, 1993, the Letter, along with certain other parts of the FPM, was provisionally retained through December 31, 1994. For the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration</span>, <span class="Italic">Little Rock</span>,<span class="Italic"> Arkansas</span>, 51 FLRA No. 24, slip op. at 8-11 (1995), we apply the FPM Letter's guidance in deciding this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that the requested information is consistent with routine use "a": (1) the information is "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information is "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM Letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis; the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Addressing first the standard of "relevance," and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical," and "significant," it is necessary to examine the relationship between the last chance agreement and the purpose for which it was sought: to ascertain whether the oral reply meeting with Employee A constituted a formal discussion from which the Union was improperly excluded. We note that, in determining whether a discussion is "formal," within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A), the Authority considers a number of relevant factors: (1) the position in the management hierarchy occupied by the individual who held the <span id="Page_382"></span>meeting; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) where the discussion took place (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, in the supervisor's office, at each employee's desk, or elsewhere); (4) how long the discussion lasted; (5) how the meeting was called (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, with formal advance written notice or more spontaneously and informally); (6) whether a formal agenda was established; (7) whether employee attendance was mandatory; and (8) the manner in which the meeting was conducted (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, whether the employee's identity and comments were noted or transcribed). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Defense Logistics Agency, Defense</span> <span class="Italic">Depot Tracy, Tracy, California</span>, 14 FLRA 475, 477 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel has not shown how a last chance agreement bears a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the Union's stated purpose of determining whether the oral reply meeting was formal within the meaning of section 7114(a)(2)(A). Furthermore, it is not apparent to us how the contents of the agreement could disclose the specifics of the meeting or indicate whether the meeting met the above mentioned <span class="Italic">indicia</span> of formality.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, in this case our analysis is informed by our <span class="Italic">in camera</span> examination of the last chance agreement itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This examination confirms that the agreement does not bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the Union's stated purpose for requesting the document. The last chance agreement sets forth management's terms and conditions governing Employee A's future performance. The agreement contains no reference to the oral reply meeting in general, or any information that pertains to the specific indicia of formality set forth above. We have also examined the other related documents that were submitted to us under seal and find that the only mention of the oral reply meeting is contained in the Respondent's cover letter to the last chance agreement. The cover letter indicates that management considered six matters in reaching the decision to offer Employee A the last chance agreement, and that one of those six was Employee A's oral reply made during the disputed meeting. However, the cover letter contains no details regarding the oral reply meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on our examination of the record as a whole, and applying the FPM Letter's "relevance" standard, we conclude that the record does not demonstrate that the last chance agreement is likely to affect the purpose for which it was sought. Accordingly, we conclude that the requested last chance agreement has not been shown to be relevant to that express purpose. Therefore, without deciding whether the information is "necessary" under the requirements of the FPM Letter, we conclude that the information sought by the Union is not disclosable as a routine use under section 552a(b)(3) of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">A union was denied access to an MSPB settlement agreement. An arbitrator upheld a grievance protesting the agency's failure to provide the agreement, but on review of exceptions to the award FLRA concluded the information need not be released, <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI El Reno and AFGE Local 171</span>, 51 FLRA 584, 588-92 (1995):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency challenges the award's consistency with law; accordingly, we review the questions raised by the exceptions <span class="Italic">de novo. See National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 24</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995). Based on such review, we find that disclosure of the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint is inconsistent with the Privacy Act and, therefore, that the award ordering disclosure is contrary to law. As a result, we set aside the award and find it unnecessary to address the remaining exceptions that are premised on other grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we note the Agency's statement, in its exceptions, that the settlement agreement and the written response are contained in a system of records identified as OPM/GOVT-3. As the Union does not dispute this statement, we find that the documents are contained in OPM/GOVT-3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure Would Result In a Clearly Unwarranted</span> <span class="Italic">Invasion of Privacy Under FOIA Exemption 6</span> [5]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently found that employees have significant privacy interests in information pertaining to disciplinary actions, which include the action involved in this case, because the release of such information can be embarrassing and stigmatizing to the employee involved. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA No. 41, slip op. at 9-10 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Department of Labor</span>). We find that the employee in this case similarly has significant privacy interests. Furthermore, by entering into an agreement with the Agency to seal the settlement agreement, the employee has evidenced a desire to maintain the secrecy of the agreement and guard against disclosure of its contents. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office, St. Petersburg, Florida</span>, 51 FLRA No. 47 (1995), slip op. at 7. The fact that the employee's identity is known to the Union does not lessen his privacy interests. <span class="Italic">See Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1014.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, New York TRACON, Westbury, New York</span>, 50 FLRA 338 (1995) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>), we set forth the approach to be used for addressing agency claims that disclosure of information requested under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning of FOIA Exemption 6 and, therefore, is prohibited by the Privacy Act. Although this case involves an information request under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, rather than the Statute, we apply the same balancing of privacy and public interests as we did in <span class="Italic">FAA</span> and as we have done previously in arbitration cases. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D.C.</span>, 46 FLRA 234, 238 (1992). We also address the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint as presenting the same privacy and public interests because the parties have treated them as such.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the public interest that would be served by disclosure, we find that release of the settlement agreement and the written response would shed light on Government operations and, therefore, would serve a public interest that is cognizable under Exemption 6. Specifically, disclosure of the two documents would serve the public interest of monitoring the manner in which the Government disciplines Federal employees and assesses the job conduct of public servants. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Robbins Tire and Rubber Co.</span>, 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978) (a basic purpose of the FOIA is to ensure an informed citizenry needed to "hold the governors accountable to the governed").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, there is no indication that disclosure of the documents in a name-identified form would better serve the foregoing public interest. <span class="Italic">See Department of Labor</span>, 51 FLRA No. 41, slip op. at 10. <span class="Italic">See also Norwood v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 993 F.2d 570 (6th Cir. 1993) (disclosure of documents pertaining to settlement offers of reinstatement to fired air traffic controllers, redacted of identifiers, found to serve the public interest). Moreover, because the requested documents concerned only one name-identified employee, it is not possible to redact the documents to protect the identity of the employee whose privacy is at stake. <span class="Italic">See Federal Aviation Administration, New York TRACON</span>, <span class="Italic">Westbury, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 115, 122 (1995). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Schonberger v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 508 F. Supp. 941, 945 (D.D.C. 1981) (court found "no reasonable way to...protect...privacy because the request sought one document, identified by name and date, applying solely to one individual"). Although disclosure of the unsanitized settlement agreement and the written response might assist the Union in discharging its representational responsibilities, this interest is specific to the Union and, as such, may not be considered in balancing interests under FOIA Exemption 6. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 50 FLRA at 349. <span class="Italic">See also Department of Defense</span>, 114 S. Ct. at 1014 ("[A]ll FOIA requesters have an equal, and equally qualified, right to information[.]"); <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press</span>, 489 U.S. 749, 771 (1989) ("[T]he identity of the requesting party has no bearing on the merits of his or her FOIA request.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, on balance, the public interest that would be served by disclosing the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint is outweighed by the invasion of privacy that would result. Accordingly, we find that disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, within the meaning of Exemption 6 of the FOIA, and, thus, is not authorized by the FOIA exception to the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Disclosure of the Requested Information Is Not</span> <span class="Italic">Authorized Under the Routine Use Exception to the</span> <span class="Italic">Privacy Act</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The routine use statement published by OPM in connection with OPM/GOVT-3 provides, under routine use "a," that records may be disclosed "to officials of labor organizations recognized under 5 U.S.C. chapter 71 when relevant and necessary to their duties of exclusive representation concerning personnel policies, practices, and matters affecting work conditions." 57 Fed. Reg. 35712 (1992). Accordingly, to determine whether the routine use exception applies to the settlement agreement and written response, we must decide whether such information is "relevant and necessary," within the meaning of routine use "a."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FPM Letter [711-64] contains two requirements that a union must satisfy in order to establish that the requested information is consistent with routine use "a": (1) the information is "relevant" to the express purpose for which it is sought, meaning that the nature of the information must bear a traceable, logical, and significant connection to the purpose to be served; and (2) the information is "necessary," meaning that there are no adequate alternative means or sources for satisfying the union's informational needs. In clarifying this second requirement, the FPM Letter explains that it is to be determined on a case-by-case basis: the union "must show that it has a particularized need for the information in a form that identifies specific individuals, and that its information needs cannot be satisfied through less intrusive means, such as by releasing records with personally-identifying information deleted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_383"></span>In this case, we find that the Union has failed to demonstrate that the requested information is "relevant" within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164. Addressing that standard and looking at the ordinary meaning of the terms "traceable," "logical," and "significant," it is necessary for us to examine the relationship between the requested information--the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint--and the express purposes for which that information was sought: to "ensure that the Agency observes its statutory, regulatory and collective bargaining agreement obligations." In this regard, the Union has not explained, and it is not apparent to us, how the information would, if provided, bear a traceable, logical, and significant relationship to these purposes. The Union has not shown, for example, how knowledge of the terms of the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response would permit the Union to ensure that the Agency complies with its statutory and regulatory obligations and its obligations under the parties' negotiated agreement. First, the Union points to no statutory and regulatory obligations with which the Agency must comply. Second, the only contractual provision cited is Article 31C, which permits employees to adjust grievances without the Union "as long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement...." The record does not indicate, and the Union does not explain, what the terms of the agreement are and how the requested documents can reasonably be attributed to and are likely to influence or affect those agreement terms.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the Union has not established that the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response to the employee's MSPB complaint are relevant, within the meaning of FPM Letter 711-164. As a result, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the information is "necessary" under the FPM Letter. We conclude that the settlement agreement and the Agency's written response are not disclosable under the routine use exception to the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b)(3), and that the Arbitrator's finding otherwise is deficient.</p>
