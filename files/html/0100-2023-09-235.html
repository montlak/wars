<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-232"><span class="space">2.</span> Application of Regulation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Straightforward interpretation and application of the regulation and practice concerning interlocutory appeals is presented in a decision presenting the question of whether respondents could obtain counsel fees from the Special Counsel when they successfully defended against Hatch Act regulations, a judge may certify an interlocutory a, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Perkins</span>, 104 MSPR 148, 153 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2006 MSPB 344 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Board's regulations, a judge may certify an interlocutory appeal if he determines that the issue presented is of such importance to the proceeding that it requires the Board's immediate attention. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. The regulations provide, however, that a judge will certify a ruling for interlocutory appeal only if the record shows that the ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, that an immediate ruling will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or that the denial of an immediate ruling will cause undue harm to a party or the public. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92; <span class="Italic">see Cooper v. Department of the Navy</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 683, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). We find these requirements are satisfied here. Whether State and local officials and governmental entities may receive attorney fees and costs in Hatch Act cases are matters of first impression about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and immediately resolving the rulings certified will materially advance the completion of the attorney fees proceedings. We therefore shall address these rulings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Board's regulations do not authorize judges to certify "questions" for interlocutory appeal; rather, the regulations authorize judges to certify their rulings. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.91-.93; <span class="Italic">see Olson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 169, &#x00B6; 11 (2002). Accordingly, rather than address the "questions" as phrased by the administrative law judge in his order certifying his rulings for interlocutory appeal, we will limit our consideration to the actual rulings that appeared in the administrative law judge's September 27, 2006 order.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While the difference between the certification of a "question" and the certification of a "ruling" on a question is subtle, the certification of a "question" as opposed to a "ruling" could have unintended consequences. For example, while the administrative law judge's order addressed the respondents' motion for attorney fees pursuant to subsection 1204(m), the third question the administrative law judge certified, i.e., whether attorney fees and costs can be awarded to a State or local government entity named by OSC in a Hatch Act complaint, is arguably much broader than his ruling, because the question, as phrased, is not limited to the Board's authority to award attorney fees under subsection 1204(m). To resolve the question, as opposed to the ruling, the Board would have to consider whether any authority exists which might permit the award of attorney fees and costs to a State or local government entity named as a respondent in a Hatch Act complaint. Because the administrative law judge relied only on subsection 1204(m) as the authority for his ruling that the Henderson Police Department may be eligible for an award of attorney fees, we limit our consideration to that authority. We do not purport to rule out the possibility that some other authority may exist that would authorize the award of attorney fees to the respondents in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying the regulation, <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 592-93 &#x00B6; 5-6, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), determined to be proper a certification for interlocutory appeal concerning retroactive effect of portions of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act Amendments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by a judge during a proceeding. An appeal may be certified for interlocutory review on the motion of either party or on the administrative judge's own motion. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. The Board's regulations provide for certification of a ruling for interlocutory review where (a) the ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and (b) an immediate ruling will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or the denial of an immediate ruling will cause undue harm to a party or the public. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1220"></span>We find that the criteria for certifying a ruling for interlocutory review are met in this case. The temporal reach of the WPEA is an important question of law about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, as evidenced by the number of <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs received in this appeal and the differing views expressed therein. In addition, an immediate ruling regarding the retroactive application of the WPEA will materially advance the completion of not only this proceeding but many other appeals that were pending when the WPEA became effective. Therefore, the administrative judge properly certified his ruling for interlocutory review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, an interlocutory appeal was appropriate as to retroactivity of the compensatory damages provision of the WPEA. <span class="Italic">King v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <span class="blue">119 MSPR 663,</span> 2013 MSPB 62 (2013). [For subsequent history of <span class="Italic">King</span>, refer to <span class="Italic">King v.

<p class="Body-Text">Interlocutory review occurred in <span class="italic">Richardson v. VA</span>, 2023 MSPB 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2023), determining whether a statute governing actions against some VA employees, 38 USC 714, supported action against a hybrid employee (<span class="italic">see</span> 38 USC 7401(3)), and concluding that the action could proceed only under Title 5 procedures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interlocutory appeal is an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by an administrative judge during a proceeding. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. An administrative judge may certify an interlocutory appeal to the Board on his own motion or upon the motion of either party. <span class="italic">Id</span>. The Board's regulations provide for certification of a ruling for review when "[t]he ruling involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion" and "[a]n immediate ruling will materially advance the completion of the proceeding, or the denial of an immediate ruling will cause undue harm to a party or the public." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criteria for certifying an interlocutory appeal are met in this case. The issue of whether the agency has the authority under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 714 to remove a hybrid employee is an important question of law about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate ruling on that question will materially advance the completion of this proceeding. Therefore, the administrative judge properly certified his ruling for interlocutory appeal. <span class="italic">See, e.g., In re Tinker AFSC/DP v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2014) (discussing the standard and finding that the administrative judge properly certified her ruling for interlocutory appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may not certify a question of law or policy to the Board for interlocutory review unless he previously ruled on the question. This means that a motion calling for a ruling must be filed or presented to the AJ. The AJ could suggest the desirability of a motion. <span class="Italic">Olson v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 169, 173-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2002), emphasized the necessity for an AJ's ruling for interlocutory appeal, although in <span class="Italic">Olson</span> the Board decided to dispense with the required ruling because of the significance of the issue presented and because the Board recently issued an order that it decided would provide guidance to the parties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interlocutory appeal is "an appeal to the Board of a ruling made by a judge during a proceeding." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. An AJ may certify a "ruling" for interlocutory review only if the "ruling" involves "an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion," and either an immediate ruling by the full Board would materially advance the completion of the proceeding or the denial of an immediate ruling would cause undue harm to a party or the public. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ merely certified a "question"; she did not make a "ruling" as the governing regulations contemplate. Certain rulings, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, denial of a motion for permissive intervention, denial of a motion for disqualification of an AJ, or denial of a motion to dismiss, by their very nature may be appropriate for interlocutory review, <span class="Italic">see Judges' Handbook</span>, ch. 6, &#x00A7; 2(a)(1), (3), (4), because if the Board disagrees and grants the motions then wasteful proceedings at the regional level will have been avoided. The question certified is not like these examples. Moreover, whether the agency could appoint non-preference eligibles to the position the appellant sought under the Outstanding Scholar program or by some other non-competitive method may be the dispositive issue on the merits. An interlocutory appeal by its very nature does not deal with dispositive issues on the merits<span class="Italic">. See Black's Law Dictionary</span> 819 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "interlocutory" as "interim or temporary, not constituting a final resolution of the whole controversy").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Note the statement in <span class="Italic">Olson</span> that "[a]n interlocutory appeal by its very nature does not deal with dispositive issues on the merits," a phrase that could have used some elaboration, since interlocutory appeals may deal with issues of law or procedure that will be dispositive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-14-0233-I-1 n.5 (NP 2/24/2015) ("Importantly, the Board's regulations define an interlocutory appeal as an appeal of a ruling made by the administrative judge during a proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. In this case, however, when the appellant moved for an interlocutory appeal, the administrative judge had not yet made any rulings but instead had issued only acknowledgment and record closing orders, to which the appellant had voiced no objections. In this context, the appellant's motion therefore is more aptly described as preemptory rather than interlocutory.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Regulations do not require that notice be given of the right to move for certification of an interlocutory appeal of an AJ's ruling. <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 7 MSPR 84, 91 n.10, 7 MSPB 15 (1981). Unless presented during a hearing, the motion for certification must be written. The AJ should attempt to obtain an immediate response to a certification motion from other parties. The AJ must provide the other parties the opportunity to object to the certification and to submit argument supporting the decision they desire the Board to make if an interlocutory appeal is certified. It appears that evidence is not to be submitted with the motion for certification; evidence should be submitted earlier in the proceeding, according to <span class="Italic">Gergick v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 651, 655 n.2 (1990), an appeal involving an application for a stay under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A case of first impression, involving whether prior service as a National Guard Technician could be added to competitive service in a probationary appointment for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an employee, was appropriate for interlocutory appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 108 MSPR 620, 624 &#x00B6; 6, 2008 MSPB 102 (2008).

DHHS</span>, 117 MSPR 30, 2011 MSPB 90 (2011). An issue with implications throughout the civil service, involving the ability of the Board to review designation of positions as "sensitive" was properly certified for interlocutory appeal in <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Dept. of Defense</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/PrecedentialDecSearch.html">115 MSPR 572</a>, 576-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2010 MSPB 247 (2010) (Board decision reversed in <span class="Italic">Berry v.

<p class="Body-Text">A discovery dispute does not ordinarily fairly implicate the interlocutory appeal process, <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 98 MSPR 683, 684-85 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, these cases do not meet the criteria for certification. Certainly, immediate resolution of the underlying discovery issue would materially advance the completion of the proceedings. If the appellants do not prevail in their appeals and the Board determined later that the AJ abused his discretion in denying the appellants' motion to compel, the cases would have to be remanded, discovery reopened, and a new hearing held. However, that is potentially true in every case involving a discovery dispute and is an insufficient basis for certifying an issue for interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the question is whether the AJ's ruling on the appellants' motion to compel "involves an important question of law or policy about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion." We find that there is no important question of law or policy presented in these cases. Instead, resolution of the discovery dispute in these cases revolves around ordinary concepts of relevance and involves neither a purely legal issue nor an issue which is reasonably likely to set either important precedent or precedent that will be directly applicable in more than a few future cases. Therefore, this issue does not meet the criteria for certification of an interlocutory appeal and we decline to address it further at this time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A motion to disqualify agency counsel and the agency's office of general counsel warranted interlocutory review, <span class="Italic">Jones v. SBA</span>, 121 MSPR 1, 5 &#x00B6; 9, 2014 MSPB 17 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The criteria for certifying a ruling for interlocutory review are met in this case. The issue of the standard for disqualification of an agency counsel and/or general counsel's office based on a conflict of interest is an important question of law about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion, and an immediate ruling regarding the appellant's request to disqualify the agency counsel will materially advance the completion of this proceeding. Therefore, the administrative judge properly certified her ruling for interlocutory review. <span class="Italic">See Collins v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-18 (2003) (considering on interlocutory review whether an appellant's counsel should be disqualified due to an impermissible conflict of interest).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The criteria for certifying an interlocutory appeal are met in this case. The issue of which party bears the burden of proof concerning the agency's "safe haven" decision is an important question of law about which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and an immediate ruling on that question will materially advance the completion of this proceeding.

<p class="Body-Text">A dispositive jurisdictional issue that did not merit an interlocutory appeal was presented in <span class="Italic">Hamlett v. DOJ</span>, 90 MSPR 674, 676 &#x00B6; 4 (2002), involving the question whether the Civil Service Due Process Amendments excluded coverage of individuals appointed to the position of Assistant United States Attorney. The AJ felt that the appellant was not an "employee" entitled to a Board appeal. The Board, while ruling on the certified issue (in favor of the appellant), suggested that the AJ should have dismissed the appeal and allowed the PFR process to run its course rather than certifying the jurisdictional issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge certified an interlocutory appeal of his finding, stating that the issue has never been directly addressed by either the Board or the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The administrative judge should have simply issued an initial decision rather than certifying an interlocutory appeal, given his view that the appeal is beyond the Board's jurisdiction. Interlocutory appeals are intended either to "materially advance the completion of the proceeding" or to prevent "undue harm to a party or the public." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.92(b). Neither circumstance is present here. Nonetheless, it would be wasteful for us to return the case to the field office without answering the certified question. Accordingly, we will answer the certified question.</p>

Bradford</span>, 69 MSPR 247, 248 (1995) (issue concerning approval of a proposed settlement of a Hatch Act case). The Board may announce that resolution of an issue does not materially advance the completion of a proceeding or prevent undue harm to a party or to the public, and then go on to decide the certified issue "to expedite review" of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lee v. DOJ</span>, 99 MSPR 256, 259 n.1 (2005).</p>
