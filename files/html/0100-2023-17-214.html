<p class="noindent">A back pay award for a temporary promotion may only be made if the employee meets minimum OPM requirements for the higher-graded positions.

Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-052.html">56 FLRA 381</a>, 388 (2000) (remanding for arbitrator to determine whether grievant met OPM minimum qualification standards), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 57 FLRA 72 (2001); <span class="Italic">DHHS, Pub. Health Serv., Navajo Area Indian Health Serv. and LIUNA, Navajo Nation Health Care Employees Local 1376</span>, 50 FLRA 383, 386 n.4 (1995) (specifically declining to determine whether remedy other than back pay would be available to grievant; also specifically not addressing, as in <span class="Italic">Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 30 FLRA 6 (1987), arbitrator's requirement that agency waive requirement concerning minimum level of qualifying experience).</p>
<p class="noindent">Of the requirement that an award of a temporary promotion include a determination that the employee meets the minimum qualifications for the higher-graded position, <span class="Italic">VAMC Asheville and AFGE Local 446</span>, 59 FLRA 605, 608-09 (2004), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that, in order to be entitled to a temporary promotion, an "employee must meet the minimum qualification requirements prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)" for the higher-graded position<span class="Italic">. United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Serv., Pub. Health Serv., Navajo Area Indian Health Serv.</span>, 50 FLRA 383, 386 (1995); <span class="Italic">See also United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Loretta, Pa</span>., 55 FLRA 339 (1999) (Member Wasserman concurring in part and dissenting in part) (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>). Where an arbitrator does not make any findings regarding the grievant's minimum qualifications and the record is insufficient for the Authority to make a determination as to whether the grievant possessed the minimum qualifications, the Authority will remand the case to the parties for resubmission to an arbitrator, absent settlement, to make a determination as to whether the grievant possessed the minimum qualifications for temporary promotion to a higher-graded position<span class="Italic">. See DOJ</span>, 55 FLRA at 343; <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 53 FLRA at 1620.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the record is insufficient to make a determination as to whether the grievant possessed the minimum qualifications required by OPM for a temporary promotion to the higher-graded GS-303-07 Program Support Assistant position. Although the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency never inquired about the grievant's qualifications for the GS-7 position and did not know if the grievant was qualified to hold the position, the Arbitrator did not address whether the grievant, in fact, met the OPM minimum qualifications requirement for the position. In addition, neither party provided evidence as to the grievant's actual qualification for such a position. Given this lack of evidence in the record, we are unable to assess, based on the record, whether the grievant possessed the minimum qualification requirements. In such circumstances, and consistent with Authority precedent, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for determination as to whether the grievant met the minimum qualification requirements for the GS-7 position<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent">An award of a temporary promotion should specifically explain whether the employee meets minimum qualification requirements. If there is any question as to the minimum qualifications of the grievant for the promotion, FLRA may condition approval of the award on a demonstration that the grievant meets those qualifications. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, New Cumberland Army Depot and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 21 FLRA 968, 973 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, DCA and NAGE Local R4-27</span>, 56 FLRA 855, 859-60 (2000) (remanding award granting temporary promotion for arbitrator to consider qualifications of grievant for position under OPM or agency qualification standards); <span class="Italic">DHUD, New Orleans and AFGE Local 3475</span>, 53 FLRA 1611, 1620 (1998) ("[W]here the question of whether a grievant meets the minimum qualifications for temporary promotion to a higher-graded position is disputed by the parties and the record is not sufficient to resolve that dispute--the Authority will remand the award to the arbitrator to make a finding as to the grievant's qualifications."); <span class="Italic">VAMC, Buffalo and SEIU Local 200-C</span>, 37 FLRA 379, 383-84 (1990) ("Although a parties collective bargaining agreement may entitle an employee to be temporarily promoted to a higher-graded position, a grievant must meet the minimum qualification requirements for the higher-graded position in order to receive the temporary promotion."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NAWS China Lake and IAF Local F-32</span>, 70 FLRA 980 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (setting aside award granting permanent promotion when employee did not meet OPM specialized experience qualification standards for job at higher grade).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award will be reasonably construed. An arbitrator's decision that an employee was eligible for a temporary promotion under a contract article contained an implicit finding that the employee satisfied the contract requirements. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 220</span>, 57 FLRA 599, 601 (2001). An agency did not specifically establish that the grievant did not meet qualification requirements, and the arbitrator did not address the issue. FLRA modified the award to grant the remedy of a retroactive temporary promotion conditioned upon the grievant having met the minimum requirements for the promotion and position on the date that the award set for the initiation of entitlement to pay for the higher-graded job. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq. XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 18 FLRA 481, 482 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 38 FLRA 89, 97 (1990) (award modified to allow temporary promotion for all times that grievant met minimum qualification requirements for promotion to position at higher grade).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator cannot award as corrective action a temporary promotion made retroactive to a date that the employee was not minimally qualified for promotion to that position, even if the employee would have been qualified for the promotion earlier had the agency given him contractually required training. <span class="Italic">Adjutant Gen., Michigan, Dept. of Military Affairs and NAGE</span>, 11 FLRA 13, 14 (1983). <span class="Italic">Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 30 FLRA 6, 7-8 (1987), vacated an arbitrator's award because the employee, who was ordered to be temporarily promoted, had not met the position's minimum qualification requirements<span class="Italic">. Dept. of Army, Hq., Ft. Dix and AFGE Local 1930</span>, 49 FLRA 730, 735-37 (1994), set <span id="page_2082"></span>aside an award of a temporary promotion to an individual who served in the position but who did not qualify for promotion to that job. FLRA explained the distinction between qualification requirements that could not be waived, and time-in-grade requirements that could be waived:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator ordered backpay for the grievant, while denying her a temporary promotion to the Chief Supply Officer position to which the grievant had been detailed. Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when the grievant has been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted agency personnel action that has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of all or part of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, West Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1061</span>, 46 FLRA 853, 860 (1992) (<span class="Italic">VA West Los Angeles</span>). Without a temporary promotion, and absent some contractual provision or similar agency regulation requiring it, backpay cannot be awarded merely because an employee is detailed to a higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">Health Care Financing Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, 17 FLRA 592 (1985) (arbitrator's award, including backpay, for extended detail to higher-graded duties set aside because neither parties' agreement nor agency's regulation mandated payment); <span class="Italic">Federal Correctional Institution, Petersburg, Virginia and American Federation of Government Employees, Appomattox Local 2052</span>, 16 FLRA 600 (1984) (arbitrator's award providing retroactive temporary promotion and backpay for detail to higher-graded duties set aside because grievant was not qualified for promotion).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the grievant was not qualified for promotion to the GS-11 position because she did not possess the specialized experience required for promotion. For an employee to be properly promoted, whether temporarily or permanently, the employee must meet the minimum qualification requirements for the position to which the employee is to be promoted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Buffalo, New York and Service Employees International Union, Local 200-C</span>, 37 FLRA 379, 384 (1990).[4] Therefore, the grievant was not qualified for promotion, including temporary promotion, to the GS-11 Chief Supply Officer position.[5] Because the grievant could not have been promoted to the position, the Agency did not violate law or regulation when it refused to promote the grievant temporarily to the GS-11 Chief Supply Officer position.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;There is no dispute in the record, and the Arbitrator found, that at least 1 year's experience at the next lower grade level is an established experience requirement in the X-118 Handbook for promotion to the GS-11 position of Chief of Supply. Similarly, there is no dispute, and the Arbitrator found, that the grievant did not possess the required experience.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that this case, which concerns the grievant's uncontroverted lack of specialized experience as required for promotion, is distinguishable from cases involving grievants who did not meet time-in-grade requirements for temporary promotions. A waiver of time-in-grade requirements by an agency is permissible under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 300.603(b)(7)<span class="Italic">. See VA</span> <span class="Italic">West Los Angeles</span>, 46 FLRA at 861; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Allen Park, Michigan and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 933</span>, 38 FLRA 688, 695-96 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a collective bargaining agreement may entitle an employee to be temporarily promoted to a higher-graded position, the employee must nonetheless meet the minimum qualification requirements for the higher-graded position in order to receive the temporary promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 38 FLRA 89, 97 (1990). However, as noted above, the Arbitrator found that Article VII, Section 9 of the parties' agreement, regarding temporary promotions, did not apply in this case because it pertains only to bargaining unit positions and the Chief Supply Officer position is a supervisory position outside the bargaining unit. The Agency, therefore, did not violate the parties' agreement when it refused to promote the grievant temporarily to the GS-11 Chief Supply Officer position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Arbitrator cited FPM Supplement 335-1-5.c.4 as an authority suspending the requirement that an employee to be promoted possess the requisite specialized experience. However, that regulation exempts agencies from following merit promotion plan procedures for effecting temporary promotions of 120 days or less; it does not waive specialized experience requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Supplement 335-1-5. The Arbitrator also relies on FPM provisions permitting an agency to detail employees, essential to fulfilling the agency's mission, without competitive procedures. Again, a waiver of competitive procedure requirements does not waive the necessity that the employee possess the requisite specialized experience. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's reliance on these FPM provisions is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, as the grievant was not entitled to the temporary promotion by law, regulation, or the parties' agreement, the Agency's refusal to promote the grievant did not constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and, consequently, no remedy under the Back Pay Act is available to the grievant. Therefore, the Arbitrator's award of backpay and interest to the grievant is deficient and will be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS FDA and NTEU</span>, 58 FLRA 567, 569-70 (2003), declined to honor an arbitrator's intent to provide an equitable entitlement to a temporary promotion based on the grievant's circumstances rather than on the grievant's ability to meet OPM qualification requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator may properly award backpay under the Back Pay Act when the arbitrator determines that an agency has denied an employee a temporary promotion to which the employee was entitled under a collective bargaining agreement for having performed the duties of a higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dept of Health and Human Services, Pub. Health Serv.,</span> <span class="Italic">Navajo Area Indian Health Serv.</span>, 50 FLRA 383, 385 (1995) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>). However, the employee must meet the minimum qualification requirements prescribed by OPM for the position to which the employee is to be promoted. <span class="Italic">See </span>50 FLRA at 385-86 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(3) (Requirement 3)).[4] When the employee does not meet a minimum qualification requirement prescribed by OPM, a failure to promote the employee does not constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act, and no backpay remedy is available under the Act. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 386; <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dept of the Army, Headquarters Fort Dix, Fort Dix,</span> <span class="Italic">NJ, </span>49 FLRA 730, 737 (1994) <span class="Italic">(Ft. Dix).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Requirement 3 provides that to be eligible for promotion or placement, candidates must meet the minimum qualification standards prescribed by OPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">OPM's Qualification Standards Operation Manual</span> specifies as a minimum education requirement for the position of consumer safety officer 30 credit hours of science courses. It is not disputed that the grievant does not satisfy this requirement. Consequently, the grievant was not qualified for the position of consumer safety officer, GS-12, and could not be temporarily promoted to that position. Accordingly, we find that the Agency's failure to promote the grievant did not constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and that the Arbitrator's award of backpay is deficient as contrary to the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 50 FLRA at 386; <span class="Italic">Ft. Dix, </span>49 FLRA at 737.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator's perceived intent of "public sector collective bargaining agreements" does not permit the grievant's promotion. In the Federal sector, the parties' collective bargaining agreement cannot authorize the temporary promotion of the grievant. <span class="Italic">See HHS</span>, 50 FLRA at 385-86 (in order to be promoted, Federal employees must meet the minimum qualification requirements prescribed by OPM for the position to which the employee is to be promoted). Furthermore, such is not the intent of the agreement. it clearly provides that to be temporarily promoted under Article 34, the employee must "meet[ ] the appropriate qualification requirements."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Arbitrator's reliance on the Agency's appointment of an employee as a consumer safety officer after the employee had been converted to a consumer safety officer position by the National Marine Fisheries Service also does not permit the grievant's promotion. As the Arbitrator specifically found, this employee was converted to the position of consumer safety officer by another agency and under the add-on rule, the Agency (FDA) could not reject his qualifications. However, the add-on rule did not apply to the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As described by the Arbitrator, under the add-on rule, once an employee is placed in a position series, the employee's qualifications are not reexamined to determine whether the employee meets minimum qualification requirements, including minimum educational requirements. Unlike the employee appointed by the Agency as a consumer safety officer after conversion to consumer safety officer by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the add-on rule did not apply to the grievant because she had never been appointed to a consumer safety officer position. Consequently, the grievant's qualifications for the consumer safety officer position were subject to review by the Agency, and the Arbitrator erred by attempting to distinguish between transfers and promotions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, even if the add-on rule provides circumstances under which employees may be promoted despite lack of minimum education requirements, the grievant's case did not present such circumstances. As the Authority has specifically held, there is no provision for the waiver by an agency of OPM minimum qualification requirements. <span class="Italic">See HHS, </span>50 FLRA at 386 n.4; <span class="Italic">Hill Air Force Base, Utah, </span>30 FLRA 6, 8 (1987) <span class="Italic">(Hill</span> <span class="Italic">AFB); cf. United States Dep't of Justice, Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Correctional Inst., Loretta, Pa., </span>55 FLRA 339, 343 (1999) (with respect to time-in-grade requirements which are waivable by an agency, the Authority noted that creating a blanket rule of waiver whenever an agency allowed an employee to perform higher-graded duties may be fair, but it would ignore title 5 of the C.F.R.).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, to the extent the award is founded on the Arbitrator's perception <span id="page_2083"></span>of inequity, the Authority has stated that it does not condone the inequity of assigning employees higher-graded duties for which they cannot be promoted, but nevertheless holds that employees who fail to meet minimum qualification requirements cannot be promoted consistent with OPM regulations.<span class="Italic"> See AFGE Local 1631, </span>23 FLRA 507, 508 (1986).</p>
