<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-94"><span class="space">3.</span> Employee AWOL</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board ordinarily lacks jurisdiction over placement of an employee in AWOL status during a period of employment. <span class="Italic">Marks v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 2 MSPR 494, 495, 3 MSPB 17 (1980). Adverse action does not encompass special leave procedures imposed on an employee. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. DHEW</span>, 2 MSPR 505, 506, 3 MSPB 27 (1980). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-218.html#sec1-216">Leave Dispute; Administrative Leave; Notice, Investigation Leave</a>," concerning AWOL determinations and the jurisdictional implications adjustments in leave status.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Placement in AWOL rather than sick leave status is not a constructive suspension or enforced leave as long as the agency does not prevent the appellant from resuming his duties. <span class="Italic">Bucci v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 36 MSPR 489, 490-91 (1988) (agency placed an employee on AWOL rather than sick leave because he did not comply with instructions to submit additional medical documentation in support of his request for sick leave; the employee controlled his own return date; distinguishing <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Alston v. SSA</span>, 95 MSPR 252, 257 &#x00B6; 12 (2003) (agency did not constructively suspend an employee who, while on administrative leave, informed the agency she would be absent for medical reasons and the agency placed her on LWOP when she failed to produce medical documentation clearing her for a return to work; "it was the appellant, not the agency, who initiated the LWOP period when she did not give the agency the requested medical report by the due date").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board lacks jurisdiction over AWOL status if the appellant voluntarily decides to remain absent from work or if the appellant cannot show that the agency placed her in a nonduty, nonpay status against her will. To establish a suspension, the employee would need to show that she contacted an agency official with decisionmaking authority to communicate unequivocally her availability and her desire to return to duty, <span class="Italic">Maki v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 449, 453-56 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2076"></span>The Board and the courts have consistently held that AWOL, by itself, is not an appealable matter<span class="Italic">. Aho v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 25 MSPR 569, 571 note, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table); <span class="Italic">Rose</span>, 721 F.2d at 366. In order for the Board to assert jurisdiction over an agency action placing an employee in AWOL status, he or she must establish that the action constituted a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction or raise the AWOL in connection with an otherwise appealable matter<span class="Italic">. See Bucci v. Department of Education</span>, 36 MSPR 489, 491 (1988). A "suspension" is defined as "the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay." 5 USC 7501(2). Suspensions for more than 14 days are appealable to the Board. 5 USC 7512(2) and 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Martel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 504 (Fed. Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">affirming</span> 15 MSPR 141 (1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843 (1984), the court agreed with the Board's conclusion that, to establish that placement in AWOL status constitutes a suspension, an employee must show that he was placed on AWOL "against his will" i.e., that he was in fact ready, willing, and able to come to work," and "for disciplinary reasons." 735 F.2d at 507-08. Additionally, the court implicitly agreed with the Board's conclusion, <span class="Italic">see</span> 15 MSPR at 149-150, that to establish that he was ready, willing, and able to report to work, the employee must show that he contacted an agency official with decision-making authority (in person or otherwise) to communicate unequivocally his availability and his desire to return to duty. 735 F.2d at 507-08.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In subsequent decisions, however, the court has appeared to eliminate the "ready, willing, and able" requirement from the jurisdictional test for many suspension cases based on enforced leave (sick leave, annual leave, or leave without pay)<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 90, n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 1018 (1985); Litoff, <span class="Italic">Enforced Leave as Suspension in the Federal Sector</span>, 39 Labor L.J. 729, 747 (1988) (concluding that the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, <span class="Italic">Mercer v.

However, in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, and <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, the court did not address whether it intended to eliminate the "ready, willing, and able" test not only for suspension cases based on enforced leave but also for suspension cases based on AWOL, the status at issue here.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board has previously distinguished between constructive suspension cases based on AWOL and those based on enforced leave, and has declined to apply the <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> test, which arose out of an enforced leave case, to a constructive suspension appeal based on AWOL<span class="Italic">. Bucci</span>, 36 MSPR at 491-92.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the administrative judge applied the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> test, which arose out of an enforced leave case, and concluded that the agency's placement of the appellant in AWOL status did not constitute a constructive suspension. To the extent that the administrative judge's failure to also apply the <span class="Italic">Martel</span> test, which arose out of an AWOL case, was error, we find that this omission does not constitute reversible error because, as explained below, the appellant did not show that the AWOL constituted a suspension under either the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> or <span class="Italic">Martel</span> tests.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on his credibility findings, the administrative judge rejected the appellant's claim that one agency official asked her to return her office keys and that another agency official, Mr. Galvin, directly informed her not to report for work from July 9 onward. According to the appellant, Mr. Galvin made this statement on July 8, 1988, when the appellant visited his office to present medical evidence regarding her absence during the previous week. The administrative judge instead credited the testimony of an agency witness to whom the appellant gave her office keys that the appellant spontaneously offered to return her keys without being asked to do so. Additionally, the administrative judge credited the testimony of another agency witness that the appellant was never told not to report for work, but rather, directed to return to work when she recovered from her illness or to submit additional medical evidence. The administrative judge found that the testimony of the agency witness that the appellant voluntarily returned her keys was detailed, internally consistent, and consistent with the appellant's admitted behavior, whereas the appellant's contrary testimony was vague. For similar reasons, the administrative judge also discounted the appellant's testimony that an agency official directed her not to report to work from July 9 onward, and credited the contrary testimony of the agency witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the administrative judge's findings, it is clear that the appellant voluntarily chose to remain absent from work, and she therefore failed to show that the agency placed her in a nonduty, nonpay status against her will. Thus, applying the <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> test, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant failed to show that her placement in AWOL status constituted a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction. The appellant also did not establish a suspension under the <span class="Italic">Martel</span> test, since she failed to show that she contacted an agency official with decision-making authority to communicate unequivocally her availability and her desire to return to duty<span class="Italic">. Martel</span>, 15 MSPR at 149-50.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Since the appellant has not satisfied this prong of the <span class="Italic">Martel</span> and <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> tests, there is no need to reach the issue of whether the agency's placement of the appellant on AWOL was effected for disciplinary reasons, as required by 5 USC 7501(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not appealable was AWOL imposed when, after a period of administrative leave pending an investigation, the appellant failed to respond to his agency's request that he communicate with his supervisor and return to work, <span class="Italic">Thorne v. MSPB</span>, 681 Fed. Appx. 923, 925-28 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From September 14 to September 18, 2015, Thorne's supervisors attempted to contact him, but he did not respond. On September 21, 2015, SSG Sayeed sent Thorne a certified letter notifying him that he was placed on administrative leave beginning September 13, 2015. The letter stated that there would be no change to Thorne's pay or other benefits, but that he had to be available by telephone during normal business hours. It also informed him that, "during this period of administrative leave, he must be available to meet with agency officials as required and must contact his supervisor on regular duty days, that he could request leave, and that his failure to follow these instructions could result in formal disciplinary action." The certified letter was returned to the agency as "unclaimed." Thorne did not contact his supervisors as instructed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 5, 2015, the agency sent Thorne a certified letter instructing him to return to duty immediately. In that letter, the agency explained that Thorne stopped communicating with his supervisors and that he had not requested leave or provided any documentation regarding his continued absence. The letter informed Thorne that the agency placed him in Absent Without Leave ("AWOL") status as of October 4, 2015, and that failure to return to work by October 16, 2015, or to comply with the requirements of the letter, might result in disciplinary action. That letter was also returned as "unclaimed," and Thorne failed to contact his supervisor.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> His timecards were marked AWOL beginning on October 17, 2015.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent Thorne argues that the agency's decision to transfer him from administrative leave to AWOL status amounted to a constructive suspension, we disagree. As previously discussed, the agency transferred Thorne to AWOL status because he failed to comply with the agency's instructions to communicate with his supervisors during his period of administrative leave. Placement on AWOL status, by itself, is not an appealable adverse action, as it does not fall under any of the categories of adverse actions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See Perez</span>, 931 F.2d at 855 ("We hold that in a situation such as this, where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the [Board]."). The Board has recognized, however, that employee-initiated leaves of absence may be appealable as constructive suspensions where the appellant alleges that: (1) he lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived him of that choice. <span class="Italic">Romero v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 121 M.S.P.R. 606, 610 (M.S.P.B. 2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 120 M.S.P.R. 397, 401 (M.S.P.B. 2013)); <span class="Italic">see Rosario-Fabregas</span>, 833 F.3d at 1346-47 (holding that the Board's standard for establishing jurisdiction in constructive suspension cases, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Romero</span>, is appropriate).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thorne has not alleged that he lacked a meaningful choice between remaining on administrative leave or being placed on AWOL. Nor does he allege that the agency deprived him of that choice. As the Board explained, had Thorne complied with the agency's instructions, "he would have remained in a paid duty status, albeit at his home, pending resolution of the agency's investigation into his conduct." Thorne's failure to remain in contact with the agency and comply with its instructions was his choice, and voluntary employee actions are not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Starkey v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 198 F.3d 851, 853 (Fed. Cir. 2000) ("Voluntary employee actions are not within the jurisdiction of the [Board]."). Under these circumstances, we agree with the Board that Thorne's placement on AWOL status is not a constructive suspension within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>

GSA,</span> SF-0752-13-0050-B-2 (NP 5/3/2016) ("the appellant otherwise purposefully took no leave during the period in question, and therefore she did not suffer a constructive <span class="Italic">suspension</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 606, &#x00B6; 8 (2014)."); <span class="Italic">Justice v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 379, 385 &#x00B6; 9 (2001) (recovered employee did not identify record evidence showing he communicated his desire to report for duty before a particular date to the agency).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an agency could not show that the employee was unable to perform any duty, yet the employee was sent home on leave, the action was adverse and reversed for lack of procedural protections. <span class="Italic">King v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 467, 469-70 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 254, 257-58 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (remanding for analysis of a possible constructive suspension resulting from "Medical <span id="Page_2077"></span>Unit's action in preventing the appellant from returning to work without clearance" after the appellant, a distribution clerk, arrived at work with a surgical shoe; further analysis was required of whether the appellant's absence became voluntary because he remained absent after he was medically cleared to return to work). However, placement of the employee in AWOL for refusal to report for work is not a suspension. <span class="Italic">Aho v. USDA</span>, 25 MSPR 569, 571 n.* (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1065 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. DHHS</span>, 721 F.2d 355 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (AWOL: "petitioner persisted in her refusal to work at her assigned work location and sat, instead in the staff library"). If an employee is placed on nonpay status because she refuses to report for a detail, the action is not a disciplinary one. It does not qualify as a suspension: the appellant is not ready and willing to work. <span class="Italic">Shaw v. GPO</span>, 26 MSPR 664, 667 (1985). <span class="Italic">Anderson v.

USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 121 (1994), helped to explain the reasoning of these cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee voluntarily absents himself from work because of a reassignment to an allegedly inappropriate position or because of medical reasons, the absence does not constitute a suspension within the meaning of 5 USC 7501(2).... If, however, an employee presents himself for work, and the agency has work that the employee can perform within the scope of any medical restrictions that may exist, the agency's refusal to allow the employee to work and its action in putting that employee on leave status can constitute an appealable suspension....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[<span class="Italic">Rivas</span> is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-098.html#sec6-97">Light and Limited Duty; Medical Restriction.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit adopted the Board's approach as to jurisdiction over appeals from employees who voluntarily absent themselves from work, <span class="Italic">Perez v. MSPB</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Perez, unlike the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, was never placed on an <span class="Italic">enforced</span> leave of absence. Rather, the Army transferred him from sick leave to AWOL status because he failed to comply in a timely fashion with repeated instructions to return to work or submit additional documentation and because his documentation was unsatisfactory. It was his choice, not the agency's, to remain away from work. We hold that in a situation such as this, where an employee has voluntarily absented himself from work, placement in a non-pay or AWOL status, even for longer than 14 days, is not a constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the MSPB.</p>
