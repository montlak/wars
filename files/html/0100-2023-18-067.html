<h4 class="h4" id="sec11-68"><span class="space">10.</span> Charge of Unbecoming or Improper or Unprofessional Conduct</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies frequently characterize a charge as "conduct unbecoming" [inserting a term characterizing the appellant's position: a supervisor, a law enforcement officer, an air traffic controller, a federal employee]. <span class="Italic">Borsa v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-12-0291-I-2 (NP 10/28/2013), described the charge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of conduct unbecoming has no specific elements of proof; the agency establishes the charge by proving the appellant committed the acts alleged under this broad label. <span class="Italic">See Canada v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). Moreover, such a charge typically involves conduct that is improper, unsuitable, or otherwise detracts from one's character or reputation. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 42 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Rude, discourteous, and unprofessional behavior in the workplace is outside the accepted standards of conduct reasonably expected by agencies and can be the subject of discipline. <span class="Italic">See Holland v. Department of Defense</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 317, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12 (1999) (removal for rude and discourteous behavior); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of Justice</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 303, 309-10 (1995) (removal for disrespectful conduct and use of insulting, abusive language); <span class="Italic">Peters v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 526, 529 (1984) (removal for discourteous and unprofessional conduct), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 770 F.2d 182 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). Further, an agency is required to prove only the essence of its charge and need not prove each factual specification supporting the charge. <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 71, 74 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 F.3d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Hornsby v. Fed. Housing Finance Agency</span>, DC-0752-15-0576-I-2 (NP 4/28/2022) ("A charge of conduct unbecoming has no specific elements of proof; the agency establishes the charge by proving the appellant committed the acts alleged under this broad label. <span class="Italic">See Canada v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). The agency also must prove that the conduct was unattractive, unsuitable, or detracted from the appellant's character or reputation. <span class="Italic">Miles v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1992)."); <span class="Italic">Le v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-16-0306-I-1 (NP 12/16/2016) ("To prove a charge of conduct unbecoming a Federal employee, an agency is required to demonstrate that the appellant engaged in the underlying conduct alleged in support of the broad label and that the conduct was improper, unsuitable, or detracted from his character or reputation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 42 (2010)."); <span class="Italic">cf. Schifano v. VA</span>, 70 MSPR 275, 281 (1996) ("if the agency proves that the appellant violated one of the 14 general principles contained in section 2635.101(b), it will have automatically proven that he engaged in conduct unbecoming a federal employee").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Raco v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of "conduct unbecoming," much like a charge of "improper conduct," has no specific elements of proof; it is established by proving that the employee committed the acts alleged in support of the broad label. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 22 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 626 F. Supp.2d 1140 (D.N.M. 2009); <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). Nothing in law or regulation requires an agency to affix a label to a charge of misconduct, and an agency may simply describe actions that constitute misbehavior in narrative form and have its discipline sustained if the efficiency of the service suffers because of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Otero,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 202. In sustaining the charge against the appellants, the administrative judge made specific findings that each was aware that Customs and Border Patrol policy prohibits employees from consuming alcohol in a government vehicle. However, the violation of any such policy was not a part of the agency's charge, and, to the extent the administrative judge considered it to be, she erred. Her error was not prejudicial, though, because she found, and we agree, that the agency proved that the appellants committed the acts in support of the "conduct unbecoming" charge. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brousseau v. United States</span>, 640 F.2d 1235, 1247 (Ct.

Similarly, in<span class="Italic"> Bize v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 155, 161 (1980), the Board considered an employee's explanation that he had never been told not to leave his badge on the dashboard or seat of his vehicle and stated that "[o]bviously, it would be impossible for the agency to anticipate every factual situation in which an agent might find himself and train the agent as to what he or she should do under each of these circumstances." Finally, the Board sustained a charge of patient abuse against a Department of Veterans Affairs nurse who confronted a patient in bed, shook papers in the patient's face, and asked a confrontational question even though the agency had not trained the employee that such conduct would constitute patient abuse. <span class="Italic">Byers</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 655, &#x00B6; 24.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-12-0312-I-1 (NP 4/26/2013), added as to unbecoming conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, the appellant asserts that the conduct unbecoming charge cannot be sustained because it is a "nebulous concept" and that, to the extent that the standard to prove the conduct unbecoming charge is to <span id="Page_3211"></span>establish that the appellant committed a prohibited personnel practice, the agency did not prove the charge. The agency is required to prove the charge as it is set out in the notice of proposed removal, not some other offense that might be sustainable by the facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See Spruill v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 36, &#x00B6; 17 (1999). Here, the agency charged the appellant with conduct unbecoming a Department of the Army employee. The appellant's assertion that the agency must prove another charge, that the appellant committed a prohibited personnel practice, is unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has articulated the standard to prove a charge of conduct unbecoming. A charge of "conduct unbecoming," much like a charge of "improper conduct," has no specific elements of proof; it is established by proving that the employee committed the acts alleged in support of the broad label. <span class="Italic">Alvarado v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 22 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 626 F. Supp.2d 1140 (D.N.M. 2009); <span class="Italic">Otero v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1997). Essential to the charge is that the conduct was improper or detracted from the employee's character or reputation as a supervisor. <span class="Italic">See Crouse v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 57, 63 (1997); <span class="Italic">Miles v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 633, 637 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no dispute that the agency established that the appellant engaged in the charged misconduct. Further, the agency showed that the conduct detracted from the appellant's reputation as a supervisor. As the administrative judge found, the appellant in his role as a supervisor in human resources was expected to set an example for subordinate employees in professionalism and integrity in the promotion process. By engaging in the charged misconduct, the appellant failed to set the proper example. As the administrative judge also found, the agency had a legitimate reason to expect the appellant to refrain from any act or perception that certain employees were being provided preferential treatment.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wolak v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 251, 261 (1992), considered the practice of agencies specifically charging misconduct and then adding the charge of "conduct unbecoming a federal manager and employee," or the like:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency did not accuse the appellant of any specific misconduct in addition to its allegations that he wrongfully accessed and executed a payroll program, and that he falsely denied such behavior in the subsequent investigation. Under these circumstances, the administrative judge should have merged the unbecoming conduct charge into the other two charges, rather than considering it as a separate charge. <span class="Italic">See Barcia v. Department of the Army</span>, 47 MSPR 423 (1991) (finding that a charge of using government property for other than official purposes and a charge of violating administrative rules should have been merged where they were based on a single specification of misconduct.). In any event, this charge cannot be sustained because neither of the charges on which it was based has been sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board allows agencies to separately charge an employee with "unbecoming conduct" if the charge has a factual or legal basis distinct from other charges asserted in the proposal, as in <span class="Italic">Miles v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 633, 637-38 (1992), involving two charges--improper use of a government vehicle and unbecoming conduct--arising out of an incident involving the use of a GOV to kill a deer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's conduct was unbecoming a Federal employee. No specific definition of this term is given in the record, although the proposal notice states that it is "disgraceful" conduct. The ordinary meaning of unbecoming is: "unattractive; unsuitable...; detracting from one's...character, or reputation; creating an unfavorable impression." <span class="Italic">See</span> Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary Of The English Language 1538 (1989 ed.). Certainly, running over a deer in a government vehicle, even for humanitarian motives, when a game warden is available, is at the very least unsuitable and tends to detract from one's character because it reflects poor judgment. Both the proposing and deciding officials testified that they considered the use of the government vehicle for this purpose "very serious" misconduct. Under these circumstances, the administrative judge correctly concluded that the appellant's misconduct was conduct unbecoming a Federal employee.</p>

Dept. of Commerce</span>, 389 F.3d 1212 (Fed. Cir. 2004)), determined that merger was appropriate for the charges of misuse of government property and unbecoming conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was charged with conduct unbecoming a federal employee, and with use of government property for unauthorized purposes. As the administrative judge noted, those two charges are based on the same incident and involve the same misconduct. The Board has held that, while the same actions may support more than one charge, they may do so only if the charges constitute separate offenses with separate elements of proof<span class="Italic">. Langham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 268 &#x00B6; 13 (2002). Otherwise, the two charges duplicate each other and merge into a single charge<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00B6; 14. In this case, we see no basis on which the agency could have sustained the charge of conduct unbecoming a federal employee in the absence of proof of the other charge. We therefore find that the former charge has merged into the latter, and we have considered the allegations as a single charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the unbecoming conduct charged may be based on actions that could be criminal, the criminal disposition of the matter is not dispositive of the civil service case, even though material compiled in a criminal investigation is relied on as evidence supporting the adverse action, <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-15-0206-I-1 (NP 4/21/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also disputes the charge based upon an assertion that he was not criminally prosecuted for his actions as alleged in the conduct unbecoming charge. He alleges that the prosecuting attorney refused <span id="Page_3212"></span>to pursue the criminal case because of scant evidence. However, it is undisputed that the appellant was criminally charged and his case was referred to a pre-trial intervention program. Although the appellant characterizes this resolution differently on review, his testimony suggests that he agreed to the pre-trial intervention program as a way to conclude the matter because the state was otherwise unwilling to drop the case. Moreover, the resolution of his criminal charge is not dispositive; the Board has upheld conduct unbecoming charges in similar circumstances. <span class="Italic">See generally Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190 (finding good cause to remove an administrative law judge for a charge of conduct unbecoming, where the underlying off-duty misconduct resulted in an arrest, but the prosecutor entered a <span class="Italic">nolle prosequi</span> on the criminal charges).</p>
