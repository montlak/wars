<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-617"><span class="space">a.</span> Negotiable Provisions</h5>
<p class="noindent">It was negotiable to require that performance standards make allowances for factors beyond the control of the employee. The proposal set a nonquantitative, general test for development of standards. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3804 and FDIC, Chicago Region</span>, 7 FLRA 217, 223-25 (1981) (Proposal 2); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1974 and VA Reg'l Office, Portland</span>, 46 FLRA 1170, 1171 (1993) (Proposal 1 was negotiable arrangement: "In applying the new performance standards, allowance shall be made for factors beyond the employee's control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the use of annual, sick and administrative leave, additional work assignments, processing delays by others and understaffing of positions."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2849 and OPM, New York Reg'l Office</span>, 7 FLRA 571, 575-76 (1982) (negotiable as an arrangement Proposal 3: "Standards of performance will make allowances for factors beyond the control of the employee.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 34, 36-37 (1993), allowed as a negotiable arrangement Provision 11, that "no employee shall be held responsible for matters beyond his control":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e consider whether the disputed sentence excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work. This requires a balancing of the benefits to employees provided by the disputed sentence against the burden on the exercise of management's rights<span class="Italic">. KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-32. Employees whose performance ratings could be adversely affected by matters beyond their control would benefit from the disputed sentence because such matters would not be considered in evaluating their performance. As a result, the disputed sentence ensures that employees' evaluations will not be negatively affected by matters beyond their control. This benefit is significant for employees because performance appraisals, in addition to their use as a basis for awards and promotions, also may result in demotions suspensions, removals, and other negative personnel actions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the burden placed on the Agency to avoid appraising employees on matters outside their control is slight. Initially, we note that the Agency retains discretion to establish performance elements and standards reflecting the work for which employees are responsible. In this regard, we note that management is required to evaluate an employee against the employee's performance elements and standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(b) ("An employee must be appraised on each critical and non-critical element in the employee's performance plan"). The disputed sentence does not affect that obligation. Accordingly, we find that the requirement in the disputed sentence puts a slight, but acceptable, burden on management. Finally, we note that the disputed sentence of Provision 11 benefits both management and employees by, in effect, requiring that those elements of performance for which an employee is responsible be clearly defined and that performance evaluations reflect employees' accomplishments in comparison with applicable performance standards.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that required management not to cause disadvantage to employees who dealt with claimants or beneficiaries whose primary language was not English. The proposal addressed the consequences arising from the nature of the work assigned. The proposal was similar to those requiring that performance standards make allowances for factors beyond the control of the employee, just a more specific description of the fair and equitable criterion FLRA approved in the past as an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of a reserved right. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Gen. Comm. of AFGE for SSA Locals and SSA</span>, 23 FLRA 329, 337-38 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Vallejo Dist. Office</span>, 35 FLRA 1276, 1278-82 (1990), declared negotiable: Proposal 1, establishing a list of types of claims that required additional processing time, and requiring management to consider the additional time necessary to process those claims; Proposal 2, establishing as factors outside the control of the employee for purposes of implementation of local numeric performance standards: timing of delivery of documents, the time a document sits on a supervisor's desk, time lost when computers suffer downtime, delays caused by transfers of folders from one office to another; Proposal 3, requiring consideration of factors beyond employees' control that included leave, details, training preparation, bilingual duties, teletype errors, abnormal amounts of time in conference with management, union official time. FLRA explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Proposals which include criteria governing the content of performance standards and critical elements are nonnegotiable because they directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and to assign work....

<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 1, 2, and 3 identify certain events or processes which either involve longer-than-normal processing time or are beyond the control of the affected employees.

<p class="noindent-1">The proposals would not obligate the Agency to change any of its existing performance standards and would not inhibit the Agency in promulgating new standards.&#x2003;The proposals, moreover, would not require the Agency to revise any performance evaluations based on the identified events or processes.

Advancing its analysis a tad, in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 40 FLRA 570, 570-71 (1991), a proposal was negotiable, drafted to benefit union representatives:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To ameliorate the adverse impact on a union representative's ability to meet performance standards while performing authorized representational activity as well as the adverse impact on employees caused by a representative's inability to perform representational activities without such consideration, the employer will not place the representative at a disadvantage in appraising performance due to this time spent performing representational activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Authorized time spent performing Union representational functions will not be considered as a negative factor when evaluating any critical or non-critical element.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;For example, if a union representative has spent 30 percent of a work period on official time, annual leave or LWOP performing union duties, this fact will be considered in the application of elements and performance standards to produce a fair and equitable result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;Additionally, if an employee is performing representational functions that result in frequent interruptions of normal work, this will also be taken into account when evaluating the employee to produce a fair and reasonable result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;Reasonable accommodation will be made in the appraisal process of union representatives to allow for their use of official time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, determined that the proposal concerned only application of performance standards, 40 FLRA at 574-79:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Proposals which restrict an agency's authority to determine the content of critical elements and performance standards directly interfere with management's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, proposals governing only the application of performance standards and critical elements do not conflict with management's right to direct employees and to assign work.... Accordingly, the task in deciding the negotiability of Proposal 1 "is primarily one of deciding, based on the record, whether it concerns substantive matters, such as the content of performance standards and critical elements, or whether it concerns the application of those standards and elements and other nonsubstantive matters such as procedures."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he introductory paragraph would require management to modify the levels of productivity and timeliness established for employee Union representatives in light of the time spent on Union activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, by requiring the Agency to modify its critical elements and performance standards so as to accommodate an employee's use of official time, the introductory paragraph of Proposal 1 directly interferes with the agency's rights to direct employees and assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ections [B-E], when read together, would require the Agency to apply established elements and standards in a way that affects the content of the standards.

<p class="noindent-1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appropriate Arrangements</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is foreseeable that an employee Union representative's use of official time could adversely affect the employee's ability to fulfill the requirements of his/her performance standards, and, in turn, could result in a lower performance appraisal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he burden placed on the Agency and the Agency's exercise of its management rights by Proposal 1 is minimal. The proposal seeks to protect employees engaged in representational activities against performance evaluations which fail to take into consideration a limitation on their ability to meet the performance standards for their position which results from the use of authorized official time, annual leave, or leave without pay. The proposal does not seek to protect employees against the consequence of poor performance, however. In this regard, the proposal would not affect or inhibit the Agency's ability to assess and evaluate Union representative's job performance and take personnel actions based on that assessment and evaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, it is not apparent to us, and the Agency does not assert, that the Agency has an interest in evaluating performance without regard to time authorized for representational activities.... The proposal would not...enable an employee to evade or otherwise frustrate application of performance standards and elements through the unauthorized use of official time or leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the proposal does not dictate or mandate that employee Union representatives receive any particular performance rating. The proposal only requires that the Agency evaluate job performance in light of the amount of time authorized to be spent by employees on representational activities. Provided the Agency does so, the Agency is free to assign any performance rating to those employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the specific constraints imposed by the proposal do not appear to be unreasonable or difficult to administer.... We find nothing in these provisions which would unreasonably burden the exercise of the Agency's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, by ensuring that employees engaged in representational activities will not be penalized because of such activity, Proposal 1 offers a significant benefit to such employees and to all other employees. In particular, Union representatives may engage in representational activities without fear that so doing will endanger their performance evaluations.... These effects should also positively impact upon all other employees, who benefit from such representation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the Agency's contention that the proposal is nonnegotiable on the basis that its inclusion in a collective bargaining agreement would subject the content of performance standards to arbitral review. The Agency's assertion that an arbitrator's judgment may be substituted for its own is not a basis for finding a proposal to be nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> [<span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, SSA</span>,] <span class="Italic">OHA</span>, 39 FLRA at 350 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 47 FLRA 10, 61-62 (1993) (approving as negotiable arrangement Provision 26: "No examiner shall be prejudiced by the fact that he or she is directed or authorized (including authorization by contract) to spend time performing non-examining activities.").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA ruled negotiable as an arrangement Proposal 2 in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 40 FLRA 570, 579, 582-83 (1991), requiring that "[i]n the application of standards to individual employees, the Employer will take into account mitigating factors such as availability of resources, lack of training, or frequent, authorized interruption of normal work duties":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t is foreseeable that employees could be adversely affected by performance evaluations which are based, even in part, on performance which is affected by matters over which the employees have no control....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the burden placed on the exercise of the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work by Proposal 2 is minimal. The proposal applies only to matters over which an employee has no control and only to the extent that the mitigating factors are involved in an employee's performance. Management has, and retains, the prerogative to ensure that resources are available to employees, that adequate training is provided to them, and that employees are not confronted with authorized interruptions of their work duties. Moreover, the proposal does not dictate to the Agency what its performance standards, critical elements, or performance ratings should be. Instead, the proposal only requires the Agency to "take into account" the specified factors when evaluating employees against their performance standards. If the Agency does so, the Agency is free to reach any conclusion which is otherwise justified in evaluating an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the burden imposed by Proposal 2 on the Agency is minimal, the proposal offers significant benefits to employees. By requiring that Agency management "take into account" mitigating factors such as the availability of resources, training, and authorized interruptions of work over which the employee has no control, Proposal 2 helps to ensure <span id="page_1075"></span>that employees' evaluations will be based, as nearly as possible, on those elements of an employee's performance over which the employee has control. Therefore, the proposal provides both employees and the Agency with some assurance that performance evaluations accurately reflect accurate performance. We note, in this regard, that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) requires the development of performance standards which will "to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance...."</p>
