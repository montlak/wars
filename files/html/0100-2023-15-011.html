<p class="Body-Text">If an individual cannot work for an extended period with no end in sight to the absence, with or without accommodation, the termination of the employee does not constitute disability discrimination, <span class="Italic">Goldsby v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-10-0161-I-2 (NP 7/13/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge analyzed the charge of excessive absence from duty using the proper framework. <span class="Italic">See Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also McCauley v. Department of the Interior</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6; 12 (2011).[2] Specifically, the criteria for bringing an adverse action based on excessive use of approved leave are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1) the appellant was absent for reasons beyond her control so that the agency's approval or disapproval of the leave was immaterial because the appellant could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the appellant that an adverse action could be taken unless she became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Based on our review of the record, the agency satisfied these criteria.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">McCauley</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 484, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, the Board concluded that it was appropriate to consider an employee's use of leave without pay, annual leave, or sick leave to demonstrate that her absences were excessive, but it was improper to consider absences pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) as part of that analysis. The administrative judge specifically noted in the initial decision that she did not consider the appellant's FMLA absences in her analysis of her charge. <span class="Italic">See Goldsby v. Department of the Air Force</span>, M.S.P.B. Docket No. DA-0752-10-0161-I-2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the appellant's undisputed numerous absences, over a period of many months, coupled with the fact that her absences appeared to continue with no end in sight, the agency had warned the appellant that an adverse action might be initiated unless she became available for full-time duty, and the agency indicated in the proposal and decision letters that it needed the position to be filled,[4] we discern no error with the administrative judge's decision to sustain the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although the appellant claimed below that her position was not filled, she offered no evidence in support of that assertion, and the agency did not indicate that her position remained unfilled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for her failure to accommodate claim, the administrative judge noted that, in its March 23, 2009 letter, the agency informed the appellant that it needed additional medical documentation regarding her restrictions, and that such documentation should:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">specifically include information such as the history of your medical conditions, clinical findings from your most recent medical evaluations, an assessment of your current clinical status and plans for future treatment, a diagnosis, an estimation of the expected date of full or partial recovery, an explanation of the impact of your medical condition on life activities both on and off the job, and a narrative explanation of the medical basis for a conclusion that your medical condition has or has not become static or well stabilized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further noted that the appellant's medical documentation (mostly in the form of Work Status reports from January 2, 2008, until March 30, 2009) are in the record, and were the result of injuries that she suffered (or prior injuries that were aggravated) after her December 28, 2007 fall in the workplace.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a federal employee, the appellant's claim arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. However, the regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act, and they are applied to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 36 n.3 (2007); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which liberalized the definition of disability, became effective on January 1, 2009. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008), codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> The ADAAA defines "disability" to mean: "a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual; a record of such an impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3))." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(1)(A)-(C). "Major Life Activities" is defined in general to include, but not limited to, "caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, seeing, hearing, eating, sleeping, walking, standing, lifting, bending, speaking, breathing, learning, reading, concentrating, thinking, communicating, and working." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12102(2)(A). The ADAAA prohibits discrimination "against a qualified individual on the basis of disability in regard to job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). The ADAAA further defines "qualified individual," in part, to mean "an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires." <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical documentation in the record includes earlier reports, from approximately January 2008, indicating that the appellant was incapacitated and also that she was temporarily totally disabled. For instance, in a January 29, 2008 letter, John W. Ellis, M.D., diagnosed the appellant with blunt trauma injury to abdomen, recurrence of hiatal hernia secondary to the blunt trauma injury to the abdomen, cervical radiculitis, thoracic sprain/strain, lumbar strain/sprain, and bilateral carpel tunnel syndrome. He stated that she was temporarily totally disabled and would "remain so until further diagnostics are completed." Subsequent Work Status reports stated that the appellant remained temporarily totally disabled and unable to return to work until August 6, <span id="Page_2444"></span>2008, at which time she was allowed to "return to work under permanent restrictions, for 0-8 hours per day." However, there were no permanent restrictions identified. In an August 19, 2008 letter, Dr. Ellis stated that the appellant should return to work with previous permanent restrictions, she may work 0-8 hours per day, but also that she needed a printer on her desk (to minimize excessive walking and aggravation of her injury) and a heater at her desk (to provide ambient temperatures in her environment). The remainder of the appellant's Work Status reports only indicated that the appellant's current--and generally unidentified--restrictions were in place, and the last report, dated March 30, 2009, stated that "until the [patient] has her surgery done, her restrictions are pending."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears, however, that the appellant became temporarily totally disabled from April 14, 2009, through October 15, 2009. She was then apparently released to full duty work by Dr. Philip J. Miner, Jr. on October 16, 2009, after she received the notice of proposed separation. She subsequently "suffered some kind of a physical traumatic spasm to her body," which resulted in another emergency room visit, she returned to work on October 19, 2009, and Dr. Ellis "relieved her of her duties indefinitely." Indeed, Dr. Ellis stated that the appellant was temporarily totally disabled as of October 24, 2009, and would continue to be so until further evaluation and treatment has been completed, and he could not provide a time frame for when she could return to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">She also stated in her Preliminary Statement--seemingly for the first time--that she "will need her own office with all the necessary accommodations so she is able to work with her disability," including a computer with speech recognition software, a suitable desk, chair, and heater.[6] At some point, the appellant also appeared to have requested telework. The appellant, however, provided no additional medical documentation to support such an accommodation request (other than her request for a heater) or to otherwise identify any of the other permanent restrictions that Dr. Ellis had put in place during the 2008-09 timeframe.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;She also apparently wrote an October 20, 2009 letter to the agency, presumably in response to the notice of proposed separation, in which she mentioned that she needed to find another position that would accommodate her with her workers' compensation limitations; however, there are no workers' compensation documents in the record below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we assume, for the purposes of our analysis, that the appellant had at least one physical impairment that substantially limited the major life activity of working, she could not be considered a qualified individual because there is no evidence that she could perform the essential functions of her position with or without a reasonable accommodation. Indeed, there is no documentation in the record showing that she could return to work with or without any accommodations between October 24, 2009, and November 21, 2009, the effective date of her separation, or how long her status would remain this way. Moreover, even if we credit the appellant's contention that she made both written and oral accommodation requests, which triggered the agency's obligation to engage in the interactive process, the appellant also had an obligation to provide medical documentation to the agency to support her requests, she was aware of this obligation, and she failed to provide relevant documentation in this regard (with the exception of Dr. Ellis's request for a printer and heater on her behalf). The appellant's failure to provide such documentation supports our conclusion that she did not prove her failure to accommodate claim. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 18 (2010) (concluding that the "agency engaged in good faith in the required interactive process to determine an accommodation, but that the appellant was not responsive to the agency's requests for medical information and never articulated a reasonable accommodation, including identifying any position to which he could have been reassigned," and finding that the appellant did not prove that he was denied a reasonable accommodation, among other things). For these reasons, we affirm the administrative judge's decision regarding this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant complained below that "three (3) white employees of the agency have been allowed extensive sick time off from work without harassment or punishment." She alleged that these three individuals were, respectively, allowed to be off work from January 2009 until February 2010; allowed sick leave and to work at home; and allegedly paid overtime to work at home. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant also indicated in a subsequent filing that there was another male white employee, who was injured at home, and who was in a wheelchair, but the agency allowed him to come into the office and sit for 8 hours per day. The administrative judge provided notice of the appellant's burden of proof for a discrimination claim based on disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first three employees, the administrative noted that the appellant's submissions "did not indicate what positions the three comparators occupied, their supervisory chains, whether they were charged with excessive absences or AWOL, their lengths of service, their injuries, or any other information to show that the three employees were similarly situated to the appellant." The administrative judge was not persuaded by the appellant's other allegations, noting that the appellant did not identify the other white employee, his position, supervisor or any factual details concerning the absences. Because the appellant submitted no evidence to show that those individuals were similarly situated to her or that they received more favorable treatment than she received, coupled with the fact that the sustained charge against the appellant constituted a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason fortaking the removal action, the administrative judge concluded that she did not meet her burden to prove disparate treatment discrimination based on color or disability. In her petition for review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's analysis in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error with the administrative judge's analysis of this claim. Although the Board has held that comparator evidence is not the only basis upon which to establish a disparate treatment claim, <span class="Italic">see Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2010), here, the appellant has identified only comparator evidence as the basis for her claim of disparate treatment, and her evidence was not persuasive. Accordingly, we affirm the administrative judge's decision regarding this claim.</p>
