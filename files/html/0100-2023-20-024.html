<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 2302(b), it is a prohibited personnel practice to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(9)&#x2003;take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General (or any other component responsible for internal investigation or review) of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disclosures to an inspector general are protected if other IRA conditions are met. Cooperation with an inspector general is covered under 5 USC 2302(b)(9), but not under the whistleblower provision, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Under <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 114 MSPR 155, 159 n.1, 2010 MSPB 106 (2010) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DA-1221-11-0224-B-1 (NP 6/18/2103)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's claim that the appellant's actions are not protected by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because another provision, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), prohibits retaliation for cooperating with an IG investigation. While it is true that &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) prohibits retaliation on that basis, <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 229, 230 (1994), &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) also prohibits such retaliation if the disclosures made to the IG rise to the level of whistleblowing, <span class="Italic">Schlosser,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. at 21. We have found that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he made protected disclosures because he reasonably believed that the agency's actions with regard to Eclipse Aviation evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation and a substantial and specific danger to public safety.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alfredson v.

Dept. of Army</span>, AT-1221-20-0167-W-1 (NP 11/16/2022) ("Regardless of the content of the disclosure itself, section 2302(b)(9)(C) protects disclosures of information to the Inspector General, and the Board has recognized that disclosures to the OIG are protected. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Corthell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The first basis for the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to make a protected disclosure is that the appellant did not make disclosures; rather than coming forward on his own initiative, the appellant merely cooperated with an investigation when the IG came to question him about information pertaining to possible falsification of travel orders by David Miller, the comptroller of the region to which the appellant was assigned. The text of the WPA speaks in terms of "any disclosure." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). The statute makes no distinction based on who initiated the conversation that led to the disclosures. Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has stated that "the plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for 'any disclosure,' regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made." <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Further, the Board has held that an appellant is entitled to protection under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) as well as &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) for his participation in an IG interview, and that "[t]he difference between sections 2302(b)(8) and 2302(b)(9)...is not whether the employee or the IG makes the initial contact but whether the disclosures made to the [O]IG rise to the level of whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">Schlosser v.

DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 39 (2022)), determined that an IRA case may be based on the initiation of an IG complaint or management's perception that the appellant made a complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case differs from the typical IRA appeal in that the appellant alleges that the agency took personnel actions against him in part because of his protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), but also in part because of its mistaken belief that he engaged in activity protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) by reporting matters to his agency's OIG. Under the latter provision, it is a prohibited personnel practice for an agency to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of...cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). We have not yet had the opportunity to address whether an appellant may seek corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) based on a claim of reprisal for perceived 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) activity. For the reasons discussed below, we find that the Board is authorized to consider such a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the statute speaks to the motivation of the agency, forbidding the agency to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee or applicant for employment because of "cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector <span id="Page_3667"></span>General of an agency." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). It does not specify that the appellant actually must have engaged in the protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) that motivated the agency. As to the Board's jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) provides that, if the jurisdictional requirements are otherwise met, an employee may seek corrective action before the Board with respect to any personnel action taken against that individual "as a result of <span class="Italic">a</span> prohibited personnel practice" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) (emphasis added). Thus, the statute does not require specifically that the prohibited personnel practice for which the appellant seeks corrective action involve a protected disclosure or protected activity on the part of the appellant. We find nothing in the legislative history of the WPA, which introduced 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), or the WPEA, which extended the protections of the WPA to activity described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C), to suggest that Congress intended a narrower reading.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 112-155 at 1, which states that the WPEA "will strengthen the rights and protections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more effectively help root out waste, fraud and abuse in the federal government."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, a broad reading of the statute would harmonize with our existing case law holding that the protections of the WPA may be available to employees who did not make protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2303(b)(8), but were perceived as having done so. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2011). For example, we have found that the WPA may cover a "mistaken identity" scenario, in which the relevant agency official believed the appellant made disclosures that were in fact made by another individual. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 274, 276, 278-80 (1990). As we explained in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Department of the Navy</span>, failure to provide an employee with the protections of the WPA in such circumstances would discourage other employees from make protected disclosures, and such a chilling effect would contravene the purpose of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 278-79. Similarly, we find that to exclude from the Board's jurisdiction claims of reprisal based on perceived 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) activity would defeat the purpose of the statute by discouraging other employees from engaging in activity which Congress has found to be in the public interest. Although the protection in section 2309(b)(9) is for the activity of going to the OIG, it is actually the equivalent of protecting disclosures to the OIG. Given that the Board has long decided to protect disclosures it would be inconsistent not to protect this disclosure/activity as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) authorizes the Board to consider a request for corrective action where the appellant alleges that the agency <a href="https://c1.staticsfly.com/asset/fetch/emb_elnr_k/emb.preview/v3 violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C)">https://c1.staticsfly.com/asset/fetch/emb_elnr_k/emb.preview/v3 violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C)</a> by taking or failing to take a personnel action based on its perception that he engaged in activity protected under that statute. As with a claim of reprisal for perceived whistleblowing, the Board will not inquire regarding whether the appellant actually engaged in the protected activity; rather, the issue of whether the agency perceived the appellant to have engaged in the protected activity will stand in for that portion of the analysis at both the jurisdictional and merits stage of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 8 (describing the analysis to be applied in a claim of retaliation for perceived whistleblowing).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to December 12, 2017, the whistleblower protection statutory scheme provided that "cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law," is protected. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted above, the appellant made purported disclosures to his supervisors, the EEO Office, and under the agency's Harassing Conduct Policy. All of the events relevant to this appeal occurred prior to the 2018 NDAA's enactment.

<p class="Block-Quote2">When a case implicates a [F]ederal statute enacted after the events in suit, the court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed the statute's proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed. If the statute would operate retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to December 12, 2017, the whistleblower protection statutory scheme provided that "cooperating with or disclosing information to the Inspector General of an agency, or the Special Counsel, in accordance with applicable provisions of law," is protected. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C) (2016); <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 33.

Edwards,2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 29. Although all of the relevant events in this appeal occurred after the December 12, 2017 enactment date of the NDAA, neither the administrative judge, nor the parties, addressed whether the appellant's administrative grievances fell within the expanded scope of this subsection. Therefore, we do so here. <span class="Italic">See Parrish</span>, 485 F.3d at 1362 (finding that the Board is obligated to determine its jurisdiction over an appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3668"></span>The legislative history of the NDAA does not define the scope of the expanded section 2302(b)(9)(C), and the term "component responsible for internal investigation or review" is not defined elsewhere in the statute. It is unnecessary to define the term here because we can make our finding on narrower grounds. We are guided by the principle that the provisions of a statute should be read together to avoid rendering any provision inoperative or superfluous. <span class="Italic">Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 815 F.2d 668, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1987). lAs previously discussed, section 2302(b)(9)(A) prohibits retaliation for the "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--(i) with regard to remedying a violation of [section 2302(b)(8)]; or (ii) other than with regard to remedying a violation of [section 2302(b)(8)]." We do not read section 2302(b)(9)(C) to include disclosures made in the course of an administrative grievance, the same activity protected under (b)(9)(A), because doing so would effectively subsume all or part of (b)(9)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This determination is consistent with prior interpretations of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b). The Board and the Federal Circuit have declined to interpret the provisions of section 2302(b)(8) and (b)(9) as overlapping. For example, the Federal Circuit held that an employee's disclosure made during the course of his EEO complaint can only be protected under section 2302(b)(9)(A), and not (b)(8), reasoning in part that reading the two subsections as covering the same activity "would render &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A) largely irrelevant, if not completely superfluous." <span class="Italic">See Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 690-91 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, 815 F.2d at 674). Similarly, the Board determined that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) did not protect an appellant from reprisal for disclosures made during an internal agency grievance. <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 587-88. The Board explained that there would be no need for section 2302(b)(9) protections if it interpreted (b)(8) to override and make redundant the provisions of (b)(9). <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. at 587-88. We likewise find that the appellant's disclosures, made in his administrative grievances, are not protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(C), because to find otherwise would render (b)(9)(A) irrelevant and superfluous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the history of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 supports the conclusion that Congress did not intend activity protected under section 2302(b)(9)(C) to overlap with (b)(9)(A). Prior to the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A), 126 Stat. 1465 (codified in pertinent part at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a)), (WPEA), the Board's IRA jurisdiction only extended to protected disclosures under section 2302(b)(8), and not to any of the protected activities identified in (b)(9). The Federal Circuit cautioned against "read[ing] the scope of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) as including [protected] activities squarely within &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)," observing that doing so "would have the effect of reversing this carefully considered Congressional decision" to exclude protected activities, including activities under section 2302(b)(9), from the Board's jurisdiction at that time. <span class="Italic">Spruill</span>, 978 F.2d at 690-91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA expanded the Board's jurisdiction over IRA appeals to include, as relevant here, activity protected under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), but not (b)(9)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 7 (recognizing this expansion to the Board's jurisdiction as to section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), but not (b)(9)(A)(ii)). As noted earlier, the Board does not have jurisdiction over claims of reprisal for activity protected under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii), i.e., a grievance an employee files on his own behalf that does not seek to remedy whistleblower reprisal like the ones at issue here. 5 U.S.C. 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Mudd</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">cf.

The parties do not dispute the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's grievances fell into this category and therefore outside the Board's jurisdiction under section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i). We decline to read the new language in section 2302(b)(9)(C) to include claims covered by (b)(9)(A)(ii). Doing so would render the deliberate distinction between section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) and (b)(9)(A)(ii) activity meaningless. It would also effectively subsume section 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii) into (b)(9)(C). <span class="Italic">See Horner</span>, 815 F.2d at 674. Accordingly, because the appellant's claims fall within the scope of section 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii), they cannot fall within the scope of (b)(9)(C). As a result, we find that he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that his grievances are protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(C). Based on the above analysis, we deny the appellant's petition for review and find that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this IRA appeal.[7]</p>
