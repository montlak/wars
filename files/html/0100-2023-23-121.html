<p class="Body-Text">Even if back pay is based on a finding of discrimination, taxes should be withheld. "Damages" under the civil rights laws may or may not be exempt from taxation, depending on what the damages are for. The law is changes. Current law must examined with care to avoid tax problems. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reese v. United States</span>, 24 F.3d 228 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 541, 545 (1992) (relying on <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1867 (1992)). A broad tax exemption for damages described in Revenue Ruling 93-88 was suspended by IRS Notice 95-45 (August 3, 1995). The IRS Notice was issued after <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Schleier</span>, 115 S. Ct. 2159 (1995). Then Congress amended the tax code. The IRS provides in its Revenue Ruling 96-65 that back pay is taxable, as are some forms of damages [readers should check for more current IRS guidance]:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DAMAGES RECEIVED ON ACCOUNT OF PERSONAL INJURIES OR SICKNESS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Published: December 30, 1996</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">ISSUE</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Are amounts received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended in 1991 (Title VII), excludable from gross income under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">LAW AND ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, &#x00A7; 61(a) provides that, except as otherwise provided by law, gross income includes all income from whatever source derived.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 104(a)(2), as amended by &#x00A7; 1605 of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act), 110 Stat. 1755, 1838, provides generally that gross income does not include the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness. Section 104(a) further provides that, for purposes of paragraph (2), emotional distress is not treated as a physical injury or physical sickness except to the extent of damages paid for medical care (described in &#x00A7; 213(d)(1)(A) or (B)) attributable to emotional distress. The 1996 Act amendments to &#x00A7; 104(a) apply to amounts received after August 20, 1996, but not to amounts received under a written binding agreement, court decree, or mediation award in effect on (or issued on or before) September 13, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before its amendment by the 1996 Act, former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) provided generally that gross income does not include the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or agreement) on account of personal injuries or sickness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1.104-1(c) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the term "damages received (whether by suit or agreement)" means an amount received (other than workmen's compensation) through prosecution of a legal suit or action based upon tort or tort type rights, or through a settlement agreement entered into in lieu of such prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229 (1992), the Supreme Court held that back pay received for disparate impact gender discrimination under Title VII was not excludable from gross income as damages received on account of personal injuries under former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) because that part of Title VII did not compensate for a broad range of traditional tort harms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of Burke, the Service issued Rev. Rul. 93-88, 1993-2 C.B. 61, which holds that compensatory damages and back pay are excludable from gross income as damages for personal injury under former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) when received for: (1) disparate treatment gender discrimination under Title VII, as amended in 1991; (2) racial discrimination under &#x00A7; 16 of the Civil Rights Act of 1870, 42 USC &#x00A7; 1981 and Title VII; and (3) disparate treatment discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101-12213, as amended in 1991. All three of these statutes provide a broad range of compensatory damages of the type the Supreme Court focused upon in Burke.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Schleier,</span> 515 U.S. [323], 115 S. Ct. 2159 (1995), the Supreme Court held that back pay and liquidated damages received to settle a claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 621-634 (ADEA), are not excludable from gross income under former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). The Court concluded that former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) and its regulations set forth two requirements for a recovery to be excludable from gross income: (1) it must be based on tort or tort type rights, and (2) it must be received "on account of personal injuries or sickness." The Court held that back pay and liquidated damages received under the ADEA meet neither requirement because (1) the ADEA does not compensate for any of the other traditional tort harms associated with personal injury, (2) the back pay is completely independent of the existence or extent of any personal injury, and (3) the ADEA liquidated damages are punitive in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on Schleier, Notice 95-45, 1995-2 C.B. 330, suspended Rev. Rul. 93-88, and added section 5.05 to Rev. Proc. 95-3, 1995-1 C.B. 385, to provide that pending issuance of published guidance, the Service will not issue rulings or determination letters on whether amounts received are excludable from gross income under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) in situations affected by Schleier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of <span class="Italic">Schleier</span>, and the amendment of &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) by the 1996 Act, the Internal Revenue Service has reconsidered Rev. Rul. 93-88.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">HOLDINGS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;Current &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). Back pay received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII is not excludable from gross income under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) because it is completely independent of, and thus is not damages received on account of, personal physical injuries or physical sickness under that section. Similarly, amounts received for emotional distress in satisfaction of such a claim are not excludable from gross income under &#x00A7; 104(a)(2), except to the extent they are damages paid for medical care (as described in &#x00A7; 213(d)(1)(A) or (B)) attributable to emotional distress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2). Back pay received in satisfaction of a claim for denial of a promotion due to disparate treatment employment discrimination under Title VII is not excludable from gross income under former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) because it is completely independent of, and thus is not damages received on account of, personal injuries or sickness under that section. However, damages received for emotional distress in satisfaction of such a claim are excludable from gross income under former &#x00A7; 104(a)(2) because they are received "on account of personal injuries or sickness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Wages and compensation. Back pay includible in gross income <span id="Page_4963"></span>under Holding (1) or (2) is "wages" for purposes of &#x00A7; 3121 (Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)), &#x00A7; 3306 (Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA)), and &#x00A7; 3401 (federal income tax withholding), and is "compensation" for purposes of &#x00A7; 3231 (Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">EFFECT ON OTHER DOCUMENTS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rev. Rul. 93-88 is obsoleted. Notice 95-45 is superseded. Rev. Rul. 72-341, 1972-2 C.B. 32, and Rev.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the authority contained in &#x00A7; 7805(b), this revenue ruling will not apply adversely to damages received under any provision of law providing tort or tort type remedies for employment discrimination for race, color, religion, gender, national origin, or other similar classifications, if the damages are received (1) on or before June 14, 1995, the date that <span class="Italic">Schleier</span> was decided by the Supreme Court, or (2) pursuant to a written binding agreement, court decree, or mediation award in effect on (or issued on or before) June 14, 1995.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C. Circuit weighed in during 2006 with a decision, based on constitutional grounds, determining that compensatory damages received under various whistleblowing statutes were not taxable as income. The scope of the decision, <span class="Italic">Murphy v. IRS</span>, 460 F.3d 79 (D.C. Cir. 2006), and its applicability in the typical federal sector Title VII or IRA case, remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For tax ramifications of damage awards or back pay civil service or EEO cases, consult a tax lawyer or CPA. A decision from the Tax Court illustrates the problem, <span class="Italic">McKinney v. IRS</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/intco20170105f20">T.C. Memo. 2017-6</a> (Docket 9512015) (T.C. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent determined a deficiency in petitioner's 2011 Federal income tax of $9,843.1 The issue for decision is whether $40,000 of settlement proceeds that petitioner received under a settlement agreement and release (settlement agreement) with her former employer, the U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey (Agency), is excludable from her gross income under section 104(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some of the facts are stipulated and are so found. The stipulation of facts and the attached exhibits are incorporated herein by this reference. Petitioner resided in Massachusetts when the petition was filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner was an employee of Agency from 1974 until her retirement on July 3, 2009. On May 20, 2009, petitioner filed a complaint of discrimination (complaint) with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Agency alleging discrimination and a hostile work environment on the bases of age and physical disability. After her retirement, petitioner expanded the bases of her complaint to include constructive discharge and thereafter filed an appeal of her claims with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 12, 2011, petitioner and Agency entered into a settlement agreement pursuant to which she agreed to withdraw her complaint and appeal before the MSPB, and Agency agreed to pay her a lump sum of $40,000. The settlement agreement states that petitioner "agrees to be responsible for the tax consequences of the lump sum payment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 14, 2012, Agency filed with the Internal Revenue Service Form 1099-MISC, Miscellaneous Income, for tax year 2011 reporting the payment of $40,000 of nonemployee compensation to petitioner. Petitioner timely filed her 2011 Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, and on April 15, 2013, filed Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, amending her initial return for tax year 2011. Petitioner failed to report receipt of the $40,000 lump-sum payment on either filed return.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 7, 2015, respondent sent petitioner a notice of deficiency for tax year 2011 determining a deficiency of $9,843 because of petitioner's failure to report the $40,000 lump-sum payment as income. Petitioner timely filed a petition for redetermination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 61(a) defines "gross income" as "all income from whatever source derived." Exclusions from gross income must be narrowly construed. <span class="Italic">Commissioner v. Schleier</span>, 515 U.S. 323, 328 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229, 248 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring)). Section 104(a)(2) provides that "gross income does not include * * * the amount of any damages * * * received * * * on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of determining whether damages received pursuant to a written settlement agreement are excludable under section 104(a)(2), we look to the nature of the claim settled. <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, 504 U.S. at 237. The nature of the claim is determined first by looking to the settlement agreement itself for indicia of its purpose. <span class="Italic">Greer v. United States</span>, 207 F.3d 322, 329 (6th Cir. 2000). Where the settlement agreement lacks express statements of purpose, we then look beyond the agreement to other evidence indicating the "intent of the payor as to the purpose in making the payment" such as, but not limited to, the amount paid, the factual circumstances that led to the settlement agreement, and the allegations in the payee's complaint and amended complaint. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Knuckles v. Commissioner</span>, 349 F.2d 610, 613 (10th Cir. 1965), <span class="Italic">aff'g</span> T.C. Memo. 1964-33); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Commissioner</span>, 102 T.C. 116, 127 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part, rev'd in part, and remanded on another issue</span>, 70 F.3d 34 (5th Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commissioner's determination in a notice of deficiency is presumed correct, and the taxpayer bears the burden of proving that the determination is erroneous. Rule 142(a); <span class="Italic">Welch v. Helvering</span>, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933). If the taxpayer presents objective and credible evidence of the payor's intent, the burden of proof may shift to the Commissioner. Sec. 7491(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement between petitioner and Agency does not provide any indicia as to whether the $40,000 payment, or any portion thereof, was made pursuant to a claim of personal physical injuries or physical sickness. Further, notwithstanding her testimony, petitioner has not satisfied her burden of introducing objective and credible evidence that the $40,000 payment was made "in lieu" of damages for personal physical injuries or physical sickness. <span class="Italic">See Simpson v. Commissioner</span>, 141 T.C. 331, 339-340 (2013) (quoting <span class="Italic">Fono v. Commissioner</span>, 79 T.C. 680, 692 (1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd without published opinion</span>, 749 F.2d 37 (9th Cir 1984)), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, __ F. App'x __, 2016 WL 4207982 (9th Cir. Aug. 10, 2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the damages Agency paid petitioner as part of the settlement agreement were for the resolution and withdrawal of her constructive discharge and discrimination claims and not on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness. Therefore, the $40,000 payment she received pursuant to the settlement agreement is includible in her income for 2011 and is not excludable under section 104(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law predating the IRS ruling, the Internal Revenue Code made earnings taxable and excluded from income taxation certain types of damages. In <span class="Italic">Greene v. DHHS</span>, 54 MSPR 163, 170 n.4 (1992), the Board expressed in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> its belief that an award of back pay through a settlement of a case including EEO allegations would not alone qualify as damages, a result consistent with <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 112 S. Ct. 1867 (1992). <span class="Italic">Greene</span> noted that "[a]ny questions about the taxability of the award and accuracy of the amount withheld will ultimately be resolved by the Internal Revenue Service, the agency primarily responsible with such questions." That back pay did not constitute "damages" prior to the IRS ruling just quoted, even it was recovered as a result of a finding of discrimination, was confirmed in <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 541, 545 (1992). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-105.html#sec16-104">Other Deductions</a>," discussing treatment of payment of lump sums for annual leave, recrediting of those sums when removals are reversed, and treatment of ensuing taxation problems; refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-102.html#sec16-101">Tax; Increased Taxes</a>."] As to the taxes on recoveries of counsel fees and costs in cases involving claims of discrimination and whistleblowing reprisal, refer to 26 USC 62 (a)(20 &#x0026; 21) (defining adjusted gross income).</p>
