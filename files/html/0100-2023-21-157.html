<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-155"><span class="space">d.</span> Ambiguous Provision in Divorce Decree; Extrinsic Evidence; Rules of Construction</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A provision for a survivor annuity must be clearly stated in a divorce decree or incorporated settlement, <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. OPM</span>, 122 F.3d 1043, 1045-48 (Fed. Cir. 1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hokanson argues that the board gave the applicable statute and implementing regulations an overly narrow construction and that under a proper construction, the divorce decree adequately provides for a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. The applicable statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) (1994), states in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a] former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subdivision, if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title or in terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute clearly states that a former spouse is not eligible for a survivor annuity unless it is "expressly provided for." The relevant regulations state that for a qualifying court order to affect civil service retirement benefits, it "must divide employee retirement benefits, award a payment from employee retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(a). The regulation continues, stating that "[f]or the purposes of awarding a former spouse annuity, the court order must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity or direct an employee, Member, or retiree to provide a former spouse annuity." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(c)(2). Furthermore, the regulations explicitly state that the term "employee retirement benefits" as used in that subpart "does not include survivor annuities." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1003. The regulations thus specifically distinguish between the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits to a former spouse during the lifetime of the retired federal employee, and the awarding of a survivor annuity to the former spouse payable after the death of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Guidelines For Interpreting State Court Orders Awarding Survivor Annuity Benefits to Former Spouses (Appendix B to Subpart J of Part 838), published in 1990 pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1014, state that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;Except as provided [in] paragraphs B2 through B4, orders must specify the benefit being awarded. Orders must contain language such as "survivor annuity," "death benefits," "former spouse annuity under 5 U.S.C. 8341(h)(1)," etc.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;Orders that provide that the former spouse is to "continue as" or "be named as" the "designated beneficiary" of CSRS [civil service retirement system] benefits will be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;Orders that provide that the former spouse will "continue to receive benefits after the death of" the employee or "that benefits will continue after the death of" the employee, but do not use terms such as "survivor annuity," "death benefits," "former spouse annuity," or similar terms will not be interpreted to award a former spouse annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, an award directing the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits is distinct from, and will not be interpreted as, an award of a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hokanson argues that although the divorce decree did not use the term "survivor annuity," the decree, when read as a whole, adequately manifests an intent to provide her with the government benefits attributable to her contribution to Mr. Hokanson's pension. Citing <span class="Italic">Fox v. OPM</span>, 100 F.3d 141 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 651 (1991), and <span class="Italic">Bliznik v. OPM</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 340 (1993), Ms. Hokanson argues that an award of "retirement benefits" must be viewed as referring to a survivor annuity. We do not agree. The cited cases cannot be read as standing for such a broad proposition. In <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, the "Survivor's benefit plan" in the settlement agreement clearly meant and was therefore construed to include the then-existing survivor annuity that had been previously elected. 100 F.3d at 142-43. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, which of course is not binding on us, the husband had elected to provide the wife with a survivor annuity prior to their divorce. The board held that the property settlement agreement incident to the divorce, which stated that "[t]he Husband agrees to maintain all rights and benefits to which the Wife is entitled and may realize in connection with his retirement and pension package," clearly and unambiguously included the then-existing survivor annuity. 46 M.S.P.R. at 654. Finally, in <span class="Italic">Bliznik</span>, the board recognized that the Bliznik divorce decree expressly distinguished between retirement benefits and survivor benefits by awarding Ms. Bliznik 50% of Mr. Bliznik's retirement annuity and also by awarding her a "lifetime monthly benefit.," i.e., a survivor annuity. 58 M.S.P.R. at 344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hokanson's divorce decree, on the other hand, awarded her a share of her former spouse's retirement benefits. She was to be paid $556.00 per month and the balance of the benefits was to be paid to Mr. Hokanson. The decree does not provide her with a "former spouse annuity," "death benefits," or designate her as the "beneficiary" of any such benefits. Ms. Hokanson argues that her divorce decree "logically must have been meant" to provide a survivor annuity. To the contrary, as Mr. Hokanson was to receive the balance of the annuity, it is clear that the decree did nothing more than divide his retirement annuity. That annuity, including Ms. Hokanson's share, would cease upon his death. Such an award is insufficient to provide Ms. Hokanson with a survivor annuity. Because Ms. Hokanson's husband died prior to retirement, there is no retirement annuity from which to draw her share.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hokanson argues that this result is illogical given the decreeing court's intent to provide her with a share of her former husband's pension benefits, however distributed. Because her former husband will receive no retirement benefits, Ms. Hokanson argues, she is entitled to recover her contributions to her former husband's pension through a former spouse survivor annuity. Thus, the board's and OPM's denial of her request for the annuity, she argues, is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not agree. The statute and regulations are clear. An award of a former spouse survivor annuity must be express. This requirement is not a mere technicality; it provides for a clear allocation of rights between the interested parties. Had Ms. Hokanson been awarded a survivor annuity, her former husband's retirement annuity would have been proportionally decreased. Presumably, Ms. Hokanson's share of the retirement annuity would have been correspondingly reduced during her former husband's lifetime. Additionally, because the combined survivor annuities of a former and current spouse cannot exceed 55% of the federal employee's retirement annuity, an award of a 50% survivor annuity to a former spouse necessarily limits the current spouse to a 5% survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.641. Ms. Hokanson would like us to <span id="Page_4346"></span>interpret the divorce decree as providing for a share of any civil service benefits "however distributed." This we cannot do. Not only do the terms of the divorce decree belie such an interpretation, but such an award would not comply with the statutory mandate that a survivor annuity be "expressly provided for." The statute and implementing regulations sensibly draw a balance between competing interests by providing for a former spouse survivor annuity, yet requiring that such an election or award be express. The board's decision is thus not arbitrary or capricious, and is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hokanson further argues that any deficiencies in the 1991 decree were rectified in the 1996 "clarification" order. However, the relevant statutes and regulations state that such an order is ineffective if issued after the retirement or death of the federal employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of this subchapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in paragraph (1) of this <span id="Page_4347"></span>subsection shall not be effective--(A) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee or Member concerned, and (B) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) (1994). The implementing regulation states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of awarding, increasing, reducing, or eliminating a former spouse survivor annuity, or explaining, interpreting, or clarifying a court order that awards, increases, reduces or eliminates a former spouse annuity, the court order must be--(i) Issued on a day prior to the date of retirement or date of death of the employee; or (ii) The first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1004(e)(1). By the express terms of the regulation, the 1996 order, having been issued after the death of Mr. Hokanson, is ineffective to the extent it purports to "clarify" a prior implicit award of a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Newman v. Love</span>, 962 F.2d 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1992), Ms. Hokanson argues that the regulation cannot be applied so as to deny effect to the 1996 court order. We disagree. <span class="Italic">Newman</span> is not applicable to this case. In <span class="Italic">Newman</span>, this court held that the division of marital assets following an initial order granting a divorce was not a "modification" of the initial order within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4). In so holding, we declined to defer to a predecessor regulation that had required that an award of a former spouse survivor annuity, if issued after the retirement or death of the federal employee, be in the first court order terminating the marital relationship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704 (1992). We noted that such a regulation, which gave no effect to the order in the second phase of bifurcated divorce proceedings, was contrary to the statutory mandate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The current regulation cures this defect by requiring that an order awarding the survivor annuity after retirement or death of the federal employee be the "first order dividing the marital property of the retiree and the former spouse." Thus, the current regulation properly distinguishes between a bifurcated divorce proceeding where the division of marital assets follows the initial divorce decree and an ineffective "modification" of a former order that had divided marital assets. Because the 1991 amended divorce decree divided the marital assets, including the retirement benefits, the 1996 order is properly considered a "modification" of that decree and is therefore ineffective for purposes of awarding Ms. Hokanson a former spouse survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board did not err in determining that Ms. Hokanson is not entitled to a former spouse survivor annuity. The 1991 amended divorce decree failed to expressly award her a former spouse survivor annuity, as required by statute if she were to receive such an annuity. The 1996 "clarification" order was also ineffective because it purported to modify the prior divorce decree and was issued after the death of Ms. Hokanson's former husband. Accordingly, the decision of the board is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM,</span> AT-0831-10-0059-B-2 (NP 1/22/2014) (remanded on another issue, <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 578 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2014)), denying a former spouse annuity, summarized the rules applicable to what OPM concluded was an allocation of the retiree's annuity through an ambiguous divorce decree:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Spouse Equity Act provides that "a former spouse of a deceased employee...is entitled to a survivor annuity under this subsection, if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h); <span class="Italic">see Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 F.3d 141, 143-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996). "The requirement that the agreement or decree 'expressly provide[&#8197;] for' a survivor annuity reflects a congressional compromise." <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 100 F.3d at 143. "On the one hand, Congress was concerned about the protection of the financial interests of former spouses of deceased federal employees," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, while "[o]n the other hand, Congress was worried that OPM might construe state court dispositions contrary to their intended effect," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 144. Although "magic words" are not needed to create a former spouse annuity, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 656 (1991), "the intent to provide the survivor annuity [must] be clear, definite, explicit, plain, direct, and unmistakable, not dubious or ambiguous," <span class="Italic">Hahn v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 154, 156 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse is not entitled to a survivor annuity "when the terms of an agreement are ambiguous," <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 100 F.3d at 144, and "OPM's regulations provide that the court order [purporting to create a former spouse annuity] must either state the former spouse's entitlement to a survivor annuity or direct an employee...to provide a former spouse annuity." <span class="Italic">Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 254, 257 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 48 F.3d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). "The Board has clearly articulated its view that a former spouse is not 'expressly provided for' if ambiguous court order provisions can be interpreted to provide for more than one type of benefit." <span class="Italic">Hahn</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 157. Accordingly, the Board has held that, when the terms of a divorce decree could refer to an entitlement to a portion of a retirement annuity, to a survivor annuity, or to a lump-sum payment of retirement benefits, the Board will not construe the ambiguity in favor of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span> at 157-58; <span class="Italic">Holzman</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 256-57; <span class="Italic">Bottrell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 338, 342 (1988), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 867 F.2d 1421 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (discussing different ways the term "pension benefits" could be interpreted and concluding that, because of the ambiguity, a divorce decree did not create a survivor annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, under the regulations applicable to the appellant and Mr. Marshall's 1987 divorce judgment, "an award directing the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits is distinct from, and will not be interpreted as, an award of a survivor annuity." <span class="Italic">Hokanson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 122 F.3d 1043, 1046 (Fed. Cir. 1997); 5 C.F.R. Part 838, Subpart J. In <span class="Italic">Hokanson</span>, the Federal Circuit explained that "the regulations explicitly state that the term 'employee retirement benefits' as used in that subpart 'does not include survivor annuities.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1045 (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.1003). "The regulations thus specifically distinguish between the payment of a share of a federal employee's retirement benefits to a former spouse during the lifetime of the retired federal employee, and the awarding of a survivor annuity to the former spouse payable after the death of the employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1046.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the divorce judgment's reference to the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), combined with the provision that the appellant "shall be entitled to the surviving spouse's allowance," was "sufficiently direct and explicit as to award the appellant a survivor annuity." Reviewing the divorce judgment in its entirety, however, we cannot agree. The section of the judgment explaining the division of Mr. Marshall's retirement benefits begins by awarding the appellant "a sum equal to 20% of [Mr. Marshall's] presently vested amount" of his pension. A reference to pension benefits, alone, does not satisfy the Spouse Equity Act's requirement that an award of a survivor annuity be express and direct. <span class="Italic">See Holzman</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 256-57 (finding that a spouse's entitlement to "[O]ne-half of Husband's pension benefits" did not create a former spouse annuity); <span class="Italic">Bottrell</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 342 (language providing that a former spouse "would receive one-half of the present value of her husband's 'retirement/pension'" did not create a survivor annuity). The initial division of Mr. Marshall's pension, therefore, did not expressly create a former spouse annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sleet v. OPM</span>, SF-0831-11-0841-I-1 (NP 10/18/2012), explained that ambiguous provisions of a divorce decree will not be construed in favor of a grant of a former spouse survivor annuity and that extrinsic evidence is not ordinarily admissible to clarify the intent of the decree:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proceeding below, the appellant challenged the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) reconsideration decision finding that she was not entitled to a survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) based on the federal service of her deceased ex-husband. On appeal, the appellant repeated her argument that the terms of her divorce decree demonstrated that it was the parties' intention that she be provided benefits under the CSRS until her death, that is, a survivor annuity. Rejecting her claim, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In disputing the administrative judge's finding that the divorce decree does not expressly provide for a survivor annuity for her, the appellant relies on language in paragraph 4 of the decree that awards her a portion of the sum that her late ex-husband, or his designated beneficiary, or his estate is entitled to receive by way of an annuity, and states that all such payments to the appellant shall cease upon her death. One reading of such language is, as the administrative judge found, that it awarded the appellant only a portion of the deceased ex-husband's annuity while he was alive. Even if another reading is that it awarded the appellant not just a portion of the deceased ex-husband's annuity, but a portion of his designated beneficiary's survivor annuity, it does not, nor could it, provide that any such benefit would continue after that designated beneficiary's <span id="Page_4348"></span>death because it would terminate at that time. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(5)(A)(i). Under the circumstances, it must be said that the operative language in the decree is uncertain or ambiguous as it relates to the awarding of a survivor annuity to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is precluded from undertaking its own determination of spousal entitlements and awarding survivor benefits based on ambiguous language. <span class="Italic">See Nicholson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 340, 342 (1994). A former spouse is not "expressly provided for" if ambiguous court order provisions can be interpreted to provide for more than one type of benefit. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Holzman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 254, 259 (1994),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 48 F.3d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 651, 655 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf. Hahn v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 154, 157-58 (1996) (separation agreement between retired employee and his former spouse which contained two provisions, one of which could be reasonably construed to provide a temporary survivor right and another of which could be interpreted to provide a permanent survivor annuity right did not satisfy statutory requirement that it expressly provide for a survivor annuity and thus the former spouse was not entitled to a survivor annuity).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the initial decision is contrary to Congress's intention in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h), that is, to close what it perceived to be a significant gap in the financial protection afforded to former spouses of federal retirees. Notwithstanding, the statute also reflects Congress's judgment that, rather than undertake its own determination of spousal entitlements, the federal government should defer to state courts, the traditional arbiters in divorce proceedings, as to the equitable division of federal retirement benefits. <span class="Italic">See McDannell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 716 F.2d 1063, 1065-66 (5th Cir. 1983). For OPM or the Board to construe unclear and ambiguous state court orders as they relate to former spouse annuities would improperly make them, and not the state courts, the arbiters of spousal entitlements. <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. at 654 n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that, in determining that her deceased ex-husband did not intend to provide a survivor annuity for her, the administrative judge improperly relied on certain evidence, namely, 1997 communications between her ex-husband and OPM in which he sought to provide a survivor annuity for his second wife. The appellant urges that, in determining the parties' intent, only evidence of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the 1988 decree can be considered. It appears that the administrative judge considered that evidence only by way of responding to the appellant's claim regarding her late ex-husband's intent. The administrative judge correctly found, however, that extrinsic evidence of intent is not admissible if the decree contains no term that could be fairly read as contemplating the award of a CSRS survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 F.3d 141, 145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The administrative judge found that there was no such term, and he referenced the 1997 communications to which the appellant refers only as "even if extrinsic evidence were considered....We therefore find that the administrative judge did not err in his review of such evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Irving v. OPM</span>, DE-0843-16-0327-I-1 (NP 7/13/2022) (court order approving decree awarding former spouse $1/month was unambiguous: "Therefore, there is no ambiguity as to what the appellant's survivor benefit is or for how long she will receive it. <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 100 F.3d 141, 146 n.3 (1996) (explaining that, when the plain meaning of the operative term grants an annuity, the annuity must be awarded, regardless of extrinsic evidence).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A court order specifying that the former wife receive a survivor annuity was properly applied by OPM to provide for the maximum amount of a survivor annuity. The AJ should not have relied on extrinsic evidence to determine what, if any, lesser amount of a survivor annuity was intended, <span class="Italic">Landrith v. OPM</span>, 99 MSPR 76, 77-80 &#x00B6; 2-11 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, Larry Landrith, and the intervenor, Judith Landrith, were divorced in 1988 while Larry was employed under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). Larry retired in 2002 with nearly 39 years of creditable service; he was married to Judith for 24 of those years. The Colorado court order dividing the parties interests in Larry's CSRS benefits, which was drafted by Larry's attorney, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5.&#x2003;Pursuant to Permanent Orders incorporated into a Decree of Dissolution of Marriage entered on December 15, 1988 in the within action, a portion of the retirement benefits of the Participant, Larry D. Landrith, is to be set aside to the alternate Payee, Judith Marie Landrith, as described herein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">6.&#x2003;Larry Landrith shall elect the survivor's annuity for his former spouse, Judith Landrith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">7.&#x2003;For purposes of this Order the annuity or pension administrator shall assume that the parties have been continuously married from the date of the employment with the United States Government or its agencies through December 15, 1988 for twenty-four years. The date of divorce is December 15, 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">8.&#x2003;Whenever Larry Landrith retires the OPM and the Plan holding pension and other funds for Larry Landrith shall pay to Judy Landrith the sum of $770.38 per month from the date of retirement until either Judy Landrith dies or Larry Landrith dies. In the event of Larry Landrith's death (whether before or after retirement) Judy Landrith shall receive the spousal annuity payable by said pension plan and all payments to Judy Landrith shall end upon her death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM interpreted the order as expressly providing for apportionment of Larry's life-only annuity, with Judith receiving a payment of $770.38 per month as long as Larry is alive. OPM found that the order failed to specify the amount of the survivor annuity to which Judith would be entitled should Larry predecease her, so it applied its own regulations to find that she would receive the maximum payable survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the administrative judge (AJ) reversed OPM's decision. He found the court order to be unclear concerning the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity. He further found that the maximum payable survivor annuity based on Larry's years of service and high-three salary would be $2708, and that it would be absurd to interpret the order as providing for such a benefit when it provided Judith with just $770.38 per month during Larry's life. Based on the testimony of Larry and his attorney, and on documents that were generated during the divorce proceedings, the AJ interpreted the order as awarding a former spouse survivor annuity of $770.38 per month.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The intervenor argues in her petition for review that the state court intended for the apportionment of Larry's annuity during his life and the survivor annuity to be separate. The appellant opposes the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The former spouse of a CSRS retiree is entitled to a portion of the annuity otherwise payable to the retiree, if and to the extent expressly provided for in a divorce decree or related court order. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1)(A). In addition, the former spouse of a CSRS retiree is entitled to a survivor annuity..., if and to the extent expressly provided for in an election under section 8339(j)(3) of this title, or in the terms of any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). The maximum payable survivor annuity is 55% of the retiree's annuity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(k)(1), 8341(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision is correct in finding the court order unclear with respect to the amount of the survivor annuity. We do not agree with the next step in the initial decision, which was to rely on extrinsic evidence to interpret the court order, based on caselaw suggesting that extrinsic evidence may be used to interpret an ambiguous settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g., Parrish-Fishman v. Department of the Interior,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 179, 181 (1991). An expression of legal rights is ambiguous if it is susceptible to differing, reasonable interpretations. <span class="Italic">Cf. Birdsong v. Department of the Navy,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 524, 528 (1997) (a settlement agreement is ambiguous if it can reasonably be interpreted in more than one way); <span class="Italic">National Rifle Association v. Reno,</span> 216 F.3d 122, 130 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (a statute is ambiguous if there is more than one reasonable interpretation of it). Silence is not ambiguity. <span class="Italic">New Jersey v. New York,</span> 523 U.S. 767, 813 (1998) (concurring opinion of Justice Breyer).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The order is very clear in &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5 and 8 that Judith should receive $770.38 per month during Larry's life, to be deducted from Larry's annuity. This clarity highlights the absence of any fixed amount, formula, or any other term dictating the amount of Judith's survivor annuity. The order provides simply that the intervenor is entitled to the survivor's annuity, &#x00B6; 6, and later provides that she shall receive the spousal annuity payable by said pension plan [the CSRS], &#x00B6; 8, with no more detail or explanation. We do not discern two, or even one, reasonable interpretation of the plain words of the order with regard to the specific amount of the survivor annuity. The order is silent, not ambiguous, with respect to the amount of the survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ seemed to acknowledge as much when he found, based on extrinsic evidence, that the state court intended to employ a fractional formula for computing the survivor annuity, and observed that the order itself did not say what method and how much was to be awarded. Extrinsic evidence should not be used to justify reading a term into [a property settlement] agreement [incident to a divorce] that is not found there. <span class="Italic">Fox v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 100 F.3d 141, 145 (Fed. Cir. 1996). It is true that &#x00B6; 7 of the order states that for purposes of the order, OPM should assume that Larry and Judith have been continuously married from the date of the employment with the United States Government or its agencies through December 15, 1988 for twenty-four years. OPM's regulations provide, however, that if the court order uses a formula to determine the former spouse survivor annuity, it must not use any variables whose values are not readily ascertainable from the face of the court order or normal OPM files. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.805(b). To the extent that the court intended for survivor benefits to be computed according <span id="Page_4349"></span>to a formula, the order is incomplete because it specifies only that the parties were married for 24 years; the order does not say what other values OPM should use, and the plain import of section 838.805(b) is that OPM will not speculate about those values.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are thus left with a court order that unambiguously provides for a former spouse survivor annuity but does not provide a fixed amount, complete formula, or other term by which the survivor annuity can be calculated. OPM has its own rule of construction that directly applies in the situation at hand: A court order that contains no provision stating the amount of the former spouse survivor annuity provides the maximum former spouse survivor annuity permitted. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.921(a). We apply that rule here, as OPM did in its reconsideration decision, and find that Judith is entitled to the maximum permissible former spouse survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the initial decision, this is not an absurd result. The property division ordered by the state court reflects a complex balancing of Larry's and Judith's interests in assets accumulated during their marriage and their expected respective financial needs. We have no reason to question the state court's determination that an appropriate apportionment of Larry's annuity is to give Judith $770.38 per month and Larry the balance during his life (nor do we have any authority to modify that determination). The CSRS survivor annuity benefit resembles life insurance; that Judith stands to receive much more than $770.38 per month in the form of a survivor annuity should she outlive Larry is no more absurd than a fairly common occurrence, namely, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy receives nothing during the insured's life but receives a large sum when the insured dies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When reference to a survivor annuity was included in a decree and incorporated marital settlement, the Board received extrinsic evidence both in the form of a statement of someone familiar with the employee's intentions during the divorce process to explain what he had desired as to a survivor annuity and through an examination of provisions of the employee's will concerning distributions to be made to his former spouse. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ivey v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 273, 276-79 &#x00B6; 8-13, 2007 MSPB 272 (2007); <span class="Italic">Rose v. OPM</span>, 84 MSPR 284, 288 &#x00B6; 11 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">Fox v.

<p class="Body-Text">A general statement in a divorce decree awarding half of the employee's retirement or pension--subject to a later actuarial determination--without an express statement in the decree of the amount, was insufficient to confer either a survivor annuity or a lump sum payment to a surviving spouse, <span class="Italic">Bottrell v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM found that the divorce decree, specifying that the amount would be determined by an actuary after the execution of the divorce order, failed to comply with the statutory requirements. Additionally, OPM found that the divorce decree did not specifically award a "former spouse" annuity or survivor annuity because the fact that the decree named her as the "sole and primary beneficiary of any death benefits which her husband would receive" was not sufficient to establish that the court intended that she should receive a monthly survivor annuity as opposed to a lump-sum payment...</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency contends that Federal law prohibits the civil service retirement system from honoring a state court order that awards a portion of the lump-sum death benefit. The agency contends that appellant's divorce decree fails to fall into any of the exceptions to the general rule set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a) prohibiting the assignment of retirement benefits and that appellant is therefore not entitled to any of her former husband's "retirement/pension." The agency further contends that a correct interpretation of applicable statutes and regulations would deny appellant a survivor annuity and a lump-sum payment, and that a state divorce decree may not award such payments in contravention of statutes and OPM regulations at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8346(a) and 8341(h), and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The general prohibition of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a) against the assignment of retirement benefits in the form of annuities or lump-sum payments has certain exceptions to benefit former spouses. In order for the appellant to collect from OPM the money described in her divorce decree as "death benefits," it must be established that the provision of the decree is amenable to one of these exceptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1) relates solely to survivor annuities and entitles a former spouse to obtain such an annuity if it was "expressly provided for" in a divorce decree or by statutory election. Similarly, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1), a former spouse may also receive payments from the civil service retirement system, if it was "expressly provided for" by the divorce decree and the payments <span class="Italic">"would otherwise be made to [the]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic"> employee</span>...based upon his service." (Emphasis supplied.) Here, appellant's divorce decree, by its own terms, does not provide her with a survivor's annuity as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h). Thus, the administrative judge properly found that appellant was not entitled to a survivor's annuity. Further, appellant is not entitled to payments under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(j)(1) since, under its terms, her former spouse, because of his death, was not eligible to receive regular annuity payments, which would otherwise have been payable to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since appellant's divorce decree did not qualify her for an annuity, we turn to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 regarding the allocation of lump-sum benefits. Under that provision, an employee is entitled to a lump-sum benefit if he is separated from the service for at least 31 days or is transferred to a position in which he is no longer subject to subchapter III (Civil Service Retirement) of Chapter 83, and he makes an application to OPM for a lump-sum benefit. Lump-sum benefits may be given to a former spouse, subject to the terms of a court order, upon being notified of the employee's application for the lump-sum benefit. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1). In this case, since a lump-sum credit could not be given to appellant's former spouse under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(a) because he died while still in the government's creditable service, appellant could not receive a lump-sum payment under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342 (a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Subject to subsection (j) of this section, an employee or Member who--(1)(A) is separated from the service for at least thirty-one consecutive days;...(2) files an application with the Office of Personnel Management for payment of the lump-sum credit; (3) is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter..., at the time he files the application; and (4) will not become eligible to receive an annuity within thirty-one days after filing the application, is entitled to be paid the lump-sum credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(j)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Payment of the lump-sum credit under subsection (a) of this section--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">(A)&#x2003;may be made only if any current spouse and any former spouse of the employee or Member are notified of the employee or Member's application; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote5">(B)&#x2003;shall be subject to the terms of a court decree of divorce...if--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote6">(i)&#x2003;the decree...expressly relates to any portion of the lump-sum credit involved; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote6">(ii)&#x2003;payment of the lump-sum credit would extinguish entitlement of the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title or to any portion of an annuity under section 8345(j) of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c) authorizes lump-sum benefits to be paid to persons surviving an employee in a prescribed order of precedence. The first designated beneficiary, under this provision, is one specifically designated by the employee in a signed and witnessed writing received by OPM before his death. The provision further specifies that a designation in another document not so executed and filed will have no force or effect. Thus, unless she is so designated the beneficiary, a former spouse has no entitlement to a lump-sum benefit under this statute's order of precedence. Since appellant was not designated a beneficiary of the lump sum in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(c), she could not receive a lump-sum payment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Supplement Chapter 831-1, Subchapter S17(b) (September 21, 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, a lump-sum "death benefit" is not a proper subject for a qualifying court order under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1704 and 831.1703. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1704(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A former spouse is entitled to a portion of an employee's <span class="Italic">retirement benefits</span> only to the extent that the division of <span class="Italic">retirement benefits</span> is expressly provided for by the court order. The court order must "divide employee retirement benefits, award a payment from employee retirement benefits, or award a former spouse annuity." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1703 specifically excludes lump-sum benefits from its definition of "employee retirement benefits." Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the divorce decree was a qualifying court order that awarded appellant a lump-sum benefit and conclude that it does not fit into any of the above exceptions to the non-assignability of retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(a).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The final exception to the prohibition against the assignability of retirement benefits is contained in 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 659 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> We agree with the agency's petition for review that these sections dealing with alimony have no applicability to this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McDannell v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 716 F.2d 1063 (5th Cir. 1983), the court held that, because the former spouse's divorce decree <span id="Page_4350"></span>did not conform to OPM's regulations regarding the method of payment of retirement benefits, OPM was not authorized to pay the former spouse, and that she would have to go back to court to obtain an order that conformed to the requirements of OPM's regulations. Here, appellant's divorce decree similarly fails to conform to OPM regulations regarding the method of payment. Moreover, in an analogous situation involving beneficiaries of Federally-sponsored life insurance, the United States Supreme Court held that, where there is a state divorce decree that names beneficiaries of a life insurance policy inconsistently with Federal statutes pertaining to the designation of beneficiaries, the Federal statutes will prevail. <span class="Italic">Ridgway v. Ridgway,</span> 454 U.S. 46 (1981). Similarly, we conclude that appellant's state divorce decree specifying "death benefits" is insufficient to satisfy the previously discussed federal statutes and regulations, and that appellant may not, therefore, receive benefits from OPM pursuant to her state court decree.</p>
