<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-98"><span id="Page_1691"></span><span class="space">b.</span> Technical Error; Supplemental Evidence of Interim Relief</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions of relatively recent vintage show flexibility as to implementation of interim relief and tolerance by the Board for minor agency miscues that do not result in significant harm to the appellant. If an agency timely restores the appellant to the work force but does not begin paying him until a few weeks later, interim relief is provided as long as the agency paid the employee back to the date of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Batten v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 222, 226 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 35 (2006) ("the appellant has not alleged that the agency has failed to provide him with the pay and benefits appropriate to the EAS-11 position to which it assigned him, even if the agency is not in full compliance with the interim relief order, the Board exercises its discretion not to dismiss the agency's petition for review under these circumstances"); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Dept. of Transp</span>, 2023 MSPB 18, &#x00B6; 14 (2023) ("the agency satisfies its obligation by taking appropriate administrative action by the deadline that will result in the issuance of a paycheck for the interim relief period"); <span class="Italic">Byers v. VA</span>, 89 MSPR 655, 661-62 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (agency showed it took reasonable steps to insure that the appellant received pay and benefits due to her from the date of the initial decision and it promptly corrected inadvertent errors as soon as it learned of them; noncompliance with an interim relief order was excused under the circumstances); <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. USPS,</span> 88 MSPR 475, 479 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) ("The appellant has not offered evidence to show that the agency has intentionally delayed paying him for the interim relief period."); <span class="Italic">Omites v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 223, 227 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (in an initial decision issued on March 6, the appellant was returned to duty and an administrative action was begun to pay the appellant for the period from the initial decision until returning to duty on March 23, and by May 23 the agency completed the necessary paperwork for back pay to be issued by the agency accounting unit; "[s]uch inadvertent delay in issuing back pay does not show noncompliance with the interim relief order"); <span class="Italic">Beardsley v. DOD</span>, 52 MSPR 457, 460 (1992) ("because the agency provided proof of compliance with its petition for review and restored the appellant to the payroll as of the date of the initial decision, and has paid him going back to the date of the initial decision, the agency complied with the interim relief order"), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Fox v. FDIC</span>, 62 MSPR 447, 452 (1994); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Dept. of Army</span>, NY-0752-13-0142-I-2 (NP 7/1/2016) ("Reasonable, inadvertent delays in issuing pay due under an interim relief order do not show noncompliance with the order. The same principle applies here, where the agency has shown a reasonable, inadvertent delay in providing health insurance benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fox v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 447, 452 (1994) (delay in reinstating the appellant's health insurance benefits did not warrant dismissal of the agency's petition for review for failure to comply with an interim relief order).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Purely procedural problems concerning interim relief are not likely to support rejection of an agency PFR. An appellant's contention that he did not receive the notice from the agency that it would be unduly disruptive to return the appellant to duty was not harmful error. <span class="Italic">Crespo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 125, 128-29 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pencook v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 409 (1995) (PFR would not be dismissed when the agency notified the appellant but not the AJ of its undue disruption determination). Not every technical deficiency in an SF-50 documenting interim relief results in dismissal of a PFR, <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. USDA</span>, 63 MSPR 165, 168 n.2 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the SF-50B the agency has submitted is insufficient evidence of compliance because it lacks an approval date and because of "the lack of any apparent authority of the individual who signed the form." Although block 50 on the form--the block reserved for the "Signature/Authentication and Title of Approving Official"--is signed by an official other than the one whose name is typed in the block, there is no indication that the former official lacked the authority to approve the action (or sign the form) for the latter. Furthermore, we see no basis for finding that the absence of an approval date has the significance attributed to it by the appellant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to dismiss a PFR on the basis that the agency did not return the employee to his position until a week after the end of the PFR filing period when the personnel papers showed reinstatement as of the date of the initial decision, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 59 MSPR 585, 589-90 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has moved that the Board dismiss the agency's petition, contending that the agency has not fully complied with the Board's interim relief regulations. He argues that, absent a specific determination under 5 CFR 1201.115(b)(2) that his presence would be unduly disruptive, the agency was required to return him to his position before it filed its petition. He argues further that, because the agency did not make such a determination, and did not return him to his position until approximately one week after the end of the filing period, the agency did not comply with the Board's interim relief regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in an appeal such as this is required, in the absence of a determination that the appellant's return to duty would be unduly disruptive, to submit proof that it has returned the appellant to duty. We find that the agency in this appeal has done so. By issuing an SF-50 timely reinstating the appellant, and by notifying him of the date on which he was to report to work, the agency completed all the administrative steps necessary to comply with the interim relief order. Furthermore, we see nothing improper in the agency's providing the appellant with a week's advance notice of the requirement that he return to duty, and we note that, because he was restored retroactive to the date of the initial decision, the appellant will receive all pay and other benefits to which he is entitled from that date. Thus, the evidence submitted is sufficient to establish that the agency complied with the administrative judge's interim relief order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's...petition for review of the May 19, 1997, initial decision was filed on June 23, 1997. As noted, with its petition, the agency submitted a memorandum advising the appellant that he was being <span id="Page_1692"></span>placed on administrative leave effective May 19, 1997, that he was not to report to duty because the agency deemed that his return would be disruptive to the operation of the facility, and that he was being placed in a pay, but non-working, status. In the absence of an SF-50 or SF-52 documenting the appellant's interim appointment, it is questionable whether the agency established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of compliance with the administrative judge's order. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wilson v. Department of Justice,</span> 68 MSPR 303, 307 (1995). Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that it did, however, the record reflects that the appellant specifically notified the agency on July 10, 1997, in connection with his Motion for Sanctions, that he believed that the agency was not in compliance with the administrative judge's interim relief order because he had not received any pay or compensation. Notwithstanding, the agency did not examine the appellant's claim until it was compelled to respond to the Board's Order of October 8, 1997. When the agency did so, it learned that the appellant had indeed not been paid because the memorandum placing him on administrative leave had not been provided to the Finance/Payroll Office. It was not until then that the agency set about to assure that the appellant received a check for what was, by that time, the rather substantial amount of money due him. Thus, in mid-October, 1997, the agency first did what it was required to do by June 23, 1997, namely, take appropriate administrative action that would result in the issuance of a paycheck.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described above, there is no indication that the agency took any action to correct its initial error in failing to put the appellant in pay status even after he clearly gave the agency notice that he had not received any money. The agency's failure to act for three months after being put on notice cannot be excused. Moreover, the appellant has well supported his claim that the agency's failure to timely pay him any money for a period of four months was not a "minor" matter, but, in fact, and as might reasonably be expected, caused him and his family to suffer a substantial financial hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because we find that the agency's failure to timely provide the appellant with this most fundamental element of interim relief, the resumption of his pay, was not excusable nor a minor mistake, its petition for review must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bartholomew v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 598, 601-02 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 85 MSPR 130, 133-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2000) (when the agency failed to correct an error in not providing full interim relief pay retroactive to the date of the initial decision, the error could not be characterized as inadvertent; the PFR was dismissed).

<p class="Body-Text">There are older decisions that near misses do not count as compliance with interim relief orders. An agency PFR was dismissed for failure to provide interim relief in <span class="Italic">Shatzel v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 451, 453 (1991), when the agency reinstated the appellant as of June 3. The initial decision called for interim relief effective May 15, the date of the decision. <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 64 MSPR 247, 248 (1994) (insufficient to place appellant into interim relief position on date effective two weeks after date of initial decision); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 73, 74 (1992) (an agency PFR was dismissed when interim relief was provided effective March 22 and the date of the initial decision was March 11). Under law predating the current certification rule, if the agency provided interim relief but failed to properly notify the Board of interim relief, the agency could still be defaulted, and its PFR could be dismissed, if the agency's delay was not excused. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 MSPR 413, 415-16 (1994).</p>
