<h2 class="h2" id="sec4-100"><span class="space">IX.</span> ROLE OF ULP PROCEDURES</h2>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's regulations provide guidance at 5 CFR 2424.30 (2022) concerning the election between ULP and negotiability procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice</span>. Except for proposals or provisions that are the subject of an agency's compelling need claim under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(2), where an exclusive representative files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the charge or grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review filed pursuant to this part, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. The dismissal will be without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the unfair labor practice charge or grievance has been resolved administratively, including resolution pursuant to an arbitration award that has become final and binding. No later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the unfair labor practice charge or grievance is resolved administratively, the exclusive representative may refile the petition for review, and the Authority will determine whether resolution of the petition is still required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusive representative has not filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice. </span>Where an exclusive representative files only a petition for review under this part, the petition will be processed as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;No bargaining obligation dispute <span class="Italic">exists. </span>Where there is no bargaining obligation dispute, the Authority will resolve the petition for review under the procedures of this part.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">A bargaining obligation dispute exists. </span>Where a bargaining obligation dispute exists in addition to the negotiability dispute, the Authority will inform the exclusive representative of any opportunity to file an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure and, where the exclusive representative pursues either of these courses, proceed in accord with paragraph (a) of this section. If the exclusive representative does not file an unfair labor practice charge or grievance, the Authority will proceed to resolve all disputes necessary for disposition of the petition unless, in its discretion, the Authority determines that resolving all disputes is not appropriate because, for example, resolution of the bargaining obligation dispute under this part would unduly delay resolution of the negotiability dispute, or the procedures in another, available administrative forum are better suited to resolve the bargaining obligation dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA provides in its FAQ on negotiability issues in its website, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/102599">www.flra.gov/102599</a>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q.&#x2003;If the agency claims in its response that it won't negotiate because the contract language is not within its obligation to bargain, on the basis that it's already covered by the collective bargaining agreement or for some other reason, how will that be resolved?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;There are several options. If it's timely, a union could file a grievance or unfair labor practice charge regarding the agency's refusal to bargain. If that happens, unless the agency has argued that it has a compelling need for an agency regulation that is counter to the contract language, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review, without prejudice to it being refiled later. The bargaining obligation question would get resolved in another forum. However, if the union does not file an unfair labor practice charge or a grievance that claims an unfair labor practice, the Authority will decide the agency's defense on the bargaining obligation, as well as the legality of the disputed language. The filing of a negotiability appeal does not stop or change the time limits for filing a grievance or ULP charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Q.&#x2003;Why is a case treated differently when a compelling need argument is raised?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;A federal court has ruled that if an agency raises an argument that disputed language is non-negotiable because it conflicts with an agency regulation for which there is a compelling need, that claim needs to be decided before an unfair labor practice determination can be made. As a result, the negotiability case will proceed, even if an unfair labor practice charge or grievance has been filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a union prevails in a negotiability appeal, the result is prospective, that is, the agency is directed to bargain but there is no relief for its past failure to bargain. In a ULP case, however, it is possible to obtain both a negotiability determination and retroactive relief through a determination that an agency committed a ULP through its bargaining tactics. The limited circumstances allowing retroactive relief are noted in this section.

<p class="noindent">Regulations now require that a ULP proceeding be resolved before adjudication of a negotiability dispute on the same subject matter. The union may withdraw <span id="Page_474"></span>a ULP charge to pursue a negotiability appeal, <span class="Italic">AFGE, SSA Gen.

<p class="noindent-1">...Moreover, to the extent that the Agency suggests that the Union waived its right to bargain when it withdrew its ULP charge, over the Agency's implementation of the space-heater policy, our procedures permit a union to withdraw a ULP allegation in order to file a negotiability appeal.[104)</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[104]<span class="Italic">See NAIL</span>, 67 FLRA at 86 ("[W]hen a union withdraws, or the Authority resolves a ULP claim related to a petition, the Authority will consider the petition, not dismiss it, because the ULP claim 'has been resolved administratively.'") (quoting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.30(a)) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 267, 268-69 (2007); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 978, 978 (2004)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-51.html">69 FLRA 355</a>, 355-56 (2016), elaborated on the election scheme:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the petition, the Union informed the Authority that it has filed the above-mentioned ULP charge in response to the Agency's implementation of the directive. The Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication then issued an order to show cause directing the Union to demonstrate why the petition should not be dismissed under &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) of the Authority's Regulations because it may be directly related to the pending ULP. The Union filed a response to the order, claiming that the ULP is not directly related to the petition because the "ULP charge concerns [the] [d]irective[, whereas] the [p]etition resulted from bargaining over the implementation of [the kiosk system]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2424.30(a) provides, in relevant part, that where a union files a ULP charge, and the charge concerns issues "directly related" to a petition for review in a negotiability case, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review, without prejudice to the union's right to refile the petition after the ULP charge has been resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the pending ULP charge alleges that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by unilaterally implementing the directive. And, according to the Union, the directive changed employees' conditions of employment by requiring officers to "stand[&#8197;] up" when speaking to travelers or when conducting certain law-enforcement duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1, at issue here, similarly concerns whether officers can sit or stand when performing passenger inspections. Specifically, Proposal 1 states that the Agency "will provide ergonomically appropriate chairs, stools, etc. to be used while [o]fficers inspect passengers after they have accessed the automated kiosks. Nothing in this provision prevents [o]fficers from standing while they inspect passengers if that is their choice." The parties agree that the purpose of Proposal 1 is "to allow officers the option to sit or stand--at their discretion--while inspecting passengers."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The pending ULP proceedings could resolve whether the Agency has an obligation to bargain over proposals related to whether officers sit or stand.&#x2003;And because Proposal 1 relates to whether certain officers can sit or stand, the resolution of the ULP proceedings could render issues raised in the instant negotiability appeal moot.[17] Thus, we find that the ULP charge concerns issues directly related to Proposal 1, and we dismiss the petition with regard to Proposal 1, without prejudice, under &#x00A7; 2424.30(a) of the Authority's Regulations.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent">We trace below practice prior to the current regulatory scheme. Under the earlier regulations (5 CFR 2423.5 and 2424.5), the union could select between the ULP or negotiability appeal procedures. If the agency asserted that a compelling need bars negotiability of a proposal, the agency's claim was to be resolved through a negotiability appeal, unless that claim was previously resolved by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 63 Fed. Reg. 66405, 66410 (Dec. 2, 1998). The earlier regulations (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2423.5 and 2424.5) did not preclude a matter from being raised under both negotiability and ULP procedures, rather, FLRA ordinarily would not simultaneously process the issue under both procedures. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE and DOJ, INS</span>, 24 FLRA 183 (1986). The union was required to elect between the two procedures within the time limits set by FLRA following the initiation of the negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 171 and FCI El Reno</span>, 52 FLRA 1484, 1489 (1997). In most negotiability disputes, the appeals procedure of &#x00A7; 7117(c) was preferred to the ULP procedure, assuming that there were facts that justified use of the ULP procedure. The informal &#x00A7; 7117(c) procedure was quicker and did not require the issuance of a complaint by the FLRA General Counsel. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1167 v. FLRA</span>, 681 F.2d 886, 890 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1982). If a ULP complaint and a negotiability petition were simultaneously pending before FLRA, the union's withdrawal of the negotiability appeal constituted the selection contemplated by the regulations, and the ULP case would be properly adjudicated by an ALJ. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 1210</span>, 25 FLRA 32, 36 (1987). An inadvertent error in filling out a ULP charge form would not prevent the union from the legitimate pursuit of a negotiability appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-100 and Dept. of Navy, Submarine Base New London</span>, 47 FLRA 750, 752 (1993). The union could make its election to follow negotiability procedures, after having filed a ULP charge, by stating its intent in its petition for review. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC Newington</span>, 54 FLRA 521, 523 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent">The relation of ULP and negotiability procedures under earlier regulations was noted but not developed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3399 and Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hosp.</span>, Columbia, 9 FLRA 1022, 1023 (1982), and clarified in FLRA's <span class="Italic">Decision on Petition for Amendment of Rules</span>, 23 FLRA 405, 407-08 (1986) (Case 0-MC-10), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 191, 199-200 (D.C. Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Sections 2423.5 and 2424.5 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations provide, in pertinent part, that where a labor organization files an unfair labor practice charge which involves a negotiability issue and also files a petition for review of the same negotiability issue, it is required to choose which procedure to pursue first. Cases which involve only an agency's allegation that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to the matter proposed to be bargained, and which do not involve alleged unilateral changes in conditions of employment, must be processed exclusively under the negotiability procedures in part 2424 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Unfair labor practice remedies are available in appropriate refusal to bargain situations, such as (1) where the refusal to negotiate is accompanied by unilateral changes in conditions of employment...and (2) where an agency refuses to bargain over a proposal substantially identical to one which the Authority has previously determined to be negotiable under the Statute....&#8197;We conclude that Petitioner's suggestion to provide for unfair labor practice remedies beyond these circumstances, such as where an agency is merely alleging--in the absence of clear precedent to the contrary--that a disputed proposal is nonnegotiable, would be contrary to the language and legislative history of the Statute as well as Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's requirement that unions use the negotiability appeal rather than the ULP route, unless an agency violated its bargaining duty by making unilateral changes in working conditions, was strongly criticized but not directly ruled on in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. OPM</span>, 778 F.2d 844, 846 (D.C. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The problem of long delays in the expedited procedure is compounded by an FLRA regulation <span class="Italic">requiring</span> unions to use the negotiability appeal process in all cases in which an agency declares a proposal non-negotiable. In other words, under current FLRA regulations, a union may elect to use the traditional unfair labor practice procedures to challenge improper agency unilateral actions and other such refusals to bargain, but it is required to use the so-called expedited procedure in cases, such as this one, involving agency declarations that a bargaining proposal is non-negotiable. Although the court need not address the issue in this case, there are potentially serious problems with this regulation if it is applied to a case in which an agency's refusal to bargain may merit retroactive relief.</p>
<p class="noindent">When management made no unilateral change in a past practice, and when there was no established FLRA precedent as to the negotiability of an issue at the time of management's refusal to bargain, management did not commit a ULP when it alleged that a union proposal was outside the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">VA and NFFE Council of Consol. VA Locals</span>, 53 FLRA 236, 241-42 (1997).<span class="Italic"> NLRB Union v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1987), considered a challenge to FLRA rules that precluded use of ULP remedies for a good faith refusal to bargain that was not accompanied by actual or contemplated changes in employment conditions. The court considered FLRA's regulations reasonable. The creation of an expedited negotiability procedure permitted an inference that Congress intended that the good faith but mistaken allegation of nonnegotiability by an agency should not subject it to ULP liability. It was reasonable for FLRA to determine that the expedited review procedure was to permit the settlement of preliminary issues of negotiability before a bargaining session came to a close, without automatically subjecting the agency to remedial measures if it asserted in good faith that certain subjects ought not to be on the <span id="Page_475"></span>bargaining table. Executive Order practice, arguably incorporated by the CSRA savings clause, developed the procedure that the FLRA later followed. FLRA's construction of the Statute was permissible in light of the statutory ambiguity and the lack of positive legislative history, and the court affirmed FLRA's regulations or, more specifically, the court declined to require it to adopt the petitioner's proposed changes in the regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29, ACT v. FLRA</span>, 898 F.2d 753, 758-59 (9th Cir. 1990), traveling a different route, considered a lawsuit against FLRA after its General Counsel refused to issue a complaint involving a "pure negotiability" issue arising from an agency decision to set aside, through statutory review, a provision of a contract that allowed civilian technicians to wear civilian clothing when they performed civilian duties. The opinion of the court was extensive and traveled various routes. The essence of it was that "that an agency head's disapproval of a collective bargaining agreement can be an unfair labor practice if the agreement is in accordance with applicable law":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute states that "[a]n agreement between any agency and an exclusive representative shall be subject to approval by the head of the agency...[who] shall approve the agreement...if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation..." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(1), (2). Section 7116(a) lists unfair labor practices and provides that "it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency...to otherwise fail or refuse to comply with any provision of this chapter<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. 7116(a)(8). A plain reading of these sections leads to the conclusion that an agency head's disapproval of a collective bargaining agreement is an unfair labor practice if the agreement is in accordance with applicable law. Neither 7114(c) nor 7116(a) requires that an agency head's refusal to approve a collective bargaining agreement include evidence of bad faith bargaining before such a disapproval can be an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Subsection (c) [of &#x00A7; 7114] provides that the agency head <span class="Italic">shall</span> approve a collective bargaining agreement..."if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). Whether a provision of the agreement is in accordance with applicable law is not subject to bargaining: either the agreement accords with the law or it does not....&#8197;[I]mplying that an agency head's decision must include evidence of bad faith bargaining when bargaining plays no part in that decision is tantamount to stating that the agency head's decision can never be considered an unfair labor practice. Such an interpretation conflicts with a plain reading of the statute and simply cannot be implied for the operation of the Labor-Management Relations Chapter as a whole.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29</span> examined the FLRA's interpretation of 5 CFR 2423.5 and 2424.5, expressed in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union v. FLRA</span>, 834 F.2d 191, 199 (D.C. Cir. 1987), to the effect that there is no ULP for a good faith but mistaken refusal to discuss a proposal because of alleged intrusion into management rights or violation of federal law or rule, unless the agency's refusal is coupled with "actual or contemplated changes in conditions of employment." The union argued that before the bargaining proposal became an issue, the technicians were permitted to wear civilian attire; accordingly, the disapproval of that provision involved a contemplated change. FLRA argued that, because the technicians could wear civilian attire during the pendency of an administrative appeal from the disapproval of the proposal, there was no unilateral change in employment conditions. FLRA's argument was that the regulation, correctly interpreted, spoke only to an actual change. Under the facts of the case, the change would not occur until the completion of administrative proceedings, a position <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29</span> rejected, 898 F.2d at 761-62:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Allowing an agency to negate a contemplated change by merely delaying enforcement of that change until completion of the appeals process would virtually invite agencies to do exactly what was done here: postpone announcement or implementation of a change until the General Counsel refuses to issue an unfair labor practice complaint. If, in addition, the FLRA followed the policy pursued by the General Counsel in this case of disregarding conduct occurring after the charge is filed,...an agency could never be found to have contemplated a change in employment conditions. The regulations then would apply only to actual changes imposed prior to a union's filing of an unfair labor practice claim, eliminating the portion of the regulations referring to contemplated changes. A regulation cannot be susceptible to a construction that ignores or renders meaningless parts of its language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the General Counsel's interpretation of "change" is nothing short of absurd....&#8197;Saying that an agency head has not proposed a change by refusing to allow a current condition to continue is simply illogical. It is beyond dispute that terminating a prior right constitutes a change. The General Counsel's interpretation, therefore, effectively eliminates the regulatory requirement that negotiability issues involving an actual or contemplated change can be pursued as an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Finally, <span class="Italic">Montana Air Chap. No. 29</span>, 898 F.2d at 762-63, brought into question the election scheme contemplated by the regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute does not restrict a union's ability to pursue either issuance of an unfair labor practice complaint or a negotiability appeal when challenging alleged unfair labor practices. On its face, the statute provides equal access to both procedures, regardless of the nature of the issue involved. The court in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union</span> nevertheless found that the regulations, which limit the ability of unions to pursue negotiability issues as unfair labor practices, are based on a permissible construction of the statute....&#8197;The General Counsel's interpretation would further restrict that ability. Such an interpretation goes too far and is not consistent with the statute's lack of limitations on the union's ability to seek unfair labor practice procedure and relief. Without expressing an opinion on the court's conclusion in <span class="Italic">NLRB Union</span>, or the validity of the regulations themselves, we conclude that the restrictions embodied in the General Counsel's interpretation are inconsistent with the statute and must be set aside as contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1991 the law according to FLRA in <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, W. Region</span>, 39 FLRA 675, 680-81 (1991), was stated in <span class="Italic">VA, VA Hosp., Brockton and NAGE, SEIU</span>, 35 FLRA 188, 195-96 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]othing in the Authority's regulations concerning a party's election to proceed under an unfair labor practice proceeding or a negotiability proceeding supports a conclusion that a party may litigate the <span class="Italic">same</span> <span class="Italic">issues</span> in both proceedings. Rather, the proceedings enable the filing party to pursue in a second proceeding any issues which are unresolved after the first proceeding. In this regard, certain issues may be resolved only in an unfair labor practice or a negotiability proceeding....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In cases which involve issues which may be resolved in only one forum as well as other issues which may be resolved in both, the selection procedure enables a union to determine which issues will be litigated first. Unresolved issues may then be resolved in the second proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent">The end result, however, was that as of the end of 1991, if there is no issue concerning a contemplated change in conditions or employment, and if there is no allegation that the agency refused to bargain over proposals substantially similar to those held negotiable by FLRA, and if the sole dispute is one of negotiability, then the case must be processed "exclusively under the negotiability procedure in part 2424 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations." <span class="Italic">DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria and NFFE Local 1655</span>, 42 FLRA 877, 884 (1991).
