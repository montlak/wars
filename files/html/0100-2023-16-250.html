<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-250"><span class="space">a.</span> Denial of Membership</h5>
<p class="noindent">On the subject of acquisition of membership, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2344 and Ramey</span>, 45 FLRA 1004, 1006-07, 1109-11 (1992), decided that a union may not deny membership to an individual based on past critical comments about the union. The only basis for a bar to membership is in the Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Respondent based the denial of membership on reports by members of the Union about statements by Combs denigrating the Union and its officers, all made before the application for membership and at a time when he was not a member of the Respondent. According to one of those reports, Combs often told anyone who would listen that the Union "is a big joke [and] can help no one," and that the officers use it "just to get out of work...." In addition, the report stated that Combs "has gone as far as to tell employees to get out of the Union and to even stop people from joining." According to the report, Combs also made derogatory racial references about a fellow employee in connection with Combs' alleged public attacks on the Union. The record contains other statements by Union members reporting similar observations of conduct by Combs that was viewed as detrimental to the Union, including claims that he planned to "get inside of [the Union]" and "tarry [sic] it up from the inside[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that membership was not denied because Combs failed to meet reasonable occupational standards or to tender dues as provided in section 7116(c) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted, section 7116(c) provides that it is an unfair labor practice for an exclusive representative to deny membership to a unit employee "except" for failure to meet occupational standards uniformly required for admission or failure to tender dues. The parties have stipulated that the Respondent's denial of membership was based on neither of these factors. Accordingly, we find that the Respondent violated section 7116(c) of the Statute by denying membership to a unit member for reasons other than those permitted by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent incorrectly insists that we may strike a balance between the interests of the employee in participating in the activities of the exclusive representative and the interests of union members in preserving its reputation, integrity, and ability to perform its statutory duties. The statutory language clearly sets out two exceptions to the right of union membership. Just as clearly, it limits the exceptions to those two circumstances and mandates that it shall be an unfair labor practice to deny a unit employee membership for any other reason. There is nothing in the legislative history that suggests the language means anything other than what it plainly says.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also argues that Combs' alleged misconduct involving plans to tear down the Union "from the inside" and engaging in "egregious racial speech[,]" "removes him from the protection[s] of [section] 7116(c)[.]" In support of this position, it notes that the use of derogatory racial comments about a manager removed the union president from the protections of section 7102 in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center</span> [26 FLRA 114 (1987)] and argues that similarly the racial name-calling in this case removed Combs from the protection of section 7116(c). That case, however, is inapposite. In establishing that employees have the right to form, join, or assist a labor organization, section 7102 does not address the scope of the conduct that will be protected in the course of such activity. Therefore, the Authority has been required to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Western Division San Bruno, California</span>, 45 FLRA 138, 155-57 (1992), <span class="Italic">petition for review filed as to other matters sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees v. FLRA</span>, No. 92-1345 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 8, 1992) (Member Armendariz dissenting in pertinent part), (the Authority determined that in the circumstances of that case offensive ethnic references were not removed from the ambit of protected activity); <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Medical Center</span> (the Authority determined that in the circumstances of that case derogatory racial comments were unprotected by section 7102). In contrast, section 7116(c) specifically limits the reasons for which a union can deny membership. Misconduct of a unit employee, no matter how opprobrious, is not among those reasons, and, as noted, section 7116(c) makes it an unfair labor practice to deny membership "except for" the enumerated reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we are not persuaded by the Respondent's argument that the General Counsel's reading of section 7116(c) would require it to admit to membership an employee "who admittedly was determined to destroy the union 'from the inside.'" Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> the accuracy of Respondent's characterization of Combs' activities, we reiterate that this does not provide an acceptable basis under section 7116(c) for denying membership to an otherwise qualified unit employee. We note that once Combs has been admitted to membership he will be subject to discipline by the Union for subsequent misconduct consistent with the requirements of section 7116(c).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2189 and Jarman</span>, 68 FLRA 374, 376-379 (2015) (Member Pizzella concurring), determined that a union committed a ULP by denying membership to an employee who was perceived as actively advocating the union's decertification, with the result that the union was directed to retroactively admit the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7116(c) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">For the purpose of [the Statute] it shall be [a ULP] for an exclusive representative to deny membership to any employee in the appropriate unit represented by such exclusive representative except for failure--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;to meet reasonable occupational standards uniformly required for admission, or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;to tender dues uniformly required as a condition of acquiring and retaining membership.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Authority precedent interpreting &#x00A7; 7116(c) differentiates between: (1) a union's denial of a bargaining-unit employee's <span class="Italic">initial</span> application for membership;[36] and (2) denial of membership by expelling a <span class="Italic">current</span> member[37] or denying readmission to a <span class="Italic">former</span> member of the union.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to denial of membership by expelling a current member[43] or denying readmission to a former member,[44] the Authority has held that unions may impose these forms of discipline if: (1) the discipline concerns the employee's actions while the employee was a member of the union imposing the discipline; and (2) the employee's actions "threaten[ed] or attack[ed] the union's existence as an institution."[45]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This case involves denying an employee initial membership in the Respondent--not expelling a current member or denying readmission of a former member. And there is no claim that the employee either failed to meet occupational standards uniformly required for admission or failed to tender dues. Thus, Authority precedent interpreting &#x00A7; 7116(c) supports finding that the Respondent violated that statutory section by denying the employee initial membership.[46]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 2344</span>, 45 FLRA at 1009-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent cites <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2419</span> (<span class="Italic">Local 2419</span>)[47] and claims that denying the employee membership was permissible discipline. But <span class="Italic">Local 2419</span> involved <span class="Italic">expulsion of an existing union member</span> (and officer) from the union.[49] Although the decision discussed the standards for "deny[ing] membership" in a union, it did so in the context of a union's denial of membership by <span class="Italic">expulsion</span>; it did not change the Authority's different standards for when a union can deny <span class="Italic">initial</span> membership to an employee.[50] Thus, <span class="Italic">Local 2419</span> does not support the Respondent's actions in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Respondent has not established that the Judge erred in finding a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Respondent argued before the Judge, and argues in its exceptions, that requiring it to admit the employee as a remedy for any violation of &#x00A7; 7116(c) would violate its freedom of association under the First Amendment. In this connection, the Respondent cites <span class="Italic">Boy Scouts of America &#x0026; Monmouth Council v. Dale</span> (<span class="Italic">Boy Scouts</span>)[52] for the proposition that the "forced inclusion" of the employee "infringes [its] freedom of expressive association," because the employee's presence would prevent it from advocating its viewpoints against decertification and "dual unionism." The Respondent argues that the freedom to associate includes the "freedom not to associate," which the Respondent claims would be violated by the employee's forced inclusion.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;530 U.S. 640 (2000).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge did not consider the Respondent's First Amendment argument, because she found that she did "not have the authority to review the constitutionality of the Statute." In that regard, she correctly determined that she did not have the authority to declare part of the Statute unconstitutional.[57] However, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has held that, when deciding among competing interpretations of the Statute, the Authority should "tak[e] into account the uncertain constitutionality of the Statute as interpreted one way but not another."[58] The court stated that by considering such constitutional implications up front, the Authority may avoid the unnecessary resolution of a constitutional question later.[59] Thus, we consider the Respondent's arguments concerning the constitutional implications of the Judge's application of &#x00A7; 7116(c).[60]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Boy Scouts</span>, the Supreme Court held that a state law violated the Boy Scouts' freedom of association.[61] In that case, the organization sought to exclude from membership an openly gay civil-rights activist who was also an assistant scoutmaster.[62] The Court stated that "[t]he forced inclusion of an unwanted person in a group infringes the group's freedom of expressive association if the presence of that person affects in a significant way the group's ability to advocate public or private viewpoints."[63] The Court found that including an openly gay assistant scoutmaster would inhibit the Boy Scouts' ability to advocate its viewpoint that homosexuality is not "morally straight."[64] The Court noted that, in other cases, where the inclusion of an unwanted person would not "materially interfere" with a group's ability to advocate its desired viewpoints, enforcement of a statute to require the person's inclusion did not violate the group's freedom of association.[65]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Boy Scouts</span> Court explained that a two-step analysis applies when evaluating whether a law, as applied to a particular group, violates the First Amendment.[66] Specifically, it must be determined whether: (1) the group engages in expressive activity; and (2) if so, whether inclusion of the unwanted person would "significantly burden" the group's ability to express its viewpoints.[67]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[67]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 653.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first step, it is undisputed that the Respondent engages in expressive activity, with its mission being "to advance its brand..., to engage in collective bargaining on behalf of the members it represents, and to promote and protect the fundamental tenets of unionism."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the second step, the Respondent argues that its constitution prohibits it from including members who advocate particular viewpoints. In support, the Respondent cites Article I, Section 5 of its constitution for the proposition that it is prohibited from including any person "who advocates dual unionism or supports movements or organizations inimical to the interests of the [Respondent]." However, the cited section actually states that "[a]ny <span class="Italic">member</span>" who advocates such ideas "shall not be eligible to <span class="Italic">hold office</span> in the [Respondent]," not that a bargaining-unit employee who holds such beliefs is precluded from initial membership outright. The Respondent also cites Article L, Section 3 of its constitution, which permits expulsion of a <span class="Italic">member</span> for improper conduct, but the Respondent does not explain how Article L is applicable to nonmembers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As further support for its First Amendment argument, the Respondent contends that the "defamatory and insidious" Facebook note was evidence of the employee's "support for an organization inimical to [the Respondent] and was encouragement of [decertification] and dual unionism." The Respondent argues that, therefore, the Authority should defer to its belief that the employee's inclusion would impair its expression.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the <span class="Italic">Boy Scouts</span> Court noted that it would give some deference to a group's view about what would impair its expressive ability,[76] because it defers to a group's assertion as to <span class="Italic">what its viewpoints are</span>, the Court stated that it is not sufficient for an organization to assert simply that "mere acceptance of a member from a particular group would impair its message."[77] The Court explained that if the evidence fails to demonstrate that including the unwanted person would affect "in any significant way the existing members' ability to carry out their various purposes," then the inclusion of that person does not infringe the group's First Amendment rights.[78]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Respondent argues that the Authority must defer to its belief that the Facebook note presented a threat to its existence. But <span class="Italic">Boy Scouts</span> does not support that proposition, and the Respondent does not cite any other authority that does. Additionally, as discussed previously, although the Facebook note mentioned generally that it is possible to decertify a union, the Judge found that the employee: (1) was not a member of the Respondent or in the bargaining unit represented by the Respondent when he posted the Facebook note; (2) never actively pursued a decertification petition against the Respondent; and (3) discussed the Respondent on his Facebook page only once--when he wrote the Facebook note. The Respondent provides no basis for finding that the Judge erred in this regard. And the Respondent offers no evidence that granting the employee membership would "significantly burden" its ability to advocate its viewpoints.[82] Further, as stated previously, once the employee is a member, if he engages in actions that "threaten or attack the [Respondent]'s existence as an institution," Authority precedent supports a conclusion that he may be subject to discipline by the Respondent.[83] Accordingly, we find that the Respondent has not demonstrated that requiring it to admit the employee to membership would violate its freedom of association.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Bradley</span>, 46 FLRA 1048, 1056 (1992) (ALJ Decision), adopted an ALJ Decision that discussed the responsibility of a union to admit individuals who pay dues and meet reasonable, uniform, occupational standards. The ALJ noted that a union must follow its constitutional requirements, however inconvenient to the union, to expel an individual from union membership. If those procedures are not followed, membership cannot be denied to the employee who tenders dues and meets occupational standards. A sequel to the 1992 decision in <span class="Italic">Bradley</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Bradley</span>, 53 FLRA 364, 369 (1997), concluded that a union may discipline former members for misconduct that occurred while the individual was a member.
