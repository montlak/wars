<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-221"><span class="space">d.</span> Postal Service Rules; <span class="Italic">Latham; Cronin</span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The USPS National Reassessment Process led to many people being moved out of positions, and to many Board appeals. One resulting issue, resolved after the NRP was discontinued, was whether the Board could enforce the USPS internal rules governing realignment of employees in the course of a restoration rights appeals. Until it changed its position a decade later and overruled its precedent in <span class="Italic">Cronin v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 13 (2022), <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Board decided it could do so in <span class="Italic">Latham v. USPS</span>, 117 MSPR 400, 404-39 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-84, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LATHAM_JAMES_C_DA_0353_10_0408_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_693051.pdf">2012 MSPB 20</a> (2012) (Member Rose dissenting), and determined that under the NRP the Board would assess whether restoration rights for partially recovered employees were arbitrarily denied by considering factors that include (1) are the tasks of the appellant's former modified assignment still being performed by other employees? (2) if so, did those employees lack sufficient work prior to absorbing the appellant's modified duties? (3) if so, did the reassignment of that work violate any other law, rule, or regulation?:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These appeals present the question of whether the agency's own internal rules regarding the return to duty in modified assignments of compensably injured individuals[2] are enforceable by the Board in a restoration appeal under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). For the reasons set forth below, we answer in the affirmative....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The term "compensably injured individual" refers to an employee who incurs an injury in the performance of his duties, or suffers a disease proximately caused by his employment, which is covered under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102. The Federal Employees' Compensation Act is a comprehensive statutory scheme which provides federal and Postal Service employees who are injured in the performance of their duties, including those who suffer from occupational disease, with workers' compensation benefits, including wage and medical benefits, as well as with rights to job restoration under certain circumstances. These appeals concern only the appellants' employment restoration claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Background</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants are employees of the agency encumbering various positions of record in their respective crafts. The appellants suffered compensable injuries that rendered them unable to perform the essential functions of their positions. The agency subsequently returned the appellants to duty in modified assignments in which they performed tasks less physically demanding than those previously required of them.[3] Between November 30, 2009, and September 23, 2010, the agency discontinued the appellants' limited duty assignments pursuant to its National Reassessment Process (NRP), informing them that there were no operationally necessary tasks available for them to perform within their medical restrictions, and directing them to request leave and not to report again for duty unless they were informed that such work is available.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Modified assignments" are assignments afforded to individuals who, because of compensable injury, are unable to perform the essential functions of their positions. They consist of tasks that do not necessarily comprise the essential functions of any established position. U.S. Postal Service Handbook EL-505, Injury Compensation, app. C (1995). Modified assignments are divided between "rehabilitation" assignments for employees whose work limitations are expected to be permanent and "limited duty" assignments for employees whose work limitations are not expected to be permanent. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> ch. 7, 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The stated purpose of the NRP was to review current modified assignments within the agency in order to ensure that they consist only of "operationally necessary tasks" within the employees' medical restrictions. The agency has since discontinued the NRP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of the five appellants filed a Board appeal and requested a hearing. They argued, among other things, that the discontinuation of their modified assignments violated the agency's own internal rules, specifically the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) and Injury Compensation Handbook EL-505 (EL-505). They requested that the Board order them restored to their modified assignments with back pay.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants and several amici responded, arguing that the agency is required to follow its own rules, including the ELM, and that the agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously when it fails to do so.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finding that the issues presented in these appeals directly concern the interpretation of an OPM regulation, the Board also requested that OPM provide an advisory opinion addressing the question of whether an agency acts arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration to a partially recovered individual when such denial violates the agency's own internal rules, such as the ELM. Latham PFR File, Tab 7; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(A). OPM responded in the affirmative, explaining that agencies are required to follow their own rules, and that section 353.304(c) contemplates that an agency's failure to follow its own rules concerning the restoration of a partially recovered individual would be arbitrary and capricious even if those rules go beyond the "minimum" restoration obligation set forth in section 353.301(d).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that federal employees who suffer compensable injuries enjoy certain rights to be restored to their previous or comparable positions.[7] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); <span class="Italic">Tat v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). Congress has explicitly granted OPM the authority to issue regulations governing agencies' obligations in this regard. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). Pursuant to this authority, OPM has issued regulations requiring agencies to make certain efforts toward restoring compensably injured individuals to duty, depending on the timing and extent of their recovery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301; <span class="Italic">see Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 92, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). With respect to "partially recovered" individuals, defined in the regulations as those who, though not ready to resume the full range of their regular duties have recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements, OPM's regulations require agencies to "make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102, .301(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The statute itself uses the term "retention rights" rather than "restoration rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151. It seems that OPM's predecessor agency, the Civil Service Commission, applied the term "restoration" to the retention of compensably injured individuals because Congress had previously applied it to the similar rights that it afforded to individuals released from military duty, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3551 (1966), and the Commission desired to treat both statutory schemes with the same set of official guidance, see Employee and Labor Relations Manual, chapter 353 (1975). In other words, the term "restoration" was already in established use in a similar context at the time that Congress first afforded retention rights to compensably injured individuals. Since "restoration" has been used synonymously with "retention" for over 40 years by the agency charged with administering the statute, there should be no confusion on the matter at this point despite the disconnect between the language in the statute and in the implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations also provide Board appeal rights to individuals affected by restoration decisions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. With respect to partially recovered individuals, these regulations provide as follows: "An individual who is partially recovered from a compensable injury may appeal to MSPB for a determination of whether the agency is acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently issued a decision holding that, in order to establish jurisdiction over a restoration appeal under that section, an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that: (1) He was absent from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) he recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of him; (3) the agency denied his request for restoration;[8] and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious because of the agency's failure to perform its obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 659 F.3d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

However, resolving that issue requires, as a threshold matter, answering the fundamental question of law presented in these appeals, i.e., whether the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) may encompass a claim that an agency's violation of its internal rules resulted in an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration. For the following reasons, we answer that question in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Office of Personnel Management's Regulations Provide That a Denial of Restoration Is Per Se Arbitrary and Capricious When It Is the Result of the Agency's Violation of Its Own Agency-Specific Restoration Rules</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over restoration appeals derives entirely from a regulation promulgated by OPM at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304. As explained above, our jurisdiction in the case of partially recovered individuals extends only to cases in which the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> 659 F.3d at 1103-04; <span class="Italic">see Chen,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18. Under OPM's regulations, a partially recovered individual's substantive rights with regard to restoration are set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), which provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Agencies must make every effort to restore in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in each case, an individual who has partially recovered from a compensable injury and who is able to return to limited duty. At a minimum, this would mean treating these employees substantially the same as other handicapped individuals under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act, and the Board applies them to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 36 n.3 (2007); 29 C.F.R. 1614.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously found that the "minimum" requirement of this section is that an agency must search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which it can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider him for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) <span class="Italic">(citing Sapp v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 189, 193-94 (1997)); <span class="Italic">see also Green v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. 661, 668 (1991) (the Rehabilitation Act does not require an agency to accommodate a disabled employee by permanently assigning him to light duty tasks when those tasks do not comprise a complete and separate position); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC Docket No. 03990006, 1999 WL 91429 (Feb. 11, 1999) (an agency is not required to create a new position to accommodate an employee's disability). However, section 353.301(d) does not state whether an agency may voluntarily assume greater obligations <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> restoring partially recovered individuals beyond the "minimum" requirements of that section, and if it does so, whether such obligations are enforceable by the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). Because of the potentially significant impact of these appeals, the Board sought an advisory opinion from OPM as to the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(d) and .304(c). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(e)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's advisory opinion addresses this matter unequivocally, stating that the phrase "at a minimum" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) anticipates that an agency may adopt additional agency-specific requirements pertaining to the restoration of partially recovered individuals and that the regulation requires "compliance with an agency's own rules as well as the provisions of OPM regulation, at least where they confer additional protections or benefits on the employee. OPM further advised as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is OPM's opinion that if the Postal Service established a rule that provided the partially recovered employees with greater restoration rights than the "minimum" described in the OPM regulations, the Postal Service is required to meticulously follow that rule. To do otherwise would be arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of OPM's regulation conferring jurisdiction on the Board at section 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that OPM's interpretation of its own regulation is controlling because it is consistent with the plain language of the regulation and is not clearly erroneous. <span class="Italic">See Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.,</span> 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); <span class="Italic">Reizenstein v. Shinseki,</span> 583 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2009). None of the parties or amici dispute OPM's interpretation of its regulations. We therefore find that, under the terms of OPM's regulations, the Board has jurisdiction over appeals concerning denials of restoration to partially recovered individuals where the denial results from a violation of the agency's own internal rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Federal Circuit recently recognized, a denial of restoration is rendered arbitrary and capricious (and hence a matter over which the Board has jurisdiction) by an agency's failure to perform its obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> 659 F.3d at 1104. OPM has clearly and unequivocally expressed its view that an agency's obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) include those which it voluntarily assumes even if they afford greater protections than the "minimum" requirements of that regulation. <span class="Italic">See Vitarelli v. Seaton,</span> 359 U.S. 535, 545 (1959);<span class="Italic"> Dodson v. Department of the Army,</span> 988 F.2d 1199, 1204 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Plezia v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 125, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). We therefore have no difficulty concluding that the Postal Service's alleged failure to adhere to its own regulations in effecting the NRP as to these appellants can be the basis for finding an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction under the terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4487"></span>As a final matter regarding the meaning of OPM's restoration regulations, we must address the issue of whether OPM's use of the term "arbitrary and capricious" was meant to exclude certain types of erroneous denials of restoration from the Board's jurisdiction. OPM's predecessor agency, the Civil Service Commission, introduced the term "arbitrarily and capriciously" into the governing regulations in 1978 as part of a new section intended to "clarify[&#8197;] the appeal rights of employees who are not entitled to mandatory restoration": "Injured employees who partially recover within 1 year of the date they begin receiving compensation may appeal to the Commission for a determination of whether their agencies are acting arbitrarily and capriciously in denying them restoration." 43 Fed. Reg. 2,379 (Jan. 17, 1978) (codified in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a)(3) (1979)). These appeal rights differed from those that the Commission afforded to fully recovered individuals to the extent that they did not offer appeal rights regarding allegedly improper restorations. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 242, 244 (1981); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a)(1)(iv), (3) (1979). The Commission, however, does not appear to have explained whether the term "arbitrarily and capriciously" was meant to limit such individuals' appeal rights even further, as <span class="Italic">amicus</span> APWU argues, to situations in which the denial of restoration resulted from an utter disregard for or intentional violation of the agency's restoration obligations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, we do not believe that the "arbitrary and capricious" standard was meant to impose such limitations. First, we find that the APWU's proposed interpretation would undermine the coherency of the regulatory scheme as a whole. <span class="Italic">See generally Lengerich v. Department of the Interior,</span> 454 F.3d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (a regulatory provision is interpreted in the context of the regulation as a whole, reconciling the section in question with sections related to it). Specifically, the APWU's proposed reading of the language would relieve agencies of the consequences of good faith violations of their substantive restoration obligations in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) itself. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 16-18 (describing an agency's minimum restoration obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)). We find it unlikely that OPM would have imposed these obligations on agencies without the intention that they be enforced. Second, we are unaware of any practical or policy purpose that such a restrictive provision might serve. It would decrease protections for compensably injured individuals without decreasing the administrative burden for agencies, and it would likely complicate litigation significantly by injecting agency intent as an additional element of proof. Third, OPM stated in its advisory opinion that, in order to avoid acting arbitrarily and capriciously, an agency must adhere to its substantive restoration obligations and do so "meticulously. OPM's description of its regulation does not permit an agency to deny restoration to a partially recovered individual through good faith errors. We find that OPM's interpretation of its own regulation in this regard is consistent with the language of the regulation and is not plainly erroneous; we therefore defer to it. <span class="Italic">See Seminole Rock,</span> 325 U.S. at 414; <span class="Italic">White v. United States,</span> 543 F.3d 1330, 1333-34 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Connolly v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 99 M.S.P.R. 422, &#x00B6; 15 (2005). For all these reasons, we agree with the appellants that an agency's failure to adhere to its substantive restoration obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), including any restoration obligations that it has voluntarily adopted, is <span class="Italic">per se</span> "arbitrary and capricious" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Office of Personnel Management's Regulations Concerning the Restoration of Partially Recovered Individuals Do Not Conflict With Statute</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, however, raises a more fundamental challenge to the Board's jurisdiction in these cases. Specifically, it argues that the regulations conferring jurisdiction should be declared invalid as ultra vires for two reasons: (1) The governing statute provides restoration rights only to fully recovered individuals and does not authorize OPM to provide restoration rights to partially recovered individuals; and (2) the governing statute provides restoration rights only to established "positions" and does not authorize OPM to provide restoration rights to modified assignments. <span class="Italic">See Bracey v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 236 F.3d 1356, 1358-62 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (modified assignments in the Postal Service do not constitute "positions" for disability retirement purposes); <span class="Italic">Ancheta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2003) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act gives the Board original jurisdiction to review OPM regulations and declare them invalid if their application requires the commission of a prohibited personnel practice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f). However, unlike federal district courts, the Board does not have jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to review OPM regulations for the purpose of determining whether they exceed the statutory grant of authority. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(C) (under the APA, a court may hold unlawful and set aside an agency regulation on the basis that it exceeds statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 184, 189 n.3 (2000) (the Board's authority to declare a regulation invalid does not extend to challenges to OPM regulations that could be made on grounds other than those identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we agree with the agency that the issue of the Board's jurisdiction is always before it and that the Board has the authority to determine its own jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Parrish v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 485 F.3d 1359, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Moreover, it is likewise true that the Board has adopted a rule of adjudication that the provisions of a statute will prevail where there is a conflict between the statute and a regulation. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Department of Justice,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 59, 67 (1996). We discern no reason to forego application of that rule, and its ensuing analysis, when the issue concerns the Board's jurisdiction. Thus, we agree with the agency that if an OPM regulation purporting to confer jurisdiction on the Board conflicts with a statutory prohibition against such jurisdiction, then the Board must defer to the statute in making its jurisdictional determination and decline to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal regardless of whether the regulation is valid under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(f). The Board, however, will apply this rule of adjudication narrowly, limiting its inquiry in such cases to whether there is an affirmative conflict between the statute and the regulation, regardless of whether the regulation might otherwise have exceeded the statutory grant of authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 20 (2011) (while not invalidating OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(10), the Board "decline[d] to follow them" to the extent that they conflicted with the Board's statutory obligation to hear appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d)). The Board's jurisdiction is not defined by statute only, but by regulation as well. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), 7701(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, we will examine whether 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 precludes Board jurisdiction over restoration claims of partially recovered individuals such as to render unenforceable OPM's regulatory grant of jurisdiction to the Board at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). As always, we begin with the plain language of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall immediately and unconditionally accord the employee, if the injury or disability has been overcome within one year after the date of commencement of compensation or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States, the right to resume his former or an equivalent position, as well as all other attendant rights which the employee would have had, or acquired, in his former position had he not been injured or disabled, including the rights to tenure, promotion, and safeguards in reductions-in-force procedures, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;the department or agency which was the last employer shall, if the injury or disability is overcome within a period of more than one year after the date of commencement of compensation, make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position within such department or agency, or within any other department or agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); <span class="Italic">see Schreiber v. Burlington Northern, Inc.,</span> 472 U.S. 1, 5 (1985) (the starting point for statutory interpretation is the text of the statute itself). The agency argues that the statute unambiguously limits restoration rights to fully recovered individuals because it provides for restoration to the "former" or "equivalent" position for employees who have "overcome" their disabilities. The agency contends that "it is unmistakable that 'overcome' must mean that an employee has recovered to the point that he or she is able to perform his or her former position," and that the statute's inclusion of "or equivalent" does not alter this meaning because the only reasonable reading of the statute is that Congress intended that an employee be restored "to a position with equivalent status, pay, and benefits [only] if his or her former position is not available. According to the agency, it would be unreasonable to interpret the term "or equivalent" "to expand the range of positions with respect to which an employee had a right of placement based on his or her degree of recovery."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the statute does not, on its face, provide restoration rights to partially recovered individuals. The Civil Service Commission appears to have recognized this when issuing its official guidance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Public Law 93-416 (the 1974 amendments to the Federal Employees Compensation Act) directs the Commission to issue regulations governing the civil service retention rights of employees who sustain a compensable injury or disability. Although employees' right to restoration under Public Law 93-416 does not vest until they have fully recovered, the legislative history of this law makes clear that Congress intended the Commission to provide certain restoration rights for employees who are partially recovered and who are able to resume limited duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), Chapter 353, &#x00A7; 1-3(b) (Mar. 6, 1978). In <span id="Page_4488"></span>addition, we note that a prior version of OPM's restoration regulations distinguished between partially recovered individuals and individuals "with a right to restoration under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.401(a)(1), (3) (1981), thereby implying that partially recovered individuals have no restoration rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 <span class="Italic">per se</span>, <span class="Italic">see Johnson,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. at 244.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the fact that the statute does not explicitly define the rights of partially recovered individuals does not necessarily mean that Congress intended to preclude OPM from doing so by regulation. In <span class="Italic">American Trucking Associations v. United States,</span> 344 U.S. 298, 309-10 (1953), the Supreme Court eloquently explained why the absence of statutory language addressing a particular concern does not necessarily indicate congressional intent to limit a regulating agency's authority to address it:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As a matter of principle, we might agree with appellants' contentions if we thought it a reasonable canon of interpretation that the draftsmen of acts delegating agency powers, as a practical and realistic matter, can or do include specific consideration of every evil sought to be corrected. But no great acquaintance with practical affairs is required to know that such prescience, either in fact or in the minds of Congress, does not exist. Its very absence, moreover, is precisely one of the reasons why regulatory agencies such as the [Interstate Commerce Commission] are created, for it is the fond hope of their authors that they bring to their work the expert's familiarity with industry conditions which members of the delegating legislatures cannot be expected to possess.</p>

Federal Election Commission,</span> 114 F.3d 1309, 1312 (1st Cir. 1997) (agencies often are allowed through rulemaking to regulate beyond the express substantive directives of the statute, so long as the statute is not contradicted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find nothing in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 explicitly prohibiting the provision of restoration rights to partially recovered individuals, and we disagree with the agency's argument that statutory language regarding restoration to the "former" or "equivalent" position must be read to preclude OPM from affording restoration rights to individuals who are unable to perform the essential functions of their former positions. Section 8151(b)(2) itself provides for restoration through a reemployment priority mechanism--a process which may result in restoration to a position that is not even arguably "equivalent" to the former one. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 302.303, 330.202 (regulations governing reemployment priority in the excepted and competitive services respectively). We cannot find OPM's regulations contrary to statute on the basis that they provide restoration rights to individuals who have not recovered sufficiently to perform in their former positions where the statute itself provides for restoration through a mechanism that does not necessarily require recovery to such an extent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b). It would make little sense to require an injured employee to have recovered sufficiently to perform the duties of his former position in order to be eligible for restoration to a position that might have different physical requirements. In any event, although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151 does not expressly mention partially recovered individuals, we find it significant that Congress has not amended FECA in light of OPM's (and the Civil Service Commission's) longstanding extensions of rights to partially recovered individuals, thereby indicating Congressional approval of OPM's interpretation of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Zenith Radio Corp. v. United States,</span> 437 U.S. 443, 450 (1978) (a longstanding and consistent administrative interpretation is entitled to considerable weight).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the statute's legislative history supports our conclusion that FECA does not preclude OPM's regulatory extension of Board appeal rights to partially recovered individuals. In particular, it provides that "the Civil Service Commission is authorized to promulgate regulations covering the rights of employees whos[e] injuries or disabilities are partially overcome, as well as those who have fully overcome their disabilities." S. Rep. No. 93-1081 at 4 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341, 5344. That history further confirms that OPM's regulations are consistent with the purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151, i.e., to ensure that "injured or disabled employees of all covered departments and agencies, including those of the United States Postal Service, be treated in a fair and equitable manner." S. Rep. No. 93-1081 at 1 (1974), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5341. Our holding also comports with the well-established canon of statutory construction that remedial statutes should be broadly construed in favor of those whom they are meant to protect. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 142, &#x00B6; 8 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also contends that the statute prohibits OPM from requiring agencies to restore compensably injured individuals to anything other than a vacant funded position. We recognize that the statute speaks in terms of restoration to a "position," and although the Postal Service is not subject to the Civil Service position classification system found in 5 U.S.C. chapter 51, for the reasons explained above, modified assignments are not the equivalent of title 5 "positions." Nevertheless, notwithstanding its litigation position in this case, we find that the agency itself has considered such return to work "restoration" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151. <span class="Italic">See</span> ELM &#x00A7; 546.11 ("The Postal Service has legal responsibilities to employees with job-related disabilities under 5 U.S.C. 8151 and the OPM regulations as outlined below."). Furthermore, OPM has indicated in its advisory opinion that it interprets "restoration" under FECA to include return to duty in a modified assignment. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) ("light duty" work constitutes restoration). Considering that FECA does not affirmatively prohibit restoration to work that does not comprise the essential functions of a complete and separate position, and the term "position" is not defined anywhere in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b), we will not second-guess OPM's decision to interpret the term more broadly than it is used in 5 U.S.C. chapter 51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we find that this argument poses something of a red herring. As explained above, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6; 12, the Board has never interpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) itself to require restoration to anything other than a vacant funded position. The regulation does, however, as confirmed in OPM's advisory opinion, permit an agency to restore a partially recovered individual to work in tasks that do not comprise the essential functions of an established position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) (describing the restoration obligations set forth therein as "minimum" obligations). Pursuant to ELM &#x00A7; 546 and EL-505, chapters 7 and 11, the agency has agreed to restore partially recovered individuals to duty in whatever tasks are available regardless of whether those tasks comprise the essential functions of an established position. An agency is required to follow its own rules regardless of whether those rules go beyond the requirements of government-wide statutes and regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vitarelli,</span> 359 U.S. at 545 (1959). OPM has merely given the Board jurisdiction to enforce those rules in the context of a restoration appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We must disagree with the dissent's approach to the issue because even if the agency's modified duty provisions could be characterized as "substantive" rather than "procedural" in nature, our authority to review the agency's compliance with them stems not from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) but from 5 C.F.R. 353.301(d) and .304(c) themselves. As OPM explained in its advisory opinion, section 353.301(d) was intended to require an agency's adherence to its own restoration rules, and section 353.304(c) was intended to vest the Board with jurisdiction over appeals in which agencies have been alleged to violate those rules.<span class="Italic"> See supra</span> &#x00B6; 13. We see nothing to prevent the Board from taking jurisdiction over an appeal on this basis.[17]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;Moreover, even if the Board were to decide that it lacks the authority to review alleged violations of the agency's modified duty rules under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c), such review could nonetheless occur under a constructive suspension theory of the case. <span class="Italic">See McLain v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 526, &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (when an employee requests work within his medical restrictions and the agency is bound by policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available work to the employee but fails to do so, his continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board). Although many Postal Service employees lack the right to appeal a constructive suspension to the Board, others, such as appellant Latham, who is a preference eligible veteran, do have the right to appeal a constructive suspension. <span class="Italic">See generally McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 996 F.2d 1193, 1199 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (describing the categories of Postal Service employees who have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75). Of course, in <span class="Italic">Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22 (2010), we found that the better approach is to adjudicate such constructive suspension claims in the context of the comprehensive scheme of restoration rights. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439 (1988). However, our decision in <span class="Italic">Kinglee</span> does not necessarily foreclose the possibility of a constructive suspension claim if the Board is precluded from considering the full scope of an appellant's restoration claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, we find that OPM's regulations regarding the restoration of partially recovered individuals do not conflict with statute. We are therefore not compelled by statute to refrain from exercising jurisdiction over appeals brought under those regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency and some of the amici argue, however, that even if the Board has jurisdiction as a legal matter over restoration appeals concerning violations of the agency's modified duty rules, the Board should still decline to exercise such jurisdiction. They argue that matters related to violations of the ELM and the EL-505 are essentially contract disputes, which are better handled through negotiated grievance procedures, and that the Board should avoid the possibility of issuing decisions that might conflict with arbitration decisions concerning the same issues. However, as the agency itself points out, Congress established a personnel system for the Postal Service that is unique among federal agencies. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719. Among other things, Postal Service employees are not covered by the election of remedies provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(d), and they have the right to file both a grievance and a Board appeal concerning the same agency action. <span class="Italic">Hall v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 26 M.S.P.R. 233, 236 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also Anderson v. <span id="Page_4489"></span>U.S. Postal Service,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 558, &#x00B6; 4 (2008) (unlike federal employees in title 5 agencies, a Postal Service employee does not have a right to Board review of an arbitration decision because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 does not apply to the Postal Service). We do not have discretion to decline consideration of a live controversy that is timely filed and within our jurisdiction. Although the possibility of inconsistent decisions is heightened by the parallel remedies available to Postal Service employees, this concern does not empower us simply to summarily refuse to consider appeals from Postal Service employees.[18] <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal Service v. Gregory,</span> 534 U.S. 1, 10 (2001) (although the Board may sometimes reach a different conclusion than an arbitrator, this possibility is the result of the parallel review structures set forth by statute). We also note that the right to a Board appeal is personal to an appellant, whereas the right to grievance and arbitration belongs to the union, and the union's decision on whether to pursue a grievance to its conclusion is not entirely within the grievant's control. For the same reasons, we disagree with the agency's argument that the Board should decline to exercise jurisdiction over these appeals out of concern for interfering with the related functions of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[18]&#x2003;Rather, the Board has historically sought to minimize the possibility of inconsistent decisions by deferring to arbitral interpretations of the collective bargaining agreements at issue in appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 47 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Agency's Modified Duty Rules Provide That It May Not Discontinue a Modified Assignment Unless the Duties of That Assignment Go Away or Need to Be Transferred to Other Employees Who Would Otherwise Lack Sufficient Work</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine whether the agency has violated its internal restoration rules in a given case, we must first determine what those rules provide. It appears to be undisputed that the agency's rules require it to offer modified assignments to partially recovered individuals whenever work is available and within their medical restrictions. The issue of when work is "available," however, is not entirely clear. It appears that the agency's practice for decades has been to make work available to partially recovered individuals under practically all circumstances, even though the plain language of the ELM suggests that the right to a modified assignment is not absolute.&#8197;...After reviewing the extensive evidence and argument that we have received in these appeals, it appears to us that the issue of when a given task is "available" to a partially recovered individual who is currently out of work remains unsettled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of these appeals, however, concerns an individual who was out of work at the time the agency denied him restoration. They all concern employees who were performing in modified assignments up until the time that the agency discontinued them based on the alleged lack of available work. The applicability of the agency's rules in this situation is clear, and they have been applied consistently in all of the arbitration decisions that we have reviewed. Looking to these decisions as guidance, <span class="Italic">see Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 47 (2007), we find that, under the ELM and the EL-505, the agency may discontinue a modified assignment consisting of tasks within an employee's medical restrictions only where the duties of that assignment no longer need to be performed by anyone or those duties need to be transferred to other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work, <span class="Italic">See In re Arbitration between U.S. Postal Service and National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> Case No. E06N-4E-C 09370199, 32, 35 (2010) (Eisenmenger, Arb.); <span class="Italic">In re Arbitration between U.S. Postal Service and National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> Case No. E06N-4E-C 09419348, 6 (2010) (Duffy, Arb.); <span class="Italic">In re Arbitration between U.S. Postal Service and National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> Case No. B01N-4B-C 06189348, 17-18 (2010) (LaLonde, Arb.);<span class="Italic"> In re Arbitration between U.S. Postal Service and American Postal Workers Union,</span> Case No. E06TG-1E-C 07186076, 7 (2010) (Monat, Arb.). We therefore overrule <span class="Italic">Soto v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 95, &#x00B6; 11 (2010), and <span class="Italic">Hunt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 11 (2010), to the extent that we found that the Postal Service "has the authority to economize its operations by consolidating the tasks being performed by limited duty employees and reassigning them to the non-limited duty employees who would be otherwise performing them." Although federal agencies may generally retain such authority, we find that the Postal Service has adopted rules that severely constrain its ability in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given that work is generally fungible, in any particular case, there may be some practical problems involved in determining whether the work of a particular limited duty assignment has actually "gone away." For example, there may be 80 hours worth of rewrapping damaged mail that needs to be performed every week at a given facility and divided between two modified duty employees. If 40 hours worth of that work goes away, this may require the agency to eliminate one limited duty assignment.[19] OPM's regulations do not address the issue of how the agency must deal with competing restoration rights in this situation, and we find that the agency is free to handle the matter as it sees fit as long as it does not violate any law, rule, or regulation in doing so.[20] There may also arise a situation in which some of the work previously performed by non-modified duty employees has gone away but the work being performed by modified duty employees has not. When faced with the choice between transferring the work of modified duty employees to non-modified duty employees or reducing the non-modified duty employees' work hours, the agency will likely be authorized to transfer the work as long as it does not, for example, violate any contractual provisions limiting its authority to combine work in different crafts, occupational groups, or levels into one job. <span class="Italic">See</span> Case No. E06TG-1E-C 07186076, 7 (2010) (the agency did not violate the ELM when it discontinued the appellant's modified assignment and assigned his former duties to full-time employees who were underburdened because of a decreasing workload); ELM &#x00A7; 546.222 (modified assignments must not impair the seniority rights of part-time flexible employees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[19]&#x2003;It is undisputed that the agency is not required to restore partially recovered individuals to "make work" assignments, to featherbedding jobs, or to work performing tasks that do not actually need to be done. There has been much argument from the appellants that the agency is not entitled to require that the work they perform be "operationally necessary," but none of them concedes that the work that they were performing was not operationally necessary. The dispute about operational necessity, rather than pertaining to whether the agency is required to assign partially recovered individuals to unnecessary work, appears to pertain to the issue of whether the agency is entitled to economize its operations by taking the appellants' allegedly necessary work and assigning it to other employees. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 31.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;There used to be a regulatory provision addressing this issue, but OPM eliminated that section on the basis that "conflicting restoration rights should rarely be an issue." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.305 (1978); 53 Fed. Reg. 857 (Jan. 14, 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the evidence and argument that we have received, we agree with the parties and amici that the "availability" of modified work for a given partially recovered individual will be entirely dependent upon the facts and circumstances of his particular case, and we will not attempt to address how the agency's modified duty rules might apply in every possible scenario. Nevertheless, based on our understanding of the agency's rules as described above, we find that the following line of inquiry provides an appropriate framework for analyzing the instant appeals: (1) Are the tasks of the appellant's former modified assignment still being performed by other employees? (2) If so, did those employees lack sufficient work prior to absorbing the appellant's modified duties? (3) If so, did the reassignment of that work violate any other law, rule, or regulation, such as the examples explained in paragraph 32 above? In this regard, evidence pertaining to general declines in mail volume and displacement of non-injured workers will likely be immaterial in the absence of a connection between these matters and the availability of the appellant's former job duties or the duties of the employees who absorbed the appellant's former tasks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have looked to arbitration decisions for the purpose of interpreting the agency's modified duty rules, we wish to emphasize that the Board is not an arbitrator. When we apply the agency's modified duty rules, we will do so in the context of the procedural and evidentiary framework established by our regulations and precedential case law, and we will not enforce these rules except as specifically authorized by statute and regulation. For example, arbitrators have employed a burden-shifting framework to decide modified duty cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span> Case No. E06N-4E-C 09370199 at 26-29. The Board does not use a burden-shifting approach. In a 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) Board appeal, the burden of proof remains always with the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Carlos,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 553, &#x00B6; 7. In addition, the Board will not examine whether the agency followed the "pecking order" for job assignments set forth at ELM &#x00A7; 546.142(a), or whether the agency minimized "any adverse or disruptive impact" in assigning modified duty as required by that section because these matters pertain to the details and circumstances of a restoration actually accomplished and are therefore outside the Board's jurisdiction.[22] <span class="Italic">See Booker v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 982 F.2d 517, 519 (Fed. Cir. 1992); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c);<span class="Italic"> cf. In re Arbitration between U.S. Postal Service and National Association of Letter Carriers,</span> Case No. E06N-4E-C 10001623, 8 (2010) (Monat, Arb.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;The Board is only concerned with whether the agency actually denied an appellant restoration following partial recovery from a compensable injury and whether that denial was arbitrary and capricious.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA-0353-10-0408-I-1</p>

There is some evidence that there was a lack of work for Clerk Craft employees at the time the agency discontinued the appellant's modified assignment, as these employees were undergoing "excessing" pursuant to Article 12 of the National Agreement Between the American Postal Workers Union and the U.S. Postal Service. However, there is no evidence that any of the appellant's duties were absorbed by Clerk Craft employees or that the lack of work in the Clerk Craft otherwise affected the availability of work for the appellant. Rather, as explained above, the record shows that the appellant's former duties were absorbed by supervisory employees, and there is no evidence that these employees otherwise lacked sufficient work. For these reasons, we find that the appellant has established by preponderant evidence the discontinuation of his modified assignment violated the agency's rules regarding its modified duty obligations. We therefore find that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious.</p>

We also find that there is no evidence to show that the duties of the appellant's modified assignment have gone away. Although there was testimony to show that mail volume in the appellant's facility has declined in general, there is no evidence that there is insufficient work for the employees who would normally be performing the tasks of the appellant's limited duty assignment. In fact, the record shows that those duties are still being performed by other employees and that those employees are not even able to cover all of the work during their regular tours of duty. For these reasons, we find that the appellant has established that the discontinuation of her modified assignment violated the agency's rules regarding its modified duty obligations. We therefore find that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious.</p>

The appellant in this case made no allegation that the tasks of her modified assignment are still being performed by other employees or that they have otherwise not gone away.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination and retaliation for prior equal employment opportunity activity, we agree with the administrative judge that the Board lacks jurisdiction over such claims <span class="Italic">per se</span> in the absence of an otherwise appealable action. ID at 6; <span class="Italic">see McDonnell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6; 11 (1999). However, we find that the administrative judge should have considered the appellant's claims in this regard to the extent that they pertain to the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">Cf. Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (at the jurisdictional stage of an involuntary retirement appeal, the Board will consider allegations of discrimination to the extent that they bear on the issue of voluntariness);<span class="Italic"> Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1996) (same). For the same reason that a denial of restoration based on a violation of an agency's own restoration rules is arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c), we find that a denial of restoration based on prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity is also arbitrary and capricious.[27]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[27]&#x2003;The administrative judge characterized the appellant's disability discrimination claim as an "affirmative defense." We think that the concept of an "affirmative defense" fits better in matters such as adverse action appeals where the agency bears the burden of proof on the merits. In restoration appeals, claims of discrimination and reprisal are better understood as independent claims or alternative ways for an appellant to show that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the appellant in this case failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the denial of restoration was based on discrimination or reprisal. Specifically, the fact that the appellant had equal employment opportunity complaints pending when the agency discontinued her assignment does not give rise to an inference of retaliatory motive in light of the fact that "almost all" similarly situated individuals were subjected to similar actions, as the appellant herself stated. In addition, the agency's decision not to accommodate the appellant's medical condition by creating a unique position for her does not give rise to an inference of disability discrimination because the Rehabilitation Act does not require such accommodations. <span class="Italic">See Green,</span> 47 M.S.P.R. at 668. Therefore, even considering the appellant's allegations of disability discrimination and reprisal for protected equal employment opportunity activity, we find that she has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious so as to entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Bledsoe,</span> 659 F.3d at 1106.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious when she identified particular tasks within her medical restrictions and alleged that they are available for her to perform. It is immaterial that these tasks do not comprise the essential functions of a vacant funded position. The agency is obligated to provide the appellant with work in the form of a modified assignment as long as that work is available and within her medical restrictions, regardless of whether it comprises the essential functions of any established position. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 26; <span class="Italic">cf.

Although the appellant presented scant evidence in support of her claim, she is not required to make her entire case at the nonfrivolous allegation stage, and we find that her pleadings are sufficient to establish a justiciable issue of material fact that can only be resolved after a jurisdictional hearing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we disagree that the appellant failed to present any specific evidence regarding her former job duties and what happened to them. The appellant made specific factual allegations that she used to work routes 202 and 203 at her facility, that other employees are now covering those routes, and that those employees are requiring overtime to do so. She also supported her factual allegations with documentary evidence showing that routes 202 and 203 continue to be worked and that her former duties have therefore not gone away. That these duties might not have constituted the essential functions of any established position is immaterial. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6; 26. We find that the appellant's specific factual allegations regarding the continued availability of her former tasks constitute nonfrivolous allegations that the agency arbitrarily and capriciously denied her request for restoration. The appellant is therefore entitled to the jurisdictional hearing that she requested.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the appellant has made allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that the denial of restoration constituted disability discrimination. Specifically, the appellant alleges on petition for review that her "limited duty" assignment was improperly classified as such because she was actually performing the essential functions of her Custodial Laborer position and that the modifications to her assignment were actually reasonable accommodations allowing her to perform those functions. <span class="Italic">De John v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> EEOC DOC 07A20030, 2004 WL 1084818 (May 10, 2004) (the agency committed disability discrimination when it withdrew the reasonable accommodation that allowed the appellant to perform the essential functions of his position). In order to make a finding on this issue, the administrative judge would need to determine what the essential functions of the Custodial Laborer position actually are and whether the appellant was performing those functions when the agency sent her home. We note that the documentary evidence of record concerning the appellant's modified duty assignment is not necessarily inconsistent with her disability discrimination claim.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated in the Board's previous decisions, the relevant framework in cases such as this for determining whether the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious is as follows: (1) are the tasks of the appellant's former modified assignment still being performed by other employees or are there other tasks within her medical restrictions that were available for her to perform; (2) if so, did those employees lack sufficient work prior to absorbing the appellant's modified duties; (3) if so, did the reassignment of that work violate any other law, rule, or regulation? <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 33 (2012). If, as the appellant asserted, the duties she was performing during the period from January 13, through January 25, 2011, were also being performed by casual and/or PSE employees, and those employees absorbed the duties she was performing after she was forced out on January 25, then the agency's action sending the appellant home would be arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Florence v. USPS</span>, DA-3443-13-0196-I-1 (NP 7/29/2014) ("The appellant, moreover, argues that the agency should not be permitted to require that his limited duty work be 'necessary and productive,' 'operationally necessary,' or consistent with the agency's 'operational needs.' The Board has already considered and rejected this argument. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 32 n.19. We further note that the appellant in this case does not allege that the work he was performing in his full-time limited duty assignment was somehow unnecessary or unproductive."); <span class="Italic">Clarke v. USPS,</span> CH-0353-11-0852-B-1 (NP 1/22/2014) ("In <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, the Board found that, under agency rules, the Postal Service may discontinue a limited-duty assignment only where the duties of that assignment no longer need to be performed by anyone or the duties need to be transferred to other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 31. Thus, the decision to end the appellant's limited-duty assignment will be found to be arbitrary and capricious if he proves that work was available for him within his medical restrictions. He can make such a showing by proving that: (1) the duties of his limited-duty assignment still needed to be performed and, (2) if those duties are being performed by other employees, the Postal service did not need to transfer the duties to the other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 33.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cronin v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 13, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-22 (2022), reversed course and overruled the <span class="Italic">Latham</span> analysis. MSPB determined that it could not expand on the statutory definition of restoration rights through incorporation of specific agency regulatory requirements or definitions. A different result, the Board determined, would leave restoration rights for partially recovered employees to be defined an agency-to-agency basis rather than on straightforward statutory analysis. <span class="Italic">Cronin</span> also determined that allegations of discrimination would not factor into the Board's evaluation of whether denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 353.301(d) does not itself require an agency to provide restoration rights beyond the minimum requirement of the regulation</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-16 (2012), <span class="Italic">superseded in part by regulation on other grounds as stated in Kingsley</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 365, &#x00B6; 10, the Board considered whether an agency's obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) might exceed the "minimum" requirement of the regulation, i.e., to search the local commuting area for vacant positions to which the partially recovered employee can be restored and to consider her for such positions. The appellants in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> alleged that the agency had arbitrarily and capriciously discontinued their modified assignments in violation of internal agency rules, set forth in the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM), concerning restoring partially recovered employees. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 5. Under the pertinent provisions of the ELM and its accompanying handbook, the agency had agreed to restore partially recovered individuals to duty in whatever tasks are available regardless of whether those tasks comprise the essential functions of an established position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 26. Thus, the agency had assumed obligations beyond the "minimum" requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). The Board noted that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) was silent as to whether an agency may voluntarily assume restoration obligations beyond the "minimum" requirements of that section and, if so, whether such obligations are enforceable by the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To help resolve the question, the Board sought and obtained an advisory opinion from OPM. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In its advisory opinion, OPM expressed the view that the phrase "at a minimum," as it appears in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), anticipates that an agency may adopt additional agency-specific requirements pertaining to restoring partially recovered individuals, and that the regulation requires "compliance with an agency's own rules as well as the provisions of OPM regulation, at least where they confer additional protections or benefits on the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13 (quoting OPM's advisory opinion in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>). OPM further advised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is OPM's opinion that if the Postal Service established a rule that provided the partially recovered employees with greater restoration rights than the "minimum" described in the OPM regulations, the Postal Service is required to meticulously follow that rule. To do otherwise would be arbitrary and capricious within the meaning of OPM's regulation conferring jurisdiction on the Board at section 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. In a split decision, the majority of the Board found that OPM's interpretation of its regulation was entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Company</span>, 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945), because it was consistent with the language of the regulation and not plainly erroneous. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">see Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997) (stating that an agency's interpretation of its own regulations is controlling unless plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation) (citations and quotations omitted), <span class="Italic">superseded in part on other grounds by regulation as stated in</span> <span class="Italic">Crowe v. Examworks, Inc</span>., 136 F. Supp.3d 16, 28 n.8 (D. Mass. 2015). Thus, the Board concluded that it has jurisdiction over appeals concerning the denial of restoration to partially recovered individuals when the denial results from the agency violating its own internal rules. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 13. In dissent, then-Member Mary M. Rose expressed her view that OPM's regulations could not be interpreted reasonably as granting the Board authority to adjudicate substantive entitlements conferred by internal agency rules concerning partially recovered employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (dissenting opinion of Member Rose), &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-17. One basis for this dissenting opinion was that the Board could enforce internal agency restoration entitlements that go beyond Federal law and OPM regulations only if OPM was permitted to redelegate the authority Congress granted it to promulgate restoration regulations, which Congress did not authorize OPM to do. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are now persuaded by this dissenting opinion that, contrary to the majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, OPM's interpretation of its regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) was plainly erroneous and therefore not entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Seminole Rock</span> and<span class="Italic"> Auer</span>.[7] Were the regulation interpreted as OPM suggested in its advisory opinion,[8] OPM would not have the final say in determining what obligations its own regulation imposed. Rather, an employing agency would have free rein to determine the scope of its obligation under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)--and, by extension, FECA itself--with the sole proviso that it provide at least the "minimum" rights described in the regulation. Thus, through its advisory opinion in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, OPM effectively claimed for itself the authority to redelegate a significant portion of its statutorily granted rulemaking authority to outside parties.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[7]&#x2003;We assume for purposes of our analysis here that deference under <span class="Italic">Seminole Rock</span> and <span class="Italic">Auer</span> applies. The Supreme Court recently addressed the proper application of such deference in <span class="Italic">Kisor v. Wilkie</span>, __ U.S. __, 139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019). Although a majority of the Court in <span class="Italic">Kisor</span> declined to overrule <span class="Italic">Seminole Rock</span> and <span class="Italic">Auer</span>, it emphasized the limits on the deference that should be extended to agency interpretations of their own regulations. In particular, the Court held that "<span class="Italic">Auer</span> deference is not the answer to every question of interpreting an agency's rules," and that deference should only be a consideration if a regulation is "genuinely ambiguous, even after a court has resorted to all the standard tools of interpretation." <span class="Italic">Kisor</span>, 139 S. Ct at 2414. The Court further held that even where such genuine ambiguity exists, deference should be given only when "the character and context of the agency interpretation entitles it to controlling weight." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2416. If the Board in <span class="Italic">Latham</span> had the benefit of the Court's guidance in <span class="Italic">Kisor</span>, it may not have deferred to OPM's interpretation in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The validity of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) itself is not before us. Rather, we proceed on the assumption that the regulation, if permissibly <span id="Page_4492"></span>interpreted, is valid and within the scope of OPM's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;We use the term "redelegation" to distinguish an agency's delegation of authority to an outside entity from subdelegation to an agency's own officials or internal components. <span class="Italic">See</span> Jason Marisam, <span class="Italic">The Interagency Marketplace</span>, 96 Minn. L. Rev. 886, 891-97 (2012). Redelegation also differs from situations in which an agency seeks outside input, such as fact-gathering, advice-giving, or establishing a reasonable condition for granting agency approval, but retains final decision-making authority. <span class="Italic">United States Telecom Association v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 359 F.3d 554, 566 (D.C. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Louisiana Forestry Association v. U.S. Department of Labor</span>, 745 F.3d 653, 671-73 (3d Cir. 2014) (finding that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had not redelegated to the Department of Labor (DOL) authority to decide H-2B petitions from employers that were required to obtain DOL certification prior to petitioning DHS for the admission of such workers but DHS retained final authority to approve or disapprove the petitions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the statute refers only to "regulations issued by [OPM]," and says nothing about OPM's authority to redelegate its rulemaking authority to an outside party. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); <span class="Italic">see Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400 (dissenting opinion of Member Rose), &#x00B6; 15. Generally, "[w]hen a statute delegates authority to a [F]ederal officer or agency, subdelegation to a subordinate [F]ederal officer or agency is presumptively permissible absent affirmative evidence of a contrary congressional intent." <span class="Italic">United States Telecom Association v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, 359 F.3d 554, 565 (D.C. Cir. 2004). By contrast, "there is no such presumption covering [re]delegations to outside parties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Rather, "[re]delegations to outside parties are assumed to be improper absent an affirmative showing of congressional authorization." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Shook v. District of Columbia Financial Responsibility &#x0026; Management Assistance Authority</span>, 132 F.3d 775, 783-84 &#x0026; n.6 (D.C.

As the D.C. Circuit explained, this distinction rests on a fundamental policy consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When an agency delegates authority to its subordinate, responsibility--and thus accountability--clearly remain with the [F]ederal agency. But when an agency delegates power to outside parties, lines of accountability may blur, undermining an important democratic check on government decision-making. Also, delegation to outside entities increases the risk that these parties will not share the agency's national vision and perspective, and thus may pursue goals inconsistent with those of the agency and the underlying statutory scheme. In short, [re]delegation to outside entities aggravates the risk of policy drift inherent in any principal-agent relationship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">United States Telecom</span>, 359 F.3d at 565-66 (citations and quotations omitted). This principle applies with equal force when, as in this case, the outside party is another Federal agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 566 (finding that Federal agency officials may not redelegate their authority to outside entities, whether private or sovereign, "absent affirmative evidence" of their authority to do so); <span class="Italic">cf. Shook</span>, 132 F.3d at 783-84 (finding that the Control Board, an agency of the District of Columbia Government, lacked authority to transfer its statutory oversight authority over the Board of Education to a Board of Trustees).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's post-<span class="Italic">Latham</span> cases confirm that, under the interpretation of OPM's regulations adopted by the majority in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, OPM has effectively redelegated its rulemaking authority to individual agencies. Most notably, since the Board decided <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, the outcome of restoration appeals brought by U.S. Postal Service employees has often turned on whether the agency violated its internal rules. [10] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 122, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2013) (finding a violation of restoration rights based on the agency's failure to comply with its ELM and handbook by searching for available tasks that did not necessarily comprise the essential functions of a position); <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9 (2012) (finding a violation of restoration rights under the ELM despite the fact that the agency complied with its minimum obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;A large percentage of the Board's restoration appeals are brought by employees of the U.S. Postal Service. However, under the majority holding in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, to the extent other Federal agencies have internal restoration rules that impose greater obligations than 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) itself, the Board effectively would need to develop a separate body of law for each such agency based on the peculiarities of their internal rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Congress has not authorized OPM to redelegate its rulemaking authority in the manner articulated in OPM's advisory opinion and approved by the majority in <span class="Italic">Latham</span>. This is not to say that an agency may not undertake restoration efforts beyond the minimum effort required by OPM under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d); indeed, the phrase "at a minimum" implies that an agency is free to do so. However, an agency's failure to comply with self-imposed obligations, such as the ELM provisions concerning partially recovered employees at issue in this appeal, cannot itself constitute a violation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d) such that a resulting denial of restoration would be rendered "arbitrary and capricious" for purposes of establishing Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Accord Smith v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 813 F.2d 1216, 1218-19 (Fed.

Rather, to establish jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c), an appellant must, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency failed to comply with the minimum requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d), i.e., to search within the local commuting area for vacant positions to which it can restore a partially recovered employee and to consider her for any such vacancies. <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 345, &#x00B6; 12.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that the agency's denial of restoration was based on prohibited disability discrimination. In <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, we suggested that a claim of unlawful discrimination or reprisal for protected activity could serve as an "alternative means" of showing that a denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious. 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27; <span class="Italic">see Paszko v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 207, &#x00B6; 15 (2013). This holding was incorrect because, as explained above, a denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c) only if an agency fails to meet its obligation under section 353.301(d). <span class="Italic">See Bledsoe</span>, 659 F.3d at 1103-04. Determining whether an agency met its obligation under section 353.301(d) will turn on whether it "ma[d]e every effort" to restore a partially recovered employee "in the local commuting area" and "according to the circumstances in each case." If the agency makes the required effort but fails to find suitable work for the appellant, the denial of restoration is not arbitrary and capricious, and the agency's lack of success cannot be attributed to any improper motive on its part. If, on the other hand, the agency fails to make the effort required under section 353.301(d), the resulting denial of restoration is necessarily arbitrary and capricious, and no further analysis is required. While an agency's failure to comply with section 353.301(d) may well be the result of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity, whether that is so is immaterial to the question of whether denying restoration in a particular instance is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c).[12]</p>

The Board acknowledged that an agency's failure to comply with section 353.301(d) may well be the result of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for protected activity; however, whether that is so is immaterial to the question of whether a denial of restoration is arbitrary and capricious for purposes of section 353.304(c). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 13 (2022)), analyzed a restoration claim arising under the NRP with discussion of a related disability discrimination claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a mail handler with the Postal Service, served in a series of modified, limited duty assignments after partially recovering from a compensable injury in 1992. On August 2, 2007, she received a limited duty offer that consisted of rewrapping damaged letters at the Portland Processing and Distribution Center (P&#x0026;DC) for 8 hours per day. On August 2, 2010, as a part of the National Reassessment Process (NRP) at the P&#x0026;DC, the agency determined that it had no available work at the P&#x0026;DC and offered her a limited duty assignment of 8 hours per day at the Portland Air Cargo Center (PACC), based on the medical restrictions detailed in her April 19, 2010 duty status report. On August 31, 2010, as a part of the NRP process at the PACC, the appellant was offered a limited duty assignment of 1 hour of work per day, based on her walking/standing limitation of 1 hour per day. On September 2, 2010, the agency offered her another limited duty assignment at the PACC, increasing her hours to up to 4 hours per day based on updated medical documentation that allowed for walking/standing for up to 4 hours per day, as tolerated. On the same day, the agency gave the appellant an Employee Leave Information Letter, Partial Day, which informed her that, pursuant to its search of necessary tasks meeting her medical restrictions under the NRP, it was unable to identify enough available necessary tasks within her medical restrictions in order for her to complete a full day of work. The agency continued to conduct its search for available necessary tasks for the appellant within her medical restrictions and was unable to identify enough to complete a full day of work. Further, the agency denied her request for reasonable accommodation because it determined that she could not perform the essential functions of her position with or without accommodation and because it searched for, and was unable to find, a vacant funded position, the essential functions of which she could perform with or without accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an initial appeal on November 26, 2010. She argued that she was never advised of her Board appeal rights with respect to her restoration claim or her right to appeal to the Board as a preference eligible. She argued that the agency denied her restoration because the rewrap duties from which she was removed were still available and were being performed by other employees, that her work hours were improperly reduced from 8 hours per day to as little as 2 hours per day, that she was constructively suspended, and that the agency denied her reasonable accommodation in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. She also raised claims of harmful procedural error, not in accordance with law, and violation of veterans' preference. At the prehearing conference, the parties agreed that all of the appellant's claims would be addressed in the context of her restoration and disability discrimination claims. After a hearing, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the agency acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner in denying her request for restoration. The administrative judge found that the rewrap duties that she had been performing prior to her reassignment were absorbed into the positions of other bid holders who had insufficient hours to complete their day and whose positions included rewrapping damaged mail. The administrative judge further found that the agency performed an adequate search for available work within the appellant's medical restrictions within the local commuting area. He concluded that the appellant failed to prove by preponderant evidence that the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in denying restoration.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the appellant filed her petition, the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Latham v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 (2012), which changed the jurisdictional test for a partially recovered individual from a nonfrivolous allegation of each element of a restoration claim to a preponderance of the evidence standard, in accordance with our reviewing court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 659 F.3d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Thus, under the current test, in order to establish jurisdiction over a restoration appeal as a partially recovered individual, an appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that: (1) She was absent from her position due to a compensable injury; (2) she recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required of her; (3) the agency denied her request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> 659 F.3d at 1104; <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10. If the appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, she is entitled to a jurisdictional <span id="Page_4494"></span>hearing at which she must prove jurisdiction by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe,</span> 659 F.3d at 1102, 1106. If the appellant establishes jurisdiction over her restoration claim, she also prevails on the merits. <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 10 &#x0026; n.9. The appellant here received a hearing in which the administrative judge evaluated her claim under a preponderance of the evidence standard and denied her restoration claim on the merits. Although we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's actions were arbitrary and capricious, we modify the initial decision to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction in accordance with <span class="Italic">Bledsoe</span> and <span class="Italic">Latham.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant satisfied the first two jurisdictional elements. We further find that the agency denied the appellant's request for restoration when it reduced her hours to 1 hour per day under the NRP on August 31, 2010, and when it offered her a limited duty assignment of up to 4 hours per day on September 2, 2010.[1] <span class="Italic">See Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11, 13-14 (2010). Thus, the ultimate issue is whether the appellant has demonstrated by preponderant evidence that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We further find that the agency's decision to reassign the appellant to the PACC was not a denial of restoration and that the appellant's challenge to this action is merely a challenge to the terms and conditions of the restoration.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., McDonnell v. Department of the Navy,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 380, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (1999) (a partially recovered individual's appeal of his assignment to a position other than the one preferred is a challenge about the details of the restoration, not a denial of restoration, and is not within the Board's jurisdiction). The record indicates that, during her initial assignment to the PACC on August 2, 2010, she was offered 8 hours of work per day performing tasks within her medical restrictions. Although there was much argument over whether the P&#x0026;DC or the PACC was her duty station, this is immaterial to our analysis here, and, indeed, the parties stipulated that this was not a dispositive issue with respect to the agency's efforts to search for available work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that there is no indication in the record that the agency's job search was geographically inadequate. The agency submitted evidence regarding the local commuting area and its daily search for tasks for the appellant from the date of its September 2, 2010 offer of modified duty through the filing of the initial appeal. The administrative judge found that the agency properly searched for any available work within the commuting area and within the appellant's medical restrictions. The appellant challenges this finding by arguing that the agency should have presented testimony from the individuals who actually conducted the search so that they could be available for cross examination. The appellant, however, did not include these witnesses on her witness list, despite her receipt of agency documents concerning the search. Additionally, Mr. Kersey, the facility manager at the PACC, testified that he conducted the search of the local commuting area himself and that the managers simply completed the necessary paperwork, at his request. The appellant has not otherwise cast doubt on the agency's evidence. Further, we find unconvincing her argument that it was impossible for the agency to search the entire local commuting area on a daily basis. <span class="Italic">See Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 56.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We consider the appellant's allegation of disability discrimination to the extent that it pertains to the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">See Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58. A denial of restoration based on prohibited discrimination is arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant's challenges to the administrative judge's findings on her disability discrimination claims are twofold: (1) that the agency failed to search for positions outside of the local commuting area as required under the Rehabilitation Act and (2) that the agency failed to accommodate her by discontinuing her limited duty position in rewrap even though other limited duty employees were still performing rewrapping tasks. The dispositive issue here, however, is whether she could perform the essential functions of her position or any other position, for which she was otherwise qualified, with or without reasonable accommodation.[2] 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8), (9); <span class="Italic">see Sanchez v. Department of Energy,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 16 (2011);<span class="Italic"> Sanders v. Social Security Administration,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 18 (2010).[3] It is undisputed that the appellant held a mail handler position and that she was unable to perform the essential functions of the position, with or without an accommodation. Further, the appellant did not argue below, and does not argue on review, that there was a vacant position, for which she was qualified, with essential functions that she could perform with or without accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 11 (2010). Rather, she argues that the agency should have accommodated her by continuing her limited duty assignment that consisted solely of rewrapping mail. It is well-established that the Rehabilitation Act imposes no obligation on the agency to create modified work assignments. <span class="Italic">White,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 21. The provision of limited duty tasks that do not constitute a separate position is not a reasonable accommodation, and the agency is not required to create a new position for the appellant in order to provide reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez-Acosta,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 13. The appellant's claim that the agency was required to continue employing her in a modified assignment to meet her medical restrictions is not one that is cognizable under the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">White,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 21. Thus, she has failed to demonstrate that the agency's denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious due to disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An appellant may establish a disability discrimination claim based on failure to accommodate by showing that: (1) She is a disabled person; (2) the action appealed was based on her disability; and (3) to the extent possible, that there was a reasonable accommodation under which the appellant believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">White v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 244, &#x00B6; 16 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As a federal employee, the appellant's claim arises under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, but the regulatory standards for the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act and are applied to determine whether there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g); <span class="Italic">Sanchez,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 16 n.5; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(b). The ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) became effective on January 1, 2009, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission subsequently issued amended regulations and guidance concerning it. <span class="Italic">See Southerland v. Department of Defense,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25, 33 n.9 (2011). The ADAAA, however, did not change the statutory provision regarding reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Sanchez,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 16 n.5; <span class="Italic">Southerland,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6; 33 n.9. Thus, to the extent that the ADAAA applies to the adverse actions at issue here, the ADAAA and its implementing regulations do not affect the outcome of this case. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 16 n.5; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> the Board held that its jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c) may encompass a claim that an agency's violation of its internal rules resulted in an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration. 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 11. The Board found that the Postal Service's rules required the agency to offer modified assignments to partially recovered individuals whenever work is available and within their medical restrictions. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 30. The Board further determined that, under the agency's rules, it may discontinue a modified assignment consisting of tasks within an employee's medical restrictions only when the duties of that assignment no longer need to be performed by anyone or those duties need to be transferred to other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 31. <span class="Italic">Latham</span> set forth the following line of inquiry as a relevant framework for analyzing the "availability" of work under such circumstances: (1) Are the tasks of the appellant's former modified assignment still being performed by other employees? (2) If so, did those employees lack sufficient work prior to absorbing the appellant's modified duties? (3) If so, did the reassignment of that work violate any other law, rule, or regulation? <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the tasks of the appellant's former modified assignment were still being performed by other employees. Brian Gaines, the Lead Manager at the P&#x0026;DC, testified that the employees in the "010" operation were responsible for rewrapping the damaged mail generated by the machine on which they worked to manage mail. He also testified that bid employees in this operation did not have sufficient work to fill an 8-hour day and they absorbed the rewrap duties without any need for overtime. Based on the agency's evidence, the administrative judge found that the employees who absorbed the appellant's rewrapping tasks were bid holders whose duties included rewrapping damaged mail and who lacked sufficient work to complete an 8-hour workday. The agency's evidence indicates that the rewrap functions were incidental to the mail handler duties in the 010 operations and performed as a part of those duties. Mr. Gaines testified that each employee operating a machine was responsible for rewrapping the damaged mail from his or her machine. The appellant did not present argument or evidence to the contrary, nor does she contest the administrative judge's finding on review. Although there was testimony regarding another limited duty employee who was given rewrapping tasks as a part of his limited duty offer, the record indicated, and the administrative judge found, that this employee's main duty was to perform mail handler tasks on the manual cull belt in the 010 operation; therefore, he was responsible for rewrapping the damaged mail resulting from his operation of that machine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, this appeal turns on the third inquiry: whether the reassignment of the rewrapping duties violated any other law, rule, or regulation. The appellant has made three arguments on review that implicate this inquiry: (1) that the agency failed to conduct a proper search for available work within her medical restrictions; (2) that the agency violated the Rehabilitation Act by failing to accommodate her disability; and (3) that the agency's action was in violation of the LMOU. <span class="Italic">See Latham,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 32. For the reasons articulated above, the appellant's challenges <span id="Page_4495"></span>to the local commuting area and her arguments regarding the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act fail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the third argument, the appellant asserts that the LMOU provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he position of Rewrap would be one of those jobs reserved for both temporary and permanent light duty.... We believe that by assigning this work to other employees (limited duty and regular non-injured Mail Handlers), the Postal Service violated the National and Local agreement between the parties and in doing that committed harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, is a limited duty employee, not a light duty employee, and the provisions at issue do not apply to her. <span class="Italic">See Yang v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 2 n.1 (2010) ("In the U.S. Postal Service, 'limited duty' refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to work-related injuries, whereas 'light duty' refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to nonworkrelated injuries."). Moreover, even if these items in the LMOU did apply to her, her interpretation of the LMOU as set forth above is inaccurate. We do not read these provisions to require that the agency provide rewrapping duties to limited or light duty employees. Instead, these provisions set forth guidelines that include rewrapping as one of the temporary light duty options and provide that "the number of light duty assignments reserved for permanent light duty for the Mail Handler Craft shall not exceed 5% of the Full Time Regular Work Force." The appellant has not put forth any persuasive argument or evidence that the agency violated these provisions. For the foregoing reasons, we find that the appellant failed to demonstrate by preponderant evidence that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious, and we dismiss her appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge failed to adjudicate her claim that she was furloughed, for which she has Board appeal rights because she is a preference eligible veteran. Even assuming that she properly made such a claim below, a claim that a partial-day absence under the NRP could constitute a furlough is subsumed in the restoration appeal. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 22 &#x0026; n.5. The appellant also submits new evidence on review regarding another employee, Robin Laudermilk, who was offered a limited duty assignment in the 010 unit on June 17, 2011, which included the rewrapping of damaged mail. She argues that such evidence demonstrates that these tasks were available to assign to her, that this evidence contradicts the agency's argument that the rewrap tasks were not available to limited duty employees, and that such evidence proves that the agency discriminated against her. We find, however, that such evidence does not affect our analysis because it is based on events that occurred well after the denial of restoration at issue in this appeal. The denial of restoration occurred in August and September 2010, and the new evidence pertains to events that occurred in June 2011. Further, the evidence supports the agency's position that the rewrap tasks were incidental to assigned duties in the 010 operation; the document submitted by the appellant reflects that Ms. Laudermilk was assigned in the 010 unit as a limited duty mail handler with the modified assignment of "facing loose mail pieces, cull belt operation, facing DVD, patching damaged mail" for 8 hours per day. That Ms. Laudermilk was performing rewrap duties as a part of her 010 assignment is consistent with Mr. Gaines's testimony that each mail handler was responsible for rewrapping the damaged mail generated by the machine he or she operated. Finally, to the extent that the appellant is arguing that the agency discriminated against her by failing to accommodate her request to rewrap mail for 8 hours per day, such argument fails for the reasons explained above. Thus, we find that this new evidence is not material to the outcome of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration,</span> 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980). To the extent the appellant is making an additional denial of restoration claim based on events that occurred after the events at issue in this appeal, such an argument may only be considered in the context of a new appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Permanent Job Offer the appellant accepted in May 1993 was clearly a permanent rehabilitation position of the sort described in the ELM. Accordingly, we conclude that, for purposes of determining whether the agency acted arbitrarily and capriciously in sending the appellant home in 2010 by failing to accommodate his medical restrictions, the relevant analysis should focus on the agency's May 1993 Permanent Job Offer. There is no dispute that the appellant was able to perform the duties of this permanent rehabilitation position when those duties were taken away from him in 2010. The agency was entitled to take away those duties only if the duties of that assignment no longer needed to be performed by anyone or those duties needed to be transferred to other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work. <span class="Italic">See Latham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 31 (2012).

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 355, 359 (2012). The agency has not disputed or rebutted that assertion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In failing to consider a reasonable accommodation with the appellant, the agency committed disability discrimination against him. <span class="Italic">See Crutch</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 460, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-17. This also means that the agency arbitrarily and capriciously denied the appellant restoration. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 22, &#x00B6; 11 (2012) (establishing a disability discrimination claim is an alternative means of proving that a denial of arbitration was arbitrary and capricious); <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27 (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Latham,</span> the agency's failure to follow its internal operating rules is not an affirmative defense; nor is it to be adjudicated under the doctrine of harmful error. Instead, it constitutes an arbitrary or capricious denial of restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 119 MSPR 22, 25-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 11, 2012 MSPB 118 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Latham overruled by Cronin v. USPS</span>, 2022 MSPB 13 (2022)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant alleged that the agency's denial of restoration was in violation of various agency-specific rules. The administrative judge considered these alleged procedural violations as an "affirmative defense" of harmful error under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(A) and found that the appellant "failed to show how, even if such violations occurred, that the agency would have reached a different conclusion in the absence of the error." <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). However, the concept of an "affirmative defense" does not apply to a restoration appeal. <span class="Italic">See Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. The appellant's claim that the agency violated its own rules in denying her restoration should instead be considered as an alternative means for establishing that the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Cf. id.</span> (appellant's claims of discrimination and reprisal to be understood not as affirmative defenses but rather as independent claims or alternative ways to show that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious). The harmful error test does not govern this inquiry because a denial of restoration may be arbitrary and capricious even if the agency could have properly denied restoration in the absence or cure of the procedural error. <span class="Italic">Cf. Tram v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 388, &#x00B6; (2012) (where denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious due to a failure to search throughout the local commuting area, the proper remedy was a retroactive job search consistent with the agency's restoration obligations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, the appellant contends that, among other alleged procedural errors, the agency violated its obligations under the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) &#x00A7; 546 and Handbook EL-505. Pursuant to ELM &#x00A7; 546 and EL-505, chapters 7 and 11, the Postal Service has agreed to restore partially recovered individuals to duty in whatever tasks are available regardless of whether those tasks comprise the essential functions of an established position. <span class="Italic">Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-33. The agency may discontinue a modified assignment consisting of tasks within an employee's medical restrictions only where the duties of that assignment no longer need to be performed by anyone or those duties need to be transferred to other employees in order to provide them with sufficient work, and the transfer of work does not violate any other law, rule, or regulation, including any contractual provision limiting the agency's authority to assign work. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant presented preponderant evidence below, and she has reasserted on review, that the tasks she performed as part of her modified assignment are now being performed by other employees on an overtime basis and by managers. Although there was some dispute over whether the Jordan Station Post Office was incurring more overtime than it had prior to the discontinuation of the appellant's modified assignment and over what particular duties employees were performing while accruing their overtime hours, we find that these issues are immaterial. <span class="Italic">See Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 32 (recognizing the fungibility of work). We therefore find that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that the reassignment of her duties was not necessary to provide sufficient work to previously underburdened employees, and, thus, the discontinuation <span id="Page_4496"></span>of her modified duty assignment violated the agency's rules regarding its modified duty obligations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 33. Because an agency's failure to adhere to the restoration obligations it has voluntarily adopted is <span class="Italic">per se</span> arbitrary and capricious, we find that the agency's discontinuation of the appellant's modified assignment under the circumstances of this case constitutes an arbitrary and capricious denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 42. We therefore REVERSE the initial decision in regard to the appellant's restoration claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our ruling on the appellant's restoration claim obviates the need to address further any other claims of error that are related to the restoration claim. We will therefore consider the appellant's other claims as they may relate to the administrative judge's rulings on her disability and age discrimination claims.[4] As with the appellant's claims of procedural error, the administrative judge should have considered the appellant's discrimination claims not as affirmative defenses, but rather as alternative means of establishing that the denial of restoration was arbitrary and capricious, or as separate claims. <span class="Italic">See Latham</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 58 n.27. Nevertheless, for the following reasons, we find that the record is complete with respect to the appellant's discrimination claims, and we agree with the administrative judge's ultimate conclusion that the appellant failed to prove those claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;As a federal employee, the appellant's claim of disability discrimination arises under the Rehabilitation Act. However, the standards under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) have been incorporated by reference into the Rehabilitation Act. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791(g). Further, the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553 (2008) (codified at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 12101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>), applies to this appeal because the incidents in question occurred after the January 1, 2009 effective date of the ADAAA. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued amended regulations implementing the ADAAA that became effective May 24, 2011. <span class="Italic">See</span> 76 Fed. Reg. 16,978 (2011) (codified at 29 C.F.R. Part 1630). Those regulations also apply to this appeal, which was pending on May 24, 2011. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 38-39 (2012); <span class="Italic">Southerland v. Department of Defense</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 56, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-28 (2011). The initial decision reflects that the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's disability discrimination claim in accordance with the ADAAA. Moreover, if we treat the appellant's initiation of a second appeal claiming rights under the new regulations as an amendment to her pleadings in this appeal, the appellant has not identified any specific provision of those regulations that would affect the outcome or require a different interpretation of the ADAAA than the one that the administrative judge applied. Notably, the administrative judge assumed for purposes of analysis that the appellant is disabled, so the ADAAA's liberalization of the definition of "disability" does not help the appellant. Additionally, the ADAAA did not change the rules regarding reasonable accommodation, <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 16 n.5 (2011), so the new regulations do not affect the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency did not violate the appellant's right to reasonable accommodation.</p>

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 379, &#x00B6; 11 (2010).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In the U.S. Postal Service, "limited duty" refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to work-related injuries, whereas "light duty" refers to modified work provided to employees who have medical restrictions due to nonwork-related injuries. <span class="Italic">Simonton v.

Under the NRP, supervisors and managers of employees performing limited duty review those employees' assignments to ensure that they are consistent with the employees' medical restrictions and contain only "operationally necessary tasks. If a limited duty assignment does not meet these criteria, the NRP prescribes procedures for identifying and offering alternative limited duty assignments that do meet the criteria. If the supervisor or manager is unable to identify any operationally necessary tasks available within the employee's work restrictions, the employee will be sent home until such work becomes available or his medical restrictions change. During the employee's absence, he will account for work hours through the use of approved leave, leave without pay, or a continuation of pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 8, 2009, the agency issued the appellant a letter stating in relevant part that, because there was no operationally necessary work available for the appellant within his medical restrictions and within his regular duty hours at the Pasadena P&#x0026;DC, the appellant should not report again for duty unless he was informed that such work had become available. During this absence, the agency directed the appellant to account for his work hours through the use of leave or continuation of pay.

In the case of a partially recovered employee, i.e., one who cannot resume the full range of regular duties but has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements, an agency must make every effort to restore the individual to a position within his medical restrictions and within the local commuting area.<span class="Italic"> Delalat v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a preference eligible City Letter Carrier at the agency's Brundage Station, Bakersfield Post Office, in Bakersfield, California, working in a limited duty capacity because of a compensable injury. On February 6, 2009, the appellant submitted updated medical documentation indicating that his ability to perform tasks involving simple grasping was limited to ninety minutes per shift, and that he could not drive more than two hours per shift. On March 24, 2009, the agency informed the appellant that, because his medical restrictions precluded him from performing the full range of duties for his position, it was reassigning him to an Unassigned Regular Letter Carrier position. The appellant, however, continued working eight hours per day and was paid for working eight hours even though the agency believed that it did not have enough productive work for him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 21, 2009, the agency issued the appellant a letter informing him that, as part of the National Reassessment Process (NRP),[1] it had conducted a search at the Brundage Station for operationally necessary tasks within his regular tour of duty and that met his medical restrictions. The letter stated that the agency was unable to find enough available operationally necessary tasks within the appellant's medical restrictions for him to complete a full day of work. It further informed him that he could select continuation of pay, if eligible, leave, or "LWOP-IOD," for the remainder of his workday, and that he should report back for duty at his normal reporting time on his next scheduled workday.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has presented a nonfrivolous allegation that his restoration claim is within the Board's jurisdiction, and that he is, therefore, entitled to his requested hearing and a decision on both the merits and his discrimination claim. The regulations governing an agency's restoration to duty obligations provide that a partially recovered employee is one who cannot resume the full range of regular duties but has recovered sufficiently from a compensable injury to return to part-time or light duty, or to another position with less demanding physical requirements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102; <span class="Italic">see Urena v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 8 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) regulations afford restoration rights to a partially recovered employee. These rights require the agency to make every effort to restore in the local commuting area a partially recovered employee who can return to limited duty, according to the circumstances in each case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A partially recovered employee's right to file a Board appeal over a violation of these rights also derives from OPM's regulations. <span class="Italic">Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9. These regulations provide that a partially recovered employee may appeal to the Board only for a determination of whether the agency is acting in an "arbitrary and capricious" way in denying restoration. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c); <span class="Italic">see also Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9. To establish Board jurisdiction over a restoration claim as a partially recovered employee, the appellant must make nonfrivolous allegations that the agency violated his restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 10. This requires the appellant to allege facts that would show, if proven, that: (1) He was absent from his position due to a compensable injury; (2) he recovered sufficiently to return to duty on a part-time basis, or to return to work in a position with less demanding physical requirements than those previously required; (3) the agency denied his request for restoration; and (4) the denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Sanchez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the parameters of this jurisdictional test, the Board has held that a partially-recovered individual who has been restored to duty may not challenge the details or circumstances of the restoration.<span class="Italic"> Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 9. It has also found, however, that an agency's rescission of a previously provided restoration may constitute an appealable denial of restoration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Similarly, the discontinuation of a limited duty position may constitute a denial of restoration for purposes or Board jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. part 353. <span class="Italic">Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has clearly satisfied the first two elements of the jurisdictional test. He has been both absent from his official position due to a compensable injury and able to return to part-time duty (90 minutes per day) in a position with less demanding physical requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next question concerns whether the appellant has presented a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's decision to reduce his limited duty from eight hours to 90 minutes per day pursuant to its NRP constitutes a restoration denial within the meaning of the third element of the jurisdictional test. The Board has already analyzed this element of the jurisdictional test with respect to the agency's complete elimination of afforded limited duty to other partially recovered employees under its NRP. The Board found that the decision under the NRP to completely eliminate work previously afforded constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation of a restoration denial satisfying this third element of the test. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 11; <span class="Italic">Urena,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4, 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason to reach a different conclusion here, where the agency has partially eliminated previously afforded limited duty, because the appellants' circumstances and the agency's actions are essentially the same in all NRP cases. Specifically, the NRP appellants are all partially recovered employees whom the agency afforded limited-duty work. Pursuant to its NRP, the agency then decided that it lacked full-time work within the appellants' medical restrictions and reduced the number of work hours. Consistent with <span class="Italic">Sanchez</span> and <span class="Italic">Urena,</span> this is not a case where an appellant is challenging the details or circumstances of the restoration but is instead a situation where the agency is rescinding a previously provided restoration. <span class="Italic">See Barachina v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 12, &#x00B6; 6 n.2 (2009). This matter, therefore, falls within the Board's jurisdictional parameters, where the other elements of the jurisdictional test are met.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In reaching this conclusion with respect to this third element of the jurisdictional test, we express no view regarding whether affording part-time restoration in circumstances other than the agency's reduction of hours pursuant to its NRP constitutes a denial of restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final jurisdictional element requires the appellant to nonfrivolously allege that the denial was arbitrary and capricious. In <span class="Italic">Sanchez,</span> the Board held that an appellant satisfies this requirement where the record shows that the agency did not examine the entire commuting area in determining the available work under the NRP, as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14. Here, the record establishes that the agency searched for work within the appellant's medical restrictions only at the Brundage Station. Because the record does not show that the agency searched throughout the proper commuting area, it establishes a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's restoration denial was arbitrary and capricious. <span class="Italic">Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 14. The appellant has, therefore, satisfied all the elements of the jurisdictional test, and is entitled to an adjudication of the merits of his restoration and disability discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Constructive Suspension</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the appellant contended that the reduction in his work hours constituted an appealable constructive suspension. The administrative judge provided the appellant with notice of his jurisdictional burden of proof regarding this claim. Specifically, the administrative judge correctly explained that a suspension is defined as the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay, and that a suspension of more than fourteen days is an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also correctly explained that, an employee's absence from work without pay may sometimes be considered an appealable constructive suspension. Constructive suspension claims may arise in two situations: when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into his ability to perform, or when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">Rutherford v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). If an employee absent due to medical restrictions requests work within those restrictions, and the agency is bound by policy, regulation or contract to offer available light-duty work, the employee's continued absence due to the agency's failure to offer available light-duty work constitutes a constructive suspension.<span class="Italic"></span> The dispositive issue in determining whether a constructive suspension occurred is who initiated the absence. If the appellant initiated the absence, the agency has not constructively suspended him, and the appellant has the burden of establishing that his absence was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to an appealable constructive suspension because the agency had not placed him in a non-pay status for more than 14 consecutive days. The administrative judge, therefore, concluded that the action was not appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4498"></span>We find, however, that the circumstances at issue in this appeal do not give rise to a constructive suspension claim. Instead, we find that the appellant's rights and remedies regarding the portion of his workday for which the agency has not assigned him work are subsumed in the restoration appeal process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, the appellant's absence, even if deemed to be agency-initiated, stemmed from the agency's determination that it lacked operationally necessary tasks within the appellant's medical restrictions. Whether the agency acted properly in making this determination constitutes the merits of his restoration appeal. Specifically, because the appellant is a partially-recovered employee, the agency must make every effort to restore him in the local commuting area, according to the circumstances in his case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(d). We have now found that the Board has jurisdiction to determine here whether the agency arbitrarily and capriciously denied the appellant restoration by offering him the 90 minutes of work at the Brundage Station. <span class="Italic">Id.;</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.304(c). If the appellant prevails on the merits of this claim, he would be entitled to relief that would address the agency's failure to provide him with the proper hours of work each day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board determines on the merits, however, that the agency afforded the appellant the restoration rights to which he is entitled, it would be illogical to then hold that the agency's proper restoration could constitute an improper constructive suspension. Indeed, the unique circumstances presented by the NRP would preclude the agency from properly taking such an action. When the agency provides a partial day of work under the NRP, it must make a daily assessment about whether it has sufficient work within the appellant's medical restrictions. If it does not have sufficient work for that day, it directs the employee to leave the duty station but to return to work at his next scheduled shift, when it again makes this determination. Because the agency makes a daily determination regarding work availability, it could not provide the appellant with the required 30 days notice to properly propose and effect an appealable suspension--it may not know whether it will have sufficient work for a day that is 30 days in the future when it is reassessing its work on a daily basis. Whether the agency is, in fact, following this procedure is a question regarding the merits of the appellant's restoration claim--specifically, whether the agency is making every effort to restore the appellant according to the circumstances in his case and whether its failure to carry out this requirement is arbitrary and capricious. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(d), 353.304(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that viewing the appellant's constructive suspension claim as subsumed by the restoration claim is consistent with the principle of excluding other avenues of relief where a comprehensive scheme exists regarding the rights and remedies at issue. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439 (1988). Here, pursuant to congressional authority, OPM has promulgated a comprehensive scheme that identifies the rights and remedies for individuals who partially or fully recover from compensable injuries. 5 C.F.R. part 353; <span class="Italic">see McFarlane v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 12 (2008). These procedures are sufficient to redress all of the appellant's claims with respect to the NRP. <span class="Italic">See Sanchez,</span> 2010 MSPB 121, &#x00B6; 18 (reference to the Rehabilitation Act in the restoration regulations must be interpreted in light of the overall scheme of the restoration regulations). Finally, we find that our conclusion that the constructive suspension claim is subsumed in the restoration appeal also applies to an analogous claim that a partial-day absence under the NRP could constitute a furlough.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;A furlough is defined as the placement of an employee in a nonduty, nonpay status for non-disciplinary reasons. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(5); <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 12 (2008); <span class="Italic">Deloach v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 574, 578 (1993). Furloughs of less than 30 days are appealable as adverse actions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513(c); C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3. Furloughs for more than 30 days must be effected under the reduction in force regulations and are appealable under those regulations. <span class="Italic">Lowmack v. Department of the Navy,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 491, &#x00B6; 14 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ferrin-Rodgers v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 140, 144 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 209 (2010) ("In <span class="Italic">Kinglee,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 14, the Board found that the partial elimination of previously afforded limited duty pursuant to the NRP is a denial of restoration within the Board's jurisdiction. Accordingly, the appellant here is not merely appealing the details and circumstances of her restoration, and an analysis of whether the restoration was so unreasonable as to constitute a denial of restoration does not apply. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Jones v.

We therefore find that the appellant has met the third jurisdictional element. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6; 14."); <span class="Italic">cf. Pettus v.

[Refer to Chapter 6, "Disputed Restoration Right."].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reduction under the NRP to part-time limited duty from full-time limited duty was within the Board's jurisdiction as a restoration claim, <span class="Italic">Yang v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 112, 119 &#x00B6; 19, 2010 MSPB 208 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that when the agency awards an employee a full-time limited duty assignment and then reduces the employee's hours to part time under the NRP, the agency has denied the employee restoration. <span class="Italic">Kinglee v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2010). The facts of the instant appeal are somewhat different than in <span class="Italic">Kinglee</span> because the appellant in this case was completely out of work for over a month between the date that the agency discontinued her full-time limited duty assignment and the date that it returned her to limited duty part time, whereas the appellant in <span class="Italic">Kinglee</span> was never out of work entirely, but went directly from a full-time limited duty assignment to a part-time limited duty assignment, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4. Nevertheless, we see no material distinction between the two cases, and we find that the merits of the agency's decision to restore the appellant to part-time limited duty rather than full-time limited duty is within the Board's jurisdiction under the particular circumstances of this case. <span class="Italic">See Kinglee</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 473, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15.</p>
