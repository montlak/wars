<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zukel v. OPM</span>, DE-0845-12-0502-I-1 (NP 6/12/2014), described the elements of financial hardship:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in, but is not limited to, those situations where the appellant needs substantially all of her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. <span class="Italic">Derrico v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 491, 495 (1989); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304. To analyze a claim of financial hardship, the first step is to compare monthly income[3] and monthly expenses throughout the period during which collection is scheduled to be made.[4] <span class="Italic">Derrico</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 495. To determine the latter, the Board has adopted a reasonable person test for deciding whether an enumerated expense is ordinary and necessary. <span class="Italic">Fusco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 501, 507 (1989). Enumerated expenses are specifically listed in OPM's regulations and include such items as mortgage payments and support expenses when the annuitant is legally responsible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 506-07; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.305. Monthly expenses are calculated by adding the following figures: (1) the appellant's proven ordinary and necessary monthly expenses, including miscellaneous expenses; and (2) $50.00 for emergency expenses. <span class="Italic">Derrico</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 495. Once the margin between income and expenses is calculated, the Board will consider the annuitant's total financial condition to determine whether recovery would cause financial hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 495-96. Unless there is a specific challenge from OPM, or unless the information appears unreasonable or incomplete on its face, an appellant should not be required to substantiate her expenses and income. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 496-97.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Monthly income is the appellant's monthly income from all sources as stated on the FRQ, including income received by another family member for whom the annuitant claims ordinary and necessary living expenses. <span class="Italic">See Derrico</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 495 n.4 (citing to a Civil Service Retirement System regulation); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304(a)(2) (indicating that income to other family members is included in the calculation of financial hardship in connection with a FERS overpayment if such family members' ordinary and necessary living expenses were included in the expenses reported by the annuitant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Board has held that it is proper to consider anticipated changes in expenses and income during the projected period of collection. <span class="Italic">Eaton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 216, 217-18 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gomez v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 612, 613-14 (1985), considered an assertion of financial hardship:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the issue of waiver of repayment, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401 provides that recovery of an annuity overpayment may be waived when (1) the annuitant is without fault, and (2) recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Since the agency acknowledged in its reconsideration decision that the appellant was without fault in this matter, we must decide whether recovery would be against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403 provides that recovery is against equity and good conscience when it would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought. Section 831.1404 provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[f]inancial hardship may be deemed to exist in--but not limited to--those situations where the annuitant from whom collection is sought needs substantially all of his/her current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record shows that appellant is 69 years old and that he receives a total monthly income (in Social Security and Civil Service annuity payments) of $909.00.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has already repaid the sum of $3,563.00 as a result of OPM's action offsetting the amount of $2,730.00 against the total overpayment for an underpayment for annuity payments which became due between October 1, 1982 to September 1, 1984. In addition, OPM collected $653.00 from appellant's annuity payments until it suspended collections pending its reconsideration decision and this appeal. Thus, the amount of the overpayment which OPM now seeks to collect is $10,578.00.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, with regard to the amount of $3,563.00 already repaid by appellant, he has not established that OPM's recovery of that amount would cause financial hardship and is therefore against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, with respect to the sum of $10,578.00 remaining to be repaid, appellant has established that repayment would cause financial hardship. The evidence of record shows that appellant has no savings account and owns no real property. When the agency reduced his annuity in 1982, appellant was forced to dispose of his automobile and move from his own furnished apartment and take up a shared residence. His monthly expenses total $790.05, including a recent rent increase of $70.00. Under these circumstances, we find that appellant needs substantially all of his current income to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses, and that collection of the overpayment in the reduced amount of $109.00 a month for 8 years would cause financial hardship to the appellant. Recovery in this case, therefore, would be against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 26 MSPR 315 (1985); <span class="Italic">Knowles v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 24 MSPR 500 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The definition of financial hardship and the concept of unconscionable recovery were developed in <span class="Italic">Derrico v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 491, 495-98 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Financial hardship may be deemed to exist in--but is not limited to--those situations where the appellant needs substantially all of his current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1404. In <span class="Italic">Fusco v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 501, 505-09 (1989)), the Board set forth a method of analyzing a claim of financial hardship. The first step is to compare monthly income[4] and monthly expenses throughout the period during which collection is scheduled to be made.[5] To determine the latter, the Board adopted a reasonable person test for deciding whether the type and amount of a miscellaneous expense is ordinary and necessary and whether the amount of an enumerated expense is ordinary and necessary. We held that to meet the reasonable person standard the individual must show by substantial evidence that the amount of the enumerated expenses, and the type and amount of the miscellaneous expenses that he or she claimed are comparable to what a person of ordinary prudence would require under similar circumstances. In doing so, however, we recognize that the discrete circumstances particular to individual situations must be taken into account. <span class="Italic">See Fusco,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 508-08.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4420"></span>[4]&#x2003;Monthly income is the appellant's monthly income from all sources as stated on the FRQ, including income received by any other family member for whom the annuitant claims ordinary and necessary living expenses. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1404(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board has held that it is proper to consider anticipated changes in expenses and income during the projected period of collection. <span class="Italic">Eaton v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 216, 217-18 (1988). To substantiate such changes, the appellant should submit relevant evidence on their nature and extent. <span class="Italic">See Clinton v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 38 MSPR 221, 223-24 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's monthly expenses are therefore calculated by adding the following figures: (1) The appellant's proven ordinary and necessary monthly expenses, including his or her miscellaneous expenses; and 2) $50.00 for emergency expenses, as allowed by OPM, <span class="Italic">see Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.9. at 8. This total monthly expense figure is then subtracted from the appellant's total monthly income to ascertain the appellant's income/expense margin. <span class="Italic">See Fusco,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 508.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the income/expense margin is calculated, the Board will consider the annuitant's total financial condition to determine whether recovery would cause financial hardship.[6] In determining financial hardship, the Board will consider whether, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1404, the appellant needs substantially all of his current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities, so that recovery would cause financial hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Nonliquid assets generally should not be considered as available for recovery of an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Fusco,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 505. Further, not all liquid assets should be considered to be available for recovery. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 7. While the amount of liquid assets that should not be considered will depend of the individual's overall financial status, $5,000.00, as a general rule, should ordinarily be considered as unavailable for recovery. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether the appellant shows that recovery of the overpayment would cause financial hardship, he may still be entitled to a waiver if he shows that recovery would be unconscionable. In <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 MSPR 540, 549-51 (1989), the Board discussed the standard that it will apply to determine whether recovery of an annuity overpayment is unconscionable in a given case. It stated that it would consider all relevant factors using a "totality-of-the-circumstances" approach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that such circumstances may include cases where there has been an exceptionally lengthy delay by OPM in adjusting an annuity; OPM failed to respond within a reasonable length of time to an annuitant's inquiries regarding an overpayment; OPM failed to act expeditiously to adjust an annuity in the fact of specific notice; or OPM was otherwise grossly negligent in handling the case. In addition, it noted that general principles of equity and fairness demand that consideration be given to situations where recovery may be unconscionable because of misinformation given to the annuitant or where personal limitations of the annuitant, including lack of education, physical or mental disability, or other factors, would make collection manifestly unfair. Finally, it stated that unconscionability may be presumed under certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Aguon,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 550-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has alleged that he suffers from a hiatal hernia, high blood pressure, stomach ulcers, hemorrhoids, and a nervous condition. He further contends that he was operated on for cancer and needs someone to assist him. Therefore, we find that the appellant should be given the opportunity on remand to submit evidence and argument showing that his medical condition is sufficient, either alone or combined with other factors, to justify a finding that recovery would be unconscionable. <span class="Italic">See Aguon,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. at 551.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Finch v. OPM</span>, AT-0845-16-0722-I-1 (NP 7/14/2022), recapped the financial hardship analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show financial hardship, the annuitant must show that she "needs substantially all of [her] current income and liquid assets to meet current ordinary and necessary living expenses and liabilities." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304; <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.1. According to OPM's <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>, "[a] debtor shall generally be deemed to need 'substantially' all of [her] current income to meet current ordinary and necessary expenses if [her] monthly income does not exceed monthly expenses by more than approximately $50 after including repayment of the overpayment as an expense." <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.9. Therefore, to determine an annuitant's total monthly expenses, $50 of "emergency expenses" must be added to the annuitant's ordinary and necessary monthly expenses. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12 (2008). The total monthly expense figure is then subtracted from total monthly income to ascertain the annuitant's income/expense margin. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12. Even when an annuitant has a zero or negative monthly income/expense margin, a financial hardship finding may not be warranted depending on the amount of available liquid assets.[6] <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2006;A liquid asset is defined as cash or an asset that is readily convertible to cash with little or no loss of value, such as a checking or savings account. <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also reported on her FRQ that she has $63,000 in a checking account. She argues on review, however, that this amount is from past due child support for her two children, who are now adults, and that it is all she has towards her retirement. Thus, she appears to contend that this liquid asset should not be considered in determining whether recovery of the overpayment would cause her financial hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As a general rule, nonliquid assets and the first $5,000 in liquid assets should be considered unavailable for recovery of an overpayment. <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.8. The <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> allow that it may be appropriate to exclude more than $5,000 of liquid assets from consideration for debt repayment if the annuitant's expenses exceed her income or if she has significant current liabilities that are not reflected in the expenses. <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.D.8. Here, the appellant's expenses do not exceed her income, and she has not alleged that she has current significant liabilities that are not reflected in her expenses. Therefore, we conclude that $58,000 of the appellant's checking account (i.e., $63,000 minus $5,000) constitutes available liquid assets that may properly be considered in determining her total financial condition. <span class="Italic">See Maples v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 572, 577 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has not demonstrated that recovery of the $3,304.07 overpayment will cause her financial hardship and, therefore, find that she is not entitled to waiver of the overpayment collection based on financial hardship. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.304; <span class="Italic">cf. Hudson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (finding that an annuitant showed that recovery of annuity overpayment would be a financial hardship, and thus against equity and good conscience, when he had no liquid assets, and his monthly living expenses exceeded his monthly income by approximately $290); <span class="Italic">Tatum v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 21 (1999) (stating that an annuitant was entitled to waiver of recovery of annuity overpayment based on financial hardship when her monthly living expenses exceeded her monthly income by approximately $443).</p>
