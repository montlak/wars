<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-133"><span class="space">a.</span> Effect of Cleansing Personnel File When Removal Is Accompanied by Retirement; Effect of Claim for Damages</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit revamped the law concerning the effect of retirement on appealed removals when, in <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 325-26 (Fed. Cir. 1997), it concluded that an agency could moot the removal appeal of the retired employee by ensuring that the removal action was rescinded and no adverse documentation remained in the employee's official personnel file. The employee could, however, challenge the retirement as adverse. The difference between a challenge to an removal, and to a constructive adverse action appeal, is considerable. In a challenge to an adverse action, the government has the burden of proof and mitigation is a possibility. In a constructive adverse action appeal, the employee has the high burden of proving coercion or fraud. <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> failed to recognize the stigmatizing effect of a removal, even when a personnel file is clear--for example, the need to disclose on future employment applications or security clearance questionnaires the circumstances involving a separation from employment under unfavorable circumstances. Consider the question as to past employment on the SF-86, "Questionnaire for National Security Positions": "For this employment have any of the following happened to you in the last seven (7) years? Fired, quit after being told you would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct, left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance." The Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, SF-85P, adds the question whether the applicant left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> essentially avoided the anti-abatement provision, 5 USC 7701(j), by focusing on the state of a personnel file rather than on the reality of the underlying personnel action and the normal requisites of <span class="Italic">status quo</span> restoration. Nevertheless, until legislatively or judicially overruled, <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> is the law, although the law should be reconsidered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 1, 1991, the Navy removed petitioner Larry L. Cooper from his position as warehouse worker foreman because of inability to perform the duties of the position. Cooper filed a timely appeal of his removal with the Board....&#8197;In the meantime, Cooper applied for disability retirement benefits, and his application was approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On March 2, 1993, an administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing Cooper's appeal. The administrative judge ruled that Cooper's disability retirement application was retroactive to a date prior to his removal and that the appeal of the removal was therefore moot. When Cooper petitioned for review of the administrative judge's decision, the full Board reversed and remanded the case to the administrative judge for further proceedings. The Board held that as long as the removal was effected prior to OPM's grant of disability retirement, the Board had jurisdiction to hear the appeal, regardless of the effective date of the retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After that decision, the Navy rescinded Cooper's removal and eliminated all references to the removal from his official personnel file. The Navy substituted a separation based on disability retirement for the removal action. Because the removal was rescinded, the Board dismissed Cooper's appeal as moot. That decision became final on May 18, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appealable action is canceled or rescinded by an agency, any appeal from that action becomes moot. In this case, Cooper alleges that it was improper for the Board to dismiss his appeal as moot, because the rescission of the removal action did not return him to his former position. We uphold the Board's ruling. The Navy's cancellation of the removal action and the removal of all references to that action from Cooper's official personnel file eliminated all the consequences of that action and thus rendered Cooper's appeal moot. After the Navy took those actions, there was no longer any removal or other adverse action for Cooper to appeal. <span class="Italic">Compare Bruning v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 834 F.2d 1019, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (employee's appeal not rendered moot if agency's rescission of removal action is incomplete or leaves another adverse action in place).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Cooper argues that to hold his appeal moot would permit an agency to avoid review of a removal action by pursuing the following course: removing the employee, waiting for the employee to file for retirement benefits, rescinding the removal when the retirement application is approved, and then moving to dismiss the employee's appeal from his removal on mootness grounds. The flaw in that argument is that an employee who believes that he has been effectively removed from his position by being improperly coerced or induced to retire can argue that his retirement was involuntary. The Board has jurisdiction over an involuntary retirement, which is treated as if it were a removal....&#8197;An employee thus may seek reinstatement or back pay as a result of an involuntary retirement....&#8197;Because Cooper has not alleged that his retirement was involuntary, the Board had no jurisdiction to reinstate him to the position he occupied prior to his retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on 5 USC 7701(j) and this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1994), Cooper argues that the Board impermissibly took his retirement status into consideration in determining that his appeal was moot. Section 7701(j) provides that in determining the appealability of a case involving a removal, the Board may not take into account the individual's status under a retirement system. As this court explained in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, section 7701(j) was intended to ensure that an employee who was eligible for retirement at the time of his removal could take a retirement annuity without forfeiting his right to challenge his removal. 27 F.3d at 1580. Thus, Mays was permitted to challenge her removal, even though her retirement became effective on the same day as her removal. In Cooper's case, by contrast, the removal action was rescinded and therefore could not be the subject of an appeal. Thus, in deciding that Cooper's appeal was moot, the Board merely relied on the fact that the agency had rescinded his removal; the Board did not need to consider Cooper's retirement status to reach its conclusion that his appeal was moot. Because Cooper's case no longer involves a removal, section 7701(j) is inapplicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional effect of a removal, retirement effective the same date, and an agency's cancelation of the removal, were explored again in <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/17-2193.Opinion.1-2-2019.pdf">911 F.3d 1370</a>, 1373-77 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (Judge Reyna dissenting), reaffirming <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>. Jenkins was placed on a PIP and his removal was proposed in February 2012. Before he was removed he sent his supervisor an email announcing his intent to retire on March 31, 2012, and he also submitted written responses to the proposed removal. On March 31, 2012, the Army issued a final removal decision effective April 1, 2012. That same day the Army issued to Jenkins a "Cancellation of Decision on Removal" stating the removal would be revoked and canceled on March 31 if Jenkins retired by March 31. Jenkins retired March 31. The Army's cancelation notice also took effect that date. Jenkins then <span id="Page_1073"></span>appealed to MSPB, alleging the removal was involuntary because the agency proposed to remove him if he did not retire. MSPB dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction for lack of a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness. The court affirmed the Board, with comments on the effect of 5 USC 7701(j):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB's "jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a). The petitioner must establish by preponderant evidence that the MSPB has jurisdiction over his appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A). Generally, the MSPB has jurisdiction over appeals of removals of non-probationary employees, based on unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(5); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e). "If an appealable action is canceled or rescinded by an agency, any appeal from that action becomes moot," thereby depriving the MSPB of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B. <span class="Italic">The MSPB Did Not Err in Holding It Lacked Jurisdiction over the Removal Claim</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB held that, because "[Mr. Jenkins] retired <span class="Italic">before</span> the removal action was effected, and the [Army] rescinded the removal decision upon [his] retirement," the MSPB lacked jurisdiction over his appeal challenging the proposed removal. Mr. Jenkins avers the MSPB has jurisdiction over his appeal because his retirement date was "<span class="Italic">after</span> the Army issued a final decision to remove him." We disagree with Mr. Jenkins.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sequence of retirement and rescission is not controlling. Rather, the MSPB lacked jurisdiction because the Army rescinded its removal. The Army proposed removal of Mr. Jenkins on February 16, 2012, Mr. Jenkins indicated his intent to retire on February 23, 2012, and the Army issued its Final Removal Decision on March 21, 2012. However, the same day his retirement went into effect, the Army <span class="Italic">rescinded the removal decision</span>. The Army removed all references to the proposed removal action in Mr. Jenkins's personnel file, thus eliminating any potential consequences the removal could have had on his retirement. This rescinding of the removal decision mooted Mr. Jenkins's improper removal claim. <span class="Italic">See Cooper</span>, 108 F.3d at 326 (explaining, "[i]f an appealable action is canceled or rescinded by an agency, any appeal from that action becomes moot" and that the petitioner's appeal was moot because the agency, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, removed "all references to [the removal action] from [his] official personnel file" thereby "eliminat[ing] all consequences of that action"). Therefore, the MSPB lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Jenkins's primary counterargument fails. He contends that his challenge to the removal is appealable to the MSPB under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) because the MSPB "consider[ed] [his] 'retirement status'" when determining whether it had jurisdiction. Section 7701(j) provides that the MSPB, in "determining the appealability...of any case involving a removal from the service," may not take into account "<span class="Italic">an individual's status</span> under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see Mays v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 27 F.3d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that "[t]he plain language of &#x00A7; 7701(j) means that retirement status cannot be taken into account in determining the appealability of 'any case involving a removal'"). In <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, we considered &#x00A7; 7701(j) and held that the MSPB had jurisdiction over petitioner's appeal because the petitioner's retirement was effective the same date as her removal and her retirement form stated she "[r]etired after receiving [final] written notice...of [the] decision to separate." 27 F.3d at 1578.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> did not involve a rescission of the removal decision being appealed to the MSPB. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, we held that when an agency has "rescinded" an effectuated removal action during the pendency of an appeal, eliminated "all references to [the removal] action from [a petitioner]'s official personnel file," and "substituted a separation" based on retirement for the removal, the appeal of the removal is moot and &#x00A7; 7701(j) is not implicated. 108 F.3d at 325-26; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. (determining that, because "the agency had rescinded his removal[,] the [MSPB] did not need to consider [the appellant]'s retirement status to reach its conclusion that his appeal was moot").[3] This case is governed by <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>. Therefore, &#x00A7; 7701(j) does not provide jurisdiction because the case no longer involved a removal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 326 (finding &#x00A7; 7701(j) did not apply). Because Mr. Jenkins's case no longer involved a removal, the MSPB did not need to consider Mr. Jenkins's retirement status in determining that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent states that the majority believes this case is unlike <span class="Italic">Mays</span> because "removing from Mr. Jenkins's file all the references to [his] removal eliminated 'all consequences' of the removal" and that "Mr. Jenkins would not have retired but for his removal." The dissent, however, fails to recognize that <span class="Italic">Mays</span> did not involve a rescission of a removal decision being appealed to the MSPB. Like <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, the MSPB in this case considered the <span class="Italic">rescission</span> of the removal decision in making the determination that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Cooper</span>, 108 F.3d at 326 (explaining, "in deciding that [the] appeal was moot, the [MSPB] merely relied on the fact that the agency had rescinded his removal"). Section 7701(j) does not prohibit an <span class="Italic">employing agency</span> from taking an employee's retirement status into account in deciding whether to cancel a removal decision; it only prohibits the MSPB from taking an appellant's retirement status into account in determining whether a non-cancelled removal decision is appealable. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Because the MSPB determined the Army rescinded Mr. Jenkins's removal decision, as in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, it did not need to consider his retirement status to determine that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Involuntary Retirement Claim</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Legal Standard</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary retirement is an adverse employment action "where an agency imposes the terms of an employee's resignation, the employee's circumstances permit no alternative but to accept, and those circumstances were the result of improper acts of the agency." <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The [MSPB] has jurisdiction over an involuntary retirement, which is treated as if it were a removal." <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, 108 F.3d at 326. "An employee thus may seek reinstatement or back pay as a result of an involuntary retirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is a presumption that an employee retired voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996). To overcome this presumption, a petitioner must establish (1) the retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency; or (2) the retirement was the product of coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 ("[T]he doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one."). The test for involuntariness is "an objective one" that "considers the totality of the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Substantial Evidence Supports the MSPB's Finding that Mr. Jenkins's Retirement Was Voluntary</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB considered all record evidence related to the voluntariness of Mr. Jenkins's retirement, <span class="Italic">see</span> J.A. 14-17 (analyzing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the length of time offered to improve performance, testimony and written records regarding performance deficiencies, and various communications between Mr. Jenkins and his first-level supervisor), and determined that while Mr. Jenkins was faced with the difficult choice of either retiring or opposing a removal action, this choice did not render his retirement involuntary because he chose to follow through with his retirement decision. Mr. Jenkins argues his retirement was involuntary because it was based on "misinformation" such as "management officials" telling him that he needed to retire to protect his retirement benefits and that it was obtained through "coercion." We disagree with Mr. Jenkins.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Substantial evidence supports the MSPB's finding that Mr. Jenkins voluntarily retired. First, Mr. Jenkins submitted personnel forms that indicate that his retirement from the Army was voluntary. Specifically, under the section asking for reasons for retirement it said "[v]oluntary retirement." <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 243; <span class="Italic">see</span> J.A. 243 (stating in the SF-50 the reason for retirement is "[v]oluntary retirement").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Jenkins's retirement was not the product of misinformation by the agency. The only evidence of record cited by Mr. Jenkins regarding any alleged misrepresentation is that an unidentified individual told Mr. Jenkins he should retire "to protect his retirement benefits." This evidence is insufficient to support Mr. Jenkins's position because he never identified any individual who made this statement nor did he provide any foundation for the alleged statement. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 425; <span class="Italic">see also</span> J.A. 18-19 (explaining by the MSPB that Mr. Jenkins admitted he did not receive misinformation about the ability to retire from Human Resources); <span class="Italic">cf. Scharf v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 710 F.2d 1572, 1573-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (finding involuntary retirement where petitioner proved reasonable reliance on a misrepresentation made by a specific agency counselor). For the first time on appeal, Mr. Jenkins argues that a notation on his final Notification of Personnel Action Form says his reason for retirement was "to obtain retirement benefits." While this notation may demonstrate the Army knew Mr. Jenkins misunderstood the effect a removal would have on his retirement benefits, it does not evidence reliance by Mr. Jenkins upon alleged agency misinformation. Importantly, Mr. Jenkins provided no evidence that he desired to retire based on that belief. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 18-19 (explaining by the MSPB that Mr. Jenkins provided no "specifics regarding the alleged misrepresentation"). After he received the Notice of Proposed Removal and was informed of his appeal rights by the Army, he still elected to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Mr. Jenkins's retirement was not caused by coercion. Mr. Jenkins argues that his retirement was the product of coercion because the Army "imposed the terms of [his] retirement" and he had "no [alternative] but to retire." A petitioner can establish his retirement was the product of coercion if he proves by preponderant evidence that an agency created "working conditions so intolerable" that he was "driven to involuntarily...retire." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1328-29. "[T]o establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion" due to a threatened or proposed adverse action, the employee must show that: (1) he involuntarily accepted the terms <span id="Page_1074"></span>"effectively imposed" by the agency; (2) the circumstances presented "no realistic alternative" but to retire; and (3) his retirement was the result of "improper acts of the agency." <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Dep't of Agric.,</span> 260 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Here, however, Mr. Jenkins has adduced no evidence to demonstrate that his working conditions were intolerable. Instead, Mr. Jenkins simply had the choice of not retiring and opposing the removal, or retiring.[4] Thus, the MSPB correctly found Mr. Jenkins failed to demonstrate that his retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The dissent states that "the Army put Mr. Jenkins in precisely the situation of making a forced choice because its offer to rescind his removal was conditioned upon Mr. Jenkins first retiring." In <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, however, we explained that when "an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act." 810 F.2d at 1136. Here, the MSPB simply relied on <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, in addition to several MSPB cases, in holding that the "unpleasant choice" to retire or be removed "does not rebut the presumed voluntariness" of the decision to retire. While Mr. Jenkins argues that his factual situation was different because the "rescission was expressly conditioned" on his retirement, our precedent does not support such a distinction, <span class="Italic">Schultz</span>, 810 F.2d at 1136.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Welcome v. MSPB</span>, 542 Fed. Appx. 940, 943 (Fed.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 112 MSPR 124, 126-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-10, 2009 MSPB 156 (2009), noted that there is no Board jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal (although there may be an appeal from an allegedly coerced retirement) if the agency cancels a removal action immediately before the time and date that the employee, who retired because of the removal, filed his Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired after the agency notified him of its decision to remove him for inability to perform the essential functions of his position as a Sheet Metal Mechanic (Aircraft). The inability arose from an on-the-job injury that resulted in permanent medical restrictions on the appellant's lifting, reaching, kneeling, pulling, and use of two of his fingers. The decision to remove the appellant followed his placement in a limited-duty Tool and Parts Attendant position in March 2001, and subsequent unsuccessful attempts to place him in a job within his medical restrictions. The appellant was scheduled to be removed effective October 29, 2008. The effective date of his retirement is November 3, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 24, 2008, the appellant filed an appeal alleging that his resignation was involuntary, and that the decision to remove him from his position was based on his disabling condition and age. On the same day that the appellant filed the instant appeal, the agency mailed a notice to the appellant informing him that "[i]nasmuch as [he had] been approved for Voluntary Retirement, [the agency had] determined that the Notice of Decision to Separate...[would] be cancelled effective this date." While the appeal was pending below, the agency repeatedly referred to its cancellation of the decision to remove the appellant, it denied that the appellant's retirement was coerced or otherwise involuntary, and it argued that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge construed the appeal as an appeal of the agency's decision to remove him and, based on the written record, sustained the charge, found that the appellant had not substantiated his discrimination claims, and sustained the removal. She found that the agency's cancellation of the removal decision did not affect the Board's jurisdiction because "the record contains no evidence that the action was actually rescinded before the appellant filed his appeal with the Board." She did not reach the issue of whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not expressly address the fact that the appellant retired after receiving the agency's notice of decision to remove him. We note, however, that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j), "an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute...may [not] be taken into account" in "determining the appealability" of a removal. The Board and its reviewing court have interpreted this section as providing that, even when an employee retires on the scheduled effective date of his removal, the Board retains jurisdiction over the employee's removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 559, 561-63 (1997); <span class="Italic">Scalese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 247, 249 (1995). In this case, the appellant's retirement was not effective until after the scheduled effective date of his removal. Clearly, the appellant's retirement after receiving a notice of decision to remove him does not deprive the Board of jurisdiction to adjudicate an appeal of his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, however, the agency canceled its decision to remove the appellant. If an agency cancels or rescinds an action before the employee files an appeal of that action, or if the agency modifies the action to one that is not appealable prior to the filing of an appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of that action. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 634, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Shelton v. U.S. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">Siman v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 306, 310 n.2 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Himmel v. Department of Justice</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 484, 486 (1981) (it is the nature of the agency's action at the time the appeal is filed that determines the Board's jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted below that it had cancelled its decision to remove the appellant and argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal in light of the cancellation and the allegedly voluntary nature of the appellant's retirement. The administrative judge, finding that the "record contained no evidence that the action was actually rescinded before the appellant filed his appeal," determined that the cancellation did not affect the Board's jurisdiction over the appeal. This was error. The agency claimed that "[t]he Decision to Separate..., effective 29 October 2008, was cancelled due to the employee's voluntary retirement, effective 03 November 2008..." and further, that the appellant "was not removed from his position because he voluntarily retired." There is nothing in the record that contradicts these statements. In the absence of any evidence or claim that the agency ever effected the removal, cancellation of the removal decision was the only action the agency needed to take in order to cancel the action. We find further that the agency cancelled its decision to remove the appellant before the appellant filed his appeal. Although the cancellation notice contains only the date November 24, 2008, and not a time of day, the record shows that it was signed during business hours. That is, it shows that the notice not only was signed on November 24, but was subsequently mailed on the same day. The appellant's electronically filed appeal indicates that it was not filed until 10:29:08 <small>P.M.</small>, Central Daylight Time, on November 24. Thus, the record establishes that the decision to remove the appellant had been cancelled by the time the appellant filed his appeal, and that the Board therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider this case as an appeal from the agency's decision to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Martin</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 634, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Shelton</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that the appellant, when he filed this appeal, characterized it as an appeal from a constructive removal. That is, he alleged that the agency improperly forced him to retire. While the agency's cancellation of its decision to remove the appellant precludes a finding of jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of the agency's decision to remove him, it does not preclude a finding of jurisdiction over the appellant's constructive removal appeal. <span class="Italic">See Siman</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 306, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 &#x0026; 9 n.2 (the Board lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's appeal as a removal appeal, since the agency had withdrawn that decision without effecting the removal, but it remanded for further consideration the appellant's claim that his retirement, which was precipitated by the removal decision, was involuntary); <span class="Italic">cf. Cooper v. Department of the Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/1997432108f3d3241352">108 F.3d 324</a>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (although cancellation of a removal after the employee retired rendered the employee's removal appeal moot, the employee could still argue that his retirement was involuntary). Accordingly, this case should have been considered as an appeal of an alleged involuntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Siman v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 306, 310 n.2 (1998), summarizing the significance of <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, the agency may block a Board appeal from a removal by withdrawing the removal decision before the appellant appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant appears to challenge the agency's decision to remove him. We note that, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j), an employee may appeal an agency's decision to remove him, even where the removal decision was never implemented because the appellant retired in lieu of removal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Anderson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 78 MSPR 518, 521 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994)). We find, however, that section 7701(j) is not applicable here and that the removal decision is beyond the Board's jurisdiction because the agency withdrew the removal decision before the appellant filed this appeal<span class="Italic">.

The reasoning is that even a clean personnel record, coupled with retirement, does not moot the claim for compensatory damages that arises from a discriminatory but otherwise moot removal. Although the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> analysis is unfortunate, given the clear intent of the anti-abatement sections of the law governing the effect of retirement elections on adverse action appeals, it is no satisfactory solution that through <span class="Italic">Lamberson</span> one obtains a hearing based on a discrimination allegation:</p>

Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, <span class="blue">108 F.3d 324</span>, 326 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In <span class="Italic">Cooper,</span> the court "deem[ed] it the best course" to transfer the case back to federal district court upon finding that it (the Federal Circuit) lacked jurisdiction over three counts of the complaint that were not rendered moot by the agency's cancellation of the appellant's removal and deletion of all references to it from his personnel file following his receipt of a disability retirement award. In <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 177 (1998) <span class="Italic">(Currier II),</span> the Board noted the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, but nonetheless reaffirmed its holding in <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 191 (1996), that, under standards for mootness set out in United States Supreme Court case law, an appeal is not moot even where the agency effects a complete rescission of the action as long as there is some "'possible, effectual relief" that could be granted to the appellant, for example, compensatory damages if the appellant prevails on a discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Currier II,</span> 79 MSPR at 183, citing <span class="Italic">Currier I</span>, 72 MSPR at 197, where the Board stated that "Where as here, an appellant has outstanding viable claims of compensatory damages before the Board, the agency's complete rescission of the action appealed does not afford him all of the relief available before the Board, so that the mere rescission does not render the appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Darrone,</span> 465 U.S. 624, 630, 104 S. Ct. 1248, 79 L. Ed.2d 568 (1984)." Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Currier II,</span> the Board held that where an appellant has filed an appeal from an action that is appealable under any law, rule, or regulation, the appellant has a right, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), to have the Board adjudicate any allegation of discrimination based on the record evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 79 MSPR at 180.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here has alleged discrimination and has claimed compensatory damages. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Currier II</span>, she has a right to introduce evidence on her allegations of discrimination and to have the Board adjudicate her discrimination claim on the merits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 79 MSPR at 179-80, 181-82. If the appellant should prevail on her discrimination claim, she would also be entitled to establish her claim for compensatory damages. Thus, we find that the Board retains jurisdiction over the appellant's discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See id.,</span> 79 MSPR at 179. Accordingly, this appeal is not rendered moot by the agency's post-appeal rescission of the removal action because there remains some possible, effectual relief that the Board could grant to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 182-83.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has been awarded a disability retirement. If an appeal of a removal action is not moot, "retirement status cannot be taken into account in determining the appealability of 'any case involving a removal."' <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation,</span> 27 F.3d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 77010). Thus, the appellant's retirement status does not change our determination that the Board continues to have jurisdiction over her appeal of the removal action based on her claim for relief and compensatory damages under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16, and her request for corrective action under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). <span class="Italic">See Alleman v. Department of Army,</span> 79 MSPR 233, 240 n.2 (1998). Nor does <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> change the result we reach here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cooper,</span> the petitioner (Mr. Cooper) filed a four-count complaint in federal district court, claiming that (1) the Board should not have dismissed his appeal of the agency's removal action as moot; (2) and (3) the agency discriminated against him based on race and disability; and (4) the agency retaliated against him based on whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 108 F.3d at 325-26. The district court transferred the case to the Federal Circuit for review of the Board's decision regarding the mootness of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 326.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit upheld the Board's ruling that the agency's cancellation of the removal action and expungement of all references to the removal from Cooper's official personnel file rendered the removal appeal moot. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In so ruling, however, the court did not state whether Cooper, in the Board appeal of his removal, had alleged discrimination, claimed compensatory damages, or requested corrective action under the WPA, nor did the court consider the effect of such claims on mootness. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Indeed, the court stated that the complaint before the district court sought damages "based on <span class="Italic">agency conduct extending beyond Cooper's removal</span>" which "would be outside the jurisdiction of the Merit Systems Protection Board even if the Board had jurisdiction over Cooper's appeal from his removal." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 327 (emphasis supplied). Thus, the court found that it lacked jurisdiction to consider claims two through four of the complaint alleging prohibited discrimination and retaliation, and transferred the case back to the district court for further proceedings on those three claims. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 327.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here has alleged discrimination and claimed compensatory damages. Hence, we decide this appeal keeping in mind our statutory mandate to adjudicate all allegations of discrimination in cases within our jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see id.,</span> 79 MSPR at 179-80, 181-82, our authority to award compensatory damages, <span class="Italic">see Currier I,</span> 72 MSPR at 196, and the Supreme Court's case law on mootness, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Currier II,</span> 79 MSPR at 182-83.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that if we were to injudiciously apply the result in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> to resolve this case, we would in effect force the appellant to take the same allegations of discrimination that she raised in her appeal from the agency's removal action and argue (as she appears to have done on petition for review after receiving the initial decision citing <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>) that her retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See</span> 108 F.3d at 326. Casting her discrimination allegations in an involuntariness context would place the jurisdictional burden on the appellant, <span class="Italic">see Locke v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 283, 287-88 (1994), require the Board to consider the discrimination allegations for purposes of jurisdiction under the standard for involuntariness, <span class="Italic">see Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 MSPR 574, 578 (1996), and, only if we found jurisdiction, would we then adjudicate the discrimination claims as affirmative defenses under Title VII standards, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 580. Because the Board initially had jurisdiction over the appeal of the agency's removal action and because the appeal is not moot given our statutory mandate to afford the appellant the relief she seeks should she prevail on her allegations of discrimination, we find that <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, which did not discuss the effect of a discrimination claim and a request for compensatory damages on what would otherwise be a moot Board appeal, is not controlling under the circumstances here. Thus, we will not require the appellant to amend her petition for appeal to recast her discrimination allegations as assertions of involuntariness (assuming she can do so at this time). Further, the adjudication of the removal action and the disability discrimination claim will render any involuntariness claim moot. <span class="Italic">See Scalese v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 68 MSPR 247, 249 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant therefore is entitled to a determination on the merits of her allegations of discrimination, as those allegations relate to the removal action effected by the agency on February 14, 1997<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 182-83. If she prevails on her discrimination claims, she is entitled to the "make whole" relief authorized by law. <span class="Italic">See Sublette v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 MSPR 82, 86 (1995) (remedy for discrimination is to make victim "whole," and, therefore, after finding discrimination, the administrative judge should have reversed the adverse action completely).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional preservation established by <span class="Italic">Lamberson</span> is lost if the appealable action is canceled before a Board appeal is filed, even if the Board appeal includes an allegation of discrimination, <span class="Italic">Shelton v. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home</span>, 82 MSPR 695, 697-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case is whether Board jurisdiction ever attaches if, before the appeal is filed, an appealable action is canceled and a non-appealable action is substituted. Here, the appellant filed an application for disability retirement after he received notice that he would be separated by RIF. After his separation, OPM granted the appellant's application for disability retirement and the agency canceled the appellant's RIF separation and substituted a separation by disability retirement retroactive to September 30, 1995. The appellant then timely filed a formal EEO complaint alleging that his separation was the result of race and disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> to dismiss the appeal as moot. However, in <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, the agency "rescinded" the appellants removal for inability to perform and substituted a retroactive disability retirement after the appellant appealed his removal to the Board. <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, 108 F.3d at 325. In the present case, by contrast the agency canceled the appellant's RIF separation and substituted a retroactive disability retirement before the appellant filed this appeal and before he filed his formal EEO complaint. Thus, <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> is distinguishable. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 MSPR 648 (1999), and <span class="Italic">Currier</span> are also distinguishable from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Lamberson</span>, the agency rescinded the appellant's removal for inability to perform after she filed her Board appeal. In <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, the agency rescinded the appellant's placement by RIF in a lower-graded position with saved grade and pay and substituted a retroactive placement in a position equivalent to the one he held before the RIF after the appellant <span id="Page_1076"></span>appealed the action to the Board. <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, 72 MSPR at 193-94. Thus, both of these cases concern the issue of divestiture of Board jurisdiction that had already attached upon the filing of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the controlling precedent in this case is <span class="Italic">Anderson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 494, 498 (1997), <span class="Italic">appeal dismissed,</span> 155 F.3d 570, 155 F.3d 570 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, we found that when an agency takes an action that appears to be appealable, but modifies the action to one that is not appealable prior to the filing of an appeal, the Board lacks jurisdiction. Thus, "Board jurisdiction does not attach if an agency modifies its action <span class="Italic">before</span> an appeal is filed." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis in original). Under <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, jurisdiction never attached to this case because, before the appellant filed this appeal and before he filed his formal EEO complaint, the agency modified its action from one that is appealable (RIF separation) to one that is not appealable (granting of an employee-initiated disability retirement). Accordingly, the Board has no jurisdiction over this appeal.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pugh v. Defense Commissary Agency,</span> 65 MSPR 6, 9-10 (1994), also differs from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Pugh,</span> the Board held that an employee who has received notice that he will be separated by RIF, and who retires on the date that the otherwise would have been effected, can appeal the RIF separation decision. However, in contrast to the case here, the agency in <span class="Italic">Pugh</span> did not cancel or rescind the RIF separation decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, under the prevailing law when the initial decision was issued, the AJ was permitted to strike a discrimination claim without taking evidence, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Crawford v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 70 MSPR 416 (1996), but that the Board changed the law in its subsequently-issued decision in <span class="Italic">Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 177 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Currier II</span>). Specifically, we stated in <span class="Italic">Currier II</span> that an appellant has a right to introduce evidence on his allegations of discrimination and to have the Board adjudicate his discrimination claim on the merits. However, we need not determine what effect <span class="Italic">Currier II</span> might otherwise have because it does not apply, since, unlike <span class="Italic">Currier II,</span> jurisdiction never attached in this appeal. Furthermore, because there is no jurisdiction over this appeal, we will not address whether the appellant's claim for damages would have kept the appeal from being moot if jurisdiction had attached.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an individual retires and is later issued a proposal and decision to remove, the appellant is not an "employee" at the time of the removal; the Board has no jurisdiction over the resulting appeal. The legislative changes concerning the effect of retirement on appeals assume appeals by "employees" otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction under the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tures v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 87, 88-9 (1992).</p>
