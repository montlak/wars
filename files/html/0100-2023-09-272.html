<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-269"><span class="space">4.</span> Failure to Use Discovery</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no requirement that a party seek discovery. Many parties do not seek discovery because they do not need it or they do not know how to use it. If counsel for the parties have an amicable relationship, they may agree to exchange documents and to schedule witnesses for depositions without bickering and motions--just a few confirming emails do the job. Agencies are not, however, required to informally provide information. Nor does an agency have an obligation to permit an appellant or his representative to interview agency witnesses in preparation for an adverse action hearing. If the agency does not agree to "informal" discovery, information must be gathered through compulsory discovery. <span class="Italic">Fuiava v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 103, 106, 3 MSPB 217 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pippinger v. Rubin</span>, 129 F.3d 519 (10th Cir. 1997) (agency head has statutory authority to control agency personnel and direct them not to engage in informal discussions with litigants or their counsel; discovery is available to develop information relevant to a case); 5 USC 301; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Enplanar, Inc. v. Marsh</span>, 11 F.3d 1284, 1296 (5th Cir. 1994) ("government employee who is a potential witness is not improperly chilling access to the courts or retaliating for use of the judicial system when he refuses to speak to a party concerning a matter <span id="Page_1260"></span>that is related to the gravamen of that party's litigation against him or his employer").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit cautioned appellants against failing to properly invoke discovery, <span class="Italic">Tiffany v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 795 F.2d 67, 69 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Tiffany claims that the presiding official failed to compel the agency to comply with her discovery requests. The short answer is that she did not ask the presiding official to do so. The Board has authority to issue an order compelling discovery, but a petitioner must request this action by filing a motion to compel with the presiding official....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Tiffany contends, however, that her letter of November 17, 1983, apprising the presiding official of the progress of her case, should be construed as an informal motion for an order to compel discovery. That letter did not request the presiding official to take any action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant does not take advantage of the procedures available to obtain information, including discovery, on PFR he may not claim injury by suggesting that he was hindered in presenting his appeal. <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 45, 48 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Estes v. Dept. of Army</span>, PH-4324-15-0268-I-1 (NP 2/10/2016) ("The Board also has held that an appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status does not excuse the failure to understand or comply with instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sumrall v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 597, &#x00B6; 13 (2000) (appellant's lack of sophistication in Board matters and general inability to understand instructions and procedures were insufficient to show good cause for a filing delay)."); <span class="Italic">Tharp v. DOJ</span>, PH-0752-11-0293-I-1 (NP 9/20/2012) ("Further, the appellant failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing discovery to obtain the aforementioned manuals and, thus, she is responsible for the absence of evidence to support her harmful error claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Radziewicz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 692, 696 (1990)."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pezdek v. DOD</span>, 80 MSPR 554, 566 &#x00B6; 32 (1999) ("[H]e submitted no evidence to support these bare claims despite having an opportunity to conduct discovery and introduce testimony from agency witnesses on these issues.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"A party who fails to follow discovery procedures has no basis for asserting harm in the agency's refusal to produce documents." <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 451, 456 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Kinsey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite his receipt of this information, upon the administrative judge's denial of his final request for further reconsideration of her rulings, the appellant simply abandoned his request for a hearing, "under protest," stating only that he "has no choice but" to do so because by the denial "he has been effectively denied access to the discovery necessary to prove his case." No specifics were provided to support this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[G]iven the broad discretion accorded administrative judges in their discovery-related rulings and the breadth of the procedures available to appellants for the development and presentation of evidence in their appeals prior to the initial decision, we find that this appellant's decision effectively to abandon the appeal at that stage is the determinative factor in our holding that he is entitled to no further discovery. By taking this action, the appellant foreclosed any possibility that he could get the additional evidence he sought in the normal course of the appeal, and in light of the extensive evidence he already had, we find that he failed to show that it was pointless to go on without it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hether examined under a specific test to determine if alternate means exist to gain relevant information or [j]ust to determine if the appellant showed he was prejudiced, this inquiry is central to the questions of <span id="Page_1261"></span>whether there has been an abuse of discretion and whether additional discovery is needed. The Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Conley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 20 (1984), reflects such an approach. There, the appellant similarly argued that the administrative judge's discovery rulings deprived him of the opportunity to present his affirmative defense of discrimination. The Board found no abuse of discretion, ruling that the request for sanctions which had been denied was untimely filed "and more importantly, in light of the agency's counselor's availability for questioning at the hearing, the appellant did not establish a need for the materials by asserting specific inadequacies in the agency's reasonable accommodation efforts. Further, the presiding official did not preclude the appellant from establishing a pattern of past and continuing discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22. Thus, even in a case where the appellant chose the more reasoned course of proceeding with his hearing, the Board found that because other avenues to obtain the same information were not foreclosed to him, his claims of error and prejudice were without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases concerning specifically the related right to a hearing, a similar inquiry concerning prejudice has been applied, and the Board and the court have not looked favorably upon an appellant who waived his hearing right and then sought further development of the record only upon review. For example, <span class="Italic">see Spezzaferro v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 807 F.2d 169, 174 (Fed. Cir. 1986), holding that the appellants' contention that, absent the discovery they sought, the administrative judge should have convened a hearing to gather the same evidence had no merit because they did not request a hearing and by electing to "rest on the record, they have waived their claims of prejudicial error with respect to the denial of a hearing." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 801 F.2d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (where the appellant waived his right to a hearing, the administrative judge's offer of the opportunity to file written submissions "was all that the law required.... Sanders ignored his opportunity to supplement the record."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Seastrunk</span>, 28 MSPR 51, 53 (1985) (no abuse of discretion shown in denial of late attempt to rescind waiver of hearing where a hearing on the written submissions and a chance to except to the ALJ's recommended decision were provided, as required by the Board's regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, we have found no Board or Federal court case construing the Federal Rules that allows an appellant, upon the denial in part of his motions to compel discovery, to withdraw his request for a hearing, and to be granted discovery, ex post facto, without any showing that no alternate means existed to develop his case. In this matter, as the agency notes in its response to the appellant's petition for review, the appellant could simply have noticed the depositions of agency officials. It is well-established that a party may take deposition testimony of "any person, including a party" without leave of court. <span class="Italic">See Jewell v. Dudley L. Moore Insurance, Inc.</span>, 872 F. Supp. 1517, 1520 (M.D. La. 1995) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 30). In addition, or instead, he could have called and cross-examined agency officials as witnesses at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, even upon petition for review, the appellant does not show the absence of such alternate means; nor does he assert any facts in support of a claim of prejudice. As discussed above, at no time after his withdrawal of his request for a hearing, even after receipt of information pertinent to the issues raised in his interrogatories, did the appellant file any written submissions, move to reinstate his request for a hearing, or even file any objection. Although the record was closed after February 1, the Board's regulations provide that certain, limited submissions may be made after that point, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.58(c) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.59(c)] ; moreover, the appellant was free to move for its reopening, which the administrative judge could have granted in her discretion, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.55, 1201.41. Accordingly, we conclude that, when the appellant waived his right to a hearing because of his disagreement with the administrative judge over her discovery rulings, and did not then take the opportunity proffered to file additional evidence and arguments, or to respond to the prehearing submission filed by the agency, it was he, not the administrative judge, who was responsible for "prevent[ing]the production of...evidence," relevant to proving his RIF and reprisal claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues, in a conclusory manner and without citation to case law, that the administrative judge's decision denied him his "Constitutional right to due process." If the appellant's contention is that there is a "due process right" to discovery, that contention lacks merit. The Federal Circuit has held that compliance with the requirements of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b) (1994) satisfies the minimum due process requirements to which the employee is entitled. <span class="Italic">See King v. Erickson</span>, 89 F.3d 1575, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1996). If his contention is that the administrative judge erred in ruling on the merits once he had waived his right to a hearing, that contention also lacks merit. When an appellant decides to forego his right to a hearing, he makes the appeal ripe for adjudication....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review the Federal Circuit affirmed, briefly noting of the discovery dispute, <span class="Italic">Markland v. OPM</span>, 140 F.3d 1031, 1036 (Fed. Cir. 1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We will not overturn the board on procedural matters relating to discovery "unless an abuse of discretion is clear and is harmful." <span class="Italic">Curtin v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 846 F.2d 1373, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Markland must show, therefore, that not only did the board abuse its discretion in sustaining the AJ's discovery rulings, but that he was prejudiced by the partial denial of his motions to compel. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1379. The board determined that he was not prejudiced because he received a variety of documents and interrogatory answers, which provided him relevant information; and other avenues for discovery were open to him, which he chose not to take.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The interrogatories and document requests denied by the AJ relate to competitive areas other than OCAS, the success of Markland's alleged cost-cutting suggestions, and challenges by others to the RIF. These requests are either too broad or not relevant to Markland's case. Therefore, the board correctly held that denying them was not an abuse of discretion. Furthermore, we are simply unable to determine from this record whether denying his discovery requests caused him prejudice because he abandoned all other attempts to develop his case. We cannot say the board was wrong on this score either.</p>
