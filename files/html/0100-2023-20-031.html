<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-29"><span class="space">b.</span> Threatened Disclosure</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A threat to expose mismanagement or otherwise engage in whistleblowing may be treated as a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 596-99 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the charges which we have already examined, the agency relied upon two nonperformance-related charges in removing the appellant. Charge 2 concerns statements made by the appellant to Administrator Carmen in January of 1983, when appellant was about to be detailed out of the position of Regional Administrator. It alleges that appellant attempted to "coerce" Administrator Carmen by threatening to "go to the press" unless the Administrator "permitted [him] to continue serving in the position of Regional Administrator." The presiding official found that since the threat did not stem from "a concern by the appellant for the public," but constituted, instead, "menacing behavior for his personal benefit," the appellant's conduct was not protected by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was in error. Congress intended whistleblowers to be protected if they reasonably believed in their protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett,</span> 26 MSPR 60 (1985). We have held that "regardless of a whistleblower's alleged personal motivations, the law's protections do extend to employees who reasonably believe in their charges." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 70, n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, the law is silent with regard to whether an announced intention to make protected disclosures is similarly protected. However, we have held in an appeal rights reprisal case, that it would frustrate the purposes of the Reform Act's protections if employees could be retaliated against for announcing their intention to exercise a protected right. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 595 (1984). That holding was based upon the fact that retaliation, in these circumstances, "would have a chilling effect on employees' exercise of their...rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 606. The same rationale is applicable to the interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Whistleblowing protections, therefore, encompass protection for an announced intention to make protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant charge presents an additional issue which the Board has not previously addressed. The charge is not predicated solely upon the appellant's allegedly improper motives or upon his stated intentions to make protected disclosures. It is based, in addition, on appellant's demand that unless he was not detailed, he would make such disclosures. In effect, the appellant said, "I will blow the whistle unless I am allowed to remain as Regional Administrator." That demand raises the question of whether whistleblowing protections should apply when employees ask for something in exchange for not making protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously interpreted and guaranteed the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and (9) in order to effectuate the purposes of the law. The same consideration needs to be addressed in judging the appellant's conduct in this case; <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> would expanding the protections to an employee who asks for a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo--</span>in exchange for not blowing the whistle in the press about mismanagement in which he reasonably believes--effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The answer to that question turns on what has been requested in exchange for the proposed silence. If the employee said, "I will blow the whistle unless the mismanagement, fraud or abuse is corrected," that request should be protected since it directly relates to the substance of the whistleblowing. However, if the employee said, "I will blow the whistle about a contractor's unlawful activity unless I am promoted," that request should not be protected since it bears no relationship to the substance of the threatened whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Charge 2, the appellant's demand did directly relate to alleged mismanagement. The agency had initiated a nationwide personnel reduction program which was not mandated by law. The appellant reasonably believed that such a policy would adversely affect the agency's ability to provide services. Immediately after making a documented presentation to management officials regarding objections to that policy, appellant was informed of his first detail. Under those circumstances, we conclude that the unidentified disclosures which the appellant threatened to make regarded the same policy objections which he had been voicing internally and which he believed were the basis for his reassignment by detail. Thus, Charge 2 is predicated upon conduct which, in order to effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), must be regarded as protected. Therefore, the charge cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count 5 also concerns allegedly coercive statements made to the Administrator. In July of 1983, an unsatisfactory rating was issued to the appellant by his supervisor. If that rating were upheld by a performance review board, it could have formed the basis for appellant's removal from the SES. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4314(b)(3). Appellant then hired an attorney. Charge 5 alleges that in a meeting with the Administrator, the attorney asserted that the appellant would "not continue to wage a campaign against the agency in the news media" if certain conditions relating to the poor performance rating were met by the agency. Those conditions were that the appellant be allowed to retain his position of record; that he be detailed to one of four specific executive positions; that he receive a fully satisfactory rating; that he be given a letter of recommendation to assist him in seeking outside employment; and that, upon obtaining such employment, "he be reassigned outside the commuting area" so that he could refuse the reassignment, becoming automatically eligible for an immediate annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that a sham geographic reassignment was requested in exchange for not making protected disclosures distinguishes this demand from that in Charge 2. This demand is also distinguishable since it is not at all clear that the substance of the unidentified disclosures, which the appellant would have refrained from making, bore any relationship to what was being requested on behalf of the appellant. The appellant sought to forestall a performance based action by offering to trade silence for a better rating. We cannot conclude that the appellant, given his appalling performance on the two details, had a reasonable belief that that rating was connected to anything other than the quality of his work. Absent the appellant showing a relationship between what he asked for and the substance of the intended whistleblowing, it would not further Congress' intent to encourage whistleblowing for us to find that his behavior was <span id="Page_3681"></span>protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As we noted in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 60, 70 n.7 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees cannot immunize themselves from agency actions merely by donning the clothes of a whistleblower. (<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2730-2731, "nor would the bill protect employees who claim to be whistleblowers in order to avoid [an] adverse action....") Supportable adverse actions not predicated upon protected activity may always be taken against employees. While the law encourages and protects whistleblowing, it does not give whistleblowers a license to perform unsatisfactorily or to engage in misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if we were able to discern a connection between the intended disclosures and the demanded conditions, the conduct would still not have been protected under these facts. Admittedly, some of the conditions demanded by the attorney were not unlawful by themselves. However, they were contained in a proposed overall solution to the appellant's performance-related problems, and all of the conditions were part and parcel of an unlawful scheme under which the appellant, once he obtained outside employment, could claim an unwarranted entitlement to an annuity through the artifice of a sham reassignment. Congress did not intend to authorize whistleblowers' demands that laws be violated. Therefore, where a request for an unlawful benefit is made in exchange for silence, we find that it would not effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) to extend its protections as a shield to insulate employees from the consequences of demanding illegal actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we find that Charge 5 does not describe protected whistleblowing activity, we conclude, however, that the alleged conduct was still not actionable. The attorney was attempting to settle appellant's performance dispute with the agency. Public policy encourages settlements and would be generally disserved by allowing demands made in settlement negotiations to form a separate basis for an agency action. Such policy considerations could, of course, be overridden had the attorney engaged in truly threatening and/or criminal behavior. However, here the agency was not placed in any real or imagined danger by the request for an unlawful reassignment in exchange for appellant not making protected disclosures. It could, as it did, deny the request. Under these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served by allowing the attorney's actions to form the basis for a separate charge of misconduct or malfeasance against the appellant. This is particularly true where, as here, there is no direct evidence of the appellant's involvement in the allegedly wrongful behavior, since he was not present at the meeting and both he and his attorney denied that the appellant had any role in the actions taken by the attorney at that meeting. Charge 5 is, therefore, not sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The threat to blow the whistle, through a draft letter, could qualify for protection, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 MSPR 595, 604-06 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An essential element in prohibited retaliation is proof that Harvey knew Gorsey had appealed to the Special Counsel. Harvey denied he knew Gorsey had sent the letter. Harvey admitted he had seen Gorsey's draft letter. He noted that in the draft letter Gorsey charged him with improper personnel actions. Harvey reacted to those charges, which he considered untruthful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have examined the evidence on the question of knowledge. The record shows the following: Several weeks prior to March 9, 1982, the date on the letter to Special Counsel, Gorsey gave a draft letter to an agency personnel officer. The letter was addressed to the Special Counsel but was undated. In the letter, Gorsey made numerous allegations of abuse of authority and mismanagement. Gorsey told the personnel officer to pass the letter on to Richards, the Inspector General and Harvey's supervisor, and to advise Richards that unless Gorsey was promised he would not be fired and was given a satisfactory assignment, which could include a position at grade 14, he would send the letter to the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The draft letter went to Richard's office. The record does not reveal whether or how much of Gorsey's conversation with the personnel officer was passed on with the draft letter. Richards testified that he considered the letter an effort to intimidate the personnel office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The undated draft letter reached Harvey from Richards' office sometime in the latter part of March. When Harvey saw, among other statements, the assertion that he had given Gorsey insignificant or no work, Harvey was angry and considered it untruthful. In later recommending that Gorsey not be assigned to any of the available SES positions, Harvey stated he had no confidence in Gorsey.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although he saw the undated draft letter in late March 1982 and admits he retaliated because he viewed the statements about him as untrue, Harvey denies he retaliated because of the letter's having been sent to the Special Counsel. Harvey contends that he did not learn Gorsey had sent the letter until February 1983, long after the alleged retaliating conduct. There is no contradictory evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question then is whether the fact that Harvey saw the draft letter and reacted to its contents but did not know whether the letter had already been sent is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of "knowledge" as an element of retaliation. We hold that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The effect of Harvey's action on the exercise of an appeal right was the same whether the letter had already been sent or was never sent. Although we have found no case that is analogous, we think the circumstances of this case bear a similarity to proof of the element of intent in discrimination cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Mead v. U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Co.,</span> 442 F. Supp. 114, 129 (D. Minn. 1977), the court in discussing the retaliation provision of Title VII stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Specific evidence of intent to discriminate is not an indispensable element of proof of violation of Section 704(a).... [A]n employer's protestation that it did not intend to discriminate is unavailing where a natural consequence of its action was such discouragement toward employees from exercising their rights under Title VII. Concluding that employees' discouragement from exercising their rights will result from acts of retaliation, it is presumed that the employer intended such consequences. <span class="Italic">Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,</span> 401 U.S. 424, 432, 91 S. Ct. 849, 854, 28 L. Ed.2d 158 (1971).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 2302(b)(9) makes retaliation a prohibited personnel practice because it discourages the use of appeals procedures that Congress has found to be in the public interest.[20] The consequences of basing an adverse action upon such protected activity are the same here regardless of whether the draft letter had been sent or had not been set.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20 By empowering the Special Counsel to investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices and to seek relief from such practices, Congress has created a forum for an appeal to be entertained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To allow Harvey to avoid a finding that he violated section 2302(b)(9) despite his admission that he knew of the draft letter and retaliated because of its contents would, in our view, frustrate the purposes of the provision by decreasing the protection given to Gorsey, who had made known his intention to appeal, and would have a chilling effect on employees' exercise of their appeal rights. Count three is sustained.</p>
