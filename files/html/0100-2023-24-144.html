<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-140"><span class="space">8.</span> Overtime, Pay Statutes</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Before a statutory amendment in 1994, suits based upon some statutory entitlements, e.g., FLSA overtime pay, were precluded if the plaintiff was covered by a collective bargaining contract that did not exclude the subject matter of the claim brought in court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">post</span>. Congress reversed the Federal Circuit's approach by amending the election of remedy procedures in the Reform Act, as <span class="Italic">Mudge v. United States</span>, 308 F.3d 1220, 1222-32 (Fed. Cir. 2002), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court dismissed Mudge's complaint on the ground that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), which is part of the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (2000), deprived the court of jurisdiction. That statutory paragraph and the subsequent paragraph read as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a) (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he heart of the dispute--whether the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over a claim that falls within the scope of the negotiated grievance procedures--centers, as it did below, on the meaning of the term "administrative" in &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 1994, the statute did not contain the term "administrative." Rather, &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) stated that the grievance procedures set forth in a CBA would "be the <span class="Italic">exclusive procedures</span> for resolving grievances which f[ell] within its coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (1988) (emphasis added). In <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied, Carter v. Goldberg</span>, 498 U.S. 811 (1990), this court interpreted the pre-1994 language to preclude federal employees from resolving grievances covered by their CBA in court. Relying on the "unambiguous" text of unamended &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), which stated that "the procedures shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage," <span class="Italic">Carter</span> held that the statute limited the resolution of such grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in an employee's CBA. <span class="Italic">Carter,</span> 909 F.2d at 1454. Like Mr. Mudge, the appellants in <span class="Italic">Carter</span> did not contest that their claims, pay disputes under the Fair Labor Standards Act ("FLSA"), constituted "grievances" subject to the negotiated procedures<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Nor did they argue that subsections (a)(2), (c), (d), or (e) removed their claims from the application of those procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1454-55. Instead, appellants argued that they were exempt from &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision because to hold otherwise would allow the CSRA to implicitly repeal their right to sue under the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1454. In other words, appellants urged this court to read an additional exception into &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), one that would allow them to bring their FLSA claims in court despite the availability of administrative redress under their CBA's negotiated grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1455. Heeding "the Supreme Court's admonition to leave the architecture of the federal personnel system to Congress," we declined to do so. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1456 (quoting <span class="Italic">Volk v. Hobson</span>, 866 F.2d 1398, 1403 (Fed. Cir. 1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress amended the CSRA by adding subsection (g) to &#x00A7; 7121. United States Office of Special Counsel, Merit Systems Protection Board: Authorization, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(b), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994) (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C. and 12 U.S.C.). This subsection gives "whistleblowers" the choice of resolving their employment grievances through either the negotiated procedures contained in their CBA or through certain administrative avenues enumerated in &#x00A7; 7121(g). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(g) (2000). Concurrent with the creation of subsection (g), Congress made two changes to subsection (a)(1). First, Congress amended &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) to refer to subsection (g). Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(c), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994). As such, &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision now applies "[e]xcept as provided in subsections (d), (e), <span class="Italic">and (g)."</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (2000) (emphasis added). Second, and critically, Congress added the contested term "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 9(c), 108 Stat. 4361 (1994). In other words, it added the term "administrative" to the phrase "shall be the exclusive procedures for resolving grievances" previously construed in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. Congress styled both of these changes to &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) as "Technical and Conforming Amendments." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing else in the direct legislative history of the 1994 amendments informs the meaning of the term "administrative" or Congress's intent in adding the word to &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). H.R. 2970, the bill that ultimately amended &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), passed the House without the term "administrative," and the word was only added later as a floor amendment in the Senate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 140 Cong. Rec. 27,361 and 28,823-28 (1994). While the House subsequently adopted the Senate's amendment to the bill, <span class="Italic">see id</span> 29,350, neither the House nor the Senate provided a discussion or an explanation of the disputed term. As far as the amendments' indirect history is concerned, two National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU") officials testified during the subcommittee hearings on H.R. 2970 that Congress should overrule <span class="Italic">Carter</span> by clarifying that while negotiated grievance procedures constitute a federal employee's exclusive administrative remedy, they do not foreclose access to available judicial remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">To Reauthorize the Office of Special Counsel and to Make Amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act: Hearing on H.R. 2970 Before the SubComm. on the Civil Servs. of the House Comm. on Post Office &#x0026; Civil Servs.</span>, 103d Cong. 20-23 (1993) (statements of Tim Hannapel, Assistant Counsel in the Office of General Counsel, NTEU, and Robert M. Tobias, President, NTEU). Additionally, a House committee report accompanying a different bill, H.R. 2721, that failed to pass either the House of Representatives or the Senate stated that the addition of "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121 would clarify that "[t]he grievance procedure was never intended to deprive employees of access to the courts" and thereby "correct" the decision in <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. Federal Employee Fairness Act of 1994, H.R. Rep. No. 103-599, pt. 1, at 56 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at pt. 2, at 75 (stating that the proposed addition of the word "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121 would "clarify that section 7121 is not intended to limit judicial remedies otherwise provided by law.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that Congress's addition of the word "administrative" to &#x00A7; 7121(a) established a federal employee's right to seek a judicial remedy for employment grievances subject to the negotiated procedures contained in his or her CBA. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Carter</span> held otherwise, the court based its decision on the language of the statute as it read prior to the 1994 amendments and that decision is therefore no longer applicable. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Federal Claim's dismissal of Mr. Mudge's claim for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e begin our inquiry with the text of the CSRA itself. Section 7121(a)(1) directs that, with a few enumerated exceptions, the negotiated grievance procedures set forth in a federal employee's CBA are to be "the exclusive <span class="Italic">administrative</span> procedures for resolving grievances that fall within [the CBA's] coverage." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) (2000) (emphasis added). Because the statute does not define the word "administrative," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103, we presume that Congress intended to give that term its ordinarily understood meaning, <span class="Italic">see Asgrow Seed Co. v. Winterboer</span>, 513 U.S. 179, 187 (1995) ("When terms used in a statute are undefined, <span id="Page_5379"></span>we give them their ordinary meaning.") (internal citation omitted). In ascertaining the common meaning of an undefined statutory term, the court may refer to the dictionary. <span class="Italic">See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 36 F.3d 1565, 1571 n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("A dictionary is an appropriate source for gleaning...'ordinary meaning.'"). Consulting <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span>, we find the meaning of "administrative" to be "distinguished from such [functions and acts] as are judicial." <span class="Italic">Black's Law Dictionary</span> 45 (6th ed. 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Carter</span>, 909 F.2d at 1455 (noting the distinction between the administrative and judicial arenas). The plain language of &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) as amended is therefore clear: while &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) limits the administrative resolution of a federal employee's grievances to the negotiated procedures set forth in his or her CBA, the text of the statute does not restrict an employee's right to seek a judicial remedy for such grievances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that "[a] leading purpose of the CSRA was to replace the haphazard arrangements for administrative and judicial review of personnel action, part of the outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century that was the civil service system." <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 444 (1988) (internal quotation omitted). As we stated in <span class="Italic">Muniz v. United States</span>, 972 F.2d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 1992), "the Congressionally unambiguous and unmistakable preference from exclusivity of arbitration is a central part of the comprehensive overhaul of the civil service system provided by the CSRA." We cannot agree, however, with an interpretation of &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) that privileges these policy concerns to the exclusion of the plain language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Artuz v. Bennett</span>, 531 U.S. 4, 10...(2000) ("Whatever merits these and other policy arguments may have, it is not the province of this Court to rewrite the statute to accommodate them. We hold as we do because respondent's view seems to us the only permissible interpretation of the text."). Moreover, we disagree with the government's interpretation of <span class="Italic">Carter</span>. As discussed above, <span class="Italic">Carter</span> based its holding on the "unambiguous" language of the pre-1994 text of &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See Carter</span>, 909 F.2d at 1454. While the court subsequently addressed the general purposes animating the CSRA, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1455-56, it did so in order to reject appellants' argument that "an additional exception to CSRA section 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision should be implied," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1455. <span class="Italic">Carter</span> therefore relied on policy considerations to reject appellants' assertion that the court should interpret unamended &#x00A7; 7121(a) contrary to its clear language; it did not, as the government urges us to do today, "follo[w] the overall purpose of the statutory scheme" in order to disregard subsection (a)(1)'s plain text. Following <span class="Italic">Carter</span>'s example, we interpret amended &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1) according to its unambiguous language and conclude that that subsection no longer restricts a federal employee's right to pursue an employment grievance in court.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;THE LEGISLATIVE LANDSCAPE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because our decision rests on a series of labor statutes, principally the FLSA and 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1003(c), we begin by briefly reviewing the relevant Congressional enactments and their implications for postal inspectors' pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT--1938</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1938, Congress enacted the FLSA to improve "conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 202(a). The FLSA requires most employers to pay "overtime" compensation to employees working more than forty hours per week "at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 207(a)(1). In 1974, Congress amended the FLSA to include all federal, state, and local government employees, and in particular, individuals employed by the Postal Service<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. &#x00A7; 203(e)(2)(B) ("'[E]mployee' means...any individual employed by the United States Postal Service....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FLSA provides detailed exemptions excluding certain classes of employees from the Act's overtime pay requirements. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 213. For example, &#x00A7; 213(a)(1) exempts "administrative" employees, a matter we address in more detail below. Section 213(b)(20) exempts federal law enforcement officers if the federal agency "employs during the workweek less than 5 employees...in law enforcement activities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 213(b)(20). According to the implementing regulations "in all exemption determinations," employees are "presumed to be FLSA nonexempt." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PAY REFORM ACT--1990</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, Congress passed the Federal Law Enforcement Pay Reform Act ("FLEPA") as part of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990. Under FLEPA, certain federal law enforcement officers are guaranteed overtime pay (referred to as "administratively uncontrollable overtime" or "AUO") among other pay protections. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5305. At the request of the Postal Service, postal inspectors were not included in FLEPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> Postal Inspection Service Compensation Task Force: Pay Comparability for Postal Inspectors Report, June 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AVAILABILITY PAY ACT ("LEAP")--1994</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1994, Congress enacted LEAP, codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a, amending FLEPA and ending administratively uncontrollable overtime for most federal law enforcement agents, though some federal agents still receive AUO pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 103-329 &#x00A7; 633, 108 Stat. 2382 (1994). LEAP <span id="Page_5380"></span>requires that covered federal law enforcement officers, in addition to their regular work schedule, be available to work an average of two extra hours per day. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(d)(1). If a law enforcement officer averages two extra hours of availability each work day for the whole year, then the officer is entitled to additional pay in the amount of 25% of the annual base pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5545a(h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because postal inspectors were not included in FLEPA, they were not included in LEAP, which basically sought to revise the FLEPA pay regime. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 2105(e) ("Except as otherwise provided by law, an employee of the United States Postal Service or of the Postal Rate Commission is deemed not an employee for purposes of this title."); <span class="Italic">see also Nigg v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 321 F.3d 1381, 1384 (Fed. Cir. 2003). To protect federal agencies from having to pay law enforcement officers both LEAP and FLSA overtime, Congress amended the FLSA to exempt officers who received LEAP from receiving FLSA overtime. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 213(a)(16).</p>
