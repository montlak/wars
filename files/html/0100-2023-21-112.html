<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-111"><span class="space">g.</span> Effect of Mental Incompetence on Timeliness of Election</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Balkovec v. OPM</span>, 83 MSPR 621, 623-24 &#x00B6; 6-7 (1999), determined that the two year period to elect an annuity after marriage could not be extended because of the employee's mental disability or incompetence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where Congress intended to permit the waiver of filing deadlines for Federal annuitants because of their mental problems, it explicitly so provided. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), an application for a disability annuity must be "filed with [OPM] before the employee...is separated from service or within 1 year thereafter." Congress further provided that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]his time limitation may be waived by [OPM] for an employee...who, at the date of separation from service, or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The statute governing the present case, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), contains no equivalent provision for waiver of the filing deadline in case of an annuitant's mental incompetence, and the Board lacks the authority to waive, on equitable grounds, requirements (including filing deadlines) that Congress has imposed as a condition to payment of Federal moneys. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 416, 434 (1990); <span class="Italic">Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1382; <span class="Italic">Gressley v. Califano</span>, 609 F.2d 1265, 1268 (7th Cir. 1979) ("A Congressional mandate to pay statutory benefits...leaves no discretion in the agencies...but to limit the payment of benefits to those entitled to them.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that he does not recall receiving a notice of election rights from OPM. OPM is required by statute to provide annuitants with annual notification of their election rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339 note; <span class="Italic">Schoemakers</span>, 180 F.3d at 1382; <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 982 F.2d 1554, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1992). OPM, however, submitted an affidavit from Ms. Mary Beth Smith-Toomey, the administrator of the contract for printing and distribution of forms and notices for OPM's retirement and insurance services. In her affidavit, Ms. Smith-Toomey stated that: (1) General notices regarding survivor benefit elections were sent to all annuitants in December 1992, December 1993, December 1994, and January 1996; (2) OPM's computer master annuity roll generated a tape listing all annuitants and their corresponding addresses; and (3) a notice was sent to each of the annuitants on the tape. A copy of the notice is attached to the affidavit. The appellant has submitted no evidence to rebut Ms. Smith-Toomey's affidavit. Accordingly, the affidavit is sufficient to establish that OPM sent the appellant the required notice of election rights. <span class="Italic">See Schoemakers</span>, slip op. at 4; <span class="Italic">Darsigny v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 787 F.2d 1555, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More recently, a challenge to the competence of the annuitant to oppose OPM's decision finding him ineligible to elect a former spouse survivor annuity was addressed, and found inadequate, in <span class="Italic">Magelitz v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 472, 477-80 &#x00B6; 11-15, 2012 MSPB 99 (2012), but allowing the possibility that the appellant's competence to actually elect a former spouse survivor annuity could be considered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, OPM argued that the Board should remand the case for a determination of whether the appellant was capable of representing himself below. We find, however, that Ms. Deursch did not successfully challenge the presumption of competency. <span class="Italic">See Stubblefield v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 455, 459 (1994); <span class="Italic">Dombeck v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 43, 46 (1989). The relevant standard for mental incompetence is "an inability to handle one's personal affairs because of either physical or mental disease or injury." <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In cases related to retirement annuity elections, the Board has held that the party seeking to change the annuity agreement of record bears the burden of showing that the annuitant lacked the requisite capacity to make a valid election. <span class="Italic">Stubblefield,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 459;<span class="Italic"> Dombeck,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. at 46. In this case, any medical records submitted by Ms. Deursch must be sufficient to call into doubt the appellant's mental competency to prosecute his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">See Frank v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 12 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Deursch's documents do not call into doubt the appellant's mental competency to prosecute his appeal <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. There is no evidence or specific allegation concerning the appellant's inability to manage his personal affairs during the initial appeal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Dombeck,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. at 46-47; <span class="Italic">cf. Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 20 (2008). According to the record, the first diagnosis of the appellant's condition occurred in August 2009, after the appellant began communicating with OPM about providing Ms. Magelitz with a former spouse survivor annuity. The June 6, 2011 document from Mountain View Primary Care stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr.&#x2003;Magelitz was diagnosed with dementia at an office visit, August <span id="Page_4241"></span>28, 2009. He was placed on medication to begin addressing this problem. He was referred to Dr. Sarim Mir for a neurology evaluation on September 8, 2009. Dr. Mir also concluded probable mild dementia of the Alzheimer's type.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Deursch also submitted a report dated September 19, 2011, which stated that the appellant was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's dementia. With respect to "past psychiatric history," the report indicated "[m]ild cognitive impairment in 2009." The report did not describe the appellant's ability to manage his own affairs in the period of time prior to filing his initial appeal or during the initial appeal proceedings. Finally, Ms. Deursch submitted a report from Dr. Janice Herron, dated January 31, 2012, which further elaborated on the appellant's current condition. With respect to her interview with the appellant and his daughter, Dr. Herron noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Changes in his functioning have been apparent to family for the past several years. His daughter noted that it is an effort to get him out of the house.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...Assistance has been required with the checkbook and bill paying for the past several years. He was recently taken advantage of financially by his ex-wife....Initiation of activities is poor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, this information does not indicate that the appellant was incompetent to represent himself during the initial appeal period from September through December of 2010. Further, this document was created after Ms. Deursch filed the petition for review and participated in the medical examination, and Dr. Herron's notes were based in part on the information that Ms. Deursch provided. Although Ms. Deursch argued that she has filed a petition to be appointed Guardian and Conservator for the appellant "due to his incompetency," this allegation does not shed light on the appellant's competency or ability to represent himself during the initial appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the record reflects that the appellant contacted OPM in a timely manner after learning of the deposit from OPM in February 2009. The record also reflects that, on May 20, 2009, the appellant obtained an addendum to the divorce decree in an attempt to provide Ms. Magelitz with a former spouse survivor annuity. These actions preceded the appellant's diagnosis on August 28, 2009. The record also reflects that the appellant continued to act consistently by appealing to OPM in October 2009, filing a reconsideration request in January 2010, and filing a Board appeal in September 2010. The appellant represented himself during the initial Board appeal proceedings, including during a close-of-record conference with the administrative judge. Thus, according to the record before us, it appears that the appellant ably represented himself during the initial appeal. The documents that the appellant filed with OPM and with the administrative judge during the initial appeal are clear, lucid, and signed by him. In the absence of any evidence tending to demonstrate otherwise, his competency has not been sufficiently challenged so as to disturb the initial decision or warrant remand to the administrative judge. Finally, Ms. Deursch's arguments centered on the appellant's ability to make a valid election in May 2011; she did not challenge his competency during the initial appeal proceedings. Thus, Ms. Deursch did not successfully challenge the presumption of competency, and, in the absence of sufficient doubt regarding the appellant's ability to represent himself below, we decline to reopen the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserted that there is a question of whether the appellant was competent to make a valid election to provide Ms. Magelitz with a former spouse survivor annuity on May 24, 2011. Ms. Deursch also stated that "the issue here is the competence of Mr. Magelitz on the day he executed the 'Election' form in May of 2011, not his 'intentions' at some point in time prior to the execution of the form. This issue, however, is not properly before the Board at this time. The Board generally has jurisdiction over a determination on the merits of a matter affecting the rights or interests of an individual under the Civil Service Retirement System only after OPM has issued a final decision, and the scope of the appeal involving federal retirement benefits is limited to those matters addressed in OPM's final decision. <span class="Italic">Hasanadka v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 636, &#x00B6; 19 (2011); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. OPM has not made a final decision on the validity of the appellant's May 2011 election of a former spouse survivor annuity. Thus, any question regarding the validity of that election must be resolved by OPM in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See Stubblefield,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. at 460; <span class="Italic">see also Deese v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11 (2011). After OPM makes a final decision, any individual whose rights or interests are affected may appeal the decision to the Board at that time in accordance with the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.110, 1201.3(a)(6).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An assertion of mental incompetence did not excuse a belated survivor annuity election in <span class="Italic">Schoemakers v. OPM</span>, 180 F.3d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Schoemakers contends that, even if Mr. Schoemakers received the notice, because of her husband's "mental state" at the time the notices were sent--her affidavit stated that he had "problems...with memory" and from "alcohol usage"--she was entitled to a waiver of the two-year statutory period for requesting a survivor's annuity. Although the Board stated that Mr. Schoemakers' "mental condition...appears to have interfered with his ability to read and understand the OPM notices that he received," it correctly held that Mrs. Schoemakers was not entitled to a waiver of the filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute unambiguously states that to obtain a survivor's annuity the annuitant must file with OPM "a signed writing...within two years after such employee...marries." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). Nothing in either the language or the legislative history even suggests, much less indicates, that Congress intended to permit waiver of the filing deadline because of the annuitant's mental condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where Congress intended to permit the waiver of filing deadlines for government annuitants because of their mental problems, it explicitly so provided. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b), an application for a disability annuity must be "filed with [OPM] before the employee...is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter." Congress further provided that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[t]his time limitation may be waived by [OPM] for an employee...who at the date of separation from service or within one year thereafter is mentally incompetent[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This provision stands in sharp contrast to the unequivocal requirement of filing within two years of marriage in &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). It strongly indicates that Congress did not intend to permit waiver of that requirement because of the annuitant's mental condition. The cases on which Mrs. Schoemakers relies, in which agencies excused untimely filings for "good cause," involved time limits imposed by the agency's own regulations, not a deadline provided by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the Board's administrative judge, we sympathize with Mrs. Schoemakers' plight. Neither courts nor administrative agencies, however, have the authority to waive requirements (including filing deadlines) that Congress has imposed as a condition to the payment of federal money. <span class="Italic">See Crown v. United States R.R. Retirement Bd.,</span> 811 F.2d 1017, 1020 (7th Cir. 1986) (quoting <span class="Italic">Gressley v. Califano,</span> 609 F.2d 1265. 1267 (7th Cir. 1979) ("A congressional mandate to pay statutory benefits...leaves no discretion in the agencies and courts but to limit the payment of benefits to those entitled to them.")). In &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A), Congress provided that an unmarried federal annuitant who marries may provide a survivor's annuity for his spouse only if he applies therefore within two years of marriage. Since Mr. Schoemakers did not do that, the Board correctly refused to provide Mrs. Schoemakers with a survivor's annuity.</p>

OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 195, 200 (1989) (survivor annuity claim: the medical evidence did not explain how the annuitant's medical condition affected his mental capacity to make decisions and offered no examples of his impairment); <span class="Italic">Lenox v.
