<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-35"><span class="space">f.</span> Contractor Employee</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Abernathy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 37, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16 (2022), determined that contractor employees have IRA protections as to loss of covered federal personnel benefits--a nonselection at a federal agency--resulting from reprisal for whistleblowing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant worked for the agency as a contractor. In August 2012, he filed a complaint with the agency's Office of Inspector General (OIG) alleging that agency officials had misappropriated funds. Later in 2012, he learned that he was not being selected for a position with the agency. The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that his nonselection was in reprisal for his protected disclosure to OIG. After OSC informed the appellant of the results of its investigation he filed this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to a show cause order issued by the administrative judge, the agency argued that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal. The agency argued that the appellant's disclosure was not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because he was neither an employee, nor an applicant, at the time he made it. The agency also argued that the failure to refer the appellant to the selecting official for the position in question was not a "personnel action" that could form the basis of an IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board requested <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs addressing whether it should reconsider its precedent in light of an apparent conflict with three nonprecedential cases by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit).[6] The <span class="Italic">amici</span> unanimously urged the Board to follow its existing precedent. Having considered the submissions of the parties and <span class="Italic">amici</span>, we see no reason to overrule our precedent in <span class="Italic">Greenup</span> [<span class="Italic">Greenup v. USDA</span>, 106 MSPR 202, 2007 MSPB 167 (2007)] and <span class="Italic">Weed</span> [<span class="Italic">Weed v. SSA</span>, 113 MSPR 221, 2010 MSPB 23 (2010)]. Under that precedent, the appellant's disclosures are not excluded from whistleblower protection simply because he was neither a Federal employee, nor an applicant for employment, when he made them. We stress that this holding is not <span id="Page_3684"></span>limited to Federal contractors, but applies to any individual who makes a whistleblowing disclosure at any time before becoming a Federal employee or applicant for employment.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Specifically, the Board observed that <span class="Italic">Greenup</span> and <span class="Italic">Weed</span> appear to conflict with the Federal Circuit's decisions in <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 376 F. App'x 29, 33-34 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Guzman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 F. App'x 927, 929 (Fed. Cir. 2002); and <span class="Italic">Amarille v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 28 F. App'x 931, 933 (Fed. Cir. 2001). However, nonprecedential decisions of the Federal Circuit are not binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 11 (2009). Further, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(B):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">A petition to review a final order or final decision of the Board that raises no challenge to the Board's disposition of allegations of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b) other than practices described in section 2302(b)(8), or (b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D) shall be filed in the [Federal Circuit] or any court of appeals of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, it is possible that the Board's decision in such a case would be reviewed not by the Federal Circuit, but instead by a different court of appeals. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 2022 MSPB 8, &#x00B6; 10 n.6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Employees of contractors have additional whistleblower protections under 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712, which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">An employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee or personal services contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described in paragraph (2) information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(a)(1). The recourse for such a violation is to submit a complaint to the Inspector General of the relevant agency, who will either determine that the complaint does not warrant investigation or investigate the complaint and submit a report to the head of the agency. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(b)(1)-(2). The head of the agency will then determine whether there is a sufficient basis to conclude that reprisal for whistleblowing took place, and issue an order denying or granting relief accordingly. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(1). Upon exhaustion of remedies with the head of the agency, the aggrieved employee may appeal the matter to Federal district court. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its additional pleading, OSC argues that a provision in the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2018 (2018 NDAA), Pub. L. No. 115-91, &#x00A7; 1097(c)(1)(B)(i)(III), 131 Stat. 1283, 1618 (2017), which went into effect after the close of the record on review, should be applied in this case. That provision states that a disclosure shall not be excluded from protection under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) because "the disclosure was made before the date on which the individual was appointed or applied for appointment to a position." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(1)(F). OSC argues that this provision clarifies existing law and should therefore be applied to all pending cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The new statutory language confirms the Board's interpretation of the prior statutory language, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Greenup</span>, and therefore the result is the same regardless of whether we apply the new statutory language. Under both <span class="Italic">Greenup</span> and the 2018 NDAA, the appellant's disclosure to OIG before he was an applicant for employment may be protected whistleblowing if it otherwise meets the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Therefore, we need not determine whether to apply this particular 2018 NDAA provision to this or any other pending cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the jurisdictional stage, the appellant is burdened only with making a nonfrivolous allegation that he reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced a violation of one of the circumstances described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Schoenig v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). The proper test for determining whether an individual had a reasonable belief that his disclosures were protected is whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the individual could reasonably conclude that the actions evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, or one of the other conditions set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Schoenig</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 8. The appellant's disclosure to OIG involved the purchase of video equipment with funds designated for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO). The appellant believed that the purchase violated acquisition regulations because the equipment was to be used for purposes other than OCO. We find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he reasonably believed he was disclosing a violation of a regulation. <span class="Italic">See Kutty v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 590, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11 (2004) (finding a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure when the appellant disclosed her belief that her supervisor had violated acquisition regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that his disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On cross petition for review, the agency argues that its failure to refer the appellant to the selecting official in connection with the position for which he applied is not a "personnel action" for purposes of the Board's IRA jurisdiction. We disagree. An appointment is among the personnel actions specifically enumerated in the statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i). We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's failure to refer him to the selecting official constitutes the failure to appoint him for purposes of the Board's jurisdiction over his IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Dorney v. Department of the Army</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 480, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (stating that an allegation of a failure to appoint is an allegation of a failure to take a personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the Deputy Director, who was both one of the subjects of his disclosure and the selecting official for the position for which he had applied, informed the appellant in September 2012 that he was not going to select the appellant because he had become "too confrontational." This alleged conversation took place the month after the appellant made his disclosure to OIG. The appellant alleges that he learned of his nonreferral 3 days later. We find that the appellant's allegations are sufficient to meet the contributing factor criterion under the knowledge-timing test at the jurisdictional stage.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Before Abernathy, supra, Cahill v. DHHS,</span> AT-1221-14-0906-W-1 (NP 4/1/2015) (remanded on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Cahill v. MSPB</span>, 821 F.3d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2016)), declined to extend IRA protection to disclosures by contractor employees, leaving for another day discussion of the effect of a contract employee's disclosures on that individual's future federal employment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged that, in the spring of 2004, he informed several agency officials that Michigan State University was unsuitable to serve as a Data Coordination Center for a certain agency project and was engaging in malfeasance in connection with the project. He further alleged that, in 2007 or 2008, his pay was reduced in retaliation for these disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed, however, that the appellant was working as a contractor during this time period--not under appointment as a federal employee. As relevant here, a "personnel action" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A), is an action with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in an agency or a position in one of the government corporations listed in 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9101. Because the appellant did not allege that he was an employee or applicant for employment in any such position during the relevant time period, we agree with the administrative judge that he failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subjected to a "personnel action" within the meaning of the WPA. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Greenup v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 6 (2007). Therefore, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the alleged reduction of his pay. <span class="Italic">See Greenup</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that, although he was technically a contractor during the reduction in pay action, he was effectively an agency employee because he worked closely with other agency employees and the agency exerted tight control over his work. He argues that "[t]o not apply an exception in these cases would result in a lack of protection for employees like the Appellant that engage in protected disclosures." The appellant further argues that 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712 indicates Congress's intent to extend whistleblower protections to contract employees, and that the Board should therefore assert jurisdiction over his claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the appellant's arguments, but we find that his close working relationship with agency employees is irrelevant because the law requires that the appellant himself be an employee or applicant for employment with an agency. <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 77 F.3d 1378, 1381 (1996). Neither the equities of this situation nor broad whistleblower protection policies empower the Board to expand its jurisdiction beyond that which is given by statute. <span class="Italic">See Lethridge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 675, &#x00B6; 10 (2005) (the Board cannot expand its own jurisdiction to address policy concerns); <span class="Italic">Drake v. Department of Transportation</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 676, 678 (1988) (the Board's jurisdiction is conferred by statute or regulation, and the Board has no power to expand or diminish that jurisdiction). Furthermore, while it is true that the law protects contract employees who have blown the whistle, it provides a different avenue of redress for such individuals than for individuals covered under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Anti-reprisal protections for employees of federal contractors are at 10 USC 2409, 41 USC 4705, 41 USC 4712, and implementing regulations. Those protections and procedures were described in <span class="Italic">Craine v. NSF</span>, 687 Fed. Appx. 682, 685-86, 689 (10th Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Joseph Mitchell Craine petitions for review of a decision issued by <span id="Page_3685"></span>the National Science Foundation (NSF) under the National Defense Authorization Act's Pilot Program for Enhancement of Contractor Protection from Reprisal for Disclosure of Certain Information ("Pilot Program"), 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712. The Pilot Program protects employees of government contractors and grantees from reprisal for making certain types of disclosures. NSF determined the disclosures made by Dr. Craine, a former employee of Kansas State University (KSU), did not fall within the Pilot Program's whistleblower protections. Proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, Dr. Craine now challenges NSF's decision. We have jurisdiction under 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(5) and deny the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Pilot Program prohibits government contractors and grantees from subjecting their employees to reprisal for disclosing gross mismanagement, waste, and other harms or wrongdoing relating to federal contracts or grants. The statute provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee of a contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or subgrantee or personal services contractor may not be discharged, demoted, or otherwise discriminated against as a reprisal for disclosing to a person or body described in paragraph (2) information that the employee reasonably believes is evidence of gross mismanagement of a Federal contract or grant, a gross waste of Federal funds, an abuse of authority relating to a Federal contract or grant, a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, or a violation of law, rule, or regulation related to a Federal contract (including the competition for or negotiation of a contract) or grant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(a)(1). The persons or bodies to whom a protected disclosure must be made are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; A Member of Congress or a representative of a committee of Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; An Inspector General.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; An authorized official of the Department of Justice or other law enforcement agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)&#x2003; A court or grand jury.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon receipt of a complaint by a person who believes he has been subjected to a prohibited reprisal, the Inspector General of the executive agency involved "shall investigate the complaint and, upon completion of such investigation, submit a report of the findings of the investigation to the person, the contractor or grantee concerned, and the head of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4712(b)(1). Within thirty days of receiving the Inspector General's report, the agency head must "determine whether there is sufficient basis to conclude that the contractor or grantee...has subjected the complainant to a reprisal prohibited by subsection (a) and shall either issue an order denying relief" or remedy the reprisal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(1). The controlling burdens of proof are set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e). 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(6). These burdens require an employee to show that a protected disclosure contributed to the adverse personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). Even if the employee meets that burden, the employer need not take any corrective action if it presents "clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We review NSF's decision under the standards set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 701-06. <span class="Italic">See</span> 41 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4712(c)(5).
