<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-181"><span class="space">l.</span> Delayed Receipt, Misrouting of Initial Decision, PFR; Constructive Receipt</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1997 the Board amended 5 CFR 1201.114(d) to permit additional time to file a PFR when it can be demonstrated that the initial decision was received more than five days after the date of issuance. The rule, now 5 CFR 1201.114(e), provides that "[a]ny petition for review must be filed within 35 days after the date of issuance of the initial decision or, if the petitioner shows that the initial decision was received more than 5 days after the date of issuance, within 30 days after the date the petitioner received the initial decision." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 86 MSPR 131, 135 &#x00B6; 2 (2000) (applying a rule permitting 30 days to file a PFR if the initial decision was received more than five days after its issuance). Good cause for extending the period for filing a PFR is shown when the appellant and her attorney do not receive a copy of the initial decision until after it has become final. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mak v. TVA,</span> AT-0351-14-0767-I-1 (NP 3/16/2016) (excusing a PFR a day late when the appellant's representative did not receive the initial decision on time, albeit the appellant timely received it as an e-filer); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 186, 187-88 (1986); <span class="Italic">Wannamaker v. OPM</span>, 15 MSPR 362, 363 n.1 (1983) ("The initial decision's certificate of service indicates that appellant's copy was sent by regular mail, and that appellant's attorney, who previously had been designated appellant's representative, did not receive a copy. In light of this, and of the agency's failure to object to the petition for review as untimely, we hereby grant appellant's request for an extension of time."); <span class="Italic">McKowen v. DLA</span>, 10 MSPR 98, 100 (1982) (agency's delayed petition was excused when it did not receive the Board order concerning the last day of submission until the day after the petition was due); <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 335, 337-38 (1981) (excusing delayed PFR when neither the appellant nor his representative timely received a copy of the initial decision); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 462, 464, 5 MSPB 3 (1981) (granting extension based on the agency's delayed receipt of the initial decision). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Nash v. OPM</span>, 26 MSPR 700, 703 (1985) (appellant could not complain that his representative did not receive a copy of the initial decision when the appellant and his representative failed to notify the regional office that the appellant had secured representation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The party seeking to avoid denial of its PFR as late because of delayed failure to receive an initial decision must supply evidence concerning the receipt of the initial decision, <span class="Italic">Pace v. OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 681, 683-84 &#x00B6; 5, 2010 MSPB 100 (2010) (OPM filed the belated PFR):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has failed to prove that it timely filed its petition for review. The initial decision's certificate of service reflects that it was mailed to the agency's address of record on February 12, 2010. Board precedent and regulations recognize that documents placed in the mail are presumed to be received in 5 days. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cabarloc v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Williamson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 <span id="Page_1770"></span>M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l). The agency has submitted no evidence, such as a sworn statement or a postmarked envelope, showing that the agency did not timely receive the initial decision. Similarly, the agency's representative has presented nothing, such as a sworn statement or affidavit, to support her assertion that she did not receive the initial decision until March 5, 2010. Accordingly, the agency has not shown that its petition for review should be considered timely on the basis that its receipt of the initial decision was delayed. Therefore, we find that the agency's petition for review was 6 days late.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">General statements that an initial decision was not received did not serve to excuse a belated PFR, <span class="Italic">Williams v. USDA,</span> AT-0752-10-0451-I-1 (NP 9/20/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge issued the initial decision on April 6, 2010, and the appellant was clearly apprised that the decision would become final on May 11, 2010, unless he filed a petition for review on or before that date. It is undisputed that the appellant filed his petition for review on April 27, 2011, nearly a year late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may waive the time limit for filing a petition for review, in the interest of justice, after considering all the facts and circumstances of a particular case. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5. To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 433, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that he had no knowledge that the administrative judge had issued an initial decision until he spoke to someone from the Board on April 20, 2011, and that individual sent him a copy of the initial decision by facsimile transmittal. However, the certificate of service for the initial decision reflects that it was mailed to the appellant on April 6, 2010, at his address of record. The Board has held that a letter properly addressed, stamped, and mailed is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. <span class="Italic">Gross v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 334, &#x00B6; 7 (2006); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lagreca v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 162, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even accepting the appellant's sworn affidavit that he did not receive the initial decision until April 2011, the Board has found that a general allegation that an appellant's mail was not delivered in a timely fashion, without more, does not constitute good cause for an untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Powers v. Department of the Navy</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 83, 86 (1991). To the extent the appellant asserts that the agency allegedly failed to follow proper procedures and/or provided misinformation regarding its investigation of his discrimination claims and issuance of a FAD, these claims are insufficient to establish good cause for the appellant's delay in filing his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that he called for a "status update on final decision" on November 10, January 11, and April 18 and that "[he] received a call back stating I call M.S.P.B. [sic] for the status and Information." In his motion to waive the time limit for filing a petition for review, the appellant explains that, in April 2011, he called Investigator Darrel Hanges for an update on his final decision from the agency, and Mr. Hanges gave him the telephone number of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and told him to contact the Board. Based on the foregoing assertions, it appears that the appellant made numerous inquiries concerning the status of the FAD to the equal employment opportunity investigator and to others, but did not contact the Board until on or about April 18, 2011. Thus, the appellant allowed over a year to elapse before inquiring into the status of his appeal. His "failure to make such inquiries was not the act of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 334, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing reasons, we find that the appellant has failed to establish good cause for the untimely filing of his petition for review, and we dismiss it on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The additional time for filing a PFR when the initial decision is delayed in the mail applies to delays that are not the fault of the appellant. <span class="Italic">Bennett v. VA</span>, 97 MSPR 1, 3 &#x00B6; 5 &#x0026; n.* (2004), involved an initial decision that was belatedly received because the appellant's post office box was closed for lack of payment of the required fee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 6, 1997, the Board amended the regulations governing time limits for filing appeals and petitions for review. Prior to this amendment, the filing deadline for a petition for review of an initial decision, or for an appeal of a final or reconsideration decision that did not set an effective date, was 35 days after the issuance of the decision, regardless of the date of receipt. However, with regard to initial appeals, the Board observed that "[w]here the 35-day time limit applies and there is a delay by the agency in mailing the decision after it is issued, and/or a delay by the U.S. Postal Service that results in more than 5 days elapsing between issuance of the decision, an appellant could have less than 30 days to file an appeal with MSPB." 62 Fed. Reg. 59991, 59991 (Nov. 6, 1997). Thus, in amending the deadline to permit filing an appeal within 30 days of receipt of the decision, the Board contemplated delays by the agency or the postal service, not negligence on the part of the appellant. Likewise, in amending 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d) to permit filing a petition for review within 30 days of receipt of the initial decision, the Board did not intend to reward an appellant's failure to arrange for the receipt or forwarding of her mail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Delay in filing a response to a PFR will be excused if it appears that the party filing the response belatedly received its copy of the PFR because of an incorrect address or another reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marshall v. VA</span>, DC-0752-13-0199-I-2 (NP 2/20/2015) (late PFR was accepted when the appellant switched from e-filing to paper filing, checked with the regional office periodically about the status case, did not receive the mailed copy of the initial decision, later checked the e-filing repository, discovered the initial decision, and promptly filed his PFR); <span class="Italic">Salaz v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 300, 302 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) ("The record, however, shows a delay in the appellant's receipt of the initial decision. The administrative judge made a notation to the record that the initial decision twice came back to him as undeliverable, and on December 26, 2000, he mailed the decision to the appellant's new address."); <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 70 MSPR 119, 121 (1996) (forgiving a delay of one day by the agency in filing its response to the appellant's PFR; the appellant did not serve the agency with the PFR until 11 days after she filed her petition with the Board), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Rackers v. DOJ</span>, 79 MSPR 262, 268 (1998) (excusing a short delay in the filing of an agency response when some confusion occurred over the date of service of a PFR); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 303, 305 (1996) (excusing a delay in response to a "show cause" order from the Board's Clerk on the basis of a sworn statement that the order was not received by the agency representative). There must still be an explanation of the timing of the document received in the mail. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lockhart v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 396, 399 &#x00B6; 7 (2003) ("The appellant's allegation regarding mail delays is speculative and wholly unsupported by any evidence. Nor has the appellant stated when he actually received the initial decision."); <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 225, 227 (1993) ("[T]he appellant's general claim of mail delay, without specifically stating the date that he received the deficient petition or the date that he mailed the refiled petition for review, is not sufficient to show good cause for the untimely filing."). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-082.html#sec2-81">Appellant's Responsibility When Decision Notice or Information About Appeal Rights Is Not Received</a>," concerning nonreceipt of adverse action or other notices containing appeal rights.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency is responsible for internal coordination of appeals processing. If it provides incorrect addresses to the Board, or if for some reason initial decisions are improperly routed within the agency hierarchy, subsequent delays resulting in untimely PFRs are not excused. <span class="Italic">McLemore v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 3 MSPR 330, 333, 3 MSPB 413 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson v. DHUD</span>, 54 MSPR 139, 141 (1992) (delay in filing a response to a PFR was not excused because of the misrouting of the appellant's PFR); <span class="Italic">Siegmund v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 524, 526 (1983) (agency's internal misrouting of a Board order was not good cause for a late response to the PFR); <span class="Italic">Moore v. GSA</span>, 12 MSPR 88, 90 (1982) ("[T]he initial decision was properly mailed to the correct agency representative, and only internal misrouting apparently kept it from coming to Counsel's attention in a more timely manner."). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Keatting v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 642, 644 n.1 (1998) (delay by the agency of two days in response to a PFR was excused when the PFR was misrouted to the agency during a period of base closure and relocation and when the appellant's personnel records were in storage at the regional records center). An agency delay resulting from difficulty in routing mail through the post office in the agency complex was excused after the agency explained the problems with the mail routing system and presented the Board with a plan to correct those deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 99, 101 n.2, 7 MSPB 28 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board contributes to the misrouting of a notice to the agency regarding the deadline for responding to appellant's PFR, a short delay in the agency's filing will be excused. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Landingham v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 77, 80 &#x00B6; 5 (1999); <span class="Italic">Birdsong v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 524, 527 (1997) (notice from the Board's clerk stating the deadline for filing the response was sent to an incorrect address); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Barnhill v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 378, 380 (1982) (one reason for a delay in the PFR was that correspondence between the MSPB and the agency was improperly addressed despite the agency's notice to the AJ of a change of representative). An incomplete mailing of an initial decision to the agency may warrant forgiveness of a belated PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Betz v. DHUD</span>, 12 MSPR 107, 109 n.1 (1982) (agency made repeated attempts to secure a missing page); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Shadrick v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 357, 360 &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (failure of the Board to serve the proper agency representative excused the agency's nonparticipation before the AJ and required remand for further development and adjudication).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Service of an initial decision on the appellant's attorney starts the clock for filing the PFR. If an appellant is represented by counsel, the AJ may send two copies of an initial decision to the attorney: one is sent directly to the attorney; the other is sent to the client "in care of" the attorney. The client may obtain a <span id="Page_1771"></span>copy directly if it is requested that his address be separately entered on the region's service list. If the attorney receives the mail of his client, some delay will occur before the appellant receives a copy of the decision. The delay may be substantial if the attorney was discharged by the client or the client changed location without notice to the attorney after the appeal was filed. The appellant's delayed receipt of a decision does not generally toll the time limit for the PFR if the representative obtained it on time. <span class="Italic">Catlin v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 109, 111 (1984) (citing <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Irwin v.

MSPB</span>, 113 Fed. Appx. 924, 925 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (time for filing a PFR with the Board ran from the date appellant's counsel received the initial decision when the appellant's copy was misdirected in the mail); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Fain v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 98 MSPR 162, 164 &#x00B6; 5 (2005) (receipt of the award by the union attorney (also appellant's representative) started the clock running for filing a Board appeal from the award). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Mak v. TVA,</span> AT-0351-14-0767-I-1 (NP 3/16/2016) (excusing a PFR delayed by a day, despite the appellant's status as an e-filer when her representative did not timely receive the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The rule that receipt of the initial decision by the appellant's attorney triggers the deadline for a PFR applies to initial decisions that are transmitted to counsel by e-filing. <span class="Italic">Laboy v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 570, 572-73 &#x00B6; 6, 2006 MSPB 299 (2006) ("Board documents served electronically on registered e-filers are deemed received on the date of electronic submission, or, if submitted on a weekend or federal holiday, on the first business day after the electronic submission. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(l).

<p class="Body-Text">The lack of communication between the appellant and his counsel furnishes no basis for extension of the period to file the PFR. <span class="Italic">Reynolds v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 5, 7 (1988) (appellant was responsible for his former counsel's failure to file a timely PFR). The fact that the appellant's attorney fails to notify him of receipt of the initial decision does not relieve appellant of his obligation to timely file his PFR. The appellant is responsible for the actions or inactions of his representative. <span class="Italic">Darby v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 582, 583 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 1343, 1346 (Fed.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 95 MSPR 391, 393 &#x00B6; 4 (2004) (appellant asserted that she received the initial decision belatedly because it was misdelivered to another apartment in her apartment complex; "[t]he appellant has made no allegation or showing of late receipt by her representative, and receipt of an initial decision by an appellant's designated representative constitutes constructive receipt by the appellant"); <span class="Italic">Hall v. DLA</span>, 69 MSPR 17, 20 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">Darby</span>) (receipt of the initial decision by "appellant's duly designated representative constitutes constructive receipt by that appellant").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The designation of a representative may be ambiguous, as when the appellant designates a union as well as a union representative to act on his behalf. Service of the initial decision will be considered to have been properly made on the union representative, however, if through the course of proceedings before the AJ it was made clear that the union representative was the actual representative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 496, 498 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Berry v. VA</span>, 25 MSPR 50, 51 n.1 (1984) (although the union representative was hospitalized, the Board found no reason why the union office could not have processed a PFR or forwarded it to the representative). But if an individual is not properly designated as a representative, delay by the appellant in filing a PFR will not be excused because the undesignated representative did not receive a copy of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Brady v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 57 MSPR 341, 346 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 1997 regulatory amendment, Board decisions held that if neither the appellant nor the representative received the initial decision immediately after it was issued, the Board expected prompt action once the initial decision was received. <span class="Italic">Federico v.

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions preceding the regulatory amendment required the petitioner to make reasonable inquiries concerning the status of an initial decision. The filing period was extended only if the appellant acted prudently to inquire of the status of the initial decision and then promptly filed a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Deville v.

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant was required to act with reasonable dispatch to determine the status of her appeal should it be alleged that an initial decision was not received.

<p class="Body-Text">Despite the regulatory change, an appellant cannot wait for an unreasonable period before making inquiry to determine the status of his appeal. Diligence is still required.
