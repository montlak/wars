<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-153"><span class="space">c.</span> Drug Testing</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Van Raab</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 1395-98 (1989), the Supreme Court determined that drug testing of federal employees by the government is subject to the reasonableness standards of the Fourth Amendment. The Court decided that warrantless drug sampling of Customs Service agents who carry firearms is proper:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, the possible harm against which the Government <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to guard is substantial, the need to prevent its occurrence furnishes an ample justification for reasonable searches calculated to advance the Government's goal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Government has demonstrated that its compelling interests in safeguarding our borders and the public safety outweigh the privacy expectations of employees who <span class="Italic">seek</span> to be promoted to positions that directly involve the interdiction of illegal drugs or that require the incumbent to carry a firearm. We hold that the testing of those employees is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are unable, on the present record, to assess the reasonableness of the Government's testing program insofar as it covers employees who are required "to handle classified material."... We readily agree that the Government has a compelling interest in protecting truly sensitive information from those who, "under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons,...might compromise [such] information."... We also agree that employees who <span class="Italic">seek</span> promotions to positions where they would handle sensitive information can be required to submit to a urine test under the Service's screening program, especially if the positions covered under this category require background investigations, medical examinations, or other intrusions that may be expected to diminish their expectations of privacy in respect of a urinalysis test....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not clear...whether the category defined by the Service's testing directive encompasses only those Customs employees likely to gain access to sensitive information....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that the suspicionless testing of employees who apply for promotion to positions directly involving the interdiction of illegal drugs, or to positions which require the incumbent to carry a firearm, is reasonable. The Government's compelling interests in preventing the promotion of drug users to positions where they might endanger the integrity of our Nation's borders or the life of the citizenry outweigh the privacy interests of those who <span class="Italic">seek</span> promotion to these positions, who enjoy a diminished expectation of privacy by virtue of the special, and obvious, physical and ethical demands of those positions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Refer to the companion case involving federally mandated drug and alcohol testing of train employees involved in train accidents, <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives Ass'n</span>, 109 S. Ct. 1402 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers drug testing constitutional. Drug testing may be random, that is, "suspicionless," or it may occur when an employee's behavior leads to a suspicion of drug involvement. The "reasonable suspicion" leading to an order for an employee to undergo drug testing may be based on information from the types of sources accepted by courts making "probable cause" determinations in criminal cases. The information may be developed through a variety of investigations or observations, including background checks conducted by OPM. The question is whether the agency reasonably acted on the information available to it at the time the drug testing was ordered. It is immaterial that the information relied upon by the agency later proved to be incorrect or unreliable. Applying constitutional interpretations of the courts, the Board determined to be reasonable random drug testing (and testing in accordance with an abeyance or last chance agreement) in <span class="Italic">Shelledy v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 49 MSPR 257, 261-63 (1991), involving removal of an air traffic control specialist:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mandatory urine testing, when conducted by the government, constitutes a "search and seizure" under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and therefore must be reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Association</span>, 489 U.S. 602, 109 S. Ct. 1402, 1411-13, 103 L. Ed.2d 639 (1989); <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Von Raabb</span>, 489 U.S. 656, 109 S. Ct. 1384, 1390, 103 L. Ed.2d 685 (1989); <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. 709, 717, 107 S. Ct. 1492, 1497, 94 L. Ed.2d 714 (1987). While a search generally must be supported by a warrant issued upon probable cause, neither a warrant, probable cause, nor individualized suspicion is required in every case to prove reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Railway Labor Executives' Association</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1413-21.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the first random drug test was conducted as a condition of the appellant's employment. The appellant argues that his agreement to provide the urine sample to retain his job did not waive his Fourth Amendment right against an unreasonable search, and we agree. The appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that the first test was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. He argues that the agency failed to prove that the ATCS position was so demanding that it justified the intrusion into the appellant's privacy rights under the Fourth Amendment. In this respect, the appellant asserts that Dr. Childs conceded that the urine testing did not measure impairment. The appellant claims that, because the agency failed to establish a connection between a positive urine sample and impairment of the appellant's job performance, there was no basis for the administrative judge's finding that the government's interests outweighed his privacy rights. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When determining whether a search is reasonable, consideration must be given to the benefits that issue from the exercise of that search. In <span class="Italic">Railway Labor Executives' Association</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1422, the Supreme Court found that regulations requiring railway employees to submit to blood and urine testing for drugs and alcohol following major train accidents or incidents, and authorizing breath or urine tests to be administered to employees who violate certain safety rules were reasonable intrusions into the privacy rights of employees, without a warrant or showing of individualized suspicion requirements, because of: (1) The limited discretion exercised by the railroad employers under the regulations; (2) the compelling safety interests served by the toxicological tests; and (3) the diminished expectation of privacy that attached to information pertaining to the fitness of covered employees. Speaking for the Court, Justice Kennedy, noting that the regulations posed only limited threats to the privacy rights of the covered employees, in contrast to the compelling government interest in testing without individualized suspicion, observed:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1591"></span>We believe that the decrease of the potential catastrophic harm in lives lost resulting from an impaired ATCS justifies the agency's program of testing air traffic control specialists, and therefore, compels the finding that the agency's program of random drug testing, in these circumstances, was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 109 S. Ct. at 1397-98 (the Custom Service's compelling interest in preventing the promotion of drug users to positions where they might endanger the integrity of United States borders or the lives of American citizens warrants the mandatory urine testing of applicants for promotion to positions directly involved in the interdiction of illegal drugs, or to positions that require the carrying of firearms, and outweighs the privacy interests of those <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing promotion to such positions). Moreover, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has specifically upheld the constitutionality of the agency's drug testing program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

Therefore, we find no error in the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency's drug testing was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the first test, conducted under the agency's random testing program, the follow-up test was conducted in accordance with the terms of the abeyance letter. Although the appellant contends that he was coerced into agreeing to the terms of the abeyance letter to retain his job, the record shows that, before he agreed to the terms of the abeyance letter, he was given sufficient time to obtain legal counsel and to weigh the options available to him. The appellant presented no evidence to demonstrate that his decision was coerced. Therefore, we find no support in the record for his argument that the administrative judge erred in finding that he consented to the follow-up test. Moreover, even if the appellant had not consented to the second test, for the reasons stated above, we would find it reasonable.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge correctly determined that the Board has the authority to determine the reasonableness of the agency's drug testing program in light of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. <span class="Italic">See Watson v.

In determining whether the agency's drug testing program was reasonable, the administrative judge looked to the standard of reasonableness set forth in decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that had previously interpreted the particular drug testing program at issue in this appeal<span class="Italic">. See AFGE v. Roberts</span>, 9 F.3d 1464 (9th Cir. 1993) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>); <span class="Italic">AFGE v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency apparently asserted below that decisions of the Ninth Circuit should not apply because the incidents at issue in this appeal occurred within the geographic boundaries of the Tenth Circuit, it does not challenge on review the administrative judge's adoption of the Ninth Circuit's standard. We note that the administrative judge's decision is entirely consistent with the approach that the Board took in <span class="Italic">Shelledy</span>, a very similar case. In <span class="Italic">Shelledy</span>, 49 MSPR at 262-63, the Board adopted the finding of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the drug testing program at issue in that appeal was constitutional. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Shelledy</span>, as in the initial decision in this appeal, the decisionmaker adopted the reasoning of a court whose decisions are not binding on the Board, but where the court squarely addressed the constitutionality of the particular drug testing program at issue in the respective cases. The administrative judge's approach is therefore consistent with Board precedent and we discern no reason to disturb his reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mandatory drug testing, when conducted by the Federal government, is a search and seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and must be reasonable to pass constitutional muster. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v.

The Ninth Circuit has held that the relevant portions of the drug testing program at issue in this appeal are constitutional if: (1) As to employees employed outside correctional institutions, only those employees who have access to information regarding the Witness Security program (Wit Sec) or the Witness/Victim program (Wit Vic) are subject to random testing; and (2) all employees subject to random testing are also subject to testing upon "reasonable suspicion" as that term was construed in <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 969 F.2d at 792-93. <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>, 9 F.3d at 1468.</p>

For example, in analogous situations in the criminal law context, the courts recognize an exception to the requirement that law enforcement officers obtain a warrant, issued by a magistrate upon a determination of probable cause, before conducting a search. Under this so-called "good faith exception," the courts will not suppress evidence obtained under a warrant later determined to be invalid if the law enforcement officers obtaining the warrant and performing the search relied in good faith on the warrant's apparent validity. <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this analogy, we are persuaded that the relevant inquiry in this appeal is whether the agency's reasonable suspicion determination was sufficient at the time that it was made and that the administrative judge erred by evaluating the adequacy of the agency's reasonable suspicion determination based on facts that did not come to light until after the fact. An agency manager is not required, in making a decision affecting the employment of one of his employees, to consider facts as he believes that an adjudicator might after the fact imagine them to be; rather, an agency manager is entitled to rely on his professional experience to consider facts as he reasonably believes them to be at the time that he makes his decision. <span class="Italic">See Waters v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, Kane testified that, in late March 1993, agency human resources official Ray Marshall came to <span class="Italic">see</span> him about the appellant's routine background re-investigation. Marshall told Kane that the OPM investigator had uncovered derogatory information about the appellant indicating possible marijuana use, and that the investigator sought authorization to expend funds to expand the scope of the investigation to pursue the derogatory information. Marshall reported to Kane that Clarence Garrison told the OPM investigator that the appellant had bought marijuana cigarettes from an individual named "Marvin" in Clarence Garrison's presence, and the appellant had smoked marijuana in his presence a number of times from 1991 to as recently as 1993.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the agency's information from the OPM investigator was specific and detailed. The derogatory information came from a close family member, the appellant's brother. As Kane testified, members of a family often tend to be protective of each other, and Clarence Garrison's close family relationship to the appellant tended to enhance his credibility and reliability in Kane's eyes. Although Kane did not conduct an investigation into Clarence Garrison's credibility or reliability, there was nothing in the information that he received from the OPM investigator that caused Kane to suspect that Clarence Garrison might not be a reliable and credible source. Further, although the appellant introduced some evidence at the hearing pertaining to Clarence Garrison's alleged mental illness and purported lack of reliability, Kane was not aware of this evidence, and had not even an inference of any alleged mental illness or lack of reliability, at the time he made his reasonable suspicion determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find, based on the information available to the agency at the time it made its reasonable suspicion determination, that the agency had a reasonable suspicion sufficient to warrant directing the appellant to take a drug test, and that its instruction that he submit to a drug test was permissible under its drug testing program. In light of this finding, we need not address the appellant's argument that Clarence Garrison was mentally ill and unreliable because this information was not available to the agency at the time it made its reasonable suspicion determination. Additionally, because the agency's instruction was one that it was entitled to have obeyed, the appellant may be disciplined for refusing to submit to the drug test<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 49 MSPR at 516. There is no dispute that the appellant refused to submit to the drug test and, thus, the charge is sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1592"></span>The appellant asserts in his cross petition for review that the administrative judge erred by not finding that the agency committed harmful error by failing to follow the procedures set forth in its Program Statement (P.S.) 3000.02 concerning Personnel Security, Suitability, and Investigation. Specifically, he avers that the agency failed to afford him the opportunity to respond to allegations of drug use prior to directing him to submit to a drug test....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On its face, P.S. 3000.02 applies to suitability determinations, background investigations, and the like. However, when derogatory information about possible drug use surfaces during an investigation covered by P.S. 3000.02, there is considerable overlap between that program statement and the agency's drug free workplace program statement. The administrative judge correctly found that the agency was free to follow the procedures set forth in its drug free workplace program statement without first imposing the additional requirements from P.S. 3000.02. Moreover, in light of our findings above that Kane had a reasonable suspicion sufficient to warrant directing the appellant to take a drug test based on the information that he had at the time, the appellant has not shown that, had the agency afforded him the opportunity to respond to Clarence Garrison's allegations against him prior to instructing him to submit to a drug test, the agency likely would not have directed him to submit to the drug test or removed him for refusing to take the drug test. Thus, he has not proven his affirmative defense of harmful error. <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 681, 685 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Garrison v. DOJ</span>, 72 F.3d 1566, 1568-71 (Fed. Cir. 1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the determination whether Mr. Kane had "reasonable suspicion" that Daryel Garrison had used drugs was to be made on the basis of the factual information Mr. Kane had when he made the determination, and not on the basis of additional information that subsequently was disclosed or which he could have discovered by further inquiry. The Third Circuit recognized, in a case involving a reasonable suspicion urinalysis drug-testing of a public employee, that the issue is "whether the city had sufficient evidence at the time of the compelled urinalysis to support an objectively reasonable suspicion that [the police officer] used illegal drugs." <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Philadelphia Police Department</span>, 840 F.2d 1139, 1144 (3rd Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1004, 109 S. Ct. 1636, 104 L. Ed.2d 153 (1989)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determination of reasonable suspicion, like that of probable cause, necessarily turns upon the information the person making the determination had when that person acted. The facts then before that person either were or were not sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that a particular individual used drugs. If that information was sufficient, it is immaterial that other information that weakened or undercut that conclusion subsequently was disclosed or could have been discovered by further inquiry. Stated another way, the AJ's theory that by making further inquiry Mr. Kane could and should have discovered other facts that weakened the reliability of the information upon which he acted, is but another way of stating that the information Mr. Kane had was not sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because "[u]rine tests are searches," <span class="Italic">Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. at 665, 109 S. Ct. at 1390, an employer's "drug-testing program must meet the reasonableness requirement of the Fourth Amendment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. What is reasonable, however, depends upon all the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. "Reasonable suspicion is a less demanding standard than probable cause not only in the sense that reasonable suspicion can be established with information that is different in quantity or content than that required to establish probable cause, but also in the sense that reasonable suspicion can arise from information that is less reliable than that required to show probable cause." <span class="Italic">Alabama v. White</span>, 496 U.S. 325, 330, 110 S. Ct. 2412, 2416, 110 L. Ed.2d 301 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Mr. Kane made his reasonable suspicion determination, he had the following information before him: Daryel Garrison's brother Clarence had stated that he had <span class="Italic">seen</span> Daryel use marijuana "several times in the last few years" and most recently less than a year before, and that Clarence had <span class="Italic">seen</span> Daryel purchase the drug from someone named "Marvin." Clarence also had stated where Daryel's drug use had occurred. The source of the information was not an unnamed informant, but Daryel's brother, who provided detailed, specific, information about the frequency and location of his brother's drug use and a purchase transaction, all of which allegedly took place in his presence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that this information was sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion in Kane's mind that Daryel had used marijuana. There was nothing about this information that should have led Kane, before acting upon it, to question its authenticity or reliability or to corroborate it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kane reasonably could have assumed that Mr. Garrison's brother was familiar with Daryel's behavior, and Kane had no reason even to suspect that Clarence might have fabricated the story as a result of his mental illness. "[T]here is nothing about a sibling relationship," <span class="Italic">United States v. Johnson</span>, 925 F.2d 1115, 1117 (8th Cir. 1991), that would make suspect the information about his brother that Clarence had provided. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To the contrary, the relationship enhanced the credibility of Clarence's statements.... Moreover, Clarence's statements described events that Clarence himself had <span class="Italic">seen</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, even in probable cause cases, where stronger evidence may be necessary, "[T]he Court has never suggested that the police, with [eyewitness] information in hand, must conduct a further investigation." <span class="Italic">Gramenos v. Jewel Cos., Inc.</span>, 797 F.2d 432, 439 (7th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 481 U.S. 1028, 107 S. Ct. 1952, 95 L. Ed.2d 525 (1987). Several courts have held that the uncorroborated statements of eyewitnesses with no motive to falsify are enough to support a finding of probable cause.... The drug-testing cases Daryel cites nowhere suggest that for its suspicion to be reasonable, an agency must make an affirmative investigation of its source's credibility....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In probable cause cases, courts have upheld police searches based on information from informants that were no more, and sometimes less, well-credentialed than Mr. Garrison's brother, where the information was sufficiently detailed and specific....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent argues that once Clarence Garrison's reliability as a source of information about Daryel Garrison's conduct had been seriously challenged, the basis for the agency's "reasonable suspicion" determination was undermined, and the agency "was required to obtain independent corroboration before testing could be required." As we have explained, however, at the time that Kane made his "reasonable suspicion" determination and directed Daryel Garrison to take the drug test, Kane had no information or reason to believe that Clarence Garrison was not a reliable and trustworthy source of information. The first time that Kane was informed of Clarence Garrison's mental illness was at the oral reply to the notice of proposed removal that Daryel Garrison and his lawyer made to Kane several weeks after Daryel Garrison had refused to provide a urine sample. In effect, the dissent reiterates the conclusion of the Administrative Judge, which the Board and this court reject. As we hold, the validity of the "reasonable suspicion" determination must be based upon the information on which the determination was made, and not upon what additional information subsequently developed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Objections to random drug testing were rejected in <span class="Italic">Hansen v. DHS</span>, 911 F.3d 1362, 1369-70 (Fed. Cir. 2018), determining that there was no requirement that specific positions be designated for testing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether the Board erred in finding that Mr. Hansen was properly ordered to undergo random drug testing. Drug testing constitutes a search, and the Fourth Amendment limits an agency's ability to subject its employees to drug testing. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989). To pass constitutional muster, testing must be reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Holton v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Customs and Border Patrol imposes random drug testing on employees in "testing designated positions." Mr. Hansen does not challenge the general reasonableness of this policy. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 103 ("I am not disputing the [agency] policy for random drug tests...."). Instead, Mr. Hansen urges that, absent a specific testing designation, the agency may not reasonably conduct random drug tests. He thus asserts that because the government failed to show that <span class="Italic">he</span> occupied a testing designated position, requiring him to undergo a drug test violated his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide whether, absent a specific designation, the agency might permissibly have tested Mr. Hansen. The Board found that Mr. Hansen occupied a position subject to random drug testing, and we hold that substantial evidence supports that fact finding. The agency's "Drug-Free Federal Workplace Program" handbook lists employees with "access to the Customs Law Enforcement Automated Systems" as testing designated, and evidence offered by the government indicated that Mr. Hansen's position required access to such systems. Mr. Hansen attacks this evidence, but our sole inquiry is whether substantial evidence supports the Board's finding. It does, and we do not reweigh evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time on appeal, Mr. Hansen now also argues that his test violated his Fourth Amendment rights because there was "no conceivable basis upon which [he] could have ascertained that he was subject to testing." He asserts "there must be some objective basis upon which a reasonable employee would be able to ascertain that he was subject to testing. Otherwise, testing would be arbitrary and not reasonable." Mr. Hansen previously argued that the government's failure to introduce his notice of testing designation proved that he was not subject to random drug testing. But before the Board, despite being represented by counsel, Mr. Hansen did not allege that any lack of notice rendered his test constitutionally impermissible. Accordingly, we decline to address the argument in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See Solorio v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 164 F.3d 602, 604 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (recognizing that the Government may generally subject "employees responsible for the safety of others" to suspicionless drug testing). When these requirements are met, an agency can test an employee even if he does not occupy a testing-designated position. <span class="Italic">See National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 489 U.S. at 667-77 (upholding a drug-testing requirement for employees who applied for promotion to drug-interdiction positions or to positions that required carrying a firearm).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, the Supreme Court upheld regulations requiring railroads to test employees "directly involved" in certain accidents, including accidents resulting in death or property damage exceeding $50,000. 489 U.S. at 609, 618-33. It further upheld regulations permitting railroads to conduct testing based on "a 'reasonable suspicion' that an employee's acts or omissions contributed to the occurrence or severity of [an] accident or incident...or...in the event of certain specific rule violations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 611, 618-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's post-accident testing procedures under its drug-testing program are similar to the permissive drug-testing regulations upheld by the Court in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>. Like those regulations, the agency's procedures allow for testing employees "reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed" to certain accidents. We do not agree with the appellant that "contributed to," as used in the procedures, is "overbroad and vague," given that this same term was used in the regulations upheld by the Court in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In support of his argument, the appellant relies on <span class="Italic">Plane v. United States</span>, 750 F. Supp. 1358, 1373-74 (W.D. Mich. 1990), in which a U.S. district court judge found that a drug-free workplace plan that called for testing all employees "involved" in accidents was overly broad. However, we find the agency's program is appropriately tailored to employees that are reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed to accidents. Therefore, we are not persuaded by the analogy to the plan at issue in <span class="Italic">Plane</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the activity involved here, the lifting and moving of a 60,000-pound load by crane, is "fraught with such risks of injury to others that even a momentary lapse of attention can have disastrous consequences." <span class="Italic">Shelledy</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 262 (quoting <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, 489 U.S. at 628). Therefore, the agency's use of its drug-testing program to test the appellant posed only a limited threat to his privacy rights but, by contrast, directly served a compelling Government safety interest.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that he had delegated the responsibility for the crane lift to a rigger in charge, and therefore he could not be tested because he did not engage in a "triggering event" that "caused" the accident. He argues that the agency improperly employed its Crane Team Concept to test him, despite the lack of any causal link between him and the accident, essentially holding him strictly responsible for the accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in his petition for review, the appellant concedes the circumstances that both bring him within the purview of the agency's post-accident testing procedures and also show that the agency reasonably suspected that he contributed to the accident. The triggering event under the agency's drug-testing program was the boom of the crane striking a building, causing more than $10,000 in property damage. <span class="Italic">See Skinner</span>, 489 U.S. at 630 (using the phrase "triggering event" to refer to an incident that requires or permits regulatory drug and alcohol testing). The appellant not only supervised the crane team but he also briefed the team before appointing a rigger in charge and moving on to the endpoint of the lift. The appellant argues that there is no evidence that he violated any rule, regulation, or instruction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the agency's drug-testing program does not require such a showing. The proper standard to be subject to post-accident testing under the agency's rules is whether the agency had a reasonable suspicion that the appellant could have caused or contributed to the accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the record reflects that the appellant instructed the crane team immediately before the accident and was still actively involved in the operation when the accident occurred, we find that it was reasonable for the agency to suspect that he could have caused or contributed to the accident and to drug test him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horton</span> was affirmed on review, <span class="Italic">Holton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 884 F.3d 1142, 1146-49 (Fed. Cir. 2018):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mandatory drug testing conducted by or required by the federal government is a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. No warrant is required, but the test must be reasonable to pass constitutional muster. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989); <span class="Italic">Skinner v. Ry. Labor Execs.' Ass'n</span>, 489 U.S. 602, 616-33 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Skinner</span> involved challenges to drug-testing regulations issued by the Federal Railroad Administration. A group of railway trade unions sued to have the regulations declared unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, 489 U.S. at 616-19. The regulations included mandatory blood and urine tests of employees involved in train accidents to determine if they were using illegal drugs. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 608-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court held that post-accident drug testing, performed without a warrant, can be a reasonable intrusion into an employee's privacy rights, upholding two subparts of the regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 624-34. The first part required railroads to test employees "directly involved" in certain severe accidents, including accidents resulting in death or property damage exceeding $500,000. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 609. The Court also upheld a second part permitting railroads to conduct testing "after a reportable accident or incident, where a supervisor has a 'reasonable suspicion' that an employee's acts or omissions contributed to the occurrence or severity of the accident or incident...or...in the event of certain specific rule violations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 611. Both parts were considered "reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 634. A variety of factors supported the reasonableness of the drug testing, among them, (1) the "limited" privacy intrusions occasioned by the testing procedures, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 624; (2) the diminished expectation of privacy that attaches to employment in an "industry that is regulated pervasively to ensure safety," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 627; and (3) the government's "compelling" interest in railway safety, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 633, an interest that could not always be protected by testing only upon individualized suspicion, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 629-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Navy's drug testing instruction here parallels the second subpart of the regulations upheld in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>. The Navy's instruction authorized post-accident drug testing of employees after an accident resulting in death or hospitalization, or property damage in excess of $10,000, if a supervisor "reasonably suspect[s]" that an employee's acts "caused or contributed to an accident or unsafe practice." The relevant regulation, Navy Shipyard Portsmouth Instruction 12792.2B provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Post-Accident Testing</span> of employees, based on a police report, suspected of having caused or contributed to an accident if there is a death or personal injury resulting in hospitalization, or if there is property damage in excess of $10,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Criteria</span>. Employees may be subject to testing when, based upon circumstances of an on-the-job accident or unsafe, on-duty, related activity, their actions are <span class="Italic">reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed</span> to an accident or unsafe practice that meets either of the following criteria:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4"><span id="Page_1594"></span>(a)&#x2003;The accident or unsafe practice results in a death or personal injury requiring admission to a hospital, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(b)&#x2003;The accident or unsafe practice results in damage to government or private property estimated to be in excess of $10,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party disputes that this Navy regulation is consistent with <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reasonable-suspicion inquiry under the Fourth Amendment and under the regulation is an objective test. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ashcroft v. al-Kidd</span>, 563 U.S. 731, 738-39 (2011). It depends only upon "the factual information [the supervisor] had when he made the determination, and not on the basis of additional information that subsequently was disclosed or which...could have [been] discovered by further inquiry." <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 72 F.3d 1566, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1995). It is correspondingly well established in the context of so-called <span class="Italic">Terry</span> stops that "the fact that the officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecated by the reasons which provide the legal justification for the officer's action does not invalidate the action taken as long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action." <span class="Italic">Whren v. United States</span>, 517 U.S. 806, 813 (1996) (quoting <span class="Italic">Scott v. United States</span>, 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978)); <span class="Italic">accord Devenpeck v. Alford</span>, 543 U.S. 146, 153 (2004). We think that this rule applies in this particular context as well and that the subjective state of mind of the official ordering drug testing is irrelevant.[1] We thus consider whether the circumstances surrounding the accident, taken objectively, would cause one to "reasonably suspect" that Mr. Holton caused or contributed to the accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Courts, of course, can inquire into the subjective motivation of officials in order to ascertain whether there was an improper motivation, such as racial animus. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., City of Indianapolis v. Edmond</span>, 531 U.S. 32, 46 (2000). No such allegation is made here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of reasonable suspicion is not limited to situations in which the employee took an affirmative action that caused or contributed to the accident. The constitutional standard also includes an employee's failure to take an action that could have prevented the accident. Indeed, the failure to act was a relevant factor in the regulations upheld in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, where the Court authorized that "[b]reath or urine tests, or both, may be ordered (1) after a reportable accident or incident, where a supervisor has a 'reasonable suspicion' that an employee's <span class="Italic">acts or omissions</span> contributed to the occurrence or severity of the accident or incident." 489 U.S. at 611 (emphasis added). The failure to act must be judged by the scope of the employee's job duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Holton argues that the Navy's "crane team concept" was not a permissible approach to define the scope of those subject to drug testing. Mr. Holton contends that, because the Navy relied on this "crane team concept," his subsequent drug test was improper. Under the "crane team concept," all members of the crane team share responsibility for ensuring the safe and successful performance of any crane operation, and all individuals either succeed or fail as a team to accomplish this goal. The Navy argued that this concept made it reasonable to suspect that every member of the team, including Mr. Holton, caused or contributed to the accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Designating responsibility for the accident to all team members and testing all members of the crane team is essentially the "test all involved employees" approach discussed in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 489 U.S. at 609 &#x0026; n.2. The Court has only permitted a "test all involved employees" approach when precipitated by the most severe accidents, which in <span class="Italic">Skinner</span> was defined as accidents involving a fatality, the release of hazardous materials resulting in evacuation or injury, or damage amounting to at least $500,000. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> With respect to less severe accidents, such as the one at issue here, the Supreme Court only approved testing regimes that involve assessment, in the language of the applicable Navy regulation, when there is "reasonabl[e] susp[icion]" that the individual employee "caused or contributed to the accident or unsafe practice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton argues that the Navy lacked "reasonable suspicion" that he "caused or contributed" to the accident under the objective standard. Having delegated responsibility to the rigger in charge, Mr. Holton was at least 150 yards away from the crane at the time of the accident and, thus, could not <span class="Italic">see</span> the crane's boom and was not actively involved in the moving of the crane. He points out that PNS Code 740 Policy #52 does not require the supervisor to remain with the crane during the evolution. The crane team supervisor is even authorized to "leave the job site for short periods of time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton further argues that as a supervisor, his decision to remove himself during the crane evolution was required by the "blue and gold do not mix" policy. Under the "blue and gold" policy, set forth in PNS Code 740 Policy #51, the overall supervisor is generally instructed to "separate yourself from the [rigger in charge]," so as to avoid a situation where the chain of command is unclear.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Holton is correct that Policy #52 did not require him to remain with the crane, but he is incorrect that Policy #51 forbade it. Policy #51 provides for separation between the supervisor and rigger in charge "<span class="Italic">unless</span> [they] are both at the working end of the crane or <span class="Italic">the area of most risk</span>." As Mr. Thayer testified, and as discussed above, the rotation around the building was the most complicated, and dangerous, part of the lift. Therefore, under the relevant policy, it would not have been improper for Mr. Holton to remain with the rigger in charge when guiding the crane through the curve, as it was the area of most risk. Mr. Thayer testified that he would have preferred Mr. Holton to stay with the crane, and that if Mr. Holton had been present during the move, he might have been able to prevent the accident.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;When asked how he had come to the conclusion that Mr. Holton could have prevented the accident, Mr. Thayer responded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">Had [Holton] been with the crane and in that role of Supervisor watching the entire operation as a whole, not having the responsibility for handling a tagline or signaling a crane, not being distracted by other things--Supervisors that's what they do. They step back and they look at the big picture. I believe that he could have <span class="Italic">see</span>n that load, not being centered on the rail and prevented this.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Q: He could have <span class="Italic">see</span>n the load.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">Q: But you're speculating on that. Aren't you?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">A: Yes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">That Mr. Thayer might have engaged in speculation is not inappropriate, because the relevant standard only requires reasonable suspicion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Mr. Holton may not have violated the Shipyard's rules with respect to his positioning during the crane evolution, Mr. Holton's job was to do what was necessary to ensure that the crane operation was performed safely and successfully. PNS Policy #51 specifically expects all supervisors to "[s]top and correct improper rigging" and "[e]nsure the crane team is operating safely and meeting standards." Given Mr. Holton's overall responsibility for the lift, it was reasonable for the Navy to suspect in the immediate aftermath of the crane accident that the incident was, at least in part, caused by something the team supervisor either did or failed to do. We agree with the Board that "[B]ecause the record reflects that [Mr. Holton] instructed the crane team immediately before the accident and was still actively involved in the operation when the accident occurred, we find that it was reasonable for the agency to suspect that he...caused or contributed to the accident." <span class="Italic">Holton</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. at 699.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, at the time that testing was ordered, Mr. Holton's supervisor could not have known for certain whether Mr. Holton had caused or contributed to the accident. But drug testing, if it is to be meaningful, must occur very soon after the accident and preferably on the same day. <span class="Italic">Skinner</span> itself recognized the importance of prompt testing. In <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, the Court declined to impose a warrant requirement on drug testing, partially because "alcohol and other drugs are eliminated from the bloodstream at a constant rate." 489 U.S. at 623. The Court recognized that "blood and breath samples taken to measure whether these substances were in the bloodstream when a triggering event occurred must be obtained as soon as possible." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Skinner</span>, the Court acknowledged that, given the short timeframe, reasonable suspicion will often be based on the incomplete information assembled at the time of the testing decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 631. The relevant standard is whether it is reasonable to <span class="Italic">suspect</span> that the employee caused or contributed to the accident, not that there was necessarily such a connection. The Board did not err in concluding that the test here met the applicable constitutional and regulatory standard.</p>
