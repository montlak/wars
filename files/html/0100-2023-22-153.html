<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-152"><span class="space">4.</span> Below Market Rate</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Akin to the request for enhancement of a reasonable hourly rate due to the contingent factors just discussed is the request to increase a below-market retainer rate to a reasonable market rate. Neither the Board nor the courts rule out adjustments of low rates. Counsel should be entitled to a reasonable rate. The retainer rate may establish a presumption as to the value of the attorney's services, but it should be rebuttable in both directions. The Board allows rate adjustment, but it does not often actually increase below-market rates.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 455, 2 MSPB 604 (1980), established a rebuttable presumption that the fee charged by a lawyer to his client is the maximum reasonable rate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official assumed, without any evidentiary basis, that the amount billed by counsel to appellant's union covered only counsel's "actual costs plus a small amount of profit" but not "a reasonable profit for the meritorious work" performed. However, a fee award under the Reform Act must not provide a windfall to counsel at the expense of the public fisc. Accordingly, where it is agreed that a specific fee be paid to counsel for legal services rendered on behalf of an appellant in a case before the Board, we will presume that the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded.[11] <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc.,</span> 488 F.2d 714, 718 (5th Cir. 1974); <span class="Italic">Sonnenberg v. Adams,</span> 18 EPD &#x00A7; 8875 at 5618 (D.D.C. 1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Such a presumption is particularly relevant here in view of the presiding official's reasonable inference that the "reduced" charge to the union was designed "to engender an attorney-client relationship [with the union] mutually beneficial to both parties." This is a normal commercial billing practice for legal practitioners with clients such as labor unions which are commonly expected, if not explicitly understood, to produce a high volume of legal business<span class="Italic">. See also</span> ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, Disciplinary Rule 2-106(B), providing that factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of a fee include "(6) The nature and length of the professional relationship with the client."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinary experience warrants the presumption that private law firms do not operate as eleemosynary institutions, and that a bill rendered by such a firm accurately reflects the partnership's fair judgment of the maximum fee that is commercially reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, absent clear evidence to the contrary in the record, we find that a reasonable amount for counsel's services in this case is $6175.00, reflecting the amount billed to appellant's union plus the allowance reasonably made by the presiding official for counsel's additional time in preparing the fee motion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The fee arrangement agreed upon by counsel and the appellant establishes a presumption that it is the maximum reasonable attorney fee. <span class="Italic">Shoemaker v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 14, 17-18 (1984); <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 455, 2 MSPB 604 (1980), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. It is presumed to be the prevailing market rate in the community for similar work by attorneys of like standing. This presumption may be overcome by convincing evidence that the agreed rate was not based on marketplace considerations and that counsel's customary rate for similar work is higher. <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 63-65 (1984). Without a retainer agreement specifying fee increases, the evidence could include copies of bills actually sent to the appellant showing that the hourly rate increased over the course of the litigation. <span class="Italic">Tri v. SEC</span>, 33 MSPR 1, 3-4 (1987). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Metz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 34 MSPR 625, 629 (1987) (presumption was overcome by affidavits from the appellant's counsel and his wife describing an oral fee agreement that was not reflected in a written agreement with counsel); <span class="Italic">Carter v. SBA</span>, 28 MSPR 296, 300 (1985) (rebuttable presumption that the fee agreement sets the maximum reasonable rate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ awarded $30 per hour to counsel who accepted the case on a reduced rate based on the appellant's ability to pay. He then claimed a rate of $125 per hour. The Board awarded $75 per hour. Evidence (including the retainer agreement) supported his position. The attorney rebutted the <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span> presumption of the market rate being the recoverable rate. <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 258, 259-60 (1985). A single bill stating a higher rate and a "cursory statement" about a new hourly rate was insufficient for the Board to award a rate higher than the one set in a fee agreement. <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 604, 611-12 (1989). Yet the Board may read into an agreement a yearly adjustment in the hourly rate. In <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 51 MSPR 549, 554 (1991), the Board determined that a verbal fee agreement was for "straight dollar per hour amounts" and should reflect increases in counsel's established billing rates. The Board observed in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> that "[i]t is generally <span id="Page_4697"></span>accepted that counsel may be awarded different billing rates for services performed in different years." <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Andrus v. GSA</span>, 56 MSPR 681, 687 n.4 (1993) ("It is generally accepted that counsel may be awarded different billing rates for services performed in different years. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Department of the Army</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 549, 554-55 (1991).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Hourly adjustments aside, substantial increases in agreed-upon rates can be difficult to secure from the Board. One attorney sought to obtain $175 from the agency when his client agreed to pay $100 per hour. The enhancement requested was based on a letter from a practitioner of a large firm that suggested the billing rate of the petitioning attorney was low. The Board found that the letter did not establish that any higher fee was commercially reasonable for representation of an unemployed midlevel federal employee. The Board declined to justify the higher rate on a theory of <span class="Italic">quantum meruit</span>--urged because the client was unable to pay his bills as the litigation continued--because the hourly rate was established by the retainer agreement. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. DOJ</span>, 12 MSPR 436, 442, 11 MSPB 78, 83 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal involving an hourly retainer rate of $75, the Board would not award a higher rate, despite evidence that other attorneys in the region charged more. There was no evidence that the rate charged to the appellant was based on his reduced ability to pay counsel's higher fee, <span class="Italic">Kennard v. DOD</span>, 33 MSPR 231, 235-36 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held that it will presume, absent convincing evidence to the contrary, that the fee agreed to by the appellant and his or her attorney in a retainer agreement represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded in a particular appeal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior,</span> 2 MSPB 604, 2 MSPR 445, 455-56 (1980); <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission,</span> 20 MSPR 60, 63 (1984); and <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Labor,</span> 26 MSPR 258, 259-60 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find, as did the administrative judge, that the evidence submitted by the appellant's counsel is insufficient to rebut this presumption. The appellant's counsel states in an affidavit filed with his original fee request that he does not have "a schedule of fees and that [his] charges are dependent upon a variety of factors." He has not identified those factors, however, and has not provided a basis upon which the Board could conclude that his normal and customary fee in a case like this would be at an hourly rate higher than his minimum fee. The appellant's counsel further states in his affidavit that his "usual minimum fee is $75.00 per hour," the exact amount the appellant agreed to pay to his attorney in the retainer agreement and the rate approved by the administrative judge. Thus, the hourly rate agreed to is within the range of fees normally charged by the appellant's counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel's affidavit provides no evidence which would tend to support his claim to a higher hourly rate in this appeal. He merely states that other attorneys in the Philadelphia area charge higher rates than he does. Similarly, the affidavit of Dennis L. Friedman submitted in support of counsel's claim to a higher hourly rate only speaks to hourly rates charged by other attorneys in the Philadelphia area in similar cases. It does not support a contention that the rate charged to the appellant was based upon his reduced ability to pay counsel's regular, higher fee. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ishikawa,</span> at 260; <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 19 MSPR 206, 213 (1984). Without such a showing, the rate agreed to in the retainer agreement represents the maximum hourly rate which will be allowed by this Board. We therefore conclude that the administrative judge did not err in limiting the hourly rate to $75.00.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another appeal found the attorney claiming $150 per hour. The retainer agreement called for $100 hourly. <span class="Italic">Ceja v. DLA</span>, 34 MSPR 399, 404-05 (1987), declined to award more:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the administrative judge properly considered that the $100 per hour fee agreement entered into between appellant and his counsel created a rebuttable presumption that that amount represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604, 2 MSPR 445, 455 (1980). Appellant's counsel contends that his normal billing rate is $150 per hour, but that he charged appellant a lesser rate because of appellant's grave financial situation. In support, he provided signed affidavits from appellant and appellant's brother, who accompanied him to the initial meeting, stating that they were aware that they were being afforded a reduced rate. However, nothing on the face of the retainer agreement itself indicates that the $100 per hour rate represents a reduced rate. The affidavits, which were neither executed nor submitted by appellant until well over a year after he initially filed his motion for fees, are not sufficient to support the higher rate. Although counsel states that he has handled four cases before the Board, prevailed in three, and was awarded attorney fees in two, he has not shown that, in any of these cases, he was compensated at a rate of $150 per hour. Similarly, we agree with the administrative judge that appellant failed to submit persuasive evidence that the $150 rate he requested is the prevailing rate for similar work in the community by lawyers of comparable experience and standing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 65 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 604, 611-12 (1989) (when the fee agreement set $75 as an hourly rate, the fee would not be adjusted upward based on counsel's "cursory" statement that the "new" rate was $100 and his submission of a bill to the client at the higher rate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An upward adjustment was allowed in <span class="Italic">Shirley v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 179, 182-83 (1988), when counsel demonstrate that he reduced his hourly fees in his retainer agreement based on his client's inability to pay the going rate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 63 n.4 (1984), the Board established a rebuttable presumption that the maximum hourly rate set by the fee agreement could be enhanced by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations and that counsel's rate for similar work was customarily higher. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Department of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 258, 260 (1985), the Board found that counsel successfully rebutted the presumption that the $30-an-hour fee agreed upon between attorney and employee was the maximum fee awardable by showing that she had agreed upon such rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay and that her customary fee for similar work was significantly higher. In <span class="Italic">Flood v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 30 MSPR 546, 547 n.2 (1986), the Board held that the appellant demonstrated that the normal presumption that the retainer agreement represented the maximum reasonable attorney fee was not a bar to a higher award by presenting evidence of a provision in the retainer agreement that his attorney had agreed to a lower-than-market rate and that the attorney had been awarded higher attorney fees in the past when representing other appellants before the Board. However, in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 28 MSPR 296, 299-300 (1985), the fee agreement determined the maximum hourly rate despite a higher hourly claim where the record was silent as to any explanation in the fee agreement concerning the lower fee agreement and no evidence was offered of hourly rates in other cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, counsel successfully rebutted the presumption that the $50.00-an-hour fee agreed upon between attorney and employee was the maximum fee awardable. In his affidavit accompanying his motion for fees, counsel states that he agreed upon the $50 rate because of the appellant's inability to pay the firm's customary billing rates....&#8197;The fee agreement itself does not explain the basis for the $50 fee. However, a $500 retainer fee is provided for when the appellant is "able to pay."...&#8197;This waiver on inability to pay grounds at least indirectly corroborates the attorney's affidavit. Further, counsel offered evidence that his customary fee for similar work was significantly higher. He furnished five contemporaneous retainer agreements showing that his customary billing rate was $100 per hour.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Andrus v. GSA</span>, 56 MSPR 681, 684-85 &#x0026; n.2 (1993), also approved an hourly rate higher than the retainer rate. The agreement, stating that the rate charged was below counsel's usual rate, was persuasive when combined with evidence of prevailing community rates charged by other lawyers. The Board did not find persuasive, however, citations to initial decisions from the MSPB regional office approving a higher rate for the petitioning attorney. The Board stated that initial decisions were not precedential, a true statement of law but an incorrect result and contrary to common sense: the initial decisions were evidence of fees paid at a particular rate, just as retainer agreements or settlement agreements are evidence of rates<span class="Italic">. Andrus</span> added that "[c]ounsel likewise failed to demonstrate below that the EEOC decisions he enumerated in his list of cases...were of precedential value." <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 60 MSPR 614, 621-22 (1994), approved a higher rate than the rate set in the retainer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency contends that counsel's typical billing practice is to obtain a retainer agreement in which the client agrees to pay a reduced hourly rate, which the agency claims is the actual rate, and may pay a higher hourly rate depending on the outcome of the case. The agency argues that, because the retainer agreement provides that the appellant would pay the higher rate only if the claims were resolved by settlement prior to the prehearing conference or by settlement of judgment after the prehearing conference, the administrative judge erred by considering only the higher rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The hourly rate set in a retainer agreement may be increased where, as here, counsel establishes that the hourly rate set in the retainer agreement was based, not on marketplace considerations, but on the appellant's reduced ability to pay and that her customary fee for similar work is significantly higher.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, we find no merit to the agency's contention that counsel is entitled to a higher rate if the appeal were settled but to a lower rate because the appeal was fully adjudicated. Moreover, we note that the appellant's counsel submitted a copy of the retainer agreement and provided ample documentation in the form of declarations from both the appellant's counsel, her associate counsel, and other practicing attorneys regarding the prevailing community rate. The administrative judge considered this supporting evidence and fully scrutinized the rates claimed, reducing them for each counsel according to counsel's experience and expertise for the various periods of time the rates were claimed. We find no basis to disturb those findings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gensburg v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 198, 206 &#x00B6; 13 (2000), added as to the presumed controlling rate set by an agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4698"></span>In his petition, the appellant also requests the Board to award him the full amount of fees that he requested below. To the extent that this request constitutes an assertion that the administrative judge erred in finding that the attorneys' hourly rate was $150, his assertion is without merit. Where it is agreed that a specific fee be paid to attorneys for legal services rendered on behalf of an appellant in a Board case, the Board presumes that the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604, 2 MSPR 445, 455 (1980), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Koch v. Department of Commerce,</span> 19 MSPR 219 (1984). This presumption, however, is rebuttable by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations and that the attorneys' rate for similar work was customarily higher, or by showing that he had agreed to such a rate only because of the employee's reduced ability to pay and that his customary fee for similar work was significantly higher. <span class="Italic">Andrus v. General Services Administration</span>, 56 MSPR 681, 685-85 (1993); <span class="Italic">Ishikawa v. Department of Labor,</span> 26 MSPR 258, 260 (1985); <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 63 n.4 (1984). The appellant here, however, presented no evidence to rebut the presumption that the fee agreement determined the maximum hourly rate. Thus, the administrative judge properly found that the hourly rate for both attorneys was that specified in the fee agreement, i.e., $150 per hour.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Yeressian v. Dept. of Army</span>, 534 Fed. Appx. 968, 969-71 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), affirmed the Board's treatment of a fee petition involving rates of two attorneys--one attorney's rate was increased; the other's was not:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Yeressian moved for attorney fees following his reinstatement. The AJ found that attorneys Robert Atkins and William Brawner both performed legal services for Mr. Yeressian throughout his case. Mr. Atkins did not have a formal retainer agreement with Mr. Yeressian; however, Mr. Atkins averred that he charged Mr. Yeressian a reduced rate of $210 per hour as a "standard rate" for federal employees and that the "prevailing market rate" for his services was $435 per hour. The AJ noted that "the amount agreed upon represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. [However, this] presumption is rebuttable by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations...." The AJ held that Mr. Yeressian rebutted this presumption by submitting direct evidence of Mr. Atkins's education, experience, and other relevant qualifications, and by submitting evidence of the rate of attorneys with similar expertise and experience. Accordingly, the AJ awarded attorney fees for Mr. Atkins at a rate of $435 per hour.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Mr. Brawner, Mr. Brawner had entered into a retainer agreement with Mr. Yeressian specifying an hourly rate of $250. In his motion for attorney fees, Mr. Yeressian requested that Mr. Brawner be compensated at $335 per hour. Mr. Yeressian's only basis for this higher rate was (1) the fact that Mr. Brawner had been compensated $300 an hour in an unrelated matter in front of the Board, and (2) the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix, which is a guide prepared by the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia. The <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix purports to show the average hourly rates for attorneys of varying experience levels. The AJ found this evidence nonbinding and unpersuasive, and awarded attorney fees for Mr. Brawner at his agreed rate of $250 per hour.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a specific fee is agreed upon, there is a presumption that the agreed upon fee represents the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded. <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198, 206 (2000). This presumption may be rebutted "by convincing evidence that the agreed-upon rate was not based on marketplace considerations and...was customarily higher, or by showing that [counsel] agreed to such a rate only because of the [client's] reduced ability to pay and that his customary fee for similar work was significantly higher." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Yeressian presented only two pieces of evidence that Mr. Brawner should be compensated at $335 per hour: (1) Mr. Brawner had been compensated at $300 per hour in an unrelated matter and (2) the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. This evidence alone is insufficient. Unlike with Mr. Atkins, Mr. Yeressian presented no evidence of Mr. Brawner's education, experience, and other relevant qualifications, and failed to submit persuasive evidence of the rate of other attorneys with similar expertise and experience. Absent such evidence, "[a] representation contract specifying hourly rates is [the best] evidence that the contract rates are consistent with local market rates, because the client freely agreed to pay the rates by entering into the contract." <span class="Italic">Willis v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Contrary to Mr. Yeressian's assertion, the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix is imprecise and is merely a guide. <span class="Italic">See Covington v. District of Columbia</span>, 57 F.3d 1101, 1109 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("[F]ee matrices are somewhat crude--the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> matrix, for example, lumps attorneys with four to seven years of experience in the same category; attorneys with eleven to nineteen also share the same hourly rate."). It is not binding on the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A prevailing rates argument will itself not necessarily justify an increase in an hourly rate that is ordinarily reduced for a class of clients. A fee agreement restrains counsel's ability to secure upward adjustment of the retainer rate, <span class="Italic">Brown v. DHHS</span>, 50 MSPR 523, 528-30 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Counsel for the appellants renews his assertions raised before the administrative judge on remand that the prevailing community rate in 1985 should be used to determine the hourly rate in calculating his fee, and that the prevailing market rate in the relevant Washington, D.C., metropolitan community for an attorney with his experience in 1985 was $85.00 per hour. He contends that the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc. v. Hodel</span>, 857 F.2d 1516 (1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (<span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>) (Starr, Silberman, and Buckley, JJ., dissenting), has determined that the prevailing community rate should be used to determine a reasonable attorney fee regardless of whether it is higher or lower than the rate actually charged by counsel. He asserts that the Board should apply the court's holding in <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span> in the present appeals. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted in <span class="Italic">Brooks v. Department of Transportation</span>, 33 MSPR 399, 402 (1987), the use of the "lodestar" is an appropriate starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee, even when the appellant requests reimbursement under a contingency fee agreement; the contingent nature of a fee agreement is only one factor in determining what is a reasonable fee....&#8197;The statute providing for the award of "reasonable attorney fees," 5 USC 7701(g)(1), does not permit windfalls beyond the "lodestar" amount plus any necessary adjustments, which, as stated by the Supreme Court, represents the reasonable fee<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Delaware Valley</span>, 483 U.S. at 728....&#8197;Thus, "in cases where the appellant has requested reimbursement of fees based under a contingency-fee arrangement, the Board will presume that the fees resulting from the fee agreement are the maximum reasonable fees to be awarded, unless they exceed the lodestar figure."[6] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;An attorney may overcome the presumption that the fee agreement stated the maximum reasonable fee, however, by presenting convincing evidence that the agreed-on rate did not reflect his billing rate. <span class="Italic">E.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Defense</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 45 (1989); <span class="Italic">Shirley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 MSPR 179, 182 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We concur with the determination of the administrative judge in these appeals that the appellants have not shown a basis for assessing a different hourly rate. The Board's regulations require that a fee request be supported by evidence of "[t]he attorney's customary billing rate for similar work if the attorney has a billing practice or, in the absence of that practice, other evidence of the prevailing community rate that will establish a market value for the attorney's services." 5 CFR 1201.37(a)(3)(iii). Thus, the Board looks first to the attorney's billing rate to establish the hourly rate, and then to the prevailing community rate in the absence of a customary billing rate. Counsel for the appellants' undisputed customary billing rate for the time period at issue was $40.00 per hour....&#8197;Thus, we conclude that the administrative judge's use of this billing rate to compute the "lodestar" was appropriate under the Board's precedent and regulations as a starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee, and that she did not err by calculating the reasonableness of the fee request based on the "lodestar" method....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the appellants' argument concerning the application of the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>, we note initially that decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit are persuasive authority only, and are not precedential for Board decisions....&#8197;We further note that the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has not so much as questioned the Board's practice of calculating the reasonableness of a fee request based on the "lodestar" method in an appeal in which the employee's counsel requested reimbursement under a contingency fee agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>, an attorney fee case arising under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977...the prevailing plaintiff's private attorneys charged their client at hourly rates less than their normal hourly rates in order to subsidize what they perceived to be a client with a good cause whose case was in the public interest....&#8197;The court found that the denial of a prevailing market rate of recovery to private attorneys who customarily charge below the prevailing community rate in order to serve a particular type of client would be inconsistent with the intent of Congress in enacting fee award statutes and with the United States Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984) ("reasonable fees" in a Federal civil rights action are to be calculated according to prevailing market rates, regardless of whether the plaintiff is represented by private or non-profit counsel). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>, 857 F.2d at 1518-24. The court held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Henceforth, the prevailing market rate method heretofore used in awarding fees to traditional for-profit firms and public interest legal services organizations shall apply as well to those attorneys who practice privately and for profit but at reduced rates reflecting non-economic goals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4699"></span><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1524. (Emphasis supplied)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not persuaded that the rationale of <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span> for awarding the prevailing market rate recovery, rather than an attorney's customary billing rate, is applicable to private attorneys who charge below the prevailing community rate to appellants in appeals before the Board. Unlike the public policy interest to encourage and facilitate the bringing of lawsuits to protect civil rights present in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>, 465 U.S. 886, or the public policy interest to encourage and facilitate the bringing of lawsuits to protect the environment present in <span class="Italic">Cumberland Mountains</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that "[t]here is no comparable public policy to encourage the bringing of suit by federal employees challenging adverse personnel actions against them." <span class="Italic">Goodrich v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, 733 F.2d 1578, 1580-81 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">Some retainer agreements are structured so that an hourly rate is set, and then a provision of the agreement states that the set rate is below the market rate and counsel, if the client prevails, should be able to get a higher prevailing rate for the community. The Board approved a structured fee agreement in <span class="Italic">Tanner v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-12-0209-A-1 (NP 8/1/2014) (approving a fee award under agreement setting an hourly rate for the client, to be increased to a higher rate (<span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix) for both the client and the agency if the client prevailed through Board decision or settlement). FLRA seemed to reject structured agreements in <span class="Italic">DHS Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement and AFGE Local 1924</span>, 64 FLRA 1003, 1007-08 (2010), declining to permit an arbitrator to award <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> rates when the retainer agreement between the union and its counsel set a lower hourly rate, but with a provision allowing counsel to seek the highest allowable prevailing market rates:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the Agency's exception as to the claimed hourly rate, there is a presumption that an agreed-upon fee between client and counsel is the "maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded absent clear evidence to the contrary." <span class="Italic">Fort McClellan Educ.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the Arbitrator, the retainer agreement in this case sets forth a billing rate of $330 per hour, but also states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These billing rates [$330 an hour] are at or below the "prevailing market rates,...charged in this legal community. In this legal market, it is the usual and customary practice for law firms like mine to ordinarily charge clients at reduced hourly rates to reflect non-economic goals.... Thereafter, if and when we are in a position to seek recovery of legal fees, we apply for such fees...at the highest allowable prevailing market rates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Arbitrator found that the retainer agreement set forth a $330 hourly rate, and that the rate set forth in the retainer agreement is the "presumed reasonable rate[.]" The Arbitrator then determined that the Union's attorney rebutted this presumption by showing that the requested $465 hourly rate was consistent with the prevailing rate for Washington, D.C.-based attorneys. On this basis, the Arbitrator concluded that the $465 hourly rate was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, the Arbitrator did not find, and the record does not indicate, that the Union's attorney charged a rate higher than the $330 hourly rate listed in the retainer agreement for similar work. As Authority and MSPB precedent require such a finding to rebut the presumption that the fee listed in the retainer agreement is the maximum reasonable fee, the Arbitrator's conclusion that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable is inconsistent with Authority and MSPB precedent. <span class="Italic">See Fort McClellan</span>, 56 FLRA at 645; <span class="Italic">Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. at 206. Further, declarations from the Union's attorney and two other attorneys with employment law practices in the Washington, D.C. area, that the $465 hourly rate is consistent with the prevailing market rate, do not establish that the Union's attorney is entitled to receive an hourly rate higher than the rate listed in the retainer agreement. <span class="Italic">See Kennard</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. at 236.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Union's attorney did not demonstrate, and the record does not indicate, that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, we find that the Arbitrator's conclusion, that the $465 hourly rate is reasonable, is contrary to law.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may base its fee award on the reasonable rates and hours formulation rather than follow the parties' agreement, although the fee agreement may, depending on its terms, establish a flat fee as the maximum reasonable fee or a fee that is partially contingent, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 26 MSPR 629, 630-32 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, while the lodestar amount (that is, the hours spent by the attorney times a reasonable hourly rate) is the starting point for determining a reasonable attorney fee, where the appellant and his attorney have agreed to a specific fee for legal services rendered by the attorney, the Board will presume that amount to represent "the maximum reasonable fee which may be awarded." <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of the Interior</span>, 2 MSPB 604, 611, 2 MSPR 445, 455 (1980). The Board will award that amount, plus an additional reasonable amount for preparation of the fee motion, unless there is clear evidence in the record that a higher fee is reasonable and warranted. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 611-12, 2 MSPR at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant's attorney stated...that the appellant had agreed to pay an hourly fee. The attorney argued, however, that he "recognized at the onset" that the appellant would be unable to pay the hourly fee, and that, despite the fee agreement, an upward contingency adjustment was warranted, noting that the appellant has paid nothing since the $1,500 retainer. The Board finds that the presiding official properly rejected the attorney's argument under <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPB 78, 83, 12 MSPR 436, 443-44 (1982) (an upward adjustment based upon the contingent nature is not applicable where the attorney has an agreement for guaranteed payment regardless of the outcome of the case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official concluded that the fee agreement between the appellant and his attorney called for a payment of $110.00 per hour. She apparently arrived at this conclusion based upon the fact that the attorney's Memorandum...referred to the $1,500 retainer and stated that, at $110.00 per hour, the retainer paid for the first 13.75 hours of work. Yet, as the agency points out, nowhere in the record is it shown that $110.00 per hour was the sum agreed to by the appellant and his counsel. Indeed, in his response to the petition for review, the appellant's attorney states that he did not introduce the terms of the fee arrangement in support of the attorney fee request "because the issue before the Presiding Official was the ascertainment of reasonable attorney fees rather than the agreement between attorney and client." He states that the fee arrangement was complex and had several contingent features. For example, it called for a $1,500 retainer, stated that the attorney would petition the Board for payment of reasonable attorney fees if the appellant prevailed and would be entitled to a percentage of back wages, but that the appellant would be obligated to pay an hourly rate that was less than the attorney's customary hourly rate in the event that the attorney was not successful. He further argues that <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, does not require the appellant to prove the terms of his fee arrangement with his attorney and the agency did not seek discovery on the fee arrangement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that a determination of the maximum reasonable attorney fee cannot be ascertained from the present record, and that, under <span class="Italic">O'Donnell</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the presiding official should have ordered the appellant to produce the retainer agreement. As acknowledged by the appellant's attorney in his response to the agency's petition for review, the agency raised this issue before the presiding official, but the presiding official declined to order production of the retainer agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the addendum decision dated August 31, 1984, is VACATED, and this case is hereby REMANDED to the Chicago Regional Office for further proceedings and a new determination consistent with this opinion. Since under the fee agreement the appellant's attorney is apparently to receive a percentage of backpay awarded to the appellant, and this, coupled with the payment by the appellant of other established fees, could be in excess of the maximum reasonable fee, the presiding official shall, upon remand, obtain information regarding the total fees to be received by the appellant's attorney.</p>
