<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-24"><span class="space">9.</span> Failure to Pay Debt</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Monterosso v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 684, 689, 6 MSPB 573 (1981), a mail clerk, appealed his discharge for three charges of failure to pay financial obligations leading to court judgments and for failure to pay a valid tax due. The employer's handbook of employee responsibilities emphasized the importance of meeting financial obligations and complying with requirements of government taxing authorities. The employee was previously disciplined for failure to honor financial obligations. The Board recognized that courts "generally upheld the removal of Federal employees for nonpayment of just debts as promoting the efficiency of the service." The courts reasoned that because federal employees' wages were at that time exempt from garnishment, creditors asked the federal employer to pressure the employee into paying his debts. If the government did not cooperate, commercial establishments could refuse to extend credit to otherwise eligible federal employees based on lack of assurance of employer support for their collection efforts. The Board observed, however, that the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977, 15 USC 1692a and 1692c, prohibits a debt collector, other than the original creditor or his employee, from communicating with anyone but the debtor or his attorneys or a consumer reporting agency, reducing the efforts of debt collectors to secure payment through indirect pressure on federal employers. The Child Garnishment Enforcement Act of 1977 establishes a procedure allowing garnishment against the United States as employer for enforcement of an employee's legal obligations to make child support or alimony payments. These statutes indicated to the Board a trend away from imposing on federal agencies the responsibility for disciplining employees who fail to pay debts. Debts are personal matters to be worked out between the debtor and creditor. The agency may take an adverse action against an employee only if it establishes that the employee's nonpayment of just debts has or will have a deleterious effect on that employee's performance or on the ability of the agency to perform its assigned mission. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-096.html#sec8-95">Conflicts of Interest; Apparent Conflicts</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-15-102.html#sec8-101">Transaction With Another; Gift; Bribe; Honorarium; Loan</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-15-103.html#sec8-102">Transaction with Patron, Vendor, Inmate</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-15-104.html#sec8-103">Transaction With Supervisor; Subordinate</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In Monterosso's case, there was no publicity about the judgments against him or his failure to pay debts. The Board rejected the notion that creditors would <span id="Page_2311"></span>become less likely to extend credit to employees of the government if they could not use the government to assist in collection. Nor could the agency penalize the employee because of the time consumed in responding, or allowing the appellant to respond, to complaints from creditors. The agency was under no obligation to act as intermediary and should not penalize the appellant for a burden that it voluntarily assumed. As to the tax obligations of the employee, the Board distinguished Monterosso's case from <span class="Italic">Giles v. United States,</span> 553 F.2d 647, 651 (Ct. Cl. 1977), and <span class="Italic">Hoover v. United States,</span> 513 F.2d 603, 608, 206 Ct. Cl. 640 (Ct. Cl. 1975), involving refusal of tax collectors or tax technicians to pay their tax obligations. The appellant made every effort to pay the tax, although he was in dire financial straits, and his removal for nonpayment of the tax could not enhance service efficiency. Concluding that the required nexus between the conduct complained of and service efficiency could not be demonstrated, the Board reversed the removal. Member Wertheim filed a concurring opinion expressing his interest in deciding the case on the basis that the appellant had not, as was charged, "willfully" failed to honor debts. Mr. Wertheim also said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's action in this case was truly Dickensian. Because appellant was laden with family medical expenses, he was unable to meet mortgage payments and his property was foreclosed. The agency thereupon assessed him for a "constructive" capital gain on the foreclosure which in actuality he never received. Because he was unable to pay the resulting $5,300 on that "gain," the agency then fired him from his job. No wonder the poor get poorer.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Monterosso</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Byars v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 225, 227-29 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's record reveals him as far less than a model debtor. The question before us is not, however, whether he pays his debts when due or is a good credit risk, but whether this record of delinquencies in debt payment is connected with the efficiency of the service in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Monterosso v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 6 MSPB 573, 574-76, 6 MSPR 684, 686-88 (1981), we reviewed past law with respect to removals of employees for nonpayment of debts. Citing <span class="Italic">Norton v. Macy,</span> 417 F.2d 1161, 1168 (D.C. Cir. 1969) and <span class="Italic">White v. Bloomberg,</span> 345 F. Supp. 133, 145 (D. Md. 1972), we concluded that only inveterate and unrepentant deadbeats were to be disciplined under past law by dismissal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We noted that, as set forth in <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Dept. of Justice,</span> 6 MSPB 493, 508, 6 MSPR 585, 604 (1981), the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, requires closer scrutiny of an agency's determination of nexus; and we found that legislative and regulatory developments had effectively modified judicial precedent under which a nexus between nonpayment of debts and the efficiency of the service might previously have been found.[6] These developments impelled us to view debts as personal matters to be worked out between debtor and creditor unless the agency establishes that the employee's nonpayment of just debts has or will have a deleterious effect on that employee's performance or on the ability of the agency to perform its assigned mission<span class="Italic">. Monterosso,</span> 6 MSPB at 576, 6 MSPR at 689, citing <span class="Italic">Merritt</span>, 6 MSPB at 509, 6 MSPR at 605.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977, 15 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1692a and 1692c; the Child Support Enforcement Act of 1977, 42 USC &#x00A7; 659; and 46 Fed. Reg. 2325 (January 9, 1981) to be codified at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.311, which permits employees to make voluntary allotments from their regular paychecks for particular amounts to be paid to creditors, reflect a trend away from imposing on Federal agencies the responsibility to bring disciplinary pressure to bear on employees who fail to pay their just debts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have combed the record for evidence relating appellant's nonpayment of debts to his performance or the agency's accomplishment of its mission. Although on October 18, 1978, appellant had been counseled on his productivity, his performance was subsequently found satisfactory. The agency's evidence is, in effect, therefore, that appellant's nonpayment of debts tarnishes its image; other employees could be adversely affected if they were unable to get credit; and morale and production would be adversely affected without discipline.[7] None of this evidence is shown to be related to the agency's accomplishment of its mission in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The agency also argued that the amount of time required to process complaints and counsel appellant interfered with the efficiency of the service. We have held that an agency's voluntary assumption of the role of intermediary with creditors, with the concomitant expenditure of time and effort by agency personnel, cannot be grounds to discipline an employee. <span class="Italic">Monterosso,</span> 6 MSPB at 576, 6 MSPR at 689.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence of any publicity resulting from appellant's repeated delinquencies. There was no evidence that appellant's creditors viewed his delinquency as other than personal to him or that based on appellant's behavior they would refuse credit to worthy risks because they were government employees. <span class="Italic">See Norton v. Macy,</span> at 1168. Moreover, although appellant's debt problems were known to some of his co-workers and three had co-signed his loan from the credit union, it does not appear that apart from jibes about his indebtedness, his working relationships were affected. <span class="Italic">Compare Yamaguchi v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 7 MSPB 496, 7 MSPR 671 (1981). Thus, we cannot find evidence in this record that rises to the preponderance necessary to show a nexus between appellant's nonpayment of his debts and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier decisions affirmed discipline against employees involved in a multitude of debt-related problems that then entangled their agency-employers in the debt collection process. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Macy</span>, 357 F.2d 62 (8th Cir. 1966); <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. Macy</span>, 237 F. Supp. 60, 62 (E.D.

Supp. 516, 521 (W.D.S.C. 1964) ("There is no dispute that the fact of the plaintiff's employment was well known to the creditors involved, as evidenced by their continuing complaints to the Social Security Administration. It is apparent that some part of the general public knew, therefore, that the Social Security Administration employed and continued to retain a person in a responsible position who was neglectful of his personal financial obligations. The plaintiff would require independent evidence that his continuing employment caused the Social Security Administration to be held in lower esteem. In order to satisfy such requirement, testimony of a countless number of witnesses would be necessary to prove the previous reputation of the agency in the same method to show how that reputation was impaired. The Courts have never required specific proof of such facts. The Commission drew a justifiable inference from the established facts just as ordinary men would conclude without specific proof that known law violations by policemen undermine public confidence in the Police Department."). <span class="Italic">But see White v. Bloomberg</span>, 345 F. Supp. 133 (D. Md. 1972) (reversing the dismissal of a debtor because the intent of the agency regulation was to enable the removal of inveterate deadbeats; the failure to pay a single debt did not put the employee in that category; the agency did not establish that the employee's debt caused agency officials to devote considerable official time to problem; the employee's financial problems did not impair his job efficiency; and the attitude of the general public toward the agency was not shown to have been adversely affected); <span class="Italic">McGuire v. United States</span>, 145 Ct. Cl. 17 (1959) (reversing the dismissal of a deputy collector of taxes for failure to pay a single private debt when the intent of the agency regulation was to punish habitual deadbeats); <span class="Italic">cf. Jones v. MSPB</span>, 276 Fed. Appx. 1008, 1011 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Vilt v. U.S. Marshals Serv.</span>, 16 MSPR 192 (1983), OPM petitioned the Board to reconsider its holding pertaining to nexus between failure to pay private debts and the efficiency of the federal service. In an earlier decision, the Board declined to sustain adverse action for a debt charge. The Board concluded that, except in the instances involving indebtedness to the agency, the agency unnecessarily became involved in the personal financial affairs of appellant, and that the managers' actions and comments to appellant's debtors only served to invite recurrent calls. <span class="Italic">Vilt v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 171, 173 (1982). This involvement, "with the concomitant expenditure of time and effort by agency personnel, cannot be grounds to discipline an employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In its reconsideration request, <span class="Italic">Vilt</span>, 16 MSPR 192 (1983), OPM argued that regulations then in effect (5 CFR 735.207 (1992), now appearing in a similar form at 5 CFR 2635.809 (2022)), required payment by employees of just financial obligations. Violation of that regulation, OPM argued, should carry a presumption of nexus. However, the Board would not find the regulatory violation to be a factor in determining whether particular misconduct was sufficiently egregious to justify a presumption of nexus. Presumptions, established after a consideration of the nature, gravity, and relationship between the misconduct and the duties and mission of the employee and the agency, were reserved for the most serious misconduct. Once again the Board rejected the argument that there might be possible adverse repercussions for the government flowing from employees who fail to pay debts; the Board acknowledged that the result might occur, justifying a finding of nexus, but the possibility did not justify a presumption of nexus. The Board then reexamined the evidence. The Board determined that some bad debts and bad checks involved the appellant's own agency. Because there was evidence that office operations were disrupted as a result of these financial problems, nexus existed, the charges were established by a preponderance of the evidence, and discipline was warranted. However, the discipline was reduced from a removal to the suspension previously ordered by the Board, in part because of the inherent unfairness of removing an employee who served a suspension, returned to the agency, and was working satisfactorily since the Board's first order. At footnote 10 of its decision the Board observed that part of the disruption in the office was caused by the unnecessary involvement of management officials in the private affairs of the appellant--management activity not supporting a finding of nexus.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Extensive debt-related involvement of those working with the appellant warranted discipline, including removal, of the employee who is warned to take care of his problems with outsiders and who fails to remedy the difficulties, <span class="Italic">Cornish v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 10 MSPR 382, 383-85 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2312"></span>The record shows that appellant entered into numerous contracts, using an assumed name, to paint private homes. Appellant obtained deposits from several individuals but failed to perform the painting as agreed. Nine coworkers submitted statements in which they revealed that appellant had been receiving calls from these individuals and from creditors at the office over a substantial period of time and that they found the calls to be disruptive. These statements also reflect that appellant's creditors called repeatedly and that at least one coworker complained to a supervisor about the disruption to the office. For example, one meteorologist in the office, Robert L. Howard, stated that his work routine was interrupted many times by telephone calls from individuals looking for appellant or his alias. Furthermore, he noted that appellant's coworkers found the calls irksome upon learning of appellant's poor business techniques and that he had given the office telephone number out for personal use. Another coworker, Thomas L. Hollis, stated that appellant's personal calls often tied up the public telephone lines (on which representatives of the news media call to obtain forecasts), and that appellant's constant personal calls were a source of aggravation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, management officials had to spend a significant amount of time dealing with creditors who would call them attempting to obtain money from appellant. Appellant's second-line supervisor testified that during the summer of 1980, the individuals with whom appellant had painting contracts began calling the agency for assistance in obtaining deposit refunds from appellant. After his supervisors discussed the calls with appellant, he consistently promised to take care of the matter and handle his business affairs properly. However, the calls continued and appellant was warned that if his conduct continued, it could lead to disciplinary action. A representative of the telephone company also called appellant's second-line supervisor to discuss appellant's sizable outstanding bill (over $1000.00) that he incurred while using a fictitious name.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's immediate supervisor had similar experiences, in which appellant would say that he had paid a particular bill and later the same creditor would call the supervisor again and complain about the debt in question. Furthermore, the immediate supervisor also testified that he spent numerous hours of official time counseling appellant pursuant to his requests to see him about his business and personal problems. Appellant failed to produce evidence rebutting the agency's showing of adverse effect on service efficiency. In view of the time consuming nature of the creditors' communications to his supervisors and the disruption in the workplace caused by appellant's failure to pay his debts, we find that the agency established by a preponderance of the evidence that appellant's off-duty misconduct had a deleterious effect on his performance and on the agency's ability to perform its assigned mission. <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 MSPB 493, 509, 6 MSPR 585, 605 (1981); <span class="Italic">Monterosso v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 6 MSPB 573, 576, 6 MSPR 684, 689 (1981).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Monterosso</span> that the agency did not establish the requisite nexus between the sustained charges and the efficiency of the service, the record in that case failed to show that the appellant's financial problems caused disruption in the workplace, or interfered with his coworkers' performance of their duties. However, in the instant case, appellant was unable to limit outside telephone calls relating to his personal business affairs from being made to his place of employment, despite the agency's efforts to prevent disruptions of its operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In mitigation, appellant alleges that his financial problems were the result of a recent divorce and that his former spouse had frozen some of his assets. Appellant also asserts that he successfully concluded the painting of approximately 80 houses, and that the agency was arbitrarily singling him out because of a few complaints regarding unfulfilled contracts. However, appellant failed to provide any substantiation of these allegations and his detailed explanations are often inconsistent and/or implausible. In addition, we note that the presiding official stated in the initial decision that she could not lend much credence to appellant's allegations or testimony. <span class="Italic">See Weaver, supra.</span> Appellant's petition for review does not present any reason for the Board to set aside this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant also claims that the penalty of removal was too severe for a first offense and was inconsistent with the agency's table of penalties. However, the table of penalties provides that the penalty of removal may be appropriate for a first offense of such off-duty misconduct and we find that its use in this case was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board determined that failure to pay debts, without more, does not support adverse action, the situation is different when debts are contracted with subordinate employees and coworkers who, when not repaid, become resentful toward the supervisor who pressured them into extending the loans. Concluding that the appellant severely abused his position as a supervisor, the Board sustained removal: the appellant could not be placed in a nonsupervisory status because of the image of untrustworthiness he had created. <span class="Italic">Yamaguchi v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 671, 673-74, 7 MSPB 496 (1981) (loans from employees exceeded $25,000 and none had been repaid). <span class="Italic">But see Vilt v. DOJ</span>, 10 MSPR 171, 174 (1982) (removal could not be sustained for bouncing a $32 check to another employee, for a $235 travel advance repayment, and for a $700 salary advance from the agency; in each case the money was subsequently paid and the debts were cleared).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board distinguishes its assessment of employees whose debts do and those whose debts do not involve the government. In <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 38 MSPR 206, 214 (1988), appellant was charged with tardy repayments to Diners Club, then the credit card holder for frequent travelers in some agencies. The Board determined that nexus existed because the appellant's debts "arose from her failure to repay Diners Club for expenses incurred in the course of her work with the agency." The Federal Circuit set aside the result reached by the Board because substantial evidence did not demonstrate insubordination by Phillips as to orders to pay the bill or to produce documentation of payment--the charge that led to her discipline. The court did not reach nexus. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 878 F.2d 370 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The Diners Club program surfaced again, however, in <span class="Italic">Dorrough v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 41 MSPR 87, 91 (1989). Failure over 15 months to pay the balance due on the credit card supported the removal of appellant from her position of travel assistant--a position that apparently required the appellant to administer the credit card program. <span class="Italic">See Myers v. USDA</span>, 88 MSPR 565, 576 &#x00B6; 35 (2001) (employee who processed loans in a position involving fiduciary duties was removed for misconduct that included the failure to pay debts that the appellant incurred on behalf of the government).

FDIC</span>, PH-0752-13-0236-B-1 (NP 9/20/2016), on earlier interlocutory appeal, <span class="Italic">Jonson v. FDIC</span>, 121 MSPR 56, 2014 MSPB 22 (2014) (dissent by Member Robbins)), determined that an agency could hold employees to standards of conduct requiring them to pay off their debts to FDIC-insured organizations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency has the right "to establish and enforce reasonable rules governing the workplace." <span class="Italic">Carosella v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 816 F.2d 638, 642 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 572, 577-78 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 712 F.2d 1006 (6th Cir. 1983). Thus, the Board has held that, when an agency charges an employee with violating its own policy or rule on sexual harassment, it is not required to prove Title VII's sexual harassment standards. <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 462 (1987). We also have recognized that an agency has a right to promulgate and enforce reasonable regulations governing its employees' ethical conduct. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. at 577-78.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The minimum fitness regulations are intended to "state the minimum standards of fitness and integrity required" of those providing services on FDIC's behalf. 12 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 336.2(b). The prohibition on defalcation in the regulations is limited to "obligations to insured depository institutions," in other words, those banking institutions and savings associations that FDIC insures. 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1813(c)(2) (defining insured depository institutions); 12 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 336.3(h) (same), 336.5(a)(3) (limiting the prohibition on defalcation to insured depository institutions). According to the agency, the purpose of the prohibition on a history of financial irresponsibility is to preserve its integrity and credibility. <span class="Italic">See</span> 61 Fed. Reg. at 28,727 (explaining the purposes of the prohibition on a pattern or practice of defalcation). Both the proposed removal and removal decision relied on the minimum fitness regulation's definition of a pattern or practice of defalcation as "[a] history of financial irresponsibility with regard to debts owed to insured depository institutions which are in default in excess of $50,000 in the aggregate." (citing 12 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 336.3(i)(1)). Given FDIC's relationship with the institutions that it insures, we find that the agency's definition of a pattern or practice of defalcation is a reasonable exercise of its right to establish workplace rules.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the agency's prohibition on a pattern or practice of defalcation is a valid exercise of its regulatory authority under the RTCCA. <span class="Italic">See Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 841-44. Congress specifically contemplated that the minimum fitness regulations would prohibit individuals who "demonstrated a pattern or practice of defalcation regarding obligations to insured depository institutions...from performing any service on behalf of [FDIC]." 12 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1822(f)(4)(E)(iii). As discussed above, FDIC provided public notice of, and comment on, what are now codified as the minimum fitness regulations. 61 Fed. Reg. at 5956. Included in the proposed regulations was the current definition of a pattern or practice of defalcation. <span class="Italic">Compare id.</span> at 5959 (containing the definition in the final rule), <span class="Italic">with</span> 12 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 336.3(i) (containing the identical definition in the minimum fitness regulations). The definition has been in place since 1996. <span class="Italic">See</span> 61 Fed. Reg. at 28,729 (final rule); <span class="Italic">see also Barnhart v. Walton</span>, 535 U.S. 212, 221-22 (2002) (indicating that the fact that an agency interpretation has been longstanding weighs in favor of applying <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference despite a lack of "'notice and comment' rulemaking"). We find that FDIC's definition of defalcation is not arbitrary or capricious, and is consistent with the RTCCA.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2313"></span>[11]&#x2003;The agency's definition of a pattern or practice of defalcation contains an exception for defaults "caused by catastrophic events beyond the control of the employee such as death, disability, illness or loss of financial support." 12 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 336.3(i)(3). The appellant claimed that the illnesses of his wife and children and the 2008 collapse of the housing market precipitated his indebtedness. In light of this regulatory exception for catastrophic events, the administrative judge should determine on remand whether the agency proved the charge of defalcation, including whether it properly found that the appellant did not fall within this exception.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board detoured from its earlier analysis in <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ADAMS_CRAIG_A_CH_0752_06_0251_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENT_248566.pdf">105 MSPR 50</a>, 56-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-19, 2007 MSPB 57 (2007), when it sustained a removal based on an agency's withdrawal of an employee's necessary access to computer and network systems based on management's judgment that Adams lacked sufficient integrity under agency guidelines to continue that access after the employee failed to satisfy managers that he made sufficient efforts to pay his private debts. Without extensive discussion of earlier decisions concerning debt payments, and over the dissent of one Board member, the majority concluded, effectively if indirectly injecting the government into debt collection:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes a copy of agency guidelines concerning the effect of financial problems on security-related determinations such as that made here. Those guidelines indicate that one concern raised by such problems is that an employee under financial pressure may be subject to temptations to obtain money illegally. The record also includes testimony in which Mr. Simonini indicated that he relied on this concern in recommending that the appellant's computer access be suspended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the agency has not shown that the appellant's indebtedness was likely to have the effect mentioned above. As the administrative judge noted, the agency presented no evidence that any of the appellant's creditors was applying any pressure at the time the agency was considering this matter. In fact, most if not all of the appellant's debts appear to have become uncollectible at or shortly after the time the agency received OPM's investigative report, as a result of their being more than 6 years old.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not, however, rely solely on its concern that the appellant might be tempted to obtain money illegally. Mr. Simonini testified that he and other agency officials who were trying to persuade the appellant to pay his creditors were concerned about whether the appellant was "acting responsibly," and whether he was "setting up a repayment schedule that show[ed] ...that [the appellant had] high integrity, [he was] a responsible individual and [he would] follow through on [his] actions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These concerns are legitimate. The agency has presented ample evidence that its computer system contains sensitive information, and that access to this information therefore must be limited to those who have demonstrated integrity and responsibility. It also has presented persuasive evidence that a background investigation with favorable results is required of employees who, like the appellant, are required to use the computer system in their jobs. Furthermore, the agency guidelines mentioned above are not inconsistent with the view that delinquent debts may reflect unfavorably on an individual's integrity, and that they accordingly may serve as a basis for disqualification. That is, the guidelines indicate that "[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include" not only an inability to satisfy debts--a circumstance that could lead to the temptations mentioned above--but also an unwillingness to do so and "other intentional financial breaches of trust."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that the appellant was in a difficult financial position at the time of his reassignment to his Michigan position. He was faced with a large amount of debt, which he estimated totaled about $40,000, and he had child support and other expenses that left him with limited money for paying his debts. The agency did not require him to pay off his entire debt, however. It indicated instead that it expected him to contact each of his creditors, to "agree[ ] to some kind of repayment plan," and to "take some kind of action to make some level of restitution to his creditors." Instead of doing so, the appellant made only a single, $200, payment to a single creditor, evidently anticipating that his debts to other creditors--or at least most of them--would be deleted from his credit report as a result of the passage of time. Moreover, as the administrative judge noted, he continued to have 15% of his salary deposited into his TSP account during his employment in Michigan, despite an agency employee assistance program counselor's suggestion that he reduce those deposits and use the money to reduce his debt. We agree with the agency that these actions reflect adversely on the appellant's integrity and responsibility. <span class="Italic">See Dorrough v. Department of Commerce</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 87, 91 (1989) (employee's failure to pay her just debts in a proper and timely manner was serious misconduct in light of her fiduciary responsibilities).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the agency acted reasonably in denying the appellant access to its computer system. Furthermore, because the appellant needed access to that system in order to perform the duties of his position, we find that the agency has established both the reasonableness of its decision to remove the appellant and the requisite nexus between the appellant's loss of access and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Benally v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 537, 539-40, 542 (1996) (removal sustained based on the employee's loss of his driver's license). The appellant's removal is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1993 Hatch Act Reform Amendments, codified at 5 USC 5520a, removed restrictions on garnishment of federal employees' wages to satisfy civil judgments. As the federal government becomes a link in the correction process, case law may evolve that permits the government to use discipline to avoid continued employment of debtors whose financial tangles involve considerable governmental time or resources.</p>
