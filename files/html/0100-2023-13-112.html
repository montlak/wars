<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-111"><span class="space">a.</span> Due Process</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As a matter of due process the appellant must be given sufficient information from the agency to permit him to defend against the misconduct or other conditions underlying a proposed indefinite suspension. Following <span class="Italic">Cheney v. DOJ,</span> 479 F.3d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (involving an indefinite suspension based on an investigation into a security clearance), <span class="Italic">Lamour v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LAMOUR_JACQUES_E_NY_0752_06_0267_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_280618.pdf">106 MSPR 366</a>, 369-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16, 2007 MSPB 185 (2007), stated the determinants of due process in indefinite suspension cases, emphasizing that if an agency proposes an indefinite suspension while an investigation is underway into conduct that may be criminal, the agency must provide sufficient detail in the suspension proposal of the potentially criminal conduct to permit an employee's informed challenge to the "reasonable cause" underlying the proposed suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...On May 4, 2006, the agency proposed the appellants' indefinite suspensions pending the results of an agency Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation concerning the appellants' alleged use of unnecessary force and criminal assault against an inmate. The appellants, who were represented by the same law firm, made oral and written replies in which they explained that they were involved in a physical altercation while helping other officers subdue and escort an inmate to another unit, but they both "vigorously denied partaking in any physical assault involving an inmate" and noted that the agency's documentation did not indicate that anyone was physically hurt. The appellants asserted that, "other than the possible complaint of an inmate, there is no evidence to establish cause to believe that the actions in the proposal occurred," and that a long indefinite suspension without pay would have a disastrous effect on their ability to provide for their families and would also threaten foreclosure on their homes. The agency indefinitely suspended the appellants, effective June 16, 2006, because the deciding official, Paul Laird, Warden of the MDC, found that the serious nature of the allegations against the appellants made retaining them in the MDC inappropriate until after the issues were resolved. "[B]ecause the criminal investigation could be quite lengthy," Laird also claimed that "retaining [the appellants] in a paid status does not meet the efficiency of the service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants filed timely appeals in which they argued that the agency had not established a nexus between their suspensions and the efficiency of the service, the suspensions were contrary to the agency's actions in more egregious cases, the agency failed to establish reasonable cause to believe that they had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the suspensions had no ascertainable end, and indefinite suspensions without pay would financially ruin them. The agency replied that an allegation that the appellants criminally assaulted an inmate was very serious in light of their responsibilities as correctional officers and that "maintaining the Appellant[s] in any paid position until the final disposition of the investigation would be inappropriate, as [they] would continue to have contact with inmates." Accordingly, the agency argued that indefinitely suspending the appellants promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513(a) of title 5 of the United States Code provides that an agency may take an adverse action, such as suspending an employee for more than 14 days, only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. An employee against whom the adverse action is proposed is entitled to at least 30 days' advance written notice of the action, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the agency submitted its PFRs, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that an agency that provides an employee with 30 days' advance notice may indefinitely suspend an employee pending an investigation of the employee's possible criminal conduct without establishing reasonable cause to believe that the employee committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Department of Justice,</span> 480 F.3d 1309, 1311 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Thus, because the agency in the instant matter proposed the appellants' indefinite suspensions on May 4, 2006, more than 30 days before its June 15, 2006 decisions to suspend them, it could indefinitely suspend the appellants pending the results of the OIG investigation without establishing that it had reasonable cause to believe that they had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. Accordingly, the Board cannot reverse the appellants' indefinite suspension on the basis of the agency's failure to establish that it had reasonable cause to believe the appellants had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, even with 30 days' advance notice, the agency was still required to meet the remaining requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, which, in pertinent part, provide that an agency may suspend an employee for a period in excess of 14 days only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and that the agency must provide written notice stating the specific reasons for the appellants' indefinite suspensions. <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 480 F.3d at 1311. In addition to the statutory requirements set out in subchapter II of chapter 75, sufficient notice of the basis for an agency's proposed action against a tenured employee also implicates due process requirements guaranteed by the 5th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. V ("No person shall...be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."); <span class="Italic">see LaChance v. Erickson,</span> 522 U.S. 262, 266 (1998) ("The core of due process is the right to notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard."). The Board has stated that "fundamental due process requires that the tenured public employee have 'oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story.'" <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994) (quoting<span class="Italic"> Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985)). In <span class="Italic">Barresi,</span> an indefinite suspension case in which the agency shortened the required notice period under the "crime exception" of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), the Board went on to note, "In this regard, due process mandates that notice be sufficiently detailed to provide a meaningful opportunity to be heard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing<span class="Italic"> Goldberg v. Kelly,</span> 397 U.S. 254, 267-68 (1970)). In a recent case involving an indefinite suspension, the Federal Circuit to a similar approach to the question of the specificity required for the agency's notice of its charges against an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. With respect to an employee's indefinite suspension following the <span id="Page_2124"></span>revocation of the appellant's security clearance, the court determined that general notice of the reasons for the security clearance revocation was insufficient. <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice,</span> 479 F.3d 1343, 1353 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The court found that the agency's notice to Cheney that he had "inappropriately queried or caused to be queried Law Enforcement Databases" was "akin to informing Mr. Cheney that his security clearance had been suspended because he had robbed a bank, without telling him where the bank was and when he had robbed it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1352. Furthermore, in a case involving a Border Patrol Agent whom the agency indefinitely suspended after his indictment, the Federal Circuit stated that, when a charge of criminal conduct arises in a context in which the credibility of key parties is necessarily in question, the agency must assure itself that it has a sound basis for acting, and it quoted <span class="Italic">Greene v. McElroy,</span> 360 U.S. 474, 496 (1959) for the following proposition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Certain principles have remained relatively immutable in our jurisprudence. One of these is that where governmental action seriously injures an individual, and the reasonableness of the action depends on fact findings, the evidence used to prove the Government's case must be disclosed to the individual so that he has an opportunity to show that it is untrue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice,</span> 956 F.2d 1151, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the agency's suspension proposals only noted that the appellants were being investigated by the OIG for allegations of use of unnecessary force and criminal assault against an inmate, and the record does not reflect that the appellants ever received any of the agency's evidence against them regarding the alleged misconduct that was the basis for the OIG investigation. When the appellants' representative requested supporting documentation for the agency's proposed actions, the only information which the agency provided was a single-page letter from the OIG which noted, without explanation, that the appellants were among four subjects of an investigation concerning allegations of use of unnecessary force and criminal assault against an inmate. However, other than naming the 4 subjects of the investigation, the OIG letter offered no details concerning the alleged assault, such as when or where it allegedly occurred or the name of the inmate involved in the incident. Although each appellant responded to the agency's proposal, they did not have a chance to respond to the agency's evidence, they were put in the position of having to guess at the specific reasons for their indefinite suspensions, and there is nothing in the record to indicate that they guessed correctly. Thus, the proposal letter, which merely informed the appellants that they were being investigated for criminal assault of an inmate without describing the circumstances surrounding the alleged assault, was insufficiently detailed to provide the appellants notice of the charges against them and, consequently, the agency denied the appellants a meaningful opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">See Barresi,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 666. Accordingly, the record shows that the agency violated the appellants' rights to due process in effecting their suspensions, and the Board cannot sustain these actions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the due process implications, the agency's failure to provide any evidence to establish some basis to believe that the appellants exerted unnecessary force against an inmate also implicates the agency's burden of proving that the appellants' suspensions promote the efficiency of the service. To show that an indefinite suspension promotes the efficiency of the service, the agency must establish a nexus between an employee's alleged misconduct and the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Dunnington,</span> 956 F.2d at 1155, 1158. The nexus requirement, for the purpose of whether an agency has shown that its action promotes the efficiency of the service, means there must be a clear and direct relationship between the articulated grounds for an adverse action and either the employee's ability to accomplish his duties satisfactorily or some other legitimate government interest. <span class="Italic">Merritt v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 585, 596 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified by Kruger v. Department of Justice,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 71, 76 n.3 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted that the appellants' indefinite suspensions promoted the efficiency of the service because of the financial burden on the agency of maintaining the appellants in a paid duty status pending the conclusion of a lengthy investigation. The agency further asserted that, "[b]ased on the seriousness of these allegations, [the deciding official found] that it is not in the best interest of the public or the Bureau to retain [the appellants] in an active duty status while the investigation of these matters is pending." However, aside from the mere fact that the OIG was investigating the alleged incident, the agency offered no evidence to establish that it had any basis to believe that the allegations against the appellants were sufficiently credible to justify the agency's belief that the appellants' actions were contrary to the requirements of their positions.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The agency's proposal letters stated, "Based on the Office of Inspector General's acceptance of this investigation, there is cause to believe the allegations against you could be credible." However, the agency failed to present evidence regarding any standards the OIG may have applied in determining whether to accept the matter for investigation, and the agency's reliance on the OIG's mere acceptance of the matter for investigation "would be violative of the due process principles requiring the agency to provide an explanation of its evidence, and a fair opportunity to respond." <span class="Italic">Barresi,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 666 (an agency could not use an investigative report to establish its charges in hindsight where the agency representatives who effected the indefinite suspension were unaware of the contents of the report and the report was not provided to the appellants as a basis for the agency's action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the agency's interests in the welfare of the prisoners in its custody and in the need to maintain order among the prison population, the agency clearly has a legitimate interest in investigating allegations that its employees have committed misconduct that may have jeopardized those interests. Further, an allegation regarding a correctional officer's use of unnecessary force against an inmate that is sufficiently credible to justify further investigation might establish the clear and direct relationship between that correctional officer's suspension and the agency's legitimate interest in investigating the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we note that correctional officers, such as the appellants, may be required to exert force against an inmate as part of their normal duties; thus, the fact that the OIG was investigating such an incident and the fact that the appellants have apparently conceded that they forcefully restrained an inmate are, without more, insufficient to establish any basis to conclude that the exertion of force called into question the appellants' ability or willingness to properly execute the duties of their position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Craig v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 449, &#x00B6; 11 (2002) (correctional institution employees are charged with maintaining security of the institution and must be prepared to use physical control in situations where necessary, such as in fights among inmates or assaults on staff). In fact, correctional officers may be punished for their failure to exert appropriate force when dictated by the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Cotton v. Department of Justice,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 397, 404-05 (the Board sustained a correctional officer's 30-day suspension for failing to use force to immediately restrain an inmate who had struck and injured another officer), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 985 F.2d 584 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Thus, while the agency may choose to investigate incidents in which its correctional officers exert force against inmates, we find that an agency cannot meet its burden of establishing that suspending a correctional officer without pay during the course of such an investigation promotes the efficiency of the service where the agency has failed to establish any basis to believe that the employee's actions were contrary to the normal and proper execution of his duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its PFRs, the agency maintained "that the appellant[s'] indefinite suspension[s] promoted the efficiency of the service because the alleged misconduct at issue clearly involved [their] law enforcement duties and raised serious and legitimate concerns about the safety of correctional staff, inmates, and the general public." The agency offered no evidence, however, regarding the actual allegations made against the appellants. Ultimately, without some basis to explain why the agency believed that the particular exertion of force at issue in these appeals was contrary to the requirements of the appellants' positions, the agency cannot establish the necessary relationship between the appellants' suspensions and the OIG's investigation into the alleged misconduct. Accordingly, we find that the agency has failed to establish that the appellants' indefinite suspensions promote the efficiency of the service.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This finding is based on the specific context of this case as discussed above and does not in any manner imply that indefinitely suspending an employee pending completion of an agency investigation into credible allegations of serious misconduct could never promote the efficiency of the service when there is no related criminal proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that it is possible that the agency chose not to provide any evidence regarding the allegations against the appellants in order to protect the integrity of the OIG investigation into potentially criminal misconduct by the appellants. However, an agency that decides that it is more important to protect the integrity of its investigation by withholding evidence regarding the alleged misconduct of an employee, rather than providing such evidence to allow the employee to make a meaningful reply to a proposed adverse action or to prove that the agency's action against the employee promotes the efficiency of the service, should understand that it runs the risk that such a decision might preclude the agency from having its action against the employee sustained by the Board. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court has stated, "[I]n those situations where the employer perceives a significant hazard in keeping the employee on the job, it can avoid the problem by suspending with pay." <span class="Italic">Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. at 544-45.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The information provided to the employee who is indefinitely suspended during criminal proceedings need not include all the information relating to the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 20 MSPR 547, 550 (1984), noted the <span id="Page_2125"></span>significance of the information available to and relied on by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, an indefinite suspension pending investigation may be imposed only on the basis of reasonable cause to believe that the employee is guilty of a crime. Moreover, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), an employee against whom an adverse action is taken is entitled to notice of the specific charges against him. Because in this case the agency charged appellant not with "reasonable cause to believe," but with the underlying criminal misconduct, we find that the agency erred in effecting the action. Such error may provide a basis for reversing the agency's action only where it is shown to be harmful to appellant. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 MSPB 489 (1980). The Board finds that appellant has not demonstrated prejudice to his ability to defend against the action and has thus failed to show that the agency's error was harmful to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the denial to appellant of all the ongoing reports of investigation does not constitute harmful error. We note that appellant was given all the material relied upon by the agency deciding official and was accorded a full and fair opportunity to defend the indefinite suspension action before the Board. While he has asserted harm in connection with the denial of discovery, he has not shown specifically how the outcome of his case would have been different before the agency or the Board had he had access to on-going investigative reports. Should action be taken against appellant based on the charges on the merits, appellant will have an additional opportunity to appeal to the Board. However, appellant has not asserted that the evidence to which he points would demonstrate that at the time it took the action the agency did not have reasonable cause to believe him guilty of a crime. Thus the petition for review fails to demonstrate harmful error. <span class="Italic">See Baracco v. Department of Transportation,</span> MSPB Docket No. DC075281F0895 at 11 (April 25, 1983).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The petition raises numerous other objections; <span class="Italic">viz,</span> the presiding official should have allowed appellant's character witness, Major Warman, to testify; appellant should have been given a further opportunity to demonstrate that the stolen goods were not agency property; appellant should have been given the opportunity to cross-examine the person who executed the affidavit, introduced as agency exhibit 1; and the presiding official committed certain errors with regard to rulings on subpoenas for Foss and Sullivan. These contentions are without merit. There is no showing that Major Warman's character testimony would have added anything to the character information already in the record. Moreover, the presiding official found that some $414.00 worth of property was stolen. This conclusion is sufficient to support a finding of reasonable cause to believe a crime has been committed. If the agency takes action against appellant based on the charges, appellant will have an additional opportunity to defend himself on the merits of the charges including whether the goods were stolen. With respect to the matter of the subpoenas, it appears Foss testified and Sullivan was excused due to illness. Any harm resulting from the agency's alleged failure to proceed with their subpoenas is purely speculative. While we find no error in these rulings of the presiding official, we note that even if certain of these rulings were in error, the petition does not demonstrate prejudice to any substantive rights of the appellant due to the rulings of the presiding official. <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henderson v. VA</span>, 123 MSPR 536, 541-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13, 2016 MSPB 29 (2016), described as sufficient a summary in the indefinite suspension proposal of the assertions contained in a referenced indictment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential requirements of constitutional due process for a tenured public employee are notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the evidence, and an opportunity for him to present his account of events. <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). When a summary suspension is based on reasonable cause to believe that a serious crime has been committed, due process requires that the employee be notified of the reasons that led to the finding of "reasonable cause to believe." <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994). The appellant argues, however, that the agency failed to provide him notice of the specific charges against him and failed to give him a meaningful opportunity to respond to the proposed indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency notified the appellant by notice dated July 22, 2015, that it was proposing his indefinite suspension based on the fact that he was arrested and charged with 50 counts of "false statements related to health care matters" in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1035. The proposal notice described the contents of the indictment and the results of the investigation that led to the indictment and explained that, based on the indictment, there was "reasonable cause to believe that [he] may be guilty of a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed." The agency allowed the appellant 7 calendar days to make an oral or written response to the proposed suspension, and, on July 29, 2015, the appellant's representative submitted a written response denying the charges. On August 7, 2015, the agency notified the appellant that he would be indefinitely suspended, effective August 9, 2015, for the reasons stated in the proposal notice. The decision letter also indicated that the deciding official carefully considered the appellant's written reply in rendering her decision to impose the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the information contained in the notice of proposed indefinite suspension provided the appellant adequate prior notice of the specific reason for the indefinite suspension, i.e., reasonable cause to believe that he committed a criminal offense for which a term of imprisonment could be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Dawson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (2014). Furthermore, we find that the agency afforded the appellant a reasonable amount of time--at least 7 days--to reply to the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(2) (stating that an employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to "a reasonable time, but not less than 7 days, to answer orally and in writing"). Accordingly, we find that the appellant has failed to establish that the agency violated his constitutional due process rights. The indefinite suspension is sustained.</p>

In an indefinite suspension appeal based on the crime exception, the issue is whether the agency has made the requisite showing of reasonable cause, not whether the agency has shown that the appellant engaged in the charged criminal behavior. Therefore, substantive defenses to the underlying criminal charges do not defeat an agency's showing of reasonable cause where, as here, that showing is supported by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Pararas-Carayannis v.
