<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 5366 establishes two exceptions relating to appeals for those who receive grade and pay retention; they are for classification appeals (to OPM) and for challenges to reductions in force:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the right of any employee to appeal--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;under section 5112(b) or 5346(c) of this title, or otherwise, any reclassification of a position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, any reduction-in-force action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board jurisdiction generally applies to involuntary reductions in grade and pay. The Reform Act denies appeal rights, however, to employees who are offered indefinite pay and two-year grade retention. Those cases ordinarily involve reclassification of positions. The grades are cut, allowing the government long-term savings, while the pay of incumbent employees is provided some protection. The grade retention provisions are at 5 USC 5362; those for pay retention are located at &#x00A7; 5363. The statutes are implemented by OPM regulations at 5 CFR Part 536 (2022). The scheme is outlined by the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> decision, subsequently discussed. The Postal Service is not covered by 5 USC 5361-63. A preference eligible in the Postal Service may appeal the resultant reduction in grade to the Board. <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 233, 237 (1985) ("The Postal Service is not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5361 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, which provides for grade and pay retention for employees who are reduced in grade following changes of positions or reclassification. Where grade and pay retention is not available, a reduction in grade is an appealable action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512."). Discussed later in this chapter, a downgrading resulting from a RIF is appealable to the Board even though the appellant secures pay and grade retention benefits. Grade and pay retention do not, however, equate to a RIF. "An agency may grant grade and pay retention to any employee who is not entitled to grade retention by operation of RIF procedures when that employee moves to a position in a lower grade during a reorganization announced by management in writing<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 536.103(b) [(1985)]." <span class="Italic">Hartman v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 79 MSPR 576, 581 (1998). [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-031.html#sec10-32">Reassignment with Pay Reduction in Anticipation of RIF</a>," for postal reorganization "voluntary" downgradings treated as RIFs appealable by <span id="Page_425"></span>preference eligible employees despite the equivalent of saved pay and grade, and, <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 347-48 (1993).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With the exceptions just discussed, when a downgrading occurs, saved pay/grade benefits, whether awarded under statute or OPM regulations, preclude Board jurisdiction over a downgrading appeal. <span class="Italic">Bosco v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 471, 474, 6 MSPB 398 (1981). Internal agency regulations implementing a statutory personnel scheme may also provide grade and pay retention and preclude Board jurisdiction over downgradings, as <span class="Italic">Broderick v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 254, 256-61 (1992), demonstrated as to pay actions taken in accordance with Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) involving employees of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants are all employees in the competitive service who are not serving probationary or trial periods under an initial appointment and have completed more than one year of current continuous service in other than a temporary appointment. They are all employed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in various positions and at various grades. They were reduced in pay and/or grade as the result of the agency's conversion to a new pay system, the "OC" pay system. This change was the result of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 9, 1989, Congress enacted FIRREA. The statute included provisions that empower OCC to set and adjust the salaries of all employees of the office. In compliance with the statute, the Comptroller retained a consultant firm to develop a salary survey. A comparison was made of salaries at other Federal banking agencies. As a result of the survey and a salary analysis, the salary scale of the appellants was reduced, and positions in the newly created grade scale were assigned. The agency provided the appellants salary retention for five years and grade retention benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We deny the appellant's petitions because, as noted, they have failed to make convincing arguments on jurisdiction, the sole issue we find relevant. We reopen these appeals to consider the administrative judge's findings on that issue. The Board's jurisdiction is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by statute or regulation<span class="Italic">. See Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 588-89 (1989). The administrative judge cited [<span class="Italic">Lomartere v. Department of Defense</span>, 4 MSPR 30, 32 (1980)] for the proposition that employees who are not entitled to grade retention under 5 USC 5361 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, are entitled to appeal to the Board if they are affected by a reduction in grade.[3] He then concluded that the Board has limited jurisdiction over the appellants' reduction in grade and pay despite the agency's efforts to grant saved grade and pay under its internal retention plan. The administrative judge thus found that although the appellants may in fact have received retained pay and grade, because they did not receive retained pay and grade under 5 USC Chapters 51 and 53, they were entitled to appeal to the Board. We find, however, that: (1) Because the appellants received retained pay and grade, they were not adversely affected and therefore have not established an adverse action under 5 USC Chapter 75; and (2) the source of the appellants' retained pay and grade benefits is not determinative of the question of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We distinguish in part our decision in <span class="Italic">Lomartere v. Department of Defense</span>, 4 MSPR 30 (1980), from the present appeals because in <span class="Italic">Lomartere</span> there is no indication that the appellants received pay or grade retention of any kind.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, the Board has jurisdiction under Chapter 75 to review actions involving reductions in grade and pay<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 7512(3) and (4). However, where a reclassification of an employee results in a reduction in pay and grade and the employee has received retained pay and grade, the employee has no appeal rights to the Board<span class="Italic">. See Decker v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 131 (1989). In addition, the right to appeal reductions in pay and grade to the Board has been narrowly construed<span class="Italic">. See Wilson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The Board has interpreted this authority to require that the appellant show a demonstrable loss, such as an actual reduction in pay, to invoke this authority<span class="Italic">. See Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 698, 707 (1981). In these appeals, although the agency effected actions reducing the appellants' grades and pay, the appellants suffered no adverse actions as contemplated under Chapter 75 because they suffered no loss of pay due to the agency's internal retention procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellants suffered no reduction in grade because they did not show that they suffered an injury that is measurable and substantial in pay terms because they received retained pay,[6] and they did not show that they would be deprived of a substantial benefit such as a promotion because they received retention benefits including the right to compete for any promotion they could have competed for under the old classification system<span class="Italic">. See Russell</span>, 6 MSPR at 709.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;A reduction in grade may be determined on the basis of a loss of pay for employees subject to Chapter 51 and 53 because when they are moved between pay schedules, the determination of grade is made by comparison of the representative rates of the position<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 536.201. Thus, absent pay retention, the appellants would have suffered a reduction in grade. We note that if such a pay comparison were not made, it would be impossible to determine if their grades were reduced or increased when they moved to a different pay system. <span class="Italic">Cf. Peele v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 6 MSPR 296 (1981) (there is no reduction in grade where a position is moved from the GS schedule to a position that is not under a position classification system).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 5361, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, employees who have been reduced in grade through no fault of their own are entitled to two years of retained pay and two years of retained grade. This statutory provision, however, does not apply to the appellants in these appeals. Title 12, Section 1202 of FIRREA, specifically excludes the appellants from coverage under 5 USC Chapter 51 (classification and grading) and subchapter III of 5 USC Chapter 53.[7] Section 1202 provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Notwithstanding any of the preceding provisions of this section to the contrary, the Comptroller of the Currency shall fix the compensation and number of, and appoint and direct, all employees of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Rates of basic pay for all employees of the office may be set and adjusted by the Comptroller without regard to the provisions of Chapter 51 or subchapter III of Chapter 53 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Under 5 USC 5361 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (retained pay and grade), "employee" means an employee to whom chapter 51 of this title applies. Thus, because Chapter 51 does not apply to the appellants, they are not covered by the retained pay and grade provisions of 5 USC 5361 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding that the statutory exclusion of Chapter 53 rights forms a basis for Board jurisdiction is error. In <span class="Italic">Bosco v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 471, 474 (1981), the appellants argued that because they received retained pay and grade benefits pursuant to supplemental regulations promulgated by OPM and not by statute, they had the right to appeal their reductions to the Board. The Board held that the fact that the appellants were covered by regulation rather than statute did not form a basis for jurisdiction. The Board stated "...it matters not at all whether appellants received the benefits of retained grade and pay due to a specific example set forth in statute or by invocation of implementing regulations promulgated by OPM." <span class="Italic">Bosco</span> at 474.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, by analogy, that the fact that the appellants here received retained pay and grade benefits under the internal procedures of the agency, and not by statute, does not form a basis for jurisdiction. We note that under 5 USC 5365, the Office of Personnel Management has specific authority to make regulations that extend the coverage of the statute's retained pay and grade provisions. We find that although the agency does not have specific statutory authority under 5 USC Chapter 53 to extend retained pay and grade benefits to its employees, its decision to grant equivalent or better benefits under the circumstances of these cases is consistent with section 5365 and the Office of Personnel Management's regulations. Moreover, because these appellants suffered no more harm than do appellants who receive their pay and grade retention directly under the statute and regulations, there is no greater reason to allow appeals from them than from those similarly situated employees to whom such right is denied<span class="Italic">. See Atwell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). The appellants have advanced no other theory of jurisdiction than that if they have no right to appeal to the Board they have no course of redress at all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to appellant Fowler's argument that she will have no course of redress if she is denied review by the Board, we find that this is an insufficient basis on which to accept the appeal because the Board may not assert jurisdiction that it does not have<span class="Italic">. See Shaw</span>, 39 MSPR at 588-89<span class="Italic">. See also Wilson</span>, 807 F.2d at 1581, where the court found that despite the fact that 5 USC Chapter 51, does not provide postal workers a right to appeal their classifications to OPM, the appellant's claim that he had been reduced in grade as a result of a postal service reclassification must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439 (1988) (holding that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 set a comprehensive scheme for reviewing actions of Federal agencies, and that if certain persons or acts are not covered by it, review in any forum is precluded).</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 83 MSPR 472, 474-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (1999) (permitting no appeal from reassignments followed by position reclassifications with retained grade and pay, despite an alleged violation of mobility agreements and the adverse impact of reassignments on mobility and training opportunities; alleged violations of agency procedures are not independently appealable; remanding to determine Board jurisdiction over reclassifications as appealable RIF demotions); <span class="Italic">Caselli v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 230 (1992) (OCC; FIRREA); <span class="Italic">Carpenter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 214, 217 (1981) (same result with voluntary downgrading to permit entry into an apprenticeship program); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nugent v. Dept. of Labor</span>, AT-0752-14-0261-I-1 (NP 12/1/2014) ("We <span id="Page_426"></span>note, moreover, that OPM's regulations expressly preclude an agency from offering retained pay to an employee who is reduced in pay at the employee's request. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.102(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 536.103 (defining 'at the employee's request' as a request 'that is initiated by the employee for his or her benefit, convenience, or personal advantage')."). <span class="Italic">But see Malan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 290 (1992) ("Although OPM's regulations deny appeal rights where an agency action entitles an employee to grade retention rights, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(8), no such exclusion applies to an agency action that entitles an employee to pay retention rights only.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a downgrading involving pay/grade retention, there is no right of appeal to the Board even if an allegation is made that the downgrading was discriminatory or resulted from a prohibited personnel practice. The unlawfulness of the downgrading may be raised only as an affirmative defense to an action initially within the Board's appeals jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Wiseltier v. GSA</span>, 5 MSPR 497, 498, 5 MSPB 494 (1981).</p>
