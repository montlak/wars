<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-105"><span class="space">E.</span> ROTATION OF JOBS AND ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
<p class="noindent">Proposals requiring management to reassign duties from one unit employee to another directly interfere with management's right to assign work. They are outside the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">FOP Lodge 1F and VAMC, Providence, R.I.</span>, 32 FLRA 944, 945 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3172 and DHHS, SSA, Modesto</span>, 49 FLRA 302, 305-10 (1994) (Proposal 1, rotational requirement, was nonnegotiable as procedure and nonnegotiable as arrangement because of undue intrusion on management's right to assign employees and work in highly specialized unit). A requirement that work assignments be rotated weekly was nonnegotiable. It conflicted with management's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 695 and Dept. of Treasury, U.S. Mint, Denver</span>, 3 FLRA 43, 43-45 (1980). It was immaterial whether the proposal was interpreted to mean that the agency would assign employees to different positions or whether the proposal required the agency to rotate the employees through the variety of duties contained in the employees' position descriptions. The proposal required all employees to be rotated each week regardless of whether any work was available requiring those duties. Management was restricted in making new assignments, or in modifying, terminating, or continuing existing assignments deemed necessary or desirable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3669 and VAMC, Minneapolis</span>, 2 FLRA 641, 641 (1980) (discussed earlier as to hours of work and tours of duty). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-006.html#sec6-7">Shifts, Tours, Hours of Duty</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-14-010.html#sec6-11">Shift Swap</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">A decision to institute a rotational system for typists working for administrative law judges, rather than having the typists permanently assigned to a particular judge, involved an exercise of the nonnegotiable right to assign work. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE</span>, 16 FLRA 740, 741 (1984) (ALJ Decision). A request that assignments be rotated periodically through the alphabet of employees doing that type of work (to avoid the accumulation of easy assignments) was nonnegotiable. It prevented management from taking valid considerations into account in making assignments. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 17 FLRA 326, 327 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Danbury</span>, 29 FLRA 990, 1015-17 (1987) (Proposal 38: rotation of entry-level personnel was nonnegotiable; it affected ability of agency to determine qualifications and determine type of employees assigned to tour of duty); <span class="Italic">Ft. Knox Teachers Ass'n and Ft. Knox Dependent Sch.</span>, 25 FLRA 1119, 1121-22 (1987) (rotation of teacher chaperon duty on school bus ignored management's right to determine qualifications of employees performing that duty).</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal restricted rotation of employees solely to avoid compensation at a higher level. It violated the right of the agency to assign employees. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 FLRA 1051, 1059 (1986). A proposal that management not rotate unit employees (auditors) through various locations and assignments as required in a mandatory agency auditor rotation policy was a nonnegotiable infringement on the right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3529 and DCAA</span>, 3 FLRA 301, 302 (1980) (relying on <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson AFB</span>, 2 FLRA 604 (1980)). A restriction against moving nurses from ward to ward unless there was an emergency infringed the right to assign work and was not an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Ft. Lyons, Colo.,</span> 25 FLRA 803, 818-20 (1987) (Proposal 4).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management's right to assign work and employees when several identical positions are available at more than one location includes the determination of whether an employee has the requisite individual characteristics, e.g., judgment and reliability, to do the work in a particular location. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>,<span class="Italic"> SSA and AFGE</span>, 21 FLRA 735, 746 (1986) (ALJ Decision). A proposal requiring nondiscretionary equality in the assignment of certain functions impinged on management's ability to assign work. The proposal was distinguished from one that preserved management's discretion by an agreement that duties be assigned on a fair and equitable basis. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 99</span>, 12 FLRA 19, 20 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 56 FLRA 798, 801 (2000) ("[W]here a proposed requirement for 'fair and equitable' assignment merely requires an agency to make assignments 'in a manner which is consistent with 'merit factors required by applicable law, rule or regulation," the proposal does not affect management rights";<span class="Italic"> citing</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Dept. of Educ. Council of AFGE Locals and Dept. of Educ.</span>, 35 FLRA 56, 62-63 (1990)). Another proposal, for a fixed schedule of rotation among duty officers of "telephone duty" (responding to incoming calls and inquiries), was not an appropriate arrangement because the schedule interfered excessively with travel and inspection duties of the employees. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals and Dept. of Labor, Office of Ass't Sec'y</span>, 37 FLRA 828, 833-34 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA, Lawrence, Mass.</span>, 55 FLRA 999, 1001 (1999) (Proposal 1, for trial period of job rotation among claims representatives, excessively interfered with management's ability to assign the full complement of employees it deemed necessary to accomplish office workload).</p>
<p class="noindent">Not all rotational arrangements interfere with management rights, and it can be difficult to discern the line that separates the negotiable from those that are not. The union could demand negotiations concerning management's intent to change a preexisting rotation schedule for customs inspectors from 30 minutes to one hour, increasing the amount of time that employees would spend in one stretch inspecting vehicles and inhaling carbon monoxide fumes. The rotation required employees to shift from vehicle checks to areas involving pedestrian or other inspections. The negotiations did not involve the assignment of work, only when employees would perform the previously assigned duties of their positions. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Local 1210</span>, 25 FLRA 32, 33 (1987). Another customs inspection rotation plan was negotiable: the employees were already performing the duties, and the agency did not suggest that particular qualifications of individual employees were needed to satisfy requirements for the jobs subject to rotation. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv. Northeast Region</span>, 25 FLRA 731, 734 (1987). A rotational system for assignment of special details to employees was negotiable. The rotation depended on a list that would allow each employee, in turn, to receive special details until a total of 88 hours were served, when the next employee would be in line for the assignments. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2272 and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 9 FLRA 1004 (1982) (Proposal 9). It was negotiable to for equitable distribution of night duty and relief tours for nurses. <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Ft. Lyons, Colo.,</span> 25 FLRA 803, 822 (1987) (Proposal 6) (relying upon <span class="Italic">ACT and Ga. NG</span>, 2 FLRA 581, 583-85 (1980) (permitting negotiations for equitable assignment of cleanup duties)).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that required that assignments of personnel essential to the mission be rotated if less than a full workforce is required, to ensure the distribution of the assignments. The provision did not affect <span id="page_685"></span>management's discretion to determine the personnel who were essential to the mission, and the proposal preserved management's right to change those determinations as necessary. The proposal was analogous to proposals involving overtime assignments. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-75 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 24 FLRA 56, 62-63 (1986). There was no objection from FLRA to a proposal requiring that, given two types of work assigned within position descriptions and measured by performance standards, employees be provided the opportunity to do both types of work so as to maintain the required proficiency in both. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS, Dallas Dist.</span>, 13 FLRA 48, 49-50 (1983). Other proposals were negotiable that qualified employees rotate with scheduled frequency through particular stations at an office involving public contact tasks. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 31 FLRA 651, 657-58 (1988) (Proposal 1).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to the claim that negotiations over the equitable distribution of work among claims representatives interfered with the right of management to determine the technology of performing work, FLRA dismissed the objections to negotiability in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 41 FLRA 1309, 1319-22 (1991), a refusal to bargain case:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we noted previously, in order to determine whether the Respondents violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by implementing a reorganization plan without bargaining over the Schmidt Plan proposals, we must determine whether any part of the Schmidt Plan is negotiable. If any one of the Schmidt Plan proposals is negotiable, then the Respondents violated the Statute by implementing the reorganization plan without bargaining over the negotiable proposal....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he portions of the Schmidt Plan concerning the method of equitably distributing the work among the CRs are negotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...These proposals are similar to proposals found to be negotiable in [<span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore</span>, 31 FLRA 651 (1988)]. In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Authority found the following proposals to be negotiable procedures within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2): (1) a proposal providing for the daily rotation of employees in an equitable manner; and (2) a proposal using rotation for selecting employees from among those employees that management had determined to be qualified to perform the work.... In finding the proposals to be negotiable, the Authority noted that the obligation to bargain over the rotation of employees to perform certain tasks was limited to employees qualified to perform the work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record does not indicate that certain CRs are more qualified to handle specific types of claims.&#x2003;Rather, according to the Respondents, "[m]anagement had determined that all teleclaims would be handled on a daily basis by all employees." In light of the Respondents' assertion as well as the fact that the Respondents set up a plan in which claims were to be distributed among CRs based on the claimant's last name, we find that the Respondents considered all of the CRs to be qualified to handle all types of claims. As the proposals constitute alternate procedures for allocating and distributing the same type of work among equally qualified CRs, we find that Proposals 2, 4, 6, 12, and 13 are negotiable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondents' argument that the Union's proposals directly interfere with management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The Respondents argue in their exceptions that the Schmidt Plan directly interferes with management's right to assign work because "management had not predetermined specifically which CRs would perform the teleclaims and walk-in interviews." However, as noted above, the Respondents previously stated that all CRs would handle teleclaims and the Respondents set up an alpha system where all CRs were assigned to all types of claims. Inasmuch as the alpha system does not allow the Respondents to predetermine specifically which particular CR will handle which particular kind of claim, we find that the Respondents have failed to substantiate their assertion that they must predetermine which CRs will handle particular claims. As the Respondents have not shown that Proposals 2, 4, 6, 12, or 13 require management to assign duties to employees not qualified to perform the work or in any way preclude management from assigning work to qualified employees, we find that the Respondents have not established that the proposal interferes with management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondents' argument that the proposals directly interfere with management's right to determine the technology, methods, and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. The Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal directly interferes with management's right to determine the "technology" used in "performing work." In order to sustain such a claim, an agency must show: first, the technological relationship of the matter addressed by the proposal to accomplishing or furthering the performance of the agency's work; and second, how the proposal would interfere with the purpose for which the technology was adopted. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3601 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Indian Hospital, Claremore, Oklahoma</span>, 39 FLRA 504, 511-12 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Respondents claim that Proposal 12 directly interferes with management's right to determine the technology of performing its work because the proposal affects "the technology (function of a technician using a telephone) of how management chooses to distribute work." We reject this claim because such an argument, without more, does not demonstrate that there is a technological relationship between the matter addressed in Proposal 12 and the performance of the Respondents' work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 83 and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 35 FLRA 398, 404 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>). Proposal 12 does not dictate the technology the Respondents will use to process claims because the Respondents have already decided that CRs will use telephones to handle certain types of claims. Rather, Proposal 12 is merely a procedure for determining who among equally qualified employees will handle particular telephone claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similar to the analysis regarding interference with the right to determine the technology of performing work, the Authority employs a two-part test to determine whether a proposal violates management's right to determine the "methods and means of performing work." First, an agency must show a direct relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Second, the agency must show that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 35 FLRA at 406-09.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As to Proposal 2, the Respondents argue that the proposal "tells [management] that it must assign interviews a certain way" and, therefore, "directly affects the means regarding how [management] should do its work." This statement is not sufficient to establish that Proposal 2 directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1). As noted previously, the proposals constitute procedures for determining who will perform the work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 15 and Department of the Army, U.S. Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command, Rock Island, Illinois</span>, 30 FLRA 1046, 1073 (1988) (Proposals 8 and 9).... Accordingly, we reject the Respondents' argument that Proposal 2 directly interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Dist. Office, New Bedford</span>, 54 FLRA 1327, 1345-46 (1998) (approving as negotiable Proposal 9, calling on management to establish log to control rotation scheme for interviews conducted by claims representatives).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although some general requirements concerning job rotation may be negotiable, specific limitations concerning rotation may be nonnegotiable if they infringe on specific management rights other than the right to assign work. A job rotation proposal was nonnegotiable that required advance notice of changes of rotation in an emergency. The proposal interfered with the right of management to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the agency mission during an emergency. 5 USC 7106(a)(2)(D). <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv. Northeast Region</span>, 25 FLRA 731, 735 (1987).

<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 65 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073-75 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 45 FLRA 1256 (1992) (dismissing a negotiability decision pursuant to the reasoning and result of the court decision), FLRA determined to be negotiable Provision 15, that "[s]upervisors will refrain from rotating or scheduling assignments of employees to avoid compensation of a particular employee at the higher level." It was FLRA's judgment in the 1991 decision that the measure was an appropriate arrangement, 39 FLRA at 66-67:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's sole argument is that Provision 15 constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the statute for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign employees. Consistent with Authority precedent, therefore, we will assume that the provision directly interferes with the right to assign employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question in this dispute, therefore, is whether Provision 15 is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3).... [W]e must first decide whether the provision is an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of the wording of Provision 15 and the record as a whole leads us to conclude that the provision is an arrangement.&#x2003;The provision's objective is to mitigate the adverse economic effect on employees when management curtails details to avoid paying increased compensation. Clearly, the provision would allow management to employ details shorter than one pay period for any reason other than avoidance of increased compensation. Thus, the interference with management's right to assign employees is minimal. Further, the Authority has previously observed that "paying employees at levels commensurate with the work that they are required to perform is good management practice." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2024 and Department <span id="page_686"></span>of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire</span>, 30 FLRA 845, 848 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 15 would allow management to use short-duration details for any sound managerial reason. It would only prevent management from curtailing details if the motive is to avoid the contractual requirement that employees be compensated at a higher level. Balancing the respective interests of management in assigning employees to details and of the employees in receiving compensation consistent with the level of work performed, we find that the benefit to employees outweighs the minimal impact on management's rights. Therefore, Provision 15 does not excessively interfere with management's right to assign employees and is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement....</p>
