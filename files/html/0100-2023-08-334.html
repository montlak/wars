<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-326"><span class="space">a.</span> Training Status</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA protections were available to employees who qualified as disabled veterans even if their service was entirely for training purposes, <span class="Italic">Hesse v. Dept. of Army,</span> 104 MSPR 647, 648-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-16, 2007 MSPB 43 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant applied for employment as a security guard, GS-0085-5, a position that by law may be filled only by appointment of a preference eligible, as long as qualified preference eligible candidates are available. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310. Although the agency tentatively selected him for such a position, it did so before confirming that he was entitled to the preference he claimed. After reviewing documents related to the appellant's military service, the agency concluded that the appellant was not a preference eligible, and that he therefore could not be appointed to the position for which he had applied. The appellant filed a complaint with the Department of Labor (DoL) under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA); DoL concurred in the agency's finding that the appellant was not a preference eligible; and the appellant filed a timely VEOA appeal with the Board's Atlanta Regional Office. The administrative judge to whom that appeal was assigned also concluded that the appellant was not entitled to veteran preference, and she issued an initial decision denying the appellant's request for corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the statutory provision generally limiting competition for security guard positions to preference eligibles is found in title 5 of the United States Code, i.e., at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3310. The term "preference eligible" is defined, for purposes of that title, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3), the term "preference eligible" means either "a disabled veteran" or "a veteran as defined by paragraph (1)(A)," "(1)(B), (C), or (D)" of section 2108. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3)(A), (B), (C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims preference eligibility as a "disabled veteran." The term "disabled veteran" is defined, for purposes of title 5, as "an individual who has served on active duty in the armed forces, has been separated therefrom under honorable conditions, and has established the present existence of a service-connected disability...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows, and the agency does not deny, that the appellant served on active duty in the armed forces for training purposes, that he was separated under honorable conditions, and that he is receiving compensation for a service-connected disability. The parties also have stipulated that this disability was based on an injury the appellant suffered while he was on active duty for training purposes, and that the appellant served on active duty only for those purposes. The agency argues that active duty for training purposes does not constitute "active duty" under the statutory definition of a "disabled veteran," and that the appellant therefore is not a preference eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_583"></span>The agency's position is based in part on a definition of "active duty" that is provided in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21). Under that provision, "active duty for training" does not constitute "active duty" in the armed forces. We note, however, that, although the term "veteran" as it is defined in paragraphs (1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(D) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 applies only to individuals whose military service included a period of "active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38," the term "disabled veteran" is defined in a separate provision, i.e., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). The definition in the latter provision includes no reference to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21) and no other indication that the "active duty" performed by a disabled veteran may not consist of active duty for training purposes. Furthermore, nothing in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 indicates that the definition of "active duty" that is stated in subsection (21) is generally applicable to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108, or that it is generally applicable to title 5. Instead, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 provides, in its introductory phrase, that the definitions in that section apply "[f]or the purposes of" title 38. The plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101 therefore indicates that the provision limiting the definition in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(B), (1)(C), and (1)(D) to individuals who served on active duty for purposes other than training does not apply to the definition of "disabled veteran" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). <span class="Italic">See KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc. v. Lasting Impression I, Inc.</span>, 543 U.S. 111, 118 (2004) (when Congress includes a particular phrase in one part of a statute but not another part, it is generally presumed to have acted intentionally in doing so).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also see nothing in the legislative history of the statutory provisions relevant here that indicates an intent to make the definition in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21) applicable to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). When 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 was first codified in 1966, it provided for only two categories of preference eligibles, i.e., the "disabled veterans" described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2) and those "veterans" who are now described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(A). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 (1966). The latter category includes individuals who served on active duty during a war, in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge was authorized, or during the period from April 28, 1952, through July 1, 1955. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(A); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1) (1966). Nothing in the 1966 version of section 2108 indicated that the "active duty" requirement applicable to those two categories could be satisfied only by active duty for purposes other than training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1966, Congress amended this provision by adding a third category of "preference eligibles," i.e., the category of veterans who are now covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(B). Veterans' Readjustment Benefits Act of 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-358 (VRBA), &#x00A7; 11 (codified as amended in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108). This category generally includes individuals who served on active duty in the armed forces after January 31, 1955. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Unlike those covered by subsection 2108(1)(A), individuals serving during the time period described in the new provision were "veterans," and therefore "preference eligibles," only if they served for more than 180 consecutive days and only if this service was "active duty (as defined in section 101(21) of title 38, United States Code)...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The imposition of these restrictions evidently reflects Congress's recognition that the new category of preference eligibles did not have "wartime" service, as that term had been used in the past. In reporting favorably on the language that was to become part of the 1966 legislation, the House committee stated that the Cold War, its crises, continued compulsory military service, and the increased stationing of service members overseas had made extension of benefits to them "necessary if our servicemen, during this tense period of history, are to receive equitable treatment." H.R. Rep. No. 89-1258, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1966 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1888, 1889-90. It also recognized, however, that wartime veterans traditionally had been given substantially more benefits than peacetime veterans. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1889. Perhaps most significant, instead of simply modifying the existing provision that is now codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(A), it added a separate provision establishing requirements that were different from those applicable to individuals whose service preceded February 1955 or was performed during a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge had been authorized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that, when Congress subsequently expanded the categories of preference eligibles further, it again added separate provisions establishing new and different sets of criteria for the new categories. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-85, &#x00A7; 1102(a)(1)(C), 111 Stat. 1629, 1922 (1997), codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C); National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-163, &#x00A7; 1111(a)(3), 119 Stat. 3136, 3451 (2006), codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(D). Nothing in the legislation described above or its history suggests that these different requirements were intended to apply to the preexisting veteran preference provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated above, the administrative judge in this case concluded that the appellant was not entitled to veteran preference. Her conclusion was based on a circuit court decision affirming a decision of the Board's predecessor, the U.S. Civil Service Commission (Commission). In its decision, the court described the Commission as having found that the employee was not a preference eligible because he had not served on active duty in the armed forces and because he had not established that he had incurred a service-connected disability. <span class="Italic">Broussard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 674 F.2d 1103, 1109 (5th Cir. 1982). The court noted that, about a year after the Commission had issued its decision, the Veterans Administration had reversed its prior decision and found that the employee did have such a disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It concluded that remanding the case was unnecessary, however, because the employee had not challenged the finding that he had not served on active duty in the armed forces. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1110. In reaching this conclusion, it stated that active duty service appeared to be essential to a finding that the employee was a preference eligible, even if the employee had a service-connected disability, and it quoted a provision of the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) that indicated that even disabled veterans were considered preference eligible only if they had served on active duty for purposes other than training. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting FPM chapter 211, subchapter 2-1(6) n.2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Commission found that the employee in <span class="Italic">Broussard</span> did not have a service-connected disability, it appears that its finding that the employee lacked the required active duty service was based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1), rather than on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2). It is not clear, therefore, that the Commission decision in <span class="Italic">Broussard</span> supports the proposition that active duty does not entitle even a disabled veteran to preference unless it is for purposes other than training. In any event, however, neither decisions of the Civil Service Commission nor those of the circuit court that issued <span class="Italic">Broussard</span> are binding on the Board. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. DeMeo</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 158, 173 (1997), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 230 F.3d 1372 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 530 U.S. 1219 (2000); <span class="Italic">see Morgan v. Department of Energy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 48, &#x00B6; 15 n.2 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The FPM provision on which the court relied in <span class="Italic">Broussard</span>--in fact, the FPM as a whole--is no longer in effect. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), however, issued regulations in 1995 that could be construed as providing, in effect, that all categories of veterans and disabled veterans listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108 must have served on active duty for purposes other than training in order to be considered preference eligibles. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 211.102(a), (b) (definitions of "veteran" and "disabled veteran," including references to those individuals' "active duty in the armed forces"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 211.102(f) (defining "active duty" as "full-time duty...in the armed forces, except for training...").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Supreme Court has held in <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984), that, when Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue in an adjudicatory proceeding such as this, an administrative interpretation of a statutory provision may be entitled to deference. Such an interpretation cannot overrule the intent of Congress, however, when that intent is clear. <span class="Italic">See Chevron,</span> 467 U.S. at 842-43 ("If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter, for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated earlier in this decision, we find that the intent of Congress regarding the matter at issue here is clear. Moreover, the OPM regulations cited above are inconsistent both with the applicable statutory language and with its history. Those regulations therefore are not entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 (if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue to be addressed in a proceeding, the question to be answered is whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute). We hold instead that "active duty," as that term is used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(2), may consist entirely of service for training purposes. The appellant in this case is a "disabled veteran" under that subsection, and he accordingly is a preference eligible.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">But "training" of duration insufficient, along with other service, to qualify for preference eligibility did not establish the basis for a VEOA claim, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. DOD,</span> DA-3330-14-0422-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(1)(C), (3)(B), preference eligibility generally applies to a veteran who "served on active duty as defined by section 101(21) of title 38 in the armed forces during the period beginning on August 2, 1990, and ending on January 2, 1992." The appellant's service <span id="Page_584"></span>fell within this date range. Nevertheless, based upon the type and duration of his service, we find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he is preference-eligible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Active duty" includes "full-time duty in the Armed Forces, other than active duty for training." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(21)(A); <span class="Italic">see Gordon-Cureton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2007) (discussing the definition of "active duty" and the limitation for training). Here, the appellant acknowledged that he participated in basic training, but separated from the Army before completing any active duty. Accordingly, the appellant's service does not meet the "active duty" element required for veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the above, an individual who entered on active duty after October 13, 1982, and who was discharged or released from a period of active duty before completing the shorter of either 24 months of continuous active duty, or the full period for which he was called or ordered to active duty, is generally not eligible for any benefit based on meeting the definition of preference-eligible in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(d); <span class="Italic">Gordon-Cureton</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 165, &#x00B6; 11. Here, even if the appellant's service constituted "active duty," he completed approximately 2 months of service, far short of the minimum service requirement. Although the statute imposing the minimum service requirement provides exemptions for discharges from active duty under sections 1171 and 1173 of Title 10, discharges for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, and persons with a service-connected disability, 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5303A(d)(3)(A), the appellant has presented nothing to suggest that any of the exemptions apply to him. Instead, the record indicates that the minimum service requirement does apply because he was discharged for failing to meet fitness standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he met the active duty or minimum service requirements to be preference-eligible, his 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A) veterans' preference claim must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Similarly, his 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(B) right-to-compete claim must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he is preference-eligible or that he separated from the armed forces after 3 years or more of active service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3304(f)(1).</p>
