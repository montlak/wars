<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-344"><span class="space">a.</span> Specificity Required for DOL Complaint</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gingery v. OPM</span>, 119 MSPR 43, 48-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18, 2012 MSPB 130 (2012), explained the necessity for a reasonably descriptive complaint to DOL as predicate to Board merits resolution:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA grants preferences to veterans who seek federal employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. If the employing agency rejects the veteran's request for preference employment, the VEOA vests the veteran with the right to challenge that rejection before the Board. To establish Board jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, an appellant must (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL, and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that: (i) He is a preference eligible within the meaning of the VEOA, (ii) the action at issue took place on or after the date that the VEOA was enacted, and (iii) the agency violated his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans preference. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a; <span class="Italic">Jarrard v. Social Security Administration</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 7 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 669 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2012); <span class="Italic">Becker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 327, &#x00B6; 9 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish exhaustion, the appellant must show that he provided DOL with a summary of the allegations forming the basis of his complaint so that DOL can conduct an investigation. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 445 F. Appx. 347 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The purpose of this requirement is to afford DOL the opportunity to conduct an investigation that might lead to corrective action before involving the Board in the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(b)-(c); <span class="Italic">Burroughs,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 9. The appellant has provided a copy of his VEOA complaint, including a fax cover sheet, but he did not submit a fax confirmation sheet showing that he actually transmitted the complaint to DOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the content of the appellant's complaint was sufficient to provide DOL with the opportunity to conduct an investigation. The administrative judge found, however, that the appellant failed to prove that the DOL "received and attempted to resolve" the complaint. In so finding, the administrative judge did not apply the correct legal standard. The statute anticipates that DOL will not always resolve VEOA complaints within 60 days, and it explicitly provides individuals with the means to pursue their rights in that event. Thus, the statute provides that, to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, the appellant must also show that he either received written notification of the results of DOL's investigation of the complaint or, if DOL does not resolve the complaint within 60 days, that he provided written notification to DOL of his intent to file a Board appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)-(2); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 10 (2011). Therefore, the appellant was not required to prove that DOL "received and attempted to resolve" his complaint. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burroughs</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 292, &#x00B6; 9 (the administrative judge erred by finding that the appellant failed to prove DOL exhaustion on the basis that there was no evidence that DOL accepted or construed his complaint as a VEOA complaint; any decision DOL made not to process the appellant's claim as a VEOA complaint could not be attributed to the appellant). Instead, the statute requires only that the appellant show that he filed a VEOA complaint with DOL. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a), (d).Under the circumstances, we find that the appellant has submitted preponderant evidence showing that he satisfied this requirement. Indeed, the fact that the appellant later filed a notice of intent to appeal on July 29, 2009, supports his assertion that he filed an initial complaint with DOL on or about April 4, 2009. Accordingly, we conclude that the appellant established that he exhausted his administrative remedy with DOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address whether the appellant's written complaint to DOL was timely filed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. The statute requires that the complaint must be filed with the Secretary of Labor within 60 days after the date of the alleged injury to the veteran's rights. We find that the appellant's written complaint with the Secretary of Labor was untimely filed. The appellant states that he became personally aware of OPM's action concerning the pass-over request "some time after the January 6[, 2009] postmark on the envelope" that he received from OPM containing its decision. In any event, the appellant was aware of OPM's decision no later than January 15, 2009, because on that date he wrote a letter to OPM which makes reference to that decision and requests that OPM reconsider it. The appellant contends that the time for filing his DOL complaint did not commence until March 27, 2009, the date upon which he received a response from OPM confirming that its earlier determination was final. We disagree. There is no indication that OPM's decision to grant the pass-over request was preliminary or otherwise subject to reversal. Thus, we find that the 60-day filing period set forth in section 3330a(2)(A) commenced no later than January 15, 2009. The deadline for filing the appellant's complaint with DOL was therefore March 16, 2009. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jones v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2012-3114, 2012 WL 3871745, at *2-3 (Fed. Cir. Sep. 7, 2012) (unpublished decision) (finding that the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant's utilization of an agency re-review process did not alter the date of the agency's nonselection and that the deadline for filing a VEOA complaint with DOL was 60 days after that date). Because the appellant states that he filed his complaint with DOL on or about April 4, 2009, the complaint was untimely filed by 19 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The 60-day filing deadline set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A), however, is subject to equitable tolling, and an employee's failure to file a complaint within that 60-day period does not summarily foreclose the Board from exercising jurisdiction to review the appeal. <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Department of the Army</span>, 479 F.3d 830, 835-44 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Roesel v.

The Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89, 96 (1990), that federal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly and that the Court had allowed equitable tolling in situations where the complainant had actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant had been "induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="Italic">See Roesel</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is neither argument nor evidence that the appellant filed a defective pleading [5] within the statutory period or that he was "tricked" or "induced" by an agency representative into filing late. <span class="Italic">Cf. Roesel</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6; 10 (rejecting the appellant's contention that his appeal should be subject to equitable tolling because he had reached a settlement with the agency in a complaint before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission concerning the pertinent vacancy announcement, the agency allegedly breached the settlement agreement, but he delayed in filing a complaint with DOL because he "had been told [the agency] had impunity from following the law"). The appellant's decision to await OPM's response to his request for reconsideration does not establish a compelling justification for the filing delay warranting the application of equitable tolling.6 Because there is no indication that the appellant pursued his remedy within the statutory period or that his failure to file a timely VEOA complaint with DOL was the result of misconduct, equitable tolling is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 14 (2009).</p>
