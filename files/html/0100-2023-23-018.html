<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-19"><span class="space">b.</span> Settlement Arising From Disputed Last Chance Agreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">At least until <span class="Italic">Delorme v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 124 MSPR 123, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-21, 2017 MSPB 2 (2017), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, complexities compounded when the Board concerned itself with a settlement arising out of an appeal resulting from a last chance agreement gone awry. If the last chance agreement waives appeal rights, the agency terminates the employee for violating the agreement, and if the employee then appeals and attempts to file a settlement of the appeal, the Board has to determine whether the waiver in the first agreement divests it of jurisdiction to accept the second agreement. That determination involves consideration of whether the appellant breached the last chance agreement, a determination that may also include consideration of whether the agency negotiated the last chance agreement in good faith, matters considered in <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 59 MSPR 434, 435-39 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 14, 1992, the agency proposed to remove the appellant from his position of Air Traffic Control Specialist on the charge of alcohol dependency. On August 31, 1992, the parties entered into a last-chance settlement agreement in which the appellant agreed, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, to abstain from the use of alcohol while employed by the agency (Condition No. 6) and to authorize the release of information to the agency as necessary for monitoring his compliance with the agreement (Condition No. 10). The agreement provided that the appellant's failure to abide by every <span id="Page_4769"></span>one of its conditions "will result in [his] removal from the Federal Service." The agreement also contained a provision waiving the appellant's appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 22, 1992, the West Paces Ferry Hospital, where the appellant was receiving therapy for alcohol abuse, reported to the agency that a blood alcohol test performed on the appellant registered an alcohol level of .268. On December 28, 1992, the appellant revoked his consent for release of information to the agency. On January 5, 1993, the agency notified the appellant that it was removing him effective January 12, 1993, for violating Condition Nos. 6 and 10 of the last-chance settlement agreement. Citing the agreement's waiver provision, the agency did not provide the appellant with notice of appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a petition for appeal to the Board alleging that the agency forced the agreement on him and pressured him to give away his constitutional rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 29, 1993, the parties entered into a settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to cancel the removal action, and the appellant agreed to enter into another last-chance settlement agreement and withdraw his appeal. The administrative judge found that the settlement agreement was lawful and that the appellant understood its terms and entered into it voluntarily. Initial She entered the settlement agreement into the record and dismissed the appeal without holding a jurisdictional hearing, retaining jurisdiction for the limited purpose of considering any enforcement or compliance issues that may arise under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 6, 1993, the appellant filed a document with the Board's Atlanta Regional Office in which he requested that the Board reopen his appeal on the grounds that he signed "the agreement" under duress and the agency acted in bad faith when it negotiated "the agreement." The regional office forwarded this submission to the Board as a petition for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will incorporate a settlement agreement into the record and enforce its terms if: (1) The parties intended that the agreement be enforced by the Board; (2) the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal; and (3) the agreement is lawful on its face and was freely reached and understood by the parties....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the August 31, 1992, last-chance settlement agreement, the appellant agreed as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">During the next two years I knowingly and voluntarily waive my rights in any disciplinary actions taken by the [Federal Aviation Administration] for violating this agreement. I have no appeal rights to MSPB, EEOC, the courts, any negotiated or agency grievance procedures or any other forum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant's waiver of appeal rights in a last-chance settlement agreement is enforceable and not against public policy if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency.... A waiver of appeal rights that meets these criteria divests the Board of jurisdiction over an appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties expressed their intent, in the April 29, 1993, settlement agreement, that the agreement be entered into the record and enforced by the Board. Before she accepted that agreement into the record for enforcement as requested by the parties, the administrative judge should have determined whether the appellant freely and voluntarily waived his appeal rights to the Board in the August 31, 1992, last-chance settlement agreement.... Instead, the administrative judge simply, and without explanation, found Board jurisdiction pursuant to 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(A), 7512(1), and 7513(d). We find that the administrative judge failed to resolve the jurisdictional issue presented in this case with appropriate factual findings and credibility determinations before entering the settlement agreement into the record....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, insofar as the appellant is petitioning the Board to enforce the terms of the April 29, 1993, settlement agreement, he has not shown that the Board has the authority to do so.... On remand, however, he will be given an opportunity to make that showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The August 31, 1992, last-chance settlement agreement predicates the reimposition of disciplinary action and concomitant waiver of appeal rights on the employee's breach of one or more of the conditions of the agreement. In such circumstances, the Board must determine whether the appellant breached the last-chance settlement agreement before determining the scope and applicability of the waiver of appeal rights....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not disputed that on or about December 22, 1992, the West Paces Ferry Hospital recorded his blood alcohol level as .268, or that on December 28, 1992, he revoked his consent for release of information to the agency, both of which severally constitute breaches of the August 31, 1992, last-chance settlement agreement. We find, therefore, that the appellant breached at least two of the conditions of the agreement. Accordingly, the issue before the administrative judge on remand is whether the appellant's waiver of appeal rights to the Board in that agreement removes this appeal from the Board's jurisdiction.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant contends that the agency "set him up for failure" in his rehabilitation program by requiring him to complete the West Paces Hospital outpatient program, which, he alleges, did not meet the agency's minimum requirements for a rehabilitation/treatment program. This argument does not go to the issue of whether the appellant breached the agreement, but, rather, to whether the agency entered into the last-chance settlement agreement in good faith, an issue on which the administrative judge agreed to receive evidence at the previously scheduled jurisdictional hearing. The question of whether the agency acted in bad faith in negotiating the agreement is relevant to the applicability of the appellant's waiver of appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ferby v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 456 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In short, at least pre-<span class="Italic">Delorme</span>, if following execution of a last chance agreement, the appellant is again removed, again appeals, and again settles, the Board has jurisdiction to accept the second settlement into the record for enforcement purposes only if it would have had jurisdiction to entertain a challenge to the removal flowing from the last chance agreement. To obtain jurisdiction, the AJ determines the validity of the waiver contained in the last chance agreement. To show that the waiver was invalid, the appellant must show either that he did not violate the last chance agreement, that he did not enter into the last chance agreement voluntarily, or that the last chance agreement was a result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Lopez v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 461, 463-64 (1996). Under <span class="Italic">Lopez,</span> underlying the Board's ability to consider a last chance agreement, the underlying personnel action, the agency, and the employee must be within the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the Board does not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement that was not entered into the Board's record for enforcement purposes because of a lack of jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 583 (1994); <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586, 593-94 (1989) (administrative judges should first settle the matter of jurisdiction before accepting a settlement agreement into the record). The appellant requests that we examine the terms of the second settlement agreement, find that the agency has breached the agreement, and, rather than enforce the agreement, rescind the agreement and reinstate his appeal. This request is tantamount to a request for enforcement of the agreement. The Board, however, does not have the authority to act on the appellant's request because the agreement was not entered into the record for enforcement purposes<span class="Italic">. See Wexler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 513, 518 (1991) (where the appellant sought nullification of a settlement agreement on the basis that the agency had violated its terms, the Board considered the allegation of breach only after finding that the settlement agreement had been incorporated into the record for enforcement purposes), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 954 F.2d 733 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). As noted earlier, the administrative judge informed the parties that the settlement agreement could not be entered into the record for enforcement purposes until he first determined that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. To determine jurisdiction, the administrative judge would have had to examine the LCA in which the appellant waived his right to appeal to the Board. If the waiver was valid, then the Board would not have jurisdiction over the appeal. If the waiver was invalid, then the Board would have jurisdiction over the appeal<span class="Italic">. See McCall v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 839 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that the waiver of appeal rights was invalid, and that the Board, therefore, had jurisdiction over the appeal, the appellant would have had to show either that he did not violate the LCA, that he did not enter into the LCA voluntarily, or that the LCA was a result of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties decided not to pursue the question of whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. Instead, they decided to settle the appeal without entering the settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. Having so decided, the appellant cannot now ask the Board to review the settlement agreement to determine whether the agency has breached it. The Board can make that kind of review only when the settlement agreement has been entered into the record.[3] <span class="Italic">See Shaw</span>, 39 MSPR at 590-91.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant has the right to ask the Board to review the settlement agreement to determine whether it was invalid because it was not voluntary or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. See Wade</span>, 61 MSPR at 583. He did not do so. However, even if the appellant had asked for such review and had established that the agreement was invalid, he would then be faced with showing that the Board had jurisdiction over his appeal by establishing that the waiver of appeal rights in the LCA was invalid.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the Board to have jurisdiction related to a last chance agreement, assuming <span id="Page_4770"></span>nonfrivolous allegations of its breach, either the agreement must have been accepted by the Board for enforcement in the course of an appeal within the Board's jurisdiction (allowing the Board authority to review a claimed breach under its enforcement procedures), or the action taken under the agreement must be within the Board's jurisdiction. If neither condition is met, the Board does not have the authority to enforce the agreement or remedy its breach, <span class="Italic">Lumpkins v. VA</span>, AT-0752-13-0297-C-1 (NP 9/16/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this petition for enforcement, alleging that the agency breached a last chance settlement agreement (LCSA) by assigning him to the wrong position under the agreement and by failing to provide him with appropriate orientation and training for that position. Initially, the agency had proposed the appellant's removal but, pursuant to the LCSA, reassigned him to a lower-graded position. The agreement, however, was executed prior to the filing of any Board appeal and thus was not entered into the record for enforcement purposes. Soon thereafter, the appellant sought to vacate the LCSA through the Board's appeal process, arguing that he entered into the agreement under duress. The administrative judge found that he had voluntarily entered into the LCSA and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. On review, the Board affirmed the initial decision. The appellant now seeks to enforce the LCSA. The administrative judge dismissed this petition for enforcement based on lack of jurisdiction because he found that the appellant had never established the Board's jurisdiction over the underlying appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reviewed the appellant's arguments. The administrative judge, however, properly dismissed this petition for lack of jurisdiction. The administrative judge explained that the appellant offered no evidence and argument addressing the jurisdictional issue in response to his order to show cause, and that the Board may enforce a settlement agreement only when that agreement has been entered into the record for enforcement purposes. CID at 2 (citing <span class="Italic">Chapman v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 246, 249 (1995)). In addition, this petition for enforcement arose after the Board declined to find jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Lumpkins II</span> at 8. As a result, the only proper action the administrative judge could have taken was to dismiss the petition for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hunt v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 590, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2010). Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision.</p>
