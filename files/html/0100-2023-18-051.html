<p class="Block-Quote1">Hanh Do petitions for review of a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"). The Board sustained the Department of Housing and Urban Development's ("HUD's" or "agency's") action demoting and suspending Do. In its notice of proposed action, HUD charged Do with "negligence of duty" for hiring and later promoting an employee when Do knew that the employee did not have a college degree, which the agency viewed as a requirement. On appeal, the Board agreed with Do that a college degree was not required and that the employee could alternatively qualify for the positions by having a combination of education and experience. The Board, nonetheless, sustained the charge, concluding that Do was negligent because she failed to ensure that the employee met the alternative qualification requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that Do's due process rights were violated because the Board exceeded the scope of the agency's charge, relying on a new ground to sustain the discipline. We reverse and remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do has been a government employee since 1990. From 1990 to 1998, Do worked as an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service. In 1998, HUD Office of Inspector General ("OIG") hired Do as auditor in the Information Systems Audit Division. She was promoted to Assistant Director of that division and then to Director in 2003 and 2005, respectively. She held the position of Director until she was demoted on November 27, 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In November 2006, Do was responsible for selecting candidates for auditor positions in her division. Uyen Asuncion applied for a GS-11 auditor position in Do's division. At the time she applied, Asuncion was working as a GS-11 auditor at the Department of Justice ("DOJ"). Both on her resume and Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, Asuncion claimed she had a college degree in accounting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December 2006, a pre-employment background investigation revealed that Asuncion did not have a degree in accounting. Do was informed of this discrepancy and questioned Asuncion about it. It turned out that Asuncion was never awarded her degree because, even though she had completed the required coursework, her grade point average was not high enough for the university to confer the degree. Apparently, Asuncion needed to take one additional course to raise her grade point average to meet the minimum and obtain the degree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Asuncion told Do that she had made an honest mistake and believed that she had completed the requirements for her degree when she applied. Asuncion promised to complete an additional college course to secure her degree. After conferring with her supervisor, Do approved Asuncion's selection for the auditor position. At the same time, Do urged Asuncion to complete her degree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Over the next few years, Asuncion was promoted to a GS-12 auditor position and then to a GS-13 auditor position. In 2009, Do posted two GS-14 auditor positions (one of which was created with Asuncion in mind). Asuncion applied for one of the positions, and human resources flagged Asuncion "as a qualified candidate" and included her on a list of "eligible candidates" for the position. Do selected Asuncion for one of the positions. At that time, Do knew that Asuncion still did not have an accounting degree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2013 or 2014, Do consulted with her supervisor regarding Asuncion's lack of degree. After consulting with human resources, Do's supervisor advised Do that Asuncion could continue as an auditor but must obtain her degree. Asuncion resigned in March 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 20, 2016, HUD issued a notice of proposal to demote Do from the position of Director (GS-15) to Non-supervisory Senior Auditor (GS-14) and to suspend her for fourteen days for negligence of duty. The notice alleged that Do was negligent in hiring Asuncion in 2006 and promoting her in 2009 because a college degree was "required for the position[s]," and "Asuncion...admitted to [Do] that she did not have her degree." Do responded both in writing and orally to the agency. On November 9, 2016, after considering Do's submitted replies, the HUD deciding official issued a formal written decision, concluding that "demotion and suspension [we]re warranted and serve to promote the efficiency of the service." Do was demoted and suspended effective November 27, 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do timely appealed to the Board. After a hearing, the administrative judge sustained the agency's action. Do did not appeal to the full Board (which then lacked a quorum), and the administrative judge's decision became the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do petitioned for review in our court. We have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1) and 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9). In reviewing the Board's decision, we must affirm the decision unless it is "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 634 F.3d 1274, 1278 (Fed. Cir. 2011). "We 'must reverse a decision of the Board if it...is not in accordance with the requirements of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.'" <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1278 (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Blank v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1228 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, public employees possess a constitutionally protected property right in their employment and are entitled to pre-deprivation due process. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 538 (1985); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp</span>., 179 F.3d 1368, 1374-76 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("An employee is entitled to a certain amount of due process rights at each stage and, when these rights are undermined, the employee is entitled to relief regardless of the stage of the proceedings."). "The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to be heard." <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. at 546. As the Supreme Court stated in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, due process "requires some kind of hearing prior to the discharge of an employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 542 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Pre-termination due process is important because "[e]ven where the facts are clear, the appropriateness or necessity of the discharge may not be; in such cases, the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 543; <span class="Italic">see also Young v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Devel</span>., 706 F.3d 1372, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("[a]n employee is entitled to notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story before termination." (citing <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 2 Richard J. Pierce, Jr., Admin. Law Treatise &#x00A7; 9.5, p. 823 (5th ed. 2010) ("Notice is one of the most important procedural safeguards.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, not every disciplinary action requires pre-deprivation notice <span id="Page_3183"></span>and opportunity to be heard. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Homar</span>, 520 U.S. 924, 933 (1997), the Supreme Court held that a pre-disciplinary hearing was not required where the disciplinary action--suspension--was only temporary, and "the State ha[d] a significant interest in immediately suspending" an employee who had been arrested and charged with a felony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Do's case does not involve a termination, the government does not argue that demotions should be treated differently than terminations or that there was a need to take action quickly without advance notice and opportunity to be heard. In the past, this court has assumed in demotion cases that there is a right to pre-demotion notice and an opportunity to be heard. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nguyen v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 737 F.3d 711, 718 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Pope v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 114 F.3d 1144, 1148-49 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Ciambriello v. Cty. of Nassau</span>, 292 F.3d 307, 321 (2d Cir. 2002) (holding "that the process due [to the employee] was notice of the charges against him and the opportunity to be heard before demotion").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that, in the civil service system, "[o]nly the charge and specifications set out in the Notice may be used to justify punishment because due process requires that an employee be given notice of the charges against him in sufficient detail to allow the employee to make an informed reply." <span class="Italic">O'Keefe v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 318 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">see Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 147 F.3d 1367, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 526-27 (Fed. Cir. 1993). When an agency relies on a charge not included in the notice, due process is violated because the notice does not fully inform the employee of the grounds for the proposed removal and deprives the employee of an opportunity to make an informed response before the agency takes disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">See Brook</span>, 999 F.2d at 527; <span class="Italic">Pope</span>, 114 F.3d at 1148-49.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, the Board is limited to reviewing the grounds invoked by the agency and may not "substitute what it considers to be a better basis for removal than what was identified by the agency." <span class="Italic">O'Keefe</span>, 318 F.3d at 1315 (citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see James v. Dale</span>, 355 F.3d 1375, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Licausi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 350 F.3d 1359, 1363 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see also Horne v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 684 F.2d 155, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Licausi</span>, 350 F.3d at 1363). "Simply put, the Board should not be in the business of affirming administrative decisions based upon how an agency might have acted if it had followed proper procedures." <span class="Italic">Horne</span>, 684 F.2d at 157-58.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">O'Keefe</span>, we held that the Board violated an employee's due process rights when it sustained a removal based on alleged misconduct that appeared nowhere in the notice of proposed removal. 318 F.3d at 1315. "By accusing [the employee] of specific misdeeds that were not within the scope of the Notice of Proposed Removal, the Board...exceeded the scope of its review of the agency's decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as a general matter, when an agency disciplines an employee, it may do so based only on the charges in the notice of proposed action, and the Board, in turn, can affirm the disciplinary action based only on the charges actually noticed and relied on by the agency. The government does not dispute these general principles established by a long line of this court's cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These due process requirements were violated here. Do was issued a notice of proposal to demote and suspend. The notice alleged a single charge of "negligence of duty" and stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Charge: Negligence of Duty</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Specification #1</span>: In 2006 you were made aware by security personnel at the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (formerly the Bureau of the Public Debt) that during a pre-employment background investigation for Uyen Asuncion attendance at the University of Colorado--Boulder was confirmed but there was no record that Ms. Asuncion had received her <span class="Italic">Bachelor of Science degree which was required for the position</span> for which she was being considered. Ms. Asuncion also admitted to you that she did not have her degree; <span class="Italic">regardless she was hired for the position</span>. <span class="Italic">Specification #2</span>: In 2009, <span class="Italic">you created a GS-14 auditor position within your division for Ms. Asuncion knowing that she did not possess a Bachelor of Science degree as required for auditor positions with HUD OIG</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphases added). The notice further characterized the offense as "serious" because "[T]he fact Ms. Asuncion did not have a [college] degree calls into question all of the work Ms. Asuncion has completed on behalf of HUD OIG."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") sets forth minimum qualification requirements for positions in the federal competitive service. Contrary to the notice, a college degree was not required for these positions in 2006 or 2009. Under the OPM standard, there were two ways an individual could qualify for a GS-11 or GS-14 auditor position: (1) by having a degree in accounting or related field, <span class="Italic">or</span> (2) by having a specified combination of education and experience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. <span class="Italic">THE AGENCY PROCEEDINGS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As HUD contends, Do argued in her responses to the agency that a degree was not required for the auditor positions; that there was an alternative way to qualify; and that she believed Asuncion qualified for the positions under this alternative. But Do was not on notice that she needed to defend against a charge of negligence for allegedly failing to investigate whether Asuncion was qualified based on a combination of education and experience. The central issue was not Do's belief but whether her actions were negligent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Do did not have a meaningful opportunity to address the unstated charge of negligence of duty in this respect (i.e., whether Do should have taken other actions to verify compliance under the alternative standard). The deciding official appeared not to have addressed the issue of negligence in failing to investigate the alternative qualifications. In her formal decision, the deciding official appeared to instead address Do's contention that she believed that Asuncion was qualified under the education and experience standard, ultimately concluding that demotion and suspension were warranted because Do believed a degree was required and knew that Asuncion did not have a degree. The deciding official stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In conclusion, the information in the case file shows you repeatedly emphasized Ms. Asuncion's need to obtain a college degree, beginning with your obtaining a promise from Ms. Asuncion around the time of her hire to complete that degree. Your emphasis on obtaining the degree demonstrates that <span class="Italic">you believed</span>, on some level, <span class="Italic">Ms. Asuncion needed to possess a college degree</span> to qualify for the auditor position, yet you allowed her to continue working in that position and even promoted her to a higher level auditor position knowing she did not possess the degree. <span class="Italic">You demonstrated poor judgment, which continued over a number of years, with regard to the hiring and subsequent promotion of Ms. Asuncion. Your actions directly led to Ms. Asuncion working and supervising audits for nearly a decade without possessing a college degree</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">THE BOARD PROCEEDINGS</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although agreeing that a college degree was not required, the Board sustained the charge on a different ground than the ground relied on by the agency. The Board found that Asuncion did not meet OPM's requirements in 2006 or 2009 because she did not possess the requisite combination of education and experience that was an alternative basis for qualifying. The education and experience standard at issue here required that the applicant have (1) "at least 4 years of experience in accounting or an equivalent combination of accounting experience, college-level education, and training that provided professional accounting knowledge" and (2) "[t]wenty-four semester hours in accounting or auditing courses of appropriate type and quality[,] [which] can include up to 6 hours of business law." With respect to the 2006 hiring, the Board found that Asuncion did not have at least four years of accounting experience or the equivalent when she transferred from the DOJ to HUD OIG.[1] Even if this requirement were met, the Board further found that Asuncion did not have twenty-four semester hours in accounting because her transcript reflected only twenty-one semester hours in accounting.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Do had argued that Asuncion worked as a student trainee at HUD OIG's Denver, Colorado, office from March 2003 through January 2005, as an auditor at HUD OIG's Baltimore, Maryland, office from January 2005 through April 2006, and as an auditor at the DOJ from April 2006 until March 2007. Do argued that Asuncion's almost two years of experience working as a student trainee and her nearly two years of experience working as an auditor met the "at least 4 years of experience in accounting <span class="Italic">or an equivalent combination of accounting experience, college-level education, and training</span>."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Do had argued that a course titled "Accounting and Financial Analysis," which was worth four credits, was an accounting course on its face, and thus Asuncion had twenty-four semester hours in accounting courses. The Board acknowledged that, "[i]f the course was applicable, Ms. Asuncion would have had 25 hours of applicable coursework."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the 2009 promotion, the Board similarly rejected Do's arguments and found that Asuncion did not meet OPM's requirements in 2009 because, "while she had more years of experience at the time of her promotion, she still lacked a college degree and it was not established that she completed 24 hours of coursework as required by OPM's qualifications." Both for 2006 and 2009, the Board concluded that Do was guilty of "negligence of duty" because she did not determine that Asuncion met the required qualifications, and she could not rely on human resources or her supervisors without making an independent investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is inconsistent with the agency's charge and <span id="Page_3184"></span>supporting specifications. On appeal, the Board was required to limit its review to the grounds specified in the notice and relied on by the deciding official, namely, that a degree was required and that Do hired and later promoted Asuncion, knowing that Asuncion did not have a degree. <span class="Italic">See O'Keefe</span>, 318 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">Lachance</span>, 147 F.3d at 1371-72 (Where an agency "use[s] general charge labels such as 'unacceptable and inappropriate behavior' or 'misconduct,'" it "would be inconsistent with due process" to allow "an agency...to prove any conduct generally relating to the conduct described in the specification, as long as that conduct could be characterized as 'inappropriate' or 'misconduct.'"). But the Board sustained the disciplinary action because it concluded that Do negligently failed to investigate whether Asuncion met OPM's alternative requirements. The alternative theory relied on by the Board appears nowhere in the notice or in the deciding official's decision, and HUD conceded as much at oral argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, the magnitude of the procedural error is relevant to determining whether there has been a due process violation. As we have stated, not every "procedural defect [is] so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that it undermines the due process guarantee and entitles the claimant to an entirely new administrative proceeding." <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376-77.[3] But this is not a case where the departures are minor.[4] Rather, Do did not have the opportunity to meaningfully address negligence at the agency under the alternative standard for qualifying, and the Board's departure from the agency's decision was significant. Procedural due process guarantees are not met when the agency fails to give notice of and fails to consider the proper standard, and the Board, as it did here, departs significantly from the grounds relied on by the agency and substitutes its own alternative theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Mathews v. Eldridge</span>, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), balancing test takes account of the substantiality of the deprivation in determining whether an individual has been afforded procedural due process. 424 U.S. at 335, 340-42; <span class="Italic">Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pope</span>, 114 F.3d at 1148-49 (rejecting petitioner's argument "that his due process rights were violated because the charges lacked specificity regarding dates, times, and places" because "[T]he notice given to Mr. Pope [wa]s quite detailed and clearly informed him of the charges as well as the evidence the Postal Service had in support"); <span class="Italic">Brook</span>, 999 F.2d at 526-27 (rejecting due process challenge where the notice did not explicitly state the nexus between the employee's misconduct and the proposed disciplinary action, but "the notice fully informed Mr. Corrado of the grounds for the proposed removal [and]...clearly identified the details of Mr. Corrado's arrest and conviction"); <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1538 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (rejecting petitioner's due process challenge because, even though "[T]he specific date of the offense charged appear[ed] to have been a little off target," the notice said "on or about 22 January 1982" and "it [wa]s clear to us that petitioner knew what charge he had to defend").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">HUD argues that, if there was a due process violation, it was at most harmless error. Even if we applied a harmless error test here, we are convinced that the error is harmful. We fail to see how the Board's error could have been harmless. There is certainly no showing that the Board would have reached the same result if it had considered only the agency's original charge since the Board agreed that a college degree was not required. With respect to the agency, the government argues that the deciding official testified that she would have reached the same result absent the error. HUD, however, has not proven by a preponderance of evidence that the deciding official would have reached the same result if Do had been charged with negligence in determining Asuncion's qualifications under the correct standard. The deciding official's testimony that she believes she would have arrived at the same conclusion and imposed the same penalty under proper procedures is not sufficient to show that the due process violation in this case was harmless because the test for harmlessness is an objective one, not a subjective one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ryder v. United States</span>, the government argued that the decision should be affirmed despite the procedural defect in the employee's firing because he would have been removed on the merits in the absence of the procedural defect. 585 F.2d 482, 487-88 (Ct. Cl. 1978), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute as recognized in Adams v. Dep't of Transp., F.A.A</span>., 735 F.2d 488, 496 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Nies, J., concurring). The Court of Claims rejected this reasoning, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]here a serious procedural curtailment mars an adverse personnel action which deprives the employee of pay, the court has regularly taken the position that the defect divests the removal (or demotion) of legality....

Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, we rejected the government's argument that the due process violation "was harmless error" and "made absolutely no difference in the case because...the petitioner would have been removed in any event because of the evidence against him" and held that the violation there "tainted the investigation, voided the entire proceeding, and rendered [the] removal decision a nullity." 720 F.2d at 1273-74 (citing <span class="Italic">Ryder</span>, 585 F.2d 482). We also rejected as irrelevant a similar argument in <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, where the deciding official stated that he would have concluded that the employee should be removed "whether or not" the due process violation occurred. 179 F.3d at 1373.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's argument that we can sustain its removal action based on Gose's alleged violations of other statutory provisions. Agency action must be sustained, if at all, on the actual grounds relied on by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Burlington Truck Lines</span>, 371 U.S. at 168-69. The letter of decision clearly states as grounds for removal "violat[ion of] the employee standards of conduct for employees as expressed in the Employee and Labor Relations Manual (ELM) that forbid your drinking of intoxicating beverages in a public place while in uniform." Although other "catch-all" ELM provisions were mentioned in the proposal letter, they did not constitute the basis for the deciding official's action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's June 9, 1998 Notice of Proposed Removal stated that the action was being taken for "CONDUCT UNBECOMING OF A POSTAL MANAGER/CREATING A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT." The notice went on to set out 9 specific incidents in support of the charge, each with an approximate or an exact date on which the incident allegedly occurred. In the July 28, 1998 Letter of Decision, the deciding official stated generally that he had reviewed the appellant's statements, as well as "all the evidence of record," and found that all of the "charges" in the proposal letter were fully supported by the evidence. In its response file submitted before the AJ, the agency included a number of statements and notes of investigative interviews from the appellant's subordinates and other employees regarding the appellant's conduct. Some of the statements and notes dealt, at least in part, with the specific incidents with which the appellant was charged, and were from individuals who were directly involved in those alleged incidents and who testified at the Board hearing; others, however, clearly concerned alleged occurrences of <span id="Page_3185"></span>misconduct that were not referenced by the agency in its proposal letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the Board hearing, the deciding official testified that, in making his decision, he reviewed the aforementioned notes of the interviews, as well as the handwritten statements from employees. During his testimony, he continually referred to a "double-digit number of people," who were witnesses or who had made allegations against the appellant. When the appellant's attorney sought clarification by pointing out that it did not appear that there were a double-digit number of witnesses to the incidents set out in the proposal notice, the deciding official made it clear that he had considered all of the statements and interview notes in reaching his decision. He further admitted that he had not made any particular findings that the appellant had committed the specific acts of misconduct in the letter of proposed removal, but rather had based his decision that the appellant had created a hostile work environment on the weight of all of the evidence that he reviewed. In response to specific questions as to whether the statements and interview notes not involving incidents in the proposal notice had "influenced [his] determination that [the appellant] had committed [the charged] offenses," and whether they "also were important to him in [his] decision about what penalty to impose," the deciding official responded in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the deciding official's testimony, we find that the agency committed procedural error by considering reasons for its action that were not referenced in the proposal notice, in violation of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(f)<span class="Italic">. See Payne v. Department of the Army</span>, 6 MSPB 581, 6 MSPR 693, 696 (1981). Moreover, inasmuch as the deciding official admitted that his consideration of the incidents not mentioned in the proposal letter played a part in his decision to sustain the charge, and to impose the penalty of demotion and reassignment, we further find that the appellant has shown that the agency's procedural error substantially prejudiced his rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 681. Under these circumstances, pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A), we must REVERSE the agency's action.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Connor v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 653, 655-58 (1993), gave some idea of how strictly the Board can apply the rule calling for clear notice of charges. The proposal to remove the appellant recited that he was convicted of distributing marijuana. The removal notice, however, stated that the basis of the removal was distribution of the marijuana "for which...[he was] convicted and...[was] sentenced to a suspended imposition."The Board set the removal aside because the appellant was charged with conviction instead of being properly charged with distribution:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Advance written notice of the charges and an opportunity to reply before a final agency decision is made are fundamental procedural due process rights. <span class="Italic">See Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680-681 (1991); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 47 MSPR 50, 57 (1991). The failure to provide these rights in connection with the removal of a nonprobationary federal employee must result in the reversal of the removal action, regardless of the merits of the employee's claim. <span class="Italic">See Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 680-681. The agency's notice of proposed removal must provide the employee with the specific reasons for the proposed action, in sufficient detail to allow him to make an informed reply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">cf. Brown</span>, 47 MSPR at 57 (1991); <span class="Italic">Hartigan v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR 613, 618 (1989).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Hartigan</span>, the Board applied a harmful error analysis to the question of whether the appellant received proper notice of the charges against him. In <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 681-683, and 685, the Board clarified its harmful error standard. Citing 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)], the Board held that harmful error would be found only when the employee proves that the procedural error was likely to have had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. <span class="Italic">See Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 685. Nevertheless, although we do not apply the harmful error analysis in <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, <span class="Italic">Hartigan,</span> and other decisions issued before <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> to the current appeal, we have cited these decisions because they address the issue of what constitutes a proper notice of proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board will not technically construe the wording or specifications of a charge, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lockett v. U.S. Marine Corps</span>, 37 MSPR 427, 429 (1988), the Board cannot consider or sustain charges or specifications that are not included in the notice of a proposed adverse action, because the appellant must have had full notice of the charges against him. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 47 MSPR at 57 (applying harmful error standard); <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 499, 503 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 852 F.2d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table) (finding that the administrative judge correctly merged charges of insubordination and disrespect). Here, the agency's notice of proposed removal charged the appellant with having been convicted of distributing marijuana. The appellant was removed, however, because he had distributed marijuana, which conduct had resulted in his being convicted and being given a suspended imposition of sentence. Thus, while the notice of proposed removal relied on the appellant's purported conviction, the removal decision was based on the underlying conduct that led to the alleged conviction and suspended imposition of sentence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the circumstances of this appeal, we find that the appellant was not given proper advance notice of the charge for which he was removed. While we recognize that the distinction between being removed for a conviction for certain activity and being removed for the activity itself may appear slight, in the current appeal it is crucial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the notice of proposed removal, the appellant had no reason to think he was being removed for his conduct of distributing marijuana, as distinct from his conviction. This is especially true in light of the fact that the agency had been aware of his conduct for almost two years and had taken no action against him. In March 1989, the appellant voluntarily told his then-supervisor about his conduct. The agency not only retained the appellant, but gave him letters of appreciation after learning of his activities. It was not until the agency became aware of the appellant's purported "conviction" and of the public knowledge of it, that the agency took action against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in determining whether an employee has received adequate notice of a charge, the Board examines the employee's reply to see whether the employee defended against it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hartigan</span>, 39 MSPR at 618; <span class="Italic">Lockett</span>, 37 MSPR at 430. Here, the appellant's reply to the notice of proposed removal did not address the charge that he had distributed marijuana, but did address the charge set forth in the notice of proposed removal: that he had been convicted of distributing a controlled substance (marijuana). The appellant's reply is thus additional support for our finding that the appellant was not given advance written notice of the basis for his removal as set forth in the removal decision. Accordingly, we find that the removal action violated the appellant's right to minimum due process and must be reversed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 681.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AJ considers a charge that could have been, but was not, made by the agency, the AJ's error does not necessarily require reversal or remand on PFR. The question becomes whether the error of the AJ determined the outcome of the appeal, <span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 192, 196 n.2 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found nexus as to falsification of time and attendance documents. This was never charged against the appellants. The Board cannot rely on grounds not invoked by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Riley v. Department of the Army</span>, 53 MSPR 683, 688 (1992). Because the administrative judge's decision, however, rested on his disposition of the other charges, we find that this adjudicatory error is not outcome-determinative, and that it thus provides no occasion for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board experienced difficulty applying its harmful error test when there was a charge mentioned in a decision that did not appear in the proposal. A reviewing court apparently directed the Board to have the employing agency reconsider a penalty as a remedy for an adverse action decision that was based on reasons not stated in the proposal. In <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1991 NP No. 91-3106), the removal decision referenced "solicitation for murder," but this conduct or charge was not mentioned in the proposal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent McCullah considered the solicitation for murder charge in arriving at his decision to remove Dunbar, as his removal notice stated that he did, he erred. Under the circumstances of this case, this error cannot be considered harmless and the MSPB finding to the contrary is not in accordance with 7703(c)(2). The MSPB is directed to have the decision to remove redetermined based on the issues raised in the "Notification of Proposed Removal" and the record that would properly have been before the deciding official, and without any consideration of the allegation of solicitation for murder.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">To determine the conduct actually at issue, as opposed to conduct described as background or as an explanation of past discipline or warnings, the Board examines the charge and the prehearing submissions of the parties. <span class="Italic">Murray v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 260, 262-63 (1989).

<p class="Body-Text">Care must be taken to distinguish explanatory information in a decision letter from new charges. <span class="Italic">Hunger v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 107, 109, 2 MSPB 275 (1980), considered the allegation that the agency charges were not the same as the reasons relied on for removal, placing the appellant at a disadvantage in delivering the reply. The Board found that a reference contained in the decision letter was for purposes of explaining the agency response to a defense raised by the appellant rather than as a new charge. Because there was no showing of prejudice by the appellant and no showing that the agency would likely have reached a different conclusion in considering her response to the notice, there was no harmful error. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 676, 680 (1988) (that the agency may have considered the appellant's allegedly aberrant behavior is not a basis for setting the action aside when the evidence demonstrated that <span id="Page_3186"></span>the agency relied solely on the appellant's physical inability to perform her job as the basis for her removal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McJunckins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 3 MSPR 422, 423, 3 MSPB 496 (1980), reversed the decision of an AJ who sustained a removal based on an employee's handling of tax records after the agency failed to provide in the notice of charges a full quotation of the regulation it relied on to remove the appellant. The omitted portion contained language indicating that action against an employee had to be based on the employee's negligence or carelessness. The agency offered no evidence that the loss of the record in question was attributable to negligence. The Board concluded both that the AJ was misled by the incomplete reference to the regulations and that the agency failed to sustain its burden as to the culpability of the employee. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Owens v. USPS</span>, 18 MSPR 677, 679 (1984) (typo in a proposal notice incorrectly citing provisions of the ELRM was not harmful error when two days prior to the hearing the appellant received the correct portion of the manual); <span class="Italic">Previte v. SBA</span>, 11 MSPR 137, 140 (1982) (typo in a regulatory citation in the adverse action proposal and decision was not harmful error; as evidenced by their thorough defense to the charge, the appellant and counsel were aware of the proper citation forming the basis for the adverse action).</p>
