<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-14"><span class="space">e.</span> Distinguishing Oral Agreement and Ongoing or Incomplete Negotiation</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A problem with oral settlements is determining, during a continuing course of discussions among the parties and the AJ, when a full settlement is achieved. Some imaginative (or hopeful) AJs attempt to create the appearance of a settlement agreement by reciting in notices they send out to the parties the terms that the parties have apparently agreed to during the course of discussions with the AJ. From bits and pieces of conversations, the AJs attempt to fashion conclusive settlement agreements. When these "agreements" fall apart, the issue becomes whether a settlement agreement can be created by implication or estoppel. It is insufficient for an AJ to record the terms of an offer and then fail to record the acceptance of the offer. <span class="Italic">Kontogeorge v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 276, 279 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Quiring v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3470) (court remanded an appeal to the Board because the record contained no evidence of a settlement that the AJ said existed and the appellant said did not exist; the appellant claimed that the parties were only in negotiations and had come to no final settlement). The settlement terms should be definite. It will not do for one party to make general statements about settlement and for the AJ to close out the case when the other party makes a statement that it accepts the general terms expressed by the other party. The settlement terms should be specific; they should be mutual; and they should be understood by both parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Borden v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 595, 597-98 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boucher v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 40, 44 (1995), illustrates what occurs when an AJ fails to follow Board guidance concerning dismissals based upon inchoate settlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal without documenting for the record that the parties reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed whether or not it was to be enforceable by the Board<span class="Italic">. Parks v. Department of Defense</span>, 56 MSPR 74, 76 (1992); <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span> <span class="Italic">v. US Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 148-49 (1988). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson</span>, 41 MSPR at 680.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal pursuant to a settlement agreement, and stated that the agreement was not filed for the record. Other than the statement in her order that the parties had reached a settlement of the appeal, however, there is no record evidence documenting that the parties actually reached an oral or written agreement, understood its terms, and clearly agreed whether it was to be enforceable by the Board. The agency representative specifically denies that the parties ever reached a final settlement of the appeal. Although the appellant asserts that the parties reached a full settlement on February 14, 1995, the agreement he sent to the administrative judge on February 28, 1995, lacked the agency representative's signature evidencing its concurrence that a full settlement had been reached by the parties. Subsequent correspondence between the parties addressing specific terms of the agreement supports a finding that no final agreement was reached. Even after the initial decision was issued, the parties continued to correspond with one another about various terms of the agreement. These letters as well reflect that there were still portions of the agreement about which the parties had not reached an accord. While prudence dictates that the parties should have contacted the administrative judge directly to inform her of the state of affairs, the fact remains that the administrative judge had an insufficient basis upon which to dismiss the appeal as settled. <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span>, 37 MSPR at 149. Thus, remand is necessary. <span class="Italic">Panther v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 52 MSPR 419, 423 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Hyatt</span>, CB-7521-13-0186-T-1 (NP 3/24/2014), pointed out that discussions do not constitute a settlement when the parties contemplate that the appeal will only be settled through a written and signed agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that a settlement agreement has not been reached by the parties resolving this matter. Before an appeal will be dismissed as settled, the record must document that the parties reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed whether it was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Goulet v.

The Board will apply contract principles in determining whether a valid settlement agreement has been reached. <span class="Italic">Ryack v. Department of the Navy</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 294, 296 (1993). A written contract need not be signed to make an agreement binding. <span class="Italic">Mastrogiuseppe v. Department of the Interior</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1995). Rather, it is necessary only to show that the parties agreed to be bound. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The parties may agree, however, not to be bound until the agreement is signed by both parties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record demonstrates that the parties have not executed a valid settlement agreement resolving this matter. It is true that the petitioner provided the respondent with the terms of a proposed settlement agreement on November 5, 2013, and that the respondent signed the proposed settlement agreement within his period for acceptance. However, as evidenced by the petitioner's email correspondences with the respondent and the terms of the proposed settlement agreement, the petitioner did not intend to be bound until a settlement agreement was signed by both parties. <span class="Italic">See Mastrogiuseppe</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 254-55. Specifically, paragraph 17 of the proposed settlement agreement states in relevant part that "[t]he Parties, by affixed signatures, agree to the terms and conditions stipulated in this Settlement Agreement," which suggests that both parties needed to sign the settlement agreement before it would become effective. Because the petitioner has not signed the proposed settlement agreement, a valid settlement agreement is not presently before the Board in this matter. <span class="Italic">See Mastrogiuseppe</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 254-55.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When they are involved with oral settlement discussions, the parties should distinguish preliminary negotiations from actual settlements. It must be made clear whether the parties are talking about terms that they want to include in a written agreement that will constitute the settlement, whether the terms they are talking about constitute the actual settlement that will not be followed by a written agreement, or whether the terms discussed by the parties are a settlement that can be acted upon by the AJ but that will be followed by a written statement of those terms. The Federal Circuit noted that an AJ accepted, as an oral settlement, proposals and counterproposals discussed by the parties and recorded by the AJ. The discussion did not make a settlement because it was clear that some terms were left for development and it was also clear that the parties recognized that they were working toward a written settlement through their comments during the recorded conference. The conference was not a settlement; rather it was no more than a negotiating session, followed by a written settlement proposal that the appellant rejected. <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126, 1129 (Fed. Cir. 1991), <span class="Italic">rev'g</span> <span class="Italic">Mahboob v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is well-established than an oral settlement agreement is binding on the parties, particularly when the terms are memorialized into the record. <span class="Italic">See Goodwin v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thornton v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3437), provides an example of discussions, characterized and treated as a complete settlement, that still appeared to leave material terms open to negotiation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thornton served as a postal police officer. On December 5, 1996, the USPS removed him for sleeping at his post on two separate occasions. The USPS also considered three previous disciplinary actions in deciding to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thornton appealed his removal to the Board. At a hearing before the administrative judge on April 7, 1997, Mr. Thornton and the USPS agreed to settle his appeal. The transcript of the hearing indicates that, for a period of time, the hearing was off the record "for the purposes of engaging in settlement discussions." Back on record, the administrative judge stated that the parties had agreed to settle the case. Under the settlement agreement, Mr. Thornton agreed to retire and not to seek employment with the USPS in the future, and to withdraw his appeal and not to pursue other grievances against the USPS. In return, Mr. Thornton received, among other things, money compensation. (Other terms of the settlement agreement were not discussed on the record because the agreement was to be confidential.) Thereupon, Mr. Thornton's attorney reminded the administrative judge that the settlement agreement should require the USPS to provide only "neutral references" for Mr. Thornton, and the administrative judge responded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The neutral references. There may be some housekeeping details that you can add without materially effecting this. When you go back and start writing it and review your normal settlements, if it has that kind of language in it, you know, [Mr. Thornton's attorney] will consider. I don't think it is going to be deal killing, you know, but--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4759"></span>The administrative judge then asked the USPS, Mr. Thornton's attorney, and Mr. Thornton himself, whether they agreed to settle the case, and they all answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the hearing, but before the administrative judge issued an initial decision, the USPS sent a draft of the written settlement agreement to Mr. Thornton's attorney. Mr. Thornton's attorney requested that the written settlement agreement state, in the paragraph discussing references by the USPS for Mr. Thornton, that Mr. Thornton voluntarily retired from the agency. The USPS complied, and it sent Mr. Thornton's attorney a second, amended version of the written settlement agreement that the USPS's representatives had signed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thornton's attorney next sent Mr. Thornton the amended written settlement agreement and asked him to sign it. Instead of signing the written agreement, Mr. Thornton wrote the administrative judge directly and indicated that he refused to sign it. Mr. Thornton objected to the language stating that he had voluntarily retired. In addition, Mr. Thornton asserted that he wanted to return to his position with the USPS for four more years to gain service for retirement purposes, or that he should receive additional compensation for the four years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, the administrative judge entered the written settlement agreement into the record and dismissed Mr. Thornton's appeal. The administrative judge found that the parties had agreed to settle at the hearing. According to the administrative judge, "[t]he agency, with the cooperation of appellant's attorney, agreed to reduce the settlement to writing." The administrative judge held that Mr. Thornton's refusal to sign the written agreement was "directly contrary to the settlement agreed to by the parties at the hearing." Because the written agreement "accurately memorialized" the oral agreement from the hearing, the administrative judge "accept[ed] the agreement into the record" and dismissed Mr. Thornton's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thornton seeks to have the Board's decision entering the settlement agreement into the record overturned and his appeal reinstated. He contends, first, that because the hearing was conducted in Illinois, that state's law governs. Under Illinois state law, according to Mr. Thornton, because the agreement at the hearing was subject to further approval, the administrative judge erred in concluding that the parties had settled the case. Alternatively, Mr. Thornton argues that, under Federal Circuit precedent, his approval of the USPS's reduction to writing of the oral settlement agreement was a condition precedent. Mr. Thornton insists that the administrative judge's concern that there might have been "deal killing" issues is evidence of such a condition. Because Mr. Thornton refused to approve the written settlement agreement, that condition was not satisfied. Consequently, Mr. Thornton asserts, there was no settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contending that state law governs the interpretation of settlement agreements that fall under the Board's jurisdiction, Mr. Thornton is wrong. A settlement agreement is treated as a contract for purposes of interpretation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Greco v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). It is clear that we rely on our own precedent and general contract principles to interpret settlement agreements over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thornton's contention that parties' approval of a written recordation of an oral settlement agreement is a condition precedent for there to be a binding agreement would be new law. We refuse to mandate such a rule. Instead, the better standard is that the particular facts and circumstances of the case determine whether an oral settlement agreement, or, in the alternative, a subsequent written agreement, binds the parties. Under this standard, we see no error in the Board's decision that Mr. Thornton is bound by his approval of the oral agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 27 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts, entitled "Existence of Contract Where Written Memorial Is Contemplated," provides that "[m]anifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to conclude a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof." In this case, the administrative judge concluded, and we agree, that Mr. Thornton's assent to the oral settlement agreement bound him, and the intention of the parties to memorialize that oral agreement in writing does not deprive the oral agreement of binding affect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously considered circumstances like these. In <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), we reversed and remanded the Board's decision dismissing the petitioner's appeal because of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1130. We held that the petitioner and the agency had not reached a final settlement of the case during a telephonic conference. Of particular importance to our holding was the fact that the written agreement that the agency had prepared after the conference was "almost completely different from the terms discussed in the telephone conference." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1129. We concluded that "[t]here [was] no doubt that the [agency] intended that [the written agreement], and not the telephone conference conversation, would be the settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because there had been no oral agreement and because the petitioner had refused to sign the written agreement, there was no settlement. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1130.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Mr. Thornton had shown that the written agreement deviates in a material fashion from the oral agreement, then this case would be more on par with <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>. However, he has not so shown. Mr. Thornton raises two objections to the written agreement: first, he disapproves of the language concerning his voluntary retirement; and second, he wants to work for four more years. With respect to the former, Mr. Thornton's attorney requested this language, and it does not materially deviate from the oral agreement. With respect to the latter, as the administrative judge concluded, Mr. Thornton's desire to return to his job directly contradicts the oral agreement that the parties had reached.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also see no reason why Mr. Thornton should not be bound by the written settlement agreement, which accurately memorializes the oral agreement to which he affirmatively agreed. Although the administrative judge understood, in stating that there could be "deal killers," that the USPS could have prepared a written agreement that did not accurately record the parties' oral agreement, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, such is not true here. Were we to hold that an oral agreement is only binding if the parties approve a subsequent written agreement, we would discourage either oral settlements altogether or the use of written agreements to memorialize oral ones. Mr. Thornton has not advanced any persuasive reason for us to announce new law that would disrupt the process by which settlement accords are handled before the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Durham v. TVA</span>, 42 MSPR 480, 482-86 (1989), presents an example of advice of an oral settlement that broke down because the parties disagreed as to whether settlement occurred. The AJ undertook to resolve the dispute by requiring affidavits concerning the course and results of the settlement discussions. After reviewing those affidavits, the AJ decided the parties settled and entered into the record the agreement that they reached:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 11 and 12, 1989, the agency requested that the hearing be canceled and informed the administrative judge that the appellant had agreed to the terms of the settlement and that the only matter outstanding was to reduce the agreement to writing and obtain the parties' signatures. The administrative judge agreed to cancel the hearing because of the agency's assurances that the appeal was settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge had not received a copy of the written settlement agreement, he held a telephone conference with the parties on February 13, 1989. He advised the parties that, since he had not yet received the written settlement agreement, he must decide whether the parties had reached a binding oral agreement. The appellant's representative stated that he believed a binding agreement was reached on December 30 because the agency offered to reemploy the appellant in a specific position and that he accepted the offer on behalf of the appellant. The agency's representative agreed that the agency made such an offer and that the appellant accepted it on December 30, 1988. The administrative judge asked the parties to file affidavits addressing the issue of whether a binding settlement agreement had been reached and the terms agreed to, if any. The parties subsequently filed affidavits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that, based on the parties' affidavits, a binding settlement agreement had been reached and that the terms of the agreement were: (1) The appellant accepted the agency's offer of a 6-month, temporary position as a Technical Reports Writer, schedule 3-D3, step 8, base salary of $41,000.00 per year, at the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant; (2) although the appellant would be eligible for a renewal or extension of the appointment at the end of 6 months, the agency made no representations as to the likelihood of extensions; (3) the agency would allow the appellant to retain her severance pay; and (4) the appellant would withdraw her appeal before the Board. The administrative judge further found that the matters of attorney fees and the appellant's reemployment rights, although discussed by the parties, were not part of the settlement terms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge rejected the agency's argument, made for the first time during the February 13, 1989 telephone conference and in the agency's representative's affidavit, that no binding agreement existed because all of the details of the agreement were not resolved, the agreement was not reduced to writing, and the agreement was not signed by the parties. He found that the appellant's representative's affidavit contained the terms of a binding and enforceable agreement. He further found that telephone conferences with the parties and conversations with the agency's representative persuaded him that the parties orally agreed to those terms and that the terms were binding on the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also determined that it was not a failure by the parties to agree on "details" that prevented the parties from filing a signed, written agreement with the Board, but that the agency in late January 1989, changed its policy and determined that a senior vice-president's <span id="Page_4760"></span>written approval was needed to establish the Technical Reports Writer position that was offered to the appellant. The administrative judge found that this condition, imposed after the parties reached an agreement, did not negate the finality of the oral agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge finally found that the oral agreement outlined in the initial decision met the criteria for inclusion in the appellate record, and entered it into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency filed a petition for review asserting that while settlement discussions were ongoing and a preliminary agreement concept had been reached, there were issues which remained unresolved and that no binding settlement had been reached by the parties. The appellant responded asserting that the parties had reached a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that the parties' representations that a settlement has been reached is an act of finality which establishes the existence of a settlement, and failure to submit a written agreement does not negate the existence of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Laranang and Rogers v. Department of the Navy,</span> 40 MSPR 233, 236-37 (1989); <span class="Italic">Young v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 315, 318 (1987). <span class="Italic">See also Autera v. Robinson,</span> 419 F.2d 1197 (D.C. Cir. 1969) (lawsuits may be compromised by oral contract); <span class="Italic">Vari-O-Matic Machine Corporation v. N.Y. Sew. Mach. Attach. Corp.</span>, 629 F. Supp. 257, 259 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (parties' oral representations to the court that a settlement agreement was reached were binding despite the failure to complete formal settlement papers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the record evidence shows that the parties, on more than one occasion, informed the administrative judge that they had orally settled the appeal. We therefore find that the parties in this appeal did reach a binding oral agreement to settle this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's subsequent initiation of a new procedure requiring a senior vice-president's approval to fill the Technical Reports Writer position does not negate the finality of the oral agreement. The agency's representative apparently did not know of this condition at the time the offer was made; nor did the appellant know of the condition at the time she accepted the offer, and the agency cannot now modify the oral agreement. <span class="Italic">See Caffrey Farms, Inc. v. Williams Pipe Line Company,</span> 739 F.2d 1366, 1368 (8th Cir. 1984) (one party to a contract cannot alter its terms without assent of the other; the minds of the parties must meet as to the proposed modification).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency alleges that the issue of the appellant's reemployment rights is an unresolved issue and that the administrative judge erred in finding that those rights were not part of the settlement terms. The agency contends that the appellant requested enhanced reemployment rights, not merely information regarding those rights as found by the administrative judge, and requested that those rights be set out in any settlement agreement. The appellant has stated that she expressed her concern regarding her reemployment rights during the settlement discussions and requested information regarding those rights, but that she did not request enhanced rights. Further, the record evidence establishes that the agency, on at least 4 occasions, represented to the administrative judge that the parties reached an oral agreement to settle the appeal and that the only matter outstanding was to reduce the agreement to writing. Thus, the agency cannot now assert that unresolved issues prevented settlement. <span class="Italic">See also Collett v. Department of Transportation</span>, 38 MSPR 128, 130-31 (1988) (appellant's bare assertion that terms of the settlement agreement were different from those he agreed to in discussions with his attorney was insufficient to set aside the agreement), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 868 F.2d 1278 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also alleges that the issue of attorney fees is an unresolved issue and that the administrative judge erred in finding that the issue of attorney fees was not part of the settlement agreement rather than that it prevented settlement. The agency contends that the appellant believes that the settlement agreement allows her to petition the Board for attorney fees, but that its representative had no authority to agree to the payment of attorney fees nor was she authorized to enter into an agreement that would not specifically preclude such payment. Again, the agency's allegations do not refute the fact that a settlement was entered into.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is true that an attorney may not settle his client's case without having express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority, absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Collett v. Department of Transportation,</span> 38 MSPR at 130; <span class="Italic">Fairchilde v. Department of Interior</span>, 36 MSPR 586, 588 (1988). A party asserting that such authority is lacking carries a heavy burden which cannot be met by conclusory statements. <span class="Italic">See Rose v. Department of the Army</span>, 33 MSPR 430, 434-35 (1988), citing <span class="Italic">Surety Insurance Co. of California v. Williams</span>, 729 F.2d 581, 583 (8th Cir. 1984). The agency has presented no evidence of the asserted lack of authority of its representative and such representative repeatedly informed the administrative judge that the appeal was settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency, relying on <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Navy,</span> 37 MSPR 132 (1988), alleges that the settlement agreement never became final since the appellant did not formally withdraw her appeal. In <span class="Italic">Smith,</span> the parties informed the administrative judge that the appeal had been settled and the administrative judge canceled the hearing. Later the same day, the appellant informed the administrative judge that he was having "second thoughts" about the settlement agreement and did not agree with the specific terms of the written settlement agreement prepared by the agency and requested that the appeal be adjudicated. The administrative judge denied his request and dismissed the appeal as settled. The Board found that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal as settled and found that absent a formal withdrawal of an appeal, and until the parties have agreed to the specific terms of a settlement agreement, the act of finality constituting a settlement has not occurred. In this case, however, the parties informed the administrative judge that the appeal had been settled and that the only matter outstanding prior to dismissal was reducing the agreement to writing. At no time, did either party represent to the administrative judge that there was not an agreement. We therefore find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Smith.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency alleges that the administrative judge erred in entering the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that before the Board will enforce a settlement agreement, the settlement itself must be made a part of the record, and in admitting such an agreement into the record, the administrative judge must be satisfied that the agreement is lawful on its face and was freely entered into by the parties. <span class="Italic">See Richardson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Environmental Protection Agency,</span> 5 MSPR at 250.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the parties requested during the December 30, 1988 telephone conference that the settlement agreement be included in the record for enforcement purposes. The administrative judge set out the terms of the oral agreement in the initial decision based on the parties' affidavits and his telephone conferences with the parties on December 30, 1988, and February 13, 1989, and his conversations with the agency's representative on January 11 and 12, 1989. The Board has held that it will be presumed that the administrative judge accurately recorded the terms of the settlement agreement and that the parties agreed on the terms before dismissing the appeal on the basis of the settlement agreement. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence showing that the administrative judge did not properly record the agreement or that the parties did not consent. <span class="Italic">See Robertson v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 37 MSPR 512 (1988). The agency has failed to present evidence that the administrative judge improperly set out the terms of the agreement. The administrative judge's orders summarizing the telephone conferences were served on the agency and the agency not only never contended that the orders inaccurately summarized the conferences, but continued to advise the administrative judge that the parties had settled the appeal and that the only matter outstanding was to reduce the agreement to writing. The agency never represented to the administrative judge or the appellant that the parties had not agreed on the terms or that there were unresolved issues preventing settlement. Thus, the administrative judge properly found that the agreement, as outlined in the initial decision, met the criteria for inclusion in the appellate record and properly entered it into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 624, 629-30 (1991), an oral settlement was not clearly conditioned on the provision of a subsequent and controlling written settlement. The AJ accepted the oral agreement and the parties did not timely submit a written agreement that might have varied the terms of the oral agreement. As a result, the oral agreement bound the parties. In <span class="Italic">Nixon</span>, the Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), involving an appeal that should not have been dismissed on the basis of preliminary settlement discussions, recorded by the AJ, that clearly contemplated a later written agreement as the operative settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As we have stated, the reduction of the settlement agreement to writing was not necessary, according to the terms set forth by the administrative judge in the taped recording and in his Order and Summary of Proceedings. Rather, the recording and the order, <span class="Italic">id</span>., specifically contemplated that the parties might be unable to reduce their agreement and the "side agreement" to written form. We find that there was no express requirement for the appellant to affix his signature to any specific documents in order for the one contingency to be removed by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the terms of the ''side agreement," the agency was to issue a "clarifying letter" to the addressees of the notice of debarment regarding the settlement. Not only did the agency agree to do so, but it submitted to the Board a copy of the letter to be issued. A problem was created when the agency made the issuance of this letter contingent upon the appellant's signing a March 27, 1990 memorandum. However, this "additional" contingency is not a basis for finding that there is no agreement in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4761"></span>In summary, we find that the parties reached an oral, contingent settlement agreement on March 26, 1990, and that the agency removed the one contingency to settlement on March 27, 1990. Because the parties did not submit a written version of the agreement within the time allotted by the administrative judge, the oral agreement became the parties' final settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Department of the Navy,</span> 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991), in several respects. First, the parties in <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span> raised certain general considerations in their oral discussion, which clearly remained to be ironed out in specific form in a later, written agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1128-29. Next, in <span class="Italic">Mahboob,</span> as in this case, the agency prepared a written settlement agreement after the oral conference between the parties had been held. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1129. In the instant case, however, unlike in <span class="Italic">Mahboob,</span> the administrative judge specifically stated on the record that the parties could reduce their agreement to writing if they chose to do so, but that if they did net submit a written version by a date certain, then the oral settlement agreement would become final (upon the removal of the contingency). Finally, unlike the situation presented in <span class="Italic">Mahboob,</span> the written version of the settlement agreement the agency proffered in this case did not contain "various new terms of settlement that were not even mentioned in the telephone conference." <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span> at 1129.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal <span class="Italic">Nixon</span> was affirmed, <span class="Italic">Nixon v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3167):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is no basis in the record to support Nixon's contention that the oral agreement taped on March 26, 1990 is unenforceable because it was not replaced by a written memorial. The circumstances of this case are wholly apart from those in <span class="Italic">Mahboob v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, this Court concluded that no settlement agreement had been reached when it was clear that not all the terms were agreed orally and that parties would not be bound until a written contract was signed. Unlike <span class="Italic">Mahboob</span>, Nixon and the Navy orally agreed to a settlement contract, subject to a single condition. On March 27, 1990, the single condition to that contract was removed, at which time the parties were informed of the opportunity, should they wish, to replace the oral contract with a writing. Absent a written agreement, however, the parties were on notice that they were bound by the oral contract taped at the settlement conference of March 26, 1990.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To avoid some difficulties reflected by these decisions, practitioners should preface emails or telephone conversations about settlement, or even discussions of offers in mediation or with AJs, with the statement that the discussions are exchanges are tentative, for settlement purposes only, and the case is not settled without a written and signed agreement.</p>
