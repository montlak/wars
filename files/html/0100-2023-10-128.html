<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Elections or eligibility for dues allotment</span>. To request:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)(i) An election to determine whether employees in an appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, and/or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(ii)&#x2003;A determination of eligibility for dues allotment in an appropriate unit without an exclusive representative; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An election to determine whether employees in a unit no longer wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;Petitions under this subsection must be accompanied by an appropriate showing of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Clarification or amendment.</span> To clarify, and/or amend:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Consolidation.</span> To consolidate two or more units, with or without an election, in an agency where a labor organization is the exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2422.2 Who may file a petition?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An individual; a labor organization; two or more labor organizations acting as a joint-petitioner; an individual acting on behalf of any employee(s); an agency or activity; or a combination of the above may file a representation petition. But,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Only a labor organization may file a petition under &#x00A7; 2422.1(a)(1);</p>
