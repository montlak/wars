<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-49"><span class="space">j.</span> Error or Lack of Authority of Appellant's Counsel or Union Representative--<span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Bona Fide</span></span> Challenge to Agreement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A petition for review is used to challenge the validity of a settlement agreement, including an unfiled agreement, that is allegedly invalid for lack of an attorney's authority to settle. Under <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 101 MSPR 258, 265, 267-68 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18, 2006 MSPB 43 (2006), if there is some evidence suggesting that the attorney lacked authority to settle, the appeal may be remanded to the region for development and analysis of evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement, regardless of whether it was been entered into the record for enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 11 (2000). If the settlement is invalid, the Board may set aside the agreement and adjudicate the merits of the appellant's underlying appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that her former attorney did not have authority to settle her mixed case. An appellant is bound by the actions of her designated representative where the representative accepts a settlement agreement on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 160, 163 (1991). A settlement agreement is not invalid merely <span id="Page_4818"></span>because the settlement agreement is oral and the appellant did not participate in the negotiations or was not present when the settlement was accepted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> While an attorney may not settle her client's appeal without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 162-63.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, in support of her claim that her "previous attorney and the agency entered into a settlement agreement without her knowledge or concurrence to settle the mixed case," submits letters from her former attorney, Ms. Nicks, dated May 13, 2005, and July 20, 2005. Ms. Nicks's May 13, 2005 letter states that the appellant "was unwilling to go forward with the settlement as she was not aware that it included both cases (MSPB &#x0026; EEO)." Thus, this letter appears to support the appellant's claim that she did not authorize her attorney to accept the settlement. However, the subsequent longer letter from Ms. Nicks dated July 20, 2005, states that the appellant was indecisive during December 2004 and gave conflicting instructions from one week to the next as to whether to enter into a settlement agreement. The July 20, 2005 letter explains that, after Ms. Nicks accepted the settlement on December 28, 2004, the appellant informed Ms. Nicks that she had been "under...doctor's care and taking heaving medication during the period she advised [Ms. Nicks] to settle the case on her behalf" and the appellant claimed that she did not understand that the agreement would resolve "both the MSPB and EEO case." Thus, despite Ms. Nicks's May 13, 2005 letter stating that that appellant "was unwilling to go forward with the settlement," it is possible that Ms. Nicks may have been authorized to enter into the settlement on the appellant's behalf on December 28, 2004, but the appellant merely misunderstood the consequences of the settlement. Under these circumstances, we find it appropriate to remand to determine whether the appellant's attorney was authorized to settle her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ford v.

We note, however, that if the appellant voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement, but merely misunderstood the consequences of that acceptance, her unilateral misunderstanding of the consequences of accepting the settlement would not be a basis for setting aside the settlement. <span class="Italic">See Virgil v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 109, 113-14 (1997) (the appellant's unilateral mistake as to the scope of a particular provision of a settlement agreement was not a sufficient basis for the Board to set aside the agreement); <span class="Italic">DeBoever v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 182, 185 (1994) (the failure of the appellant and his representative "to realize the full implications of a settlement agreement is insufficient to set the agreement aside"), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 47 F.3d 1180 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 616, 622 (1990) ("The inadequate exchange of information between the appellant and his attorney, without more, does not provide a basis for setting aside the agreement or for making its terms unenforceable. The appellant was responsible for the actions of his designated attorney, and therefore must suffer the consequences of any deficiencies in representation.") (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The standard is demanding of the appellant who seeks to set an agreement aside for lack of counsel's authority to settle. "In asserting that their attorney lacked the authority to settle their cases...appellants carry a heavy burden which cannot be met merely by conclusory statements." <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 236 (1989) (citing <span class="Italic">Fairchilde v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 36 MSPR 586, 588 (1988)). But the standard is occasionally met. The Board determined that an attorney who allegedly settled a case for the appellant either did not have the authority to enter into settlement or did not enter into the settlement that the agency contended had been made. The appellant's evidence on the question of authority of counsel and the nonoccurrence of settlement was unrebutted. <span class="Italic">Hofmann v. USDA</span>, 42 MSPR 453, 457 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disclaiming any change in the law governing the binding nature of settlements reached by representatives, the Board remanded a case for a determination of whether the appellant's representative was authorized to settle his client's appeal. Of concern was the appellant's claim that his representative provided no information to him concerning settlement negotiations or the resultant agreement; information from the appeal suggested that the appellant may have been suffering a mental impairment, <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270, 273-74 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has consistently held that, while an attorney may not settle his client's case without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Kowalczyk v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 621 (1990); <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 235 (1989); <span class="Italic">Fairchilde v. Department of the Interior</span>, 36 MSPR 586, 588 (1988). An appellant who asserts that his representative lacked such authority carries a heavy burden which cannot be met merely by conclusory statements. <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk</span>, 44 MSPR at 621; <span class="Italic">Laranang</span>, 40 MSPR at 236; <span class="Italic">Fairchilde</span>, 36 MSPR at 588.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's allegations, even if true, do not meet this burden of proof because he has not claimed that his representative was not authorized to settle his case, only that he was not aware of and did not consent to a particular settlement agreement. Moreover, he did not make his allegations in the form of an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1746. <span class="Italic">Cf. Vincent v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 263, 268-69 (1987) (the administrative judge erred in relying on statements in an agency's response to a petition for enforcement, where those statements were not supported by evidence or affidavits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the petition for review falls short of the proof required to set aside the settlement agreement, we believe a remand is warranted to determine whether the appellant's representative was authorized to settle the case. First, unlike the case in <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk, Laranang</span>, and <span class="Italic">Fairchilde</span>, there is no evidence here that the appellant was even aware of the existence of settlement negotiations between his representative and the agency representative, and he has affirmatively disclaimed any knowledge of the settlement agreement signed by his representative. In his Dissenting Opinion, Member Amador contends that this distinction is immaterial, citing to <span class="Italic">Montoya v. United States Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 317 (1989). In <span class="Italic">Montoya</span>, however, as in the three cases previously cited, there was evidence that the appellant was aware of on-going settlement negotiations between his representative and the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The absence of such evidence in the present case is at least consistent with the appellant's claim that his representative lacked settlement authority, a significant and material distinction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we note that the appellant was separated from his position because of his alleged mental and emotional instability, and that he is proceeding without a representative on review. The fact that an unrepresented appellant may have significant mental impairments is a legitimate factor to consider in deciding whether to exercise the Board's discretionary authority to remand for further findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these considerations, we think it appropriate to give the appellant the opportunity to present evidence to establish that his representative did not have express authority to settle his appeal. In affording this opportunity, we neither change nor waive the presumption, stated previously, that an appellant's representative of record has the authority to settle his client's case. Nor do we imply any lessening of the heavy burden necessary to rebut such presumption. Instead, we merely exercise our discretionary authority under 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.116-.117 to reopen an appeal and remand it the regional office for further fact-finding.</p>

USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 294, 296-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7 (1999), concluding that an attorney does not have the right, by virtue of his general retainer only, to compromise his client's claim, and that an appellant may rebut the presumption that his representative had authority to settle his appeal by an unequivocal denial that he ever authorized a settlement without his assent to its terms:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement, even where it has not been entered into the record for enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">See Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 61 MSPR 580, 583 (1994). Here, as noted above, the appellant contends that the agreement is invalid because her representative lacked authority to settle her appeal. While an attorney may not settle his client's case without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority, absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Crayton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 62 MSPR 497, 500 (1994); <span class="Italic">Ford v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 61 MSPR 270, 273 (1994).

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 346, 350 (1996); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 243-44 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that, on March 5, 1998, she received from her then representative, Q. Byrum Hurst, a copy of the agency's settlement proposal. She states that she faxed Hurst a counterproposal, which he sent to the agency on March 10, 1998. The appellant further asserts <span id="Page_4819"></span>that, on May 8, 1998, her husband received a telephone call from Hurst's secretary indicating that he needed to have her sign a settlement agreement. She states that she refused to sign the agreement because she did not agree to its terms. In addition, the appellant asserts that she expressly told Hurst that she would not agree to the settlement agreement unless certain terms, including provisions relating to payment of compensatory damages and attorney fees by the agency, were included therein. The record reflects that Hurst understood that these terms represented his client's wishes. Further, the appellant alleges that Hurst never communicated with her after forwarding to her a copy of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's assertions are more than merely conclusory. They are detailed allegations that her representative did not enter into the agreement with her consent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 69 MSPR 469, 471-72 (1996), (Member Amador, dissenting).

<p class="Body-Text">The Board showed some flexibility as it remanded a case for a determination of whether the appellant authorized her counsel to settle in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 69 MSPR 469, 471-75 (1996), a decision that carried divergent views in majority and dissenting opinions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from her GS-7 health technician position, finding that she had deliberately falsified an official document, wantonly disregarded directives, and failed to honor valid debts or legal obligations. After receiving her timely appeal, the administrative judge scheduled a prehearing telephone conference for July 28, 1995. The appellant did not personally participate in the conference, although her attorney did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her memorandum summarizing the conference, the administrative judge stated that the parties had agreed to settle the appeal. Among other things, the settlement agreement provided that the agency would rescind the removal, and that the appellant would instead resign, and would agree to never apply for another job with the United States Government. Subsequently, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal pursuant to the appellant's withdrawal of it, as set forth in the settlement agreement. In her decision, she noted that neither party had contacted her regarding her summary of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her timely petition for review, the appellant, who is now acting <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, states that she has released her attorney, 0. Wayne Ellerbee, as counsel. She asserts that the terms of the settlement are unacceptable to her, and that she had advised Ellerbee of this before he entered into the agreement. She further contends that she has been unable to reach Ellerbee, and that he has not informed her that an agreement had been reached, or what its terms were. With her petition for review, the appellant encloses a copy of a letter she sent to the administrative judge. She also encloses a letter to Ellerbee, in which she dismisses him as her attorney because he entered into the settlement agreement after she told him that the terms incorporated in it would be unacceptable to her. The agency has responded to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an attorney may not settle his client's case without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Ford v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270, 273 (1994). An appellant who asserts that her representative lacked such authority carries a heavy burden which cannot be met by merely conclusory statements. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Here, the appellant submits unsworn statements that she did not agree to the settlement, that she had previously informed Ellerbee that she did not agree to such a settlement, that he failed to inform her of the settlement, and that she has fired him. She further contends that she would expect any representative to contact her before agreeing to a settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's allegations are unsworn, they are insufficient to meet her burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Amin v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Nevertheless, we find that the appellant has established that her appeal should be remanded to determine whether Ellerbee had the actual authority to enter into the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Ford</span>, 61 MSPR at 273-74. The appellant asserts that she had expressly told him that she would not agree to the settlement. Her assertions are more than merely conclusory. They are detailed allegations that Ellerbee did not enter into the agreement with her consent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we note that an attorney does not have the right, by virtue of his general retainer only, to compromise his client's claim. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Beebe</span>, 180 U.S. 343, 351, 21 S. Ct. 371, 374, 45 L. Ed. 563 (1901); <span class="Italic">Michaud v. Michaud</span>, 932 F.2d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1991). Although there is a presumption that an attorney has the authority to settle a case, the appellant may rebut this presumption by an unequivocal denial that she ever authorized a settlement without her assent to its terms. <span class="Italic">See Matzo v. Postmaster General</span>, 685 F. Supp. 260, 262 (D.D.C. 1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 861 F.2d 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the appellant in <span class="Italic">Ford v. Department of the Air Force</span>, a case in which we remanded an appeal to determine whether an attorney had the authority to enter into a settlement agreement, the appellant here claims that the agreement was entered into without her knowledge and consent, and that she first learned about it after it was made. In addition, and in contrast to <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, the appellant here contends that she had specifically advised Ellerbee that certain terms, which he then agreed to, were unacceptable to her. Thus, although the appellant here does not claim the mental and emotional instability which were present in <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 61 MSPR at 274, the facts here are at least as strong as those in <span class="Italic">Ford</span> in favor of a remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, in other past decisions in which we declined to set aside a settlement agreement, the appellants contended that they were not adequately informed of the settlement, whereas the appellant here argues that she had not given her attorney the authority to enter into the agreement on her behalf. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616 (1990); <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233 (1989). Nor is there evidence, as there was in another decision in which we found a settlement agreement valid, that the appellant's then-attorney expressly stated during the prehearing conference that he had the authority to settle the case for the appellant, that the appellant understood the terms of the settlement agreement, that she entered into it voluntarily, and that she wished it to be entered into the record. <span class="Italic">See Hoyos v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 63 MSPR 532, 534 (1994). Further, unlike the attorney in <span class="Italic">Hoyos</span>, after entering into the settlement agreement the attorney here did no further work for the appellant, and apparently did not even have any additional contact with her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, in <span class="Italic">Fairchilde v. Department of the Interior</span>, 36 MSPR 586 (1988), another decision finding that an appeal was properly dismissed as settled, we noted that the appellant admitted that he had entered into settlement negotiations, and was aware when a tentative settlement was reached. These factors are not present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, considering the appellant's current <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, the lack of evidence showing that she was aware that her unsworn statements would be insufficient, and all of the above circumstances, we find that it is appropriate to remand the appeal for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Ford</span>, 61 MSPR at 274.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISSENTING OPINION OF ANTONIO C. AMADOR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I dissent. I believe that the Board should deny the appellant's petition for review and her request to set aside the settlement agreement. For the reasons set forth in my dissent in <span class="Italic">Ford v. Department of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 270, 275-77 (1994), as well as the fact that this case is clearly distinguishable from the factors relied upon by the majority in <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, the appellant in this case is bound by her representative's acceptance of the July 28/August 4 agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority in <span class="Italic">Ford</span> cited two grounds for its decision to remand. First, the fact that there was no evidence that the appellant in that case "was even aware of the existence of settlement negotiations between his representative and the agency representative." <span class="Italic">Ford</span> at 274. In this case, by contrast, the appellant has not denied awareness of such negotiations, nor that she had authorized her attorney to negotiate a settlement. Moreover, although the appellant in this case maintains that <span class="Italic">her attorney</span> never informed her that an agreement had been reached nor provided details with regard to this agreement, she has not "affirmatively disclaimed any knowledge of the settlement agreement signed by [her] representative," <span class="Italic">Ford</span> at 274, nor has she denied timely receipt of the administrative judge's July 28, 1995 summary of the agreement (which included certificate of service to the appellant at her home address), which provided her with ample opportunity to object to the terms of the agreement prior to the issuance of the initial decision dismissing her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other "factor" for the remand in <span class="Italic">Ford</span> was the evidence that the appellant was unrepresented <span class="Italic">and</span> "may have significant mental impairments." <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, at 274. Although the appellant in this case is presently unrepresented, there is no claim or evidence indicating that she has any mental impairments, "significant" or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the majority decision states that the appellant's petition for review statements, including that she "had previously advised my counsel that I would be unable to accept the terms reflected in this case and not voice my strong objections to them," are "detailed claims that she <span id="Page_4820"></span>didn't enter into the agreement with her consent." Actually, if one looks at this statement objectively, one must conclude that, if this discussion with her counsel took place before the settlement agreement was signed, then the appellant <span class="Italic">was aware</span> that her representative was engaged in negotiations with the agency. <span class="Italic">See Montoya v. US Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 317 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf. Ford</span> at 274.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alternatively, it is possible that the discussion took place after the representative agreed to the settlement terms at the July 28 prehearing conference, perhaps even after the administrative judge dismissed the appeal based on the settlement provisions (with "previously" referring to the time period prior to her filing of her petition for review with the Board). In such case, the appellant is bound by her representative's action in entering into an agreement, and an inadequate exchange of information between an appellant and her attorney does not constitute a basis for overturning an agreement. <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 621-22 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although I have noted how this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, there is one similarity: in both cases, the appellant expressed a willingness to renegotiate the settlement agreement and specified modifications to the agreement. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, it is clear that the appellant's petition for review was generated by her dissatisfaction with the settlement agreement, and the Board should respect its precedents and bind the appellant by her representative's action in entering into the settlement agreement on her behalf.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caracciolo v. OPM</span>, 86 MSPR 601, 604 &#x00B6; 5 (2000) ("[a]n attorney does not have the right, by virtue of his general retainer only, to compromise his client's claim.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Howell v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 249, 255-56 &#x00B6; 21 (2000), attempted and failed to make sense of an exchange of amended drafts, apparently unsworn representations by an agency representative, terse statements in prehearing orders, and other confusion resulting from attempts to guess the meaning of documents--all in an effort to determine whether the appellant authorized a settlement signed by his representative and disavowed by the appellant. The Board sent the case back to the region for additional evidence--the type of evidence that the AJ should have insisted upon when the dispute was first heard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We remand this case with instructions to the administrative judge to allow the parties and Ms. Schick to supplement the record with affidavits or statements under penalty of perjury regarding what authority Ms. Schick had to enter into a settlement agreement on the appellant's behalf and when she had such authority. If the administrative judge believes that testimony is required, she shall exercise her discretion to convene a hearing limited to the issues that she finds warrant testimony. After providing the parties and Ms. Schick with an opportunity to supplement the record, the administrative judge shall issue a new initial decision dismissing the case as settled if she finds that Ms. Schick had the authority to enter into the agreement on the appellant's behalf and to agree to the terms set forth in the agreement. If the administrative judge finds that Ms. Schick lacked such authority, she shall declare the agreement void....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant who can clearly disavow representation may be able to avoid an unauthorized settlement. In <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 160, 162-63 (1991), the appellant asserted, and the Board agreed, that the individual who entered a settlement did not do so as the appellant's representative. As a result, a factual issue needed to be resolved as to the binding nature of the agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an attorney may not settle his client's appeal without express authority to do so, the attorney of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 621 (1990). An appellant is bound by the actions of his designated representative where the representative accepts a settlement agreement on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">Montoya v. United States Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 317 (1989). The fact that the settlement agreement is oral and that the appellant did not participate in the negotiations or is not present when the settlement is accepted does not invalidate a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laranang v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 MSPR 233, 236 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant's orally designated representative, Warren Brown, did not participate in the teleconference in which the appeal was settled. A review of the tape recording of that teleconference reveals that the administrative judge noted that the appellant was represented by "Mr. Meade sitting in for Mr. Brown."... The record contains no designation of Mr. Meade as the appellant's representative or any indication of the relationship between Mr. Meade and Mr. Brown. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.31. Because it is not clear whether the representative who entered into the settlement agreement was designated by the appellant, we decline to apply the usual presumption of express authority to settle an appeal. A representative does not possess the inherent authority to settle by virtue of his general power to handle the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft v. Department of Interior</span>, 46 MSPR 594, 598 n.3 (1991). The appellant raises a question of the authority that he delegated to Mr. Brown and Mr. Meade that can best be answered by additional submissions and a hearing, if necessary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wildowsky v. VA</span>, 72 MSPR 298, 301-03 (1996), presents another example of a remand requiring an AJ to determine the actual settlement authority of a union representative, who filled in for the designated representative, to negotiate an oral settlement that the appellant, not party to the settlement conference, disclaimed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While a duly designated representative may not settle an appeal without express authority from the appellant to do so, a representative is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary.... An appellant who asserts that her representative lacked such authority carries a heavy burden which cannot be met by merely conclusory statements. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 69 MSPR 469, 471 (1996); <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 61 MSPR at 273. Here, the appellant submits on review unsworn statements that she did not agree to the settlement, that her designated representative below failed to inform her of the settlement, and that she never designated the individual who settled her appeal to act on her behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant does not make her allegations in the form of an affidavit or sworn statement under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1746, we find that they are insufficient to meet her burden of proving that her designated representative below lacked the authority to settle her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Amin v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 951 F.2d 1247, 1254 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Ford</span>, 61 MSPR at 273. Nevertheless, we find that, based on her assertions, which are more than merely conclusory, and the evidence of record, she has shown that her appeal should be remanded to determine whether McGehee had the authority to enter into the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 69 MSPR at 472-73; <span class="Italic">see also Crowell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 585, 587 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the appellant nor her designated representative below, Loyd, participated in the teleconference in which the appeal was settled. A review of the tape recording of the teleconference indicates that McGehee informed the administrative judge that Loyd was "temporarily incapacitated"; that McGehee would be the appellant's representative "for the purpose of this telephone call"; and that he had "the authority to settle the appeal on the appellant's behalf."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the fact that the settlement agreement is oral and that the appellant did not participate in the negotiations or was not present when the settlement was accepted does not invalidate the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 160, 162-63 (1991). However, although McGehee identified himself during the teleconference as the president of the same local chapter of the union of which Loyd is the chief steward, the record contains no written designation of McGehee as the appellant's representative. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.31; <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, 52 MSPR at 162-63. The appellant claims that the agreement was entered into without her knowledge and consent, and it appears that she is alleging that she did not learn of the agreement until after it was made. Because it is also not clear whether the representative who entered into the settlement agreement was designated by the appellant, we decline to apply the usual presumption of express authority to settle an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 69 MSPR at 472. A representative does not possess the inherent authority to settle by virtue of his general power to handle the appeal<span class="Italic">. See Moore</span>, 52 MSPR at 163.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant's arguments on review raise another unresolved matter, <span class="Italic">viz.</span>, whether Loyd had the authority to delegate his representative powers to McGehee. Generally, under basic agency law principles, an agent may not delegate his functions to someone else without the knowledge or consent of the principal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Annapolis Emergency Hospital Ass'n.</span>, 561 F.2d 524, 532-33 (4th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Moriarty v. Glueckert Funeral Home</span>, <span class="Italic">Ltd.</span>, 925 F. Supp. 1389, 1393-97 (N.D. Ill. 1996); Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 17, 18, 77-78, 81 (1958) (an agent may delegate "incidental mechanical or ministerial acts," but not duties requiring a "special skill," an "exercise of discretion," or "personal performance"). An agent, however, has apparent authority if the principal, through words or conduct, creates a reasonable impression that the agent has been granted the authority to perform certain acts. <span class="Italic">See Damian Services</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v. PLC Services, Inc.</span>, 763 F. Supp. 369, 372-73 (N.D. Ill. 1991). Furthermore, a principal may ratify an agent's action if she gives effect to it by word or deed which suggests that she had originally authorized it. Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 82 (1958).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear, based on the record before us, whether the appellant conferred upon Loyd the actual or apparent authority to delegate his representational powers to McGehee, or that an "unforeseen contingency" arose that made it impracticable for Loyd to communicate with the appellant that it was "reasonably necessary" for him to appoint McGehee to protect her interests. Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 79(d) (1958). Therefore, we find that a remand is necessary for further proceedings and fact-findings to resolve these issues. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anetsberger v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.</span>, 14 F.3d 1226, 1234 (7th Cir. 1994) ("[t]he existence and scope of an agency relationship are questions of fact, unless the parties' relationship is so clear as to be undisputed"); <span class="Italic">Moriarty</span>, 925 F. Supp. at 1397.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times it can be difficult to determine the extent of authority of a <span id="Page_4821"></span>representative when a settlement is accepted as the disposition of the appeal and the appellant later asserts that a different settlement was reached and that the first settlement could not serve to terminate the appeal. <span class="Italic">DeLoach v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 108 MSPR 485, 486-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-12, 2008 MSPB 78 (2008), remanded an appeal under those circumstances, with discussion concerning the authority of a representative to settle without the appellant's signature:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has submitted the settlement agreement that had been the subject of negotiations on August 29, 2007. The circumstances surrounding this document, however, are unknown because there is no mention of the document or any settlement negotiations in the record, except for the administrative judge's statement that the appellant had "rejected the oral agreement that was reached on August 29, 2007."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The submitted settlement and the administrative judge's statement, however, raise the question of whether the parties had, in fact, reached a binding settlement. The administrative judge's statement implies that the parties reached an oral agreement. If so, and if the parties did not require that the agreement be memorialized in writing, the appellant's post-settlement dissatisfaction with the agreement would not be sufficient to set the settlement aside. <span class="Italic">See Tiburzi v. Department of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">West v. Department of the Army</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6; 10 (2004). Because, however, neither the fact of an agreement nor the terms of an agreement were read into the record, and the administrative judge and the parties have proceeded as if there were no settlement agreement, we are unable to determine whether the parties, in fact, reached a valid oral settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The written settlement submitted on review also raises the question of whether it constitutes a valid settlement, either because it memorializes the oral settlement discussed above or because it is, by itself, a valid settlement. That document was signed by the appellant's representative and the agency's representative, but was not signed by the appellant. Indeed, the administrative judge had noted that the appellant had "rejected" the oral settlement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, however, the absence of an appellant's signature will not, standing alone, invalidate a settlement agreement where the appellant's representative has authority to enter into a settlement agreement on the appellant's behalf. <span class="Italic">See Howell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 5 (2000); <span class="Italic">Walker v. Department of the Navy</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 600, 603 n.2 (1989). While a representative may not settle his client's case without express authority for this action, a representative of record is presumed to have this authority, absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Howell</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Franklin v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 294, &#x00B6; 5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's designation of representative specifically addressed settlement authority. In naming his representative, the appellant acknowledged that he understood that his representative was authorized to act on his behalf and that he specifically delegated to his representative the authority to settle the appeal on his behalf. This delegation form also informed the appellant that any limitation on this settlement authority must be filed in writing with the Board. The appellant, however, did not subsequently limit his representative's settlement authority in writing, as required. Thus, the appellant's representative had authority to enter into a settlement on the appellant's behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement agreement also addresses the question of whether the appellant's signature was required for it to become effective. The settlement's first term states that the agency would convert the appellant's removal to a resignation for personal reasons, effective the date of the appellant's removal, and that the "appellant's signature on this agreement or that of his representative constitutes his resignation from employment with the agency." The second term provides that the appellant agrees to immediately withdraw his Board appeal, and it similarly states that the appellant's signature on the agreement or that of his representative constitutes his withdrawal of the appeal. Thus, the terms of the agreement suggest that the appellant's representative's signature was sufficient to make the settlement effective, regardless of whether the appellant also signed the agreement. These terms distinguish the present case from precedent finding settlements invalid because they specifically stated that the signatures of all the parties were required, and some of the required signatures were absent. <span class="Italic">See Mastrogiuseppe v. Department of the Interior</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Howell</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the settlement further states that the parties read and fully understood the agreement, that the appellant agreed that he entered into the settlement voluntarily after being fully apprised of his rights by his representative, and that the appellant acknowledged that the settlement was not the product of duress, deception, or coercion on anyone's part, including his representative. These terms, however, do not require the appellant's signature or otherwise limit the previous terms that convert the appellant's removal to a resignation and require the appellant to withdraw his appeal effective upon his representative's signature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also recognize that events transpiring after a purported settlement agreement can cast doubt on its validity. <span class="Italic">See Mahboob v. Department of the Navy</span>, 928 F.2d 1126, 1129 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Howell</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 10. Here, the administrative judge stated that the appellant rejected the oral agreement, and neither party objected to the administrative judge's order stating that the appellant rejected the settlement or otherwise raised this matter in a subsequent filing. These circumstances raise the possibility that the parties did not intend any agreement to be effective until the appellant signed the written agreement, or that the appellant indicated during negotiations that he would not agree to the settlement before the representatives executed the agreement. If the agency representative were aware that the appellant had rejected the proposed settlement before execution, the agreement would be invalid despite the signature of both representatives because the agency representative would have known that the appellant's representative lacked actual or apparent authority to settle. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Agency &#x00A7; 166 (1958); <span class="Italic">see also Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 4 (2000); <span class="Italic">Wesselhoft v. Department of the Interior</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 594, 596-98 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that questions exist whether the written settlement was within the scope of the appellant's representative's authority and therefore valid, and whether the appellant has mere post-settlement remorse that does not provide a basis for setting aside a valid settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Henson v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 10 (2000); <span class="Italic">Howell</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 249, &#x00B6; 19; <span class="Italic">Satterfield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 132, &#x00B6; 7 (1998). Because the existence and scope of a representative's authority to enter into a settlement are questions of fact, remand is necessary for further proceedings and fact findings to resolve this issue if the parties did not reach a binding oral agreement prior to the execution of the written agreement. <span class="Italic">See Wildowsky v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 298, 303 (1996).</p>
