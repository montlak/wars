<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-154"><span class="space">3.</span> Challenge to Admission of Testimony, Exhibits, Briefs</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator's limitation on the submission of evidence does not, by itself, demonstrate that the arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing, <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 31</span>, 60 FLRA 479, 481 (2004), "[a]n award will be found deficient...when it is established that an arbitrator's refusal to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or other actions in conducting the proceeding, prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 50 FLRA 236, 238-39 (1995); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard and FEMTC Local 127</span>, 53 FLRA 390, 397 (1997) (same). FLRA will grant exceptions if it appears that the petitioner was not <span id="page_1930"></span>provided a fair hearing because the arbitrator's challenged rulings precluded consideration of all the pertinent and material evidence, but there must be some proof of harm, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3369 and SSA, New York Region</span>, 55 FLRA 1074, 1076 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when it determines that an arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence or by other actions which prejudice a party and affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1668 and U.S. Department of the Air Force,</span> <span class="Italic">Elmendorf Air Force Base, Anchorage, Alaska,</span> 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator prejudiced the Union or affected the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.&#x2003;The Union claims that the restriction on the time to present its case imposed by the Arbitrator prevented it from questioning witnesses, but does not explain what the testimony would have been, its relevance or how its omission affected the proceedings as a whole. Similarly, the Union has not disclosed the nature of the documents it was precluded from introducing into evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Concerning the assertion that an arbitrator unduly limited the scope of evidence admitted to support an allegation of racial discrimination or hostile environment, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3828 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, CCC San Antonio</span>, 66 FLRA 504, 505 (2012), determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the merits of these arguments, the Arbitrator excluded witness testimony and exhibits concerning incidents occurring outside the grievance period because they were "too remote." The fact that the Arbitrator limited the submission of exhibits and witness testimony does not, by itself, demonstrate that the arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">See PTO</span>, 60 FLRA at 879. Moreover, the Arbitrator's limitation did not preclude the Union from submitting evidence that demonstrated a continuous pattern of racially discriminatory behavior by the supervisor during the grievance period. In addition, the Union cites nothing that required the Arbitrator to provide advance notice of his decision to consider only evidence that related to the grievance period. Accordingly, the Union's arguments do not provide a basis for finding that the Arbitrator denied it a fair hearing in these regards.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 4044 and DOJ, FCT Three Rivers, Texas</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v57/57-027.html">57 FLRA 98</a>, 100 (2001) (unsubstantiated allegations--those lacking reference to evidence in record or transcript--cannot establish denial of a fair hearing); <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med. Ctr. and NAGE Local R5-136</span>, 57 FLRA 72, 74 (2001) ("[T]he Agency's arguments that the Arbitrator improperly <span class="Italic">weighed</span> evidence do not demonstrate that he refused to <span class="Italic">hear</span> evidence and, thus, do not demonstrate that the Arbitrator denied the Agency a fair hearing."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corpus Christi Army Depot and AFGE Local 2142</span>, 56 FLRA 1057, 1073 (2001) ("[T]he Agency does not describe the information that it would have hoped to elicit, its relevance, or how its omission prejudiced the hearing.

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to accept into the record Agency exhibits relating to prior suspensions, its Table of Penalties, and written evidence used by the deciding official, the Agency does not establish that the Arbitrator refused to hear or consider this evidence. Instead, the record shows that the Arbitrator ruled that the Agency should present its relevant exhibits into evidence as needed in conjunction with a witness's testimony, but that the Agency failed to do so. That the Agency did not introduce this evidence does not establish that the Arbitrator denied the Agency a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Limitations on testimony will not ordinarily furnish grounds for setting aside an award. An award is not deficient because an arbitrator decided to permit a witness to give a statement without cross-examination.

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims the award is contrary to Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence because the Arbitrator improperly certified a certain witness as an expert and relied on his testimony.&#x2003;However, the Authority has long held that the Federal Rules of Evidence are not applicable to arbitration hearings and awards. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Explosive Ordinance Disposal Tech. Div., Indian Head, Md.</span>, 56 FLRA 280, 287 (2000). As such, even if the Arbitrator's certification of the witness as an expert and reliance on his testimony violate the Federal Rules of Evidence, that would not render the award deficient. Moreover, under longstanding Authority precedent, "[t]he liberal admission of testimony and evidence by an arbitrator is a permissible practice." <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3495</span>, 60 FLRA at 512 (citing<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 22</span>, 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996)).

<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the Arbitrator found that the Agency based the grievant's discipline on the statements of one witness who was not an eyewitness and whose statement was based on what she learned from others. With respect to another Agency eyewitness, the Arbitrator found that her statement was "far from complete as to exactly what happened." Further, the Arbitrator found that neither of these witnesses were able to testify as to what either the grievant or the patient said and their testimony was in conflict regarding the grievant's actions during the incident; the Agency does not dispute these findings. Having observed the witnesses and examined the evidence, the Arbitrator credited the grievant's testimony--over that of the Agency's witnesses--that he walked away from the patient. Specifically, the Arbitrator credited the grievant's testimony that: the patient repeatedly spoke to the grievant and called him a racial slur; the patient accused the grievant of belonging to a gang; and the grievant "simply kept walking" and did not respond to the patient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertions take issue with the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence. As set forth above, disagreements with an arbitrator's findings of fact and evaluation of the evidence and testimony, including the credibility of witnesses and the weight given their testimony, do not establish that an award is deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3295,</span> 51 FLRA at 32. Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator did not fail to conduct a fair hearing and deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award will not be vacated because the arbitrator based his award on statements (in lieu of evidence) in a posthearing brief if the party filing exceptions fails to identify specific facts or findings of the arbitrator that were not based on record evidence. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv. and Nat'l Weather Serv.

<p class="noindent-1">We construe the Union's assertion that the Arbitrator improperly considered information included in the Agency's brief to the Arbitrator after the close of the hearing as a contention that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing. The Authority will find an arbitration award deficient if it is established that the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by, for example, refusing to consider pertinent and material evidence....&#8197;Here, the Union alleges, in effect, that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by considering additional information introduced by the Agency after the hearing. However, the Union had the opportunity to respond to the information as evidenced by its motion to the Arbitrator to strike the information. Further, the Union has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator considered the information in making his award, or, even if he had considered the information, that the Union was prejudiced as a result.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In that regard, we reject the Union's argument that the award is deficient under [<span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS, Atl.

In <span class="Italic">OEA</span> we did not establish a requirement that an arbitrator make such a statement in order for us to find that an award is not deficient. Rather, we merely noted that an arbitrator specifically informed an agency that he had not relied on a disputed <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication and on that basis we concluded that the award was not deficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 31 FLRA at 94. In this case, we find that the absence of such a statement by the Arbitrator does not mean that he considered information that was not properly introduced into evidence. Therefore, we conclude that the Union has not demonstrated that it was denied a fair hearing in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 65 FLRA 806, 807-08 (2011), declined to set aside an award when the arbitrator, allegedly in violation of the code of professional conduct for arbitrators, considered a brief from the union that was not served on the agency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Award is Not Contrary to Law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FMCS has developed a set of standards for professional behavior of arbitrators.&#x2003;Arbitrators must meet the FMCS's standards to be listed on its roster of arbitrators. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1404.4.

<p class="noindent-1">The FMCS, however, has no authority to regulate arbitrators' actions. <span class="Italic">See </span>29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1404.4(d). Its regulations only set standards for arbitrators who want to be included on the roster. As relevant here, the only consequence for an arbitrator of not following the FMCS's regulations or the Code of Professional Responsibility is possible removal from the FMCS roster. Therefore, the cited FMCS regulations do not constitute a general restriction on arbitrators' authority and discretion with respect to arbitration proceedings. Consequently, that the Arbitrator may not have adhered to &#x00A7; 1404.4 and the Code of Professional Responsibility is not a basis for finding that the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Cf. Veterans Admin., Leavenworth, Kan., </span>34 FLRA 898, 902 (1990) (holding that Code of Professional Responsibility "is a privately developed set of standards for professional behavior and...is not a law, rule, or regulation...on which exceptions to an arbitration award can be predicated" (citations omitted)).

<p class="noindent-1">The only ground on which the Agency claims that it was denied a fair hearing is that it was "improperly deprived of its right to review, respond, or...clarify any factual errors or new evidence that may have been contained" in the Union's brief. The Agency, however, does not provide any evidence that it had such a right to file a rebuttal brief in this case. Moreover, it is undisputed that the Agency has not attempted to obtain a copy of the Union's brief to ascertain whether there would have been any need, in its view, to file such a rebuttal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Agency has not shown that the Union's failure to serve a copy of its brief on the Agency prejudiced the Agency's ability to fully and completely present its position before the Arbitrator. The Agency's belief that it may have been prejudiced, without more, does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator denied the Agency a fair hearing by considering the Union's brief. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's fair hearing exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Randolph AFB and AFGE Local 1840</span>, 45 FLRA 727, 733-35 (1992), noted of a party's concerns about an arbitrator's treatment of a case and briefing:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when: (1) the award was procured by fraud, corruption, or undue means; (2) there was partiality or corruption on the part of the arbitrator; or (3) the arbitrator was guilty of misconduct by which the rights of any party were prejudiced. For example, <span class="Italic">Ft. Polk</span>, 44 FLRA at 1561. In <span class="Italic">National Gallery of Art and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, Local 1831, 39 FLRA 226, 233-34 (1991) (National Gallery of Art), we reviewed the standards applied by the Federal courts when a party seeks to have an arbitration award vacated on this ground. We noted that the courts review the record to ascertain whether the arbitrator's conduct destroyed the fundamental fairness of the process and that the courts require the party challenging the award to prove specific facts indicating impropriety. We further noted that the courts have found awards deficient on this basis when: (1) a reasonable person would conclude that the arbitrator was partial; (2) the circumstances are powerfully suggestive of bias; or (3) the evidence of impropriety is direct, definite, and capable of demonstration. <span class="Italic">National Gallery of Art</span>, 39 FLRA at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that no basis is provided for finding the award deficient.&#x2003;We agree with the Agency that the complimenting of an Agency witness and the issuing of the award a month after the postmarking of briefs fails to demonstrate that the award was procured by fraud, corruption, or undue means; or that there was partiality or corruption on the part of the Arbitrator; or that the Arbitrator was guilty of misconduct by which the rights of any party were prejudiced under any of the tests commonly applied by Federal courts in private sector labor relations cases. <span class="Italic">See Ft. Polk</span>, 44 FLRA at 1562. In our view, the Union has failed to establish any impropriety that destroyed the fairness of the arbitration proceedings. <span class="Italic">See National Gallery of Art</span>, 39 FLRA at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although FLRA did not characterize the arbitration process as unfair, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 35 FLRA 417, 420 (1990), found FLRA ruling that when an arbitrator raised and tentatively decided an issue in a case and then provided the parties a deadline to submit their briefs on that issue, the arbitrator erred by issuing his decision on the issue prior before the deadline, depriving a party of an opportunity to file and have its submission considered:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no basis on which to conclude that the Arbitrator was required to provide the parties with an opportunity to submit information concerning his tentative decision.&#x2003;Having done so, however, we find that the Arbitrator limited his authority to issue a final decision before the time limit for receipt of that information had expired. That is, the Arbitrator was required to observe the limitations he placed on his authority to resolve the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that the Arbitrator did not observe the self-imposed limitations on his authority. Accordingly, we conclude that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority and that the addendum to his tentative decision is deficient. We will, therefore, remand this matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator....</p>
