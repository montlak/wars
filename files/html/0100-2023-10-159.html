<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-160"><span class="space">2.</span> Equivalent Status Rule; Access and Solicitation by Rival Unions</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7116:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this chapter, it shall be an unfair labor practice for an agency--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization, other than to furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other labor organizations having equivalent status[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Neither the regulation nor the statute defines when a union achieves "equivalent status." The status is of importance to a union that seeks to becomes the exclusive representative through an election. A union that acquires "equivalent status" to an incumbent union may be granted the use of facilities by an agency without a breach of required neutrality by that agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">The acquisition of "equivalent status" was explained in <span class="Italic">DODDS, Panama and Educ. Ass'n of Panama, Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 44 FLRA 419, 421-25 (1992), stating that a "petitioning union acquires equivalent status with an incumbent at such time as the Regional Director determines, and notifies the appropriate parties, that a notice of the petition will be posted":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the ARD [Acting Regional Director], EAP contended, as relevant here, that it achieved equivalent status with PCFT on January 3, 1991, the date on which it filed the representation petition. Accordingly, EAP argued that, as of that date, it should have been granted access to bulletin boards in various locations as well as the Activity's internal mail system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ARD agreed with EAP.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Citing</span> <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 2 FLRA 360 (1979) (<span class="Italic">DOT</span>) and <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, United States Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 9 FLRA 253 (1982) (INS), <span class="Italic">reversed in part</span>, <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. FLRA</span>, 727 F.2d 481 (5th Cir. 1984), the ARD determined that "[a] labor organization acquires equivalent status when it has raised a question concerning representation by filing a representation petition or becoming an intervenor in such a pending representation petition." <span class="Italic">Citing</span> <span class="Italic">United States Department of Defense, Department of the Army, United States Army Air Defense Center and Fort Bliss, Fort Bliss, Texas</span>, 29 FLRA 362 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Fort Bliss</span>), the ARD further determined that "EAP acquired equivalent status when it filed the petition and was thereafter entitled under [s]ection 7116(a)(3) of the Statute to the same and customary and routine services and facilities that DoDDS had granted to the incumbent Union, PCFT." Based on these findings, the ARD sustained EAP's objection to the election and directed that the election be set aside and another be conducted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">PCFT argues that its application for review should be granted because the ARD's decision departs from Authority precedent. We disagree and conclude, instead, that there is an absence of Authority precedent on the issue of when a petitioning union acquires equivalent status, within the meaning of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute, so as to be entitled to be furnished customary and routine facilities and services. In this regard, we find misplaced the ARD's and EAP's reliance on <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, <span class="Italic">INS</span> and <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss</span> to support the conclusion that a petitioning union acquires equivalent status on the date it files a representation petition. In <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, the issue was whether the agency was required under section 19(a)(3) of Executive Order 11491, as amended, to provide certain facilities and services to a union that had not filed a representation petition and did not have equivalent status. <span class="Italic">DOT</span>, 2 FLRA at 368-69. In <span class="Italic">INS</span>, the issue concerned the nature of the facilities and services required to be furnished under section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 9 FLRA at 300. Finally, <span class="Italic">Fort Bliss</span> concerned the issue of whether an agency was required to furnish a labor organization which had equivalent status with an incumbent union with the exact same services and facilities that the incumbent obtained through collective bargaining<span class="Italic">. Fort Bliss</span>, 29 FLRA at 365-66.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In none of these cases did the Authority address the issue of when a petitioning union acquires equivalent status.&#x2003;Accordingly, as no case in which such issue was addressed has been cited or is apparent to us, we conclude that there is an absence of Authority precedent on this issue and we grant PCFT's application for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that although section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute refers to "labor organizations having equivalent status[,]" and although the legislative history of the Statute contains an example of equivalent status, the Statute does not define that term. Consistent with the plain wording of section 7116(a)(3), our task is to determine when, for the purposes of that section, two or more unions have the same status under the Statute. In the case before us, one of those unions is an incumbent exclusive representative. Accordingly, the question is when, or how, a petitioning union acquires a status which is equivalent to that of an incumbent for the purposes of section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7111 of the Statute sets forth the process by which unions are certified as exclusive representatives.&#x2003;As relevant here, under that section, a union seeking exclusive recognition must file with the Authority a petition alleging that 30 percent of the employees in an appropriate unit wish to be represented by the union. Section 7111(f) provides that exclusive recognition may not be accorded a union if, among other things, there is not credible evidence that at least 30 percent of the employees in the relevant unit wish to be represented by the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7111(b) provides that the Authority shall investigate a representation petition and, if there is reasonable cause to believe that a question concerning representation exists, shall provide an opportunity for a hearing or supervise and conduct an election. In conducting such investigation, the appropriate Regional Director determines, among other things, the adequacy of a showing of interest. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.2(f)(1) [now 2422.9(b)]. After the Regional Director determines that a petition establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest, the Regional Director so notifies the affected activity and requests the activity to post copies of a notice of petition in certain places and furnish the Regional Director a current list of employees included in or excluded from the unit described in the petition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.4; <span class="Italic">Office of the General Counsel Representation Case Handling Manual</span>, Section 205.051 (March 1983). A party may challenge the validity of a showing of interest and/or may intervene by filing its challenge or intervention with the Regional Director within 10 days after the posting. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.2(f)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear from the foregoing that certain statutory and regulatory requirements are applicable to representation petitions.&#x2003;It is clear also that such petitions must be investigated to determine whether the requirements have been satisfied. As such, we are not persuaded that the mere filing of a representation petition automatically confers on the filing party a status equivalent to that of an incumbent. Instead, we conclude that a petitioning union acquires equivalent status for the purposes of section 7116(a)(3) when an appropriate Regional Director determines, and notifies the parties, that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing <span id="page_147"></span>of interest and merits further processing. Therefore, consistent with the Authority's Rules and Regulations, we conclude that a petitioning union acquires equivalent status with an incumbent at such time as the Regional Director determines, and notifies the appropriate parties, that a notice of the petition will be posted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this approach protects the rights of all parties. It protects the rights of an incumbent union by assuring that a petitioning union will not have access to an agency's facilities and services for campaign purposes based on a facially invalid petition or showing of interest. We note that, consistent with section 205.025 of the <span class="Italic">General Counsel Case Handling Manual</span>, "[a]ll authorization material must be checked <span class="Italic">completely</span> in determining the existence of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest." (Emphasis in original). As such, this approach would not, as alleged by PCFT with respect to the principle applied by the ARD, "encourage labor organizations to file frivolous representation petitions without an adequate showing of interest in the hope of gaining equivalent status and organizing at the expense of incumbent labor organizations." At the same time, this approach assures a petitioning union that it will be furnished with customary and routine facilities and services at the same time--when notices are posted--that unit employees are made aware of a petition and are, therefore, likely also to be aware of the relative status of a petitioner and an incumbent. Finally, this approach enables agencies and activities easily to determine whether a labor organization is entitled, on request, to be furnished facilities and services under section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, when a petitioning union achieves "equivalent status" with an incumbent union, the petitioning union becomes "entitled to be furnished customary and routine facilities and services." <span class="Italic">Panama Teachers</span>, 44 FLRA at 422. <span class="Italic">Accord</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(3) (it is not an unfair labor practice for agency to "furnish, upon request, customary and routine services and facilities" to a union "if the services and facilities are also furnished on an impartial basis to other [unions] having equivalent status[&#8197;]"). In <span class="Italic">Panama Teachers</span>, the Authority held that, under applicable statutory and regulatory requirements:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[A]&#x2003;petitioning union acquires equivalent status...when an appropriate [RD] determines, and notifies the parties, that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and merits further processing. Therefore, consistent with the Authority's Rules and Regulations,...a petitioning union acquires equivalent status with an incumbent at such time as the [RD] determines, and notifies the appropriate parties, that a notice of the petition will be posted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 425. Thus, <span class="Italic">Panama Teachers</span> held that a petitioning union obtains equivalent status only if the RD both determines, <span class="Italic">and notifies the appropriate parties</span>, that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest, that it merits further processing, and that a notice of petition will be posted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to <span class="Italic">Panama Teachers</span>, the Authority has stated this test inconsistently with respect to an RD's obligation to notify parties of his or her determinations. In one decision, the Authority restated the test as including the requirement that the RD notify the parties that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and merits further processing. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Barksdale Air Force Base, Bossier City, La.</span>, 45 FLRA 659, 662 n.2 (1992) (union obtains equivalent status when it files a petition and the RD "determines, and notifies the parties, that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and merits further processing[&#8197;]"). In two other decisions, the Authority restated the test without including the requirement that the RD notify the parties that the petition includes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and merits further processing. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 55 FLRA 964, 965 n.4 (1999) (union obtains equivalent status "when a petition for election is properly filed with the Authority and the appropriate Authority [RD] determines that there has been a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 52 FLRA 1159, 1162 n.3 (1997) (same) (Member Wasserman concurring on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both NAGE and the Agency contend in their applications for review that the RD failed to apply established law by failing to notify the parties that IUPE had submitted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and had achieved equivalent status. Consistent with this claim and the foregoing discussion, we take this opportunity to clarify that if an RD determines under the Statute and the Authority's Regulations that a petitioning union has submitted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and, therefore, has achieved equivalent status with the incumbent union, the RD must timely notify all of the appropriate parties of these determinations and that a notice of petition will be posted. As stated in <span class="Italic">Panama Teachers</span>, we find that this approach "protects the rights of all parties[&#8197;]" and "enables agencies and activities easily to determine whether a labor organization is entitled, on request, to be furnished facilities and services under [&#x00A7;] 7116(a)(3) of the Statute." 44 FLRA at 425.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the RD acknowledged that he failed to notify the parties explicitly that IUPE had submitted a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of interest and had achieved equivalent status. Thus, we grant the application for review in part on this basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we recognize that when a representative of the Authority's regional office commits a prejudicial error that warrants setting aside an election, the Authority will direct that an election be set aside and a new election conducted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of HHS, SSA, Dist. Office, Greenville, N.C.</span>, 36 FLRA 824 (1990) (Authority found prejudicial error warranting new election where Authority agent opened newly-discovered ballot, outside the presence of parties' representatives, after the initial tally of ballots had been issued). If an RD fails to provide the required notification discussed above, and this failure results in a delay in according a union equivalent status, then it will be necessary for the Authority to determine whether the union was prejudiced in a manner that warrants setting aside the election. Specifically, the Authority will need to determine whether, in the circumstances of the case, the delay in according equivalent status had the "potential [to] interfere[&#8197;] with the free choice of the voters."<span class="Italic"> United States DOD, Stateside Dependents Schs., Fort Benning Schs.

<p class="noindent">An early decision from an FLRA ALJ explained the genesis of the equivalent status rule, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 2 FLRA 360, 367-69 (1979):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, U.S. Army Natick Laboratories, Natick Mass.,</span> A/SLMR No. 263 and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Interior, Pacific Coast Region, Geological Survey Center, Menlo Park, California,</span> A/SLMR No. 143; <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Navy Commissary Store Complex, Oakland,</span> CA, A/SLMR No. 654 the Assistant Secretary concluded that a union which has not raised a question concerning representation by virtue of its action in filing a representation petition or become an intervenor in such a pending representation petition, does not enjoy "equivalent status" within the meaning of section 19(a)(3) of the Order. Also, in the absence of "special circumstances" a labor organization not possessing "equivalent status" with an incumbent exclusively recognized representative, may not enjoy the use of the services and facilities of the activity involved for purposes of organizational activities. In the absence of a showing of special circumstances, i.e. a showing that the employees involved are inaccessible to reasonable attempts by a labor organization to communicate with them outside the agency's or activity's premises, the granting of access to a union not enjoying "equivalent status" is violative of section 19(a)(3) of the Order and constitutes improper pre-election conduct justifying the setting aside of an election. <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Natick Laboratories and Geological Survey Center, Menlo Park supra; Defense Supply Agency, Defense Contract Administration Services, Region SF, Burlingame, California,</span> A/SLMR No. 247.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Assistant Secretary noted in "<span class="Italic">Natick</span>" "that before an agency or activity grants access to its facility by non-employee representatives of a labor organization, it must ascertain that the labor organization involved has made a diligent, but unsuccessful, effort to contact the employees away from the agency or activity premises and that its failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility. It appears that irrespective of the existence of "special circumstances," an agency or activity could be engaging in conduct violative of section 19(a)(3) of the Executive Order if it allow access to its premises without first inquiring into the past efforts of the labor organization which is requesting either use of its premises or facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The cases make it clear that where there is no question concerning representation exists an agency will be compelled to permit use of its facilities and services only in rare cases of inaccessibility to other modes of communication.&#x2003;Further, there appears to be an affirmative responsibility on the agency or activity to ascertain whether a labor organization seeking use of its facilities and services has made a diligent, but unsuccessful effort to contact employees away from the agency or activity's premises and that the failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility. There is ample justification for such procedure and the question of whether or not employees are inaccessible should be raised with the activity or agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief Complainant urges that it was denied access to employees and that it had no other practical or legitimate means of soliciting employees.&#x2003;Yet it made no effort to communicate this difficulty to the Respondent, who has a responsibility to make such a determination under the case law, but instead sought directly to use the internal mailing system before any such determination could be made. In the circumstances, it is my view that Respondent faced with allowing the use of its facilities without making a determination as to inaccessibility was correct in not distributing the mail through its internal mailing system. Furthermore, Respondent was correct in noting that it would be subject to unfair labor practice complaints from the certified labor organizations had it delivered the mail through its internal mailing system where no question concerning representation had been raised and where it had not made a determination as to the employees accessibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether or not employees were inaccessible outside <span id="page_148"></span>the Respondent's premises, the evidence is clear that the facilities involved were geographically scattered. However, there is no showing that Complainant made a diligent effort to contact employees prior to the mailing or that such efforts to contact employees would have been futile. Indeed the evidence shows that after a limited effort by telephone Complainant made its decision to use the mails. Since it has not been established that the employees involved were beyond the reach of reasonable efforts by PASS to communicate with them other than by mail, in view of the existing certification bars and the lack of a question concerning representation, it is found that Respondent did not violate sections 19(a)(1) and (3) of the Order by returning the mailings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is also found that there is no disparity of treatment in this matter with respect to mailing or to distribution of mails for other labor organizations.&#x2003;With regard to the latter, Respondent indeed distributed mailings for PATCO. However, at the time of that single distribution, PATCO was an exclusive representative in the unit in which the distribution occurred, thus raising an entirely different question. Finally, since it is found that no question concerning representation existed and that Complainant did not exhaust reasonable efforts to communicate with employees other than by mailing, it is unnecessary to pass on the question of what effect Respondent's directives had on its refusal to distribute the PASS organizational material while distributing personal mail at its facilities.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and NFFE Local 1749</span>, 44 FLRA 217, 223-27 (1992), is another early exploration of equivalent status (adopting the ALJ's explanation in the ULP case):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent is charged with unlawfully assisting the Intervenor, a labor organization not having "equivalent status" with the Charging Party, the incumbent exclusive representative of certain employees of the Respondent. This alleged assistance was the permitting of organizing efforts by the Intervenor (the Laborers) at the Respondent's hospital. The factual allegations of the complaint are not disputed, nor is the allegation that at the time of these events the Laborers did not have "equivalent status" within the meaning of section 7116(a)(3) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). The Respondent defends on the basis of circumstances purporting to justify its treatment of the Laborers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A hearing was held on May 17, 1991, in Gallup, New Mexico. Counsel for the General Counsel and for the Respondent filed post-hearing briefs. Counsel for the General Counsel also filed an unopposed motion to make minor corrections to the transcript. That motion is granted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Findings of Fact</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent is a hospital, one of eight medical facilities serving the Navajo Reservation in the vicinity of Gallup, New Mexico. A unit of its employees has for some years been represented by the Charging Party Union. In May 1990, the Laborers sought to obtain the right to challenge the Charging Party Union in a representation election by obtaining sufficient unit employee signatures to support a representation petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the week of May 21, one or more representatives of the Laborers (at least one being an employee of another area hospital of the Indian Health Service, of which the Respondent is apparently a part) occupied a conference room at the hospital until their presence was discovered by members and representatives of the Charging Party Union. National Representative Henry Mesa, of the National Federation of Federal Employees, the parent organization of the Charging Party, went to see Dr. Timothy Fleming, the Respondent's Service Unit Director (chief executive officer) about this. Dr. Fleming testified credibly that only shortly before Mesa's visit had he learned of this presence, and that he had told the Laborers' representative to leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After some discussion, Dr. Fleming, over Mr. Mesa's protest, decided that the Laborers' representative who had been in the conference room could occupy a table in an area on the ground floor next to the elevators, near some vending machines outside the employee cafeteria. There, with Dr. Fleming's knowledge, representatives of the Laborers continued to solicit employees about once a week into the summer. The Laborers filed a representation petition on July 12, 1990.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The area in which the Laborers organizational activity was permitted is frequented by employees during off-duty hours and is part of a main passageway which some employees use while on duty. Tables and chairs are apparently kept in this area permanently, and are used by vendors of all kinds of items that employees or visitors might be interested in purchasing. The Respondent maintains a policy of permitting anyone whose conduct does not disrupt the hospital environment to use the area. It is, in Dr. Fleming's phrase, designated as a "public use area." As far as anyone could remember, however, it had never before been used by a union for organizational purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Discussion and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unfair labor practice alleged here is described in section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute. (The violation of section 7116(a)(1), also alleged in the complaint, is derivative.) Since there is no issue here as to "equivalent status," this case involves only the first part of section 7116(a)(3), establishing certain agency action as an unfair labor practice: "to sponsor, control, or otherwise assist any labor organization...." The issue breaks down, on the facts presented here, to the narrower question of whether this (admitted) agency "otherwise assist[ed]" the Laborers, which, although not specifically alleged as such, is undisputably a labor organization.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7116(a)(3), as under its predecessor, section 19(a)(3) of Executive Order 11491, one kind of agency action that is deemed to be unlawful assistance is a grant of access (to a rival union without "equivalent status") to the agency's facilities for the purpose of organizing employees. <span class="Italic">See Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census,</span> 24 FLRA 943, 946 n.2 (1986); <span class="Italic">AFGE v. FLRA,</span> 793 F.2d 333, 337 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1986). The Respondent seeks to remove itself from the application of this general principle for various, reasons it presented in two categories of argument. One is an exception to the general principle. The other is a series of related policy arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The assertedly applicable exception is based on an authoritative decision issued under Executive Order 11491 which, not having been superseded, remains in full force and effect. See section 7135(b) of the Statute. That decision was rendered in the case of <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, U.S. Army Natick Laboratories, Natick, Massachusetts,</span> 3 A/SLMR 193 (1973) (<span class="Italic">Natick</span>). In <span class="Italic">Natick,</span> the Assistant Secretary carved out an exception to section 19(a)(3)'s prohibition of granting access to a rival union, for situations where the employees whom the rival union is attempting to organize are "inaccessible to reasonable attempts by the labor organization to communicate with them outside the agency's or activity's premises." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 196. However, the Assistant Secretary placed a significant procedural burden on an agency seeking to avail itself of this exception:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">It should be noted, however, that before an agency or activity grants access to its facility by nonemployee representative in these circumstances, it must ascertain that the labor organization involved has made a diligent, but unsuccessful effort to contact the employees away from the agency or activity premises and that its failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> There was no showing on the record in the instant case that the Respondent ascertained any such effort by the Laborers. The <span class="Italic">Natick</span> exception, therefore, is not available to this Respondent.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;There is no evidence that any of the representatives of the Intervenor who used the Respondent's facilities were employees of the Respondent, and the Respondent does not argue that their status is different from the "nonemployee representatives" mentioned in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's main line of argument, however, is that it had established a practice of not exercising control over the use to which the area in question was put, at least not with respect to the identity of the users or the content of their nondisruptive communications. This practice, the Respondent asserts, made it a "public use area" outside the Respondent's control. The answer to that contention is that the Respondent's hands-off policy regarding the use of that area, which in any event was not a complete abdication of control, was a voluntary restraint on its part. The Respondent never really abandoned its dominion over this part of its hospital; it merely permitted its general use for non-hospital purposes. The Statute does not concern itself with an agency's decision to open its facilities to public uses. It does concern itself with the circumstances under which labor organizations are permitted to use agency facilities, and section 7116(a)(3), interpreted in light of the authorities cited above, prohibits the specific use that the Respondent allowed here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I must also reject the Respondent's argument for application here of the principle, applied in such private sector cases as <span class="Italic">Montgomery Ward &#x0026; Co v. NLRB,</span> 692 F.2d 1115 (7th Cir. 1982), that forbids discrimination between the access given to members of the public and that given to nonemployee union organizers. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1125-28. That line of cases deals with the balancing of employee interests in receiving information about union organization against the property rights of the owner. The instant case, on the other hand, deals with a statutory line drawn between permissible and impermissible exposures of employees to employer-sanctioned contacts, a line designed to prevent any infringement of employee free choice between competing unions. <span class="Italic">See Natick, supra,</span> at 196. Again, here, the Statute itself imposes the restriction and, if it be regarded as such, the discrimination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent has asserted that its opening of the area to commercial uses, and its expressed intention that the area be equally open to non-commercial messages, establishes the area as a public forum to which First Amendment considerations apply, thereby precluding any discrimination with respect to the content of the message. This does raise an interesting point. While First Amendment protection no longer reaches speech, including union organizing, in privately owned public areas such as shopping centers (<span class="Italic">Hudgens v. NLRB,</span> 424 U.S. 507 (1976)), <span id="page_149"></span>organizing "speech" is presumably still protected from abridgement by government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 513. However, the Respondent's contention, if it is to affect the resolution of this case, must be that section 7116(a)(3), to the extent that it prohibits the Respondent's granting access to the Laborers, is unconstitutional. I lack the authority to pass on this. Moreover, if there is a real constitutional problem here, I see no ambiguity in the Statute that would permit its interpretation in a manner that avoids the problem. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> the <span class="Italic">Natick</span> exception, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> based on an "overall policy" of the Executive Order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 196. Whether the Respondent has standing to raise the constitutional issue is another question.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For all of these reasons, I conclude that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute by assisting the Laborers. Although <span class="Italic">Natick</span> did not specifically hold that such conduct also interfered with, restrained, or coerced employees in the free exercise of their right to select their bargaining representative, that decision clearly implied that such a tendency was part of the basis for the result reached. Therefore, I conclude that the Respondent's conduct here also violated section 7116(a)(1) of the Statute. I recommend that the Authority issue the following order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">ORDER</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to section 2423.29 of the Federal Labor Relations Authority's Rules and Regulations and section 7118 of the Statute, it is hereby ordered that the Gallup Indian Medical Center, Gallup, New Mexico shall:</p>

<p class="noindent">Equivalent status and alternate access rules were applied in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Barksdale AFB and NFFE Local 1953</span>, 45 FLRA 659, 663-66 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7116(a)(3) of the Statute, an agency unlawfully assists a labor organization when it grants a rival union without equivalent status access to its facilities for the purpose of organizing its employees....&#8197;As an exception to this rule the Authority has held that a union lacking equivalent status "may obtain access to an agency's facilities if it demonstrates to the agency that, after diligent effort, it has been unable to reach the agency's employees through reasonable, alternative means of communication." <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, 45 FLRA No. 27, slip op. at 16 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees v. FLRA</span>, 793 F.2d 333, 337 n.9 (D.C. Cir. 1986)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This exception was first applied in <span class="Italic">Natick</span> [3 A/SMLR 193 (1973)] by the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations (Assistant Secretary) under Executive Order 11491, the predecessor to the Statute. <span class="Italic">Natick</span> involved a facility that was guarded and enclosed by a high fence. Although the evidence established that the employees were difficult to reach entering and exiting the facility, the Assistant Secretary concluded that nonemployee organizers for a rival union that did not have equivalent status could not gain access to the facility because the employees were not inaccessible outside its premises. In reaching this conclusion, the Assistant Secretary examined whether the rival union had "made a diligent, but unsuccessful, effort to contact the employees away from the [employer's] premises and [whether] its failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility." 3 A/SLMR at 196. Finding insufficient evidence of inaccessibility under this analysis, the Assistant Secretary found that the agency had violated the Executive Order by permitting access to its premises to nonemployee organizers for the rival union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has applied <span class="Italic">Natick</span> in two recent cases. In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span>, the Authority determined that the employees were not inaccessible even though the employees lived throughout a large metropolitan area and were difficult to reach when entering and exiting the facility. The Authority pointed to the fact that the rival union had had "some success" in attempting to contact employees through such means as the use of a commercial search firm, searches of local telephone directories, distribution of leaflets on city buses entering the facility, and meetings with employees. 45 FLRA No. 27, slip op. at 18. In addition, the Authority noted that there was no evidence that the rival union had requested that employees distribute literature during their non-work times in non-work areas on the agency's premises, a factor set forth in <span class="Italic">Natick</span>. The Authority found that it had not been established that the inability of the rival union to contact the employees was "due to the employees' inaccessibility, rather than other factors such as cost." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, the Authority concluded that no special circumstances existed to warrant applying the exception to the general rule that an agency may not grant access to a rival union without equivalent status....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case there is no evidence that the Respondent inquired as to the measures taken by AFGE to contact the employees on the Respondent's premises without using nonemployee organizers to do so. Significantly, there is evidence that one employee already is engaged in campaigning for AFGE. It is established Authority law that the Respondent may not interfere with that employee's right to distribute materials for AFGE on its premises if the distribution takes place in non-work areas during non-work times....&#8197;Nonetheless, there is no evidence that the Respondent took into account that employee's efforts on behalf of AFGE when determining that its employees were inaccessible to AFGE's organizing campaign.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever to indicate whether the Respondent attempted to ascertain measures taken by AFGE to contact the employees off the base other than AFGE's unsuccessful attempt to obtain the home telephone numbers and addresses of the employees. For example, the Respondent did not inquire as to whether AFGE had made any effort to reach the employees through the media or by distributing leaflets on or near public transportation or in popular gathering spots, such as malls where employees are known to congregate. In the absence of such information regarding AFGE's organizational efforts, the Respondent had no basis on which to grant access to a labor organization without equivalent status. In this regard, the Respondent appears to defend its decision to grant access to AFGE by stating only that it is unable to furnish the incumbent Union with the addresses of its employees, and, therefore, that it could not provide that information to any other union. As we have shown above, contact with employees at their homes is not the only way by which a rival union can attempt to communicate with employees away from the workplace. Whether the Respondent fulfills its obligations under the Statute with regard to the incumbent Union should have no bearing on the rights of a rival union to organize on the Respondent's premises.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we conclude that it is not relevant to the disposition of this case that the Respondent assertedly did not know that AFGE had not filed a petition for an election when the Respondent permitted the AFGE organizer access to the base. An agency has a statutory obligation under section 7116(a)(3) to ensure that it does not provide unlawful assistance to a union without equivalent status. Therefore, before granting access to its employees and facilities to nonemployee organizers for a rival union, the agency is obligated to determine whether that union has achieved equivalent status and, if it has not, whether its failure to communicate with the employees was based on their inaccessibility. If an agency does not make such inquiries, it acts at its peril.</p>
<p class="noindent">An election petition was dismissed when an agency improperly assisted a petitioning union by allowing the petitioner access to agency facilities for organizing and soliciting employee signatures. The union's showing of interest was invalid because the petitioning union, rival to the incumbent, was permitted access to agency facilities to conduct an organizing campaign when the petitioner did not have equivalent status. <span class="Italic">Gallup Indian Med.

<p class="noindent">As to the posting of messages by employees on their lockers in a teachers' lounge, the equivalent status rule was designed to deal with demands of competing labor organizations for equal access by nonemployee agents to an agency's premises and for use by those organizations of an agency's services and facilities during organizational campaigns. The rule was inapplicable to employees who distribute literature or engage in solicitation during their own time on agency premises. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Schussel</span>, 21 FLRA 849, 862-63 (1986) (ALJ Decision).
