<p class="Body-Text">Aside from the civil rights acts and the Whistleblower Protection Act, no authority provides for the award of incidental or consequential expenses (or compensatory damages) to an employee as a consequence of improper personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 488, 495 (1987) (citing 63 Comp. Gen. 170 (1984)); 61 Comp. Gen. 578 (1982); FPM Supp. 990-2, Book 550, Subch. S8-7(b)(7) (4-20-84); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wilkins v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 648, 653-54 (1993) (no reimbursement of medical expenses); <span class="Italic">Kennedy v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 429, 431 (1989) ("the Board has no authority to direct an agency to pay an employee additional or consequential expenses in connection with a back-pay award"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Morgan v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 81 MSPR 48 (1999) (concerning a promotion opportunity), <span class="Italic">post.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">For appeals not involving claims of civil rights violations or whistleblowing reprisal, the general rule is that reimbursement of consequential expenses incurred as a result of an improper personnel action is not provided for in the Back Pay Act or in any other authority. <span class="Italic">Seibel v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 87 MSPR 260, 266 &#x00B6; 15 (2000) (Back Pay Act did not support a claim for the reimbursement of additional medical expenses, without a provision in a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">O'Connell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 73 MSPR 235, 241 (1997) (as to costs incurred by appellant in an appeal, the Back Pay Act does not authorize an award of compensatory damages or incidental expenses); <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 53 MSPR 78, 82 (1992) (appellant could not recover interest on his own debt to the agency and to the retirement fund).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel and Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 79 MSPR 542, 550-55 (1998), denied consequential damages in lieu of back pay to a 1982 applicant for employment who, through court order, was instated with EPA years after his application and for whom OSC sought a monetary remedy for financial losses between the time the applicant should have been and was actually hired. In <span class="Italic">Hubbard</span>, the Board decided that its remedial authority prior to the 1989 WPA did not extend to awards of monetary damages to the victims of prohibited practices <span id="Page_4959"></span>who could not be compensated through the Back Pay Act or other statutes unequivocally establishing monetary relief:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Board's corrective action authority prior to the 1994 Act did not provide for an award of damages</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner argues that the 1994 Act merely clarified that the Board's broad authority to award corrective action under 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A) includes the authority to award money damages. The CALJ addressed this issue and concluded that the authority to award damages was not part of the Board's authority until it was added by the 1994 amendments to the WPA. We agree, for the following reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The statutory language is not broad enough to allow the awarding of money damages.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As acknowledged by the Supreme Court, "'[t]he starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language itself.'" <span class="Italic">Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth,</span> 471 U.S. 681, 685, 105 S. Ct. 2297, 2301, 85 L. Ed.2d 692 (1985) (citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Norfolk &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Western Ry. Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, the Board addressed the scope of its corrective action authority under 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B)[4] and found that its authority under that statutory provision was broad enough to allow the Board to order more than just a "mere correction of a specific personnel action." 1 MSPB 159, 1 MSPR at 198. The Board found that it had the power to address systemic abuses and fashion whatever remedy and appropriate action need be taken. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board did not indicate, however, that its corrective action authority was tantamount to a clear waiver of sovereign immunity which would allow it to award money damages of the kind being claimed in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Both 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B), which was enacted in 1978, and its successor section 1214(b)(4)(A), which was added in 1989 as part of the WPA, allow the Board to "order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate" when the Board determines that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frazier II,</span> the Board denied a request that it enjoin an agency from taking a personnel action, finding that the affected federal employee had failed to show how having to sell his house would constitute irreparable harm, particularly since the Board "under its broad corrective action authority" could order him "made whole" for any damages he incurred as a result of a prohibited personnel practice. 1 MSPB 268, 1 MSPR at 282 and n.4.[5] The Board did not find that such authority arose from a specific waiver of sovereign immunity in 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B) for all monetary losses. Rather, as noted by the CALJ, the authority to compensate or reimburse employees for expenses associated with relocation to other geographic areas arises from a specific waiver of sovereign immunity found in 5 USCA &#x00A7; ch. 57, subch. 11 ("Travel and Transportation Expenses; New Appointees, Student Trainees, and Transferred Employees").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The intervenor argues that the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Frazier II</span> was not limited to losses on sales of homes, but extended to "'financial loss arising from the sale of a home or <span class="Italic">otherwise.'"</span> (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">quoting Frazier II,</span> 1 MSPB 268, 1 MSPR at 282 n.4. To the extent the Board's use of the word "otherwise" can be read to refer to expenses other than the sale of a home, we decline to interpret <span class="Italic">Frazier II</span> as holding that the Board has authority to award money damages in excess of those specifically allowed by statute. Accordingly, we find the intervenor's argument unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">c.&#x2003;The fact that Congress in subsequent legislation added a consequential damages provision is further evidence that the Board did not have authority to award damages prior to the enactment of that provision.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, in 1994 Congress amended section 1214, adding a consequential damages provision--5 USCA &#x00A7; 1214(g). The fact that Congress added a damages provision to the corrective action section of the WPA is additional evidence that the Board did not have authority prior to the enactment of the 1994 amendments to award money damages in corrective action cases. The petitioner and intervenor argue that the 1994 amendments merely clarified the Board's corrective action authority. The plain language of 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1214(g) and its legislative history, however, lead to a contrary conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1214(g) lists several types of damages that had not previously been awarded by the Board in corrective action cases, i.e., "reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages." Its legislative history refers to this section as one of the "expanded" provisions of the WPA. Section 1214(g) was enacted to remedy the situation where individuals had found "their victorys [sic] to be pyrrhic" and to permit compensation for their losses. 140 Cong. Rec. H11419, H11421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey). Had the Board been able to award any remedy it considered appropriate prior to the 1994 Act, as argued by the petitioner and the intervenor, section 1214(g) with its limited scope would have constituted a restriction of the Board's authority, not an expansion as indicated by the legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">3.&#x2003;The other arguments offered by the petitioner and the intervenor do not persuade us that the Board had the authority prior to the 1994 amendments to the WPA to award money damages.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he intervenor argues that 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A) should be construed broadly because it is a remedial provision.

Because Congress did not give the Board explicit authority to award back pay or money damages under the circumstances of this case, we cannot extend the application of 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A) to make such an award solely on the ground that section 1214(b)(4)(A) is remedial legislation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1316-19 (Fed. Cir. 2000), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1982, Hubbard applied to the EPA for a position as a criminal investigator. The EPA did not hire him because, as the district court found, it had been told that while working as a detective for the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police, he had revealed to the press and to a member of Congress information about the police department's Capitol Hill drug investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard sued the EPA in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking instatement and back pay. The court ruled that the EPA had violated Hubbard's First Amendment rights in refusing to hire him. The court ordered him instated in the position, but denied him back pay or money damages and did not make the order retroactive. <span class="Italic">See Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 735 F. Supp. 435, 440-41 (D.D.C.1990); <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 739 F. Supp. 654, 657 (D.D.C.1990) (modifying original order).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed. <span class="Italic">See Hubbard v. EPA</span>, 982 F.2d 531 (1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In denying Hubbard <span id="Page_4960"></span>back pay, the court held that the waiver of sovereign immunity in the Administrative Procedure Act for "relief other than money damages," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 702, does not cover back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">EPA then hired Hubbard for the criminal investigative position he had sought, effective March 8, 1993, but declined to give him back pay to the time when it originally rejected him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In May 1994, the Office of Special Counsel, on Hubbard's behalf, filed a complaint with the Board, seeking monetary relief under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, and the Civil Service Reform and Whistleblower Protection Acts, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A), (g), and 2302(b)(11). The complaint alleged that the EPA's refusal to hire Hubbard violated his First Amendment rights and constituted a "prohibited personnel practice" under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11), that the Board could remedy. Hubbard intervened in the proceeding. He sought the additional relief of EPA posting notices both nationally and regionally acknowledging its commission of a prohibited personnel practice and stating the agency's commitment to a work environment free of such practices, and a cease and desist order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act prohibits personnel actions, including "appointment[s]," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i), "if the taking of or failure to take such action violates any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(11). Section 2301 provides in pertinent part that "[f]ederal personnel management should be implemented consistent with the following merit system principles:... (2) All...applicants for employment should receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management...with proper regard for their...constitutional rights." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). The Act also authorizes the Board to take "corrective action" if it finds that a prohibited personnel practice occurred. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B) (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1989, in the Whistleblower Protection Act, Pub.L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3(a)(8), 11, 103 Stat. 16, 18, 19 (1989), Congress replaced section 1206(c)(1)(B) with a new section 1214, which, similar to its predecessor, gave the Board authority to "order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, if the Board determines that the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice...has occurred." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A). Section 1214 was further amended in 1994 to add a new subsection (g), which provides that "corrective action under this section...may include--(1) that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and (2) ...back pay and related benefits...and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that the EPA had committed a "prohibited personnel practice" by refusing to hire Hubbard, but that neither the Back Pay Act, nor the relief provisions in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214 authorized it to grant the monetary relief requested. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. EPA</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 542, 555 (1998). The Board held that the Back Pay Act applies only to employees and former employees and not to applicants for employment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 547.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Treating Hubbard's claim as one for money damages under section 1214, the Board concluded it had no authority to make such an award in this case. First, the Board held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g), which in 1994 authorized the Board to award back pay and consequential damages, does not cover conduct before its enactment, because it "conferred a new right to monetary relief," which "[i]f applied retroactively...would attach new legal consequences to conduct that took place before its enactment." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 550. Second, the Board held that prior to 1994, it had no authority to award money damages in corrective action cases. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 550. The "corrective action" provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A), the Board reasoned, "does not constitute a clear unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity that would permit [it] to award money damages in corrective action cases." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 551.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board denied Hubbard's request for non-monetary relief, noting that "the case involves actions that occurred over fifteen years ago" and that "the requested posting and cease and desist order would serve no useful purpose under these circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 555-56 n.8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal Hubbard does not challenge the Board's rulings (1) that the Back Pay Act covers only present and former employees, not applicants for employment, and (2) that section 1214(g) does not apply retroactively. He contends only (1) that the Board's authority in section 1214(b)(4)(A) to take "corrective action" constituted a waiver of the government's sovereign immunity and authorizes the Board to award back pay and (2) that the Board erred in refusing to provide the non-monetary relief he sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly held that its statutory authority to "order corrective action" to remedy a prohibited personnel practice did not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity that would permit it to award back pay covering the period for which Hubbard had improperly been denied employment. "A waiver of the Federal Government's sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text, and will not be implied. Moreover, a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity will be strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain a claim that the Government is liable for awards of monetary damages, the waiver of sovereign immunity must extend unambiguously to such monetary claims. A statute's legislative history cannot supply a waiver that does not appear clearly in any statutory text; "the unequivocal expression of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text." <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed.2d 486 (1996) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Lane</span>, "[t]he clarity of expression necessary to establish a waiver of the Government's sovereign immunity against monetary damages for [prohibited personnel practices] is lacking in the text of the relevant provisions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The phrase "order corrective action" does not specifically provide for, or even suggest the payment of monetary compensation. It is a general term that, as the Board stated, "is not specific enough to itself constitute a clear waiver of sovereign immunity." <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. EPA</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 551.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard contends that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the Board erred when it analyzed the portion of the CSRA authorizing "corrective action" in isolation to the other aspects of the law which clearly and unequivocally demonstrated that corrective action applied to "applicants" for employment, such as Mr. Hubbard, and authorized the correction of any "decision concerning pay."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He notes that the statute applies to "applicants for employment," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2), and that the definition of "prohibited personnel practice" includes "decision [s] concerning pay," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). He argues that, "[u]nder a plain meaning of the statute, 'corrective action' authorized the Board to 'correct' a 'personnel action' impacting an 'applicant' for employment related directly to a 'decision concerning pay.'" Thus, he contends that the EPA's decision not to hire him was a prohibited "decision concerning pay," for the correction of which by a monetary award Congress waived sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the argument is ingenious, it is unconvincing. The provisions upon which he relies define the particular personnel actions over which the Board has jurisdiction, not the remedies that Congress authorized the Board to employ. Moreover, although the definition of "prohibited personnel action" includes "decisions concerning pay," it also includes those concerning "an appointment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i). The question is whether Congress waived sovereign immunity to permit the Board to order payment of damages for the agency's improper initial refusal to appoint Hubbard. The prohibited personnel actions falling under the statutory term "decision concerning pay" involve such questions as the proper pay level for particular jobs, the calculations of the amount of pay, etc., rather than the award of back pay as a remedy for the erroneous decision refusing to give Hubbard an appointment in 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress intended to waive sovereign immunity to permit the Board to award monetary compensation, it knew how to, and did do so clearly and unequivocally. In the 1994 amendments of section 1214, Congress expanded the definition of "corrective action" to "include...reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(g)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard argues that the 1994 amendment was intended only to clarify, but not to change existing law. The addition of the numerous kinds of monetary payments to the definition of "corrective action," however, significantly enhanced and changed the Board's authority. Contrary to Hubbard's contention, the legislative history of that amendment does not show that it merely clarified, but did not expand, the Board's existing authority. The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs described the new section as "<span class="Italic">allow[ing]</span> the Board to order corrective action that will make, as nearly as possible, the individual 'whole.'" S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3549, 3559 (emphasis added). The use of the word "allow" strongly suggests that Congress intended to give the Board remedial power it did not previously possess.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard contends, however, that the Court of Claims decision in <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. United States</span>, 127 Ct. Cl. 417, 118 F. Supp. 369 (1954), establishes that "Congress intended to include back pay in its definition of corrective action." In <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span>, a veteran had been demoted in his federal government employment. After it was determined that his demotion was improper and he was reinstated to his formerly held higher grade, he filed suit in the Court of Claims under section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 863 (1954), to recover the pay he had lost as a result of his demotion. That section provided that if the Civil Service Commission (the Board's predecessor) determined that the veteran had been improperly demoted, it would direct the administrative officer in the agency that demoted the veteran to take such "corrective action" as the Commission recommended. In <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span>, the Commission <span id="Page_4961"></span>recommended that the veteran "be restored to his former rank as of...the date of his reduction in grade. Compliance with that recommendation would have required that the Naval Shipyard pay the plaintiff the wages he lost because of his demotion, back to the date of his demotion." 118 F. Supp. at 370.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the actual holding in the case was that the statute of limitations did not bar the veteran's claim, the court also ruled that the "corrective action" the Commission was authorized to recommend included back pay: "When Congress authorized the Civil Service Commission to hear the demoted veteran's appeal and recommend to the employing agency correction of its treatment of him, it could not have been unaware that the most important element of relief for wrongful demotion, next to restoration to his former status, was back pay." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 371. <span class="Italic">See also Smith v. United States</span>, 127 Ct. Cl. 706, 119 F. Supp. 200, 201 (Ct. Cl. 1954); <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Haeberle</span>, 80 F. Supp. 652, 656 (E.D.N.Y. 1948); <span class="Italic">Wettre v. Hague</span>, 74 F. Supp. 396, 399 (D. Mass. 1947), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds</span>, 168 F.2d 825 (1st Cir. 1948).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its opinion, the Court of Claims did not discuss, or even refer to, any issue of sovereign immunity, and it is uncertain from the opinion whether the government even raised that defense. The court focused on whether the statutory phrase "corrective action" included back pay and the court ruled that it did. <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span> cannot be read as holding that in the Veterans Preference Act Congress waived sovereign immunity for back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard's argument seems to be that <span class="Italic">Goodwin</span> established that when Congress uses the phrase "corrective action," it not only covers back pay but also waives sovereign immunity for it. He asserts that when Congress authorized the Board to take "corrective action," those words had a well established meaning that included back pay. That term, however, is a generic phrase that appears repeatedly throughout the United States Code in greatly varying contexts. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 16 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1606(e); 17 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 119(a)(5)(A)(i); 19 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1509(f)(2)(F). Hubbard has not shown that Congress's use of the term in the legislation here involved expressed a clear and unequivocal intent to waive sovereign immunity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hubbard further contends that the Board erred in denying the additional non-monetary relief he sought--the posting by EPA of notices admitting its misconduct and a cease and desist order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In denying this additional relief the Board, "assuming" it had the authority to take such action, "den[ied] the request for the following reasons":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]he request came from the intervenor, not the petitioner, which is the agency charged with bringing actions before the Board to correct prohibited personnel practices. Further...the case involves actions that occurred over fifteen years ago and have been the subject of numerous published court decisions in which intervenor ultimately prevailed.... [T]he requested posting and cease and desist order would serve no useful purpose under these circumstances. Moreover, there has been no allegation or showing that the prohibited conduct has continued into the present. A cease and desist order would therefore be redundant and unnecessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. EPA</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 555-56 n.8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may "order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(4)(A). "Words such as 'may' and 'consider appropriate' show a clear Congressional intent to provide the Board with broad discretion in the type and scope of the corrective action ordered, if any." <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 1 M.S.P.R. 163, 198 (1979) (footnotes omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The Board did not abuse its discretion in denying this additional relief that Hubbard sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that the Special Counsel did not seek such relief is significant. As the Board noted, the Office of Special Counsel, not Hubbard, is the entity charged with seeking "corrective action" against prohibited personnel practices; it "is fundamentally concerned with the integrity of the merit system" and responsible "to vindicate the public interest." <span class="Italic">Frazier</span>, 672 F.2d at 162-63. The fact that the violations occurred more than fifteen years earlier supports the Board's conclusion that "the requested posting and cease and desist order would serve no useful purpose." Although Hubbard refers to three more recent cases in which he alleges the EPA violated the First Amendment rights of its employees, there is no showing that those cases are comparable to the present one. This case arose out of an isolated incident many years ago, and there is no indication of any real likelihood of its repetition.</p>

Dept. of Energy</span>, 81 MSPR 48, 53-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16 (1999), determined that the Back Pay Act, read with the 1989 WPA, qualified an employee to recover pay lost when the employee was denied a promotion because of reprisal during a period before the effective date of the 1994 WPA amendments providing compensatory damages:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5596(b)(1) was amended in 1978 concurrent with the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 1978 USCCAN (92 Stat.) 1111, which created the Board and gave it corrective action authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 95-454, &#x00A7; 702, 1978 USCCAN (92 Stat.) at 1216. According to the legislative history of the CSRA, the "new subsection (b) provides for coverage under the Back Pay Act for any employee who is found by an appropriate authority to have suffered a withdrawal, reduction, denial, <span class="Italic">or denial of an increase in</span>, all or part of the employee's pay, allowances, differentials or any other monetary or employment benefits which would not have occurred but for an unjustified or unwarranted action taken by the agency." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 114-15 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2836-37 (emphasis added). The legislative history reveals Congress's purpose that when an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action is found, the amended subsection (b)(1) entitles the employee "to be <span class="Italic">made whole for any</span> of the losses found to have been suffered by the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 115, 1978 USCCAN at 2837 (emphasis added). More specifically for this case, Congress expressed its intent that the 1978 revisions to the Back Pay Act "provide[ ] for <span class="Italic">directing a promotion to a higher level position</span> when such order would effectuate the make-whole purposes of the Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the words "denial of increase in...pay" were not made a part of the amended Back Pay Act, the legislative history clearly indicates Congress's intent that a denial of an increase in pay was a situation covered by the terms of the revised Act, and that back pay for a retroactive promotion should be awarded under the Act when the retroactive promotion would make the employee "whole for any of the losses" resulting from the prohibited personnel practice. Indeed, the Board has effected the make-whole purposes of the Back Pay Act by ordering retroactive increases in pay or promotions where the denial of the increase in compensation or nonselection for promotion was due to an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy,</span> 61 MSPR 151, 153 (1994) (retroactive merit increases ordered), <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); <span class="Italic">Cosgrove v. Department of the Navy,</span> 59 MSPR 618, 626 (1993) (retroactive promotion ordered). The appellant here would not be made whole if he was awarded only a prospective promotion from May 12, 1997.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the 1978 CSRA also indicates that Congress intended the Board to have broad corrective action authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 37, 1978 USCCAN at 2759 ("the Board is empowered to order such corrective action as it finds necessary"). As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">In re Frazier</span>, 1 MSPB 159, 1 MSPR 163, 197-98 (1979), <span class="Italic">aff'd in part and review dismissed in part</span>, 672 F.2d 150 (D.C. Cir. 1982), the legislative history of the 1978 CSRA and the language of the corrective action statute indicate a congressional intent that the Board have broad discretion in the type and scope of any corrective action it decides to order. This congressional intent would be thwarted if the Board were to find in this appeal that it could only order a prospective promotion from the date of the final Board order even after determining that the agency had denied the appellant a promotion in February 1990 because of his protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the WPA requires that the Board order corrective action where the Board finds that the personnel action would not have been taken absent the protected whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2); <span class="Italic">Costin v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 72 MSPR 525, 539 (1996), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 75 MSPR 242 (1997). A "promotion" is a personnel action for purposes of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ii). Where a law requires a promotion or where the facts establish a "clear entitlement to a retroactive promotion," the appellant is entitled to the promotion retroactively. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 50 MSPR 686, 697 (1991). Given the Board's findings made under the standard set forth in the WPA, the appellant would have been selected for the promotions but for his whistleblowing activity. Thus, he has established a "clear entitlement" to those promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the Board has the authority under the WPA to order the agency to promote the appellant to a supervisory GS-14 position retroactive to February 1990, the date when the agency did not select him for a supervisory GS-14 position because of his whistleblowing activity. We also find that the Board has the authority under the Back Pay Act to order the agency to pay him back pay for the period between his nonselection in February 1990 and his prospective promotion to a GS-14 position pursuant to the Board's May 12, 1997 Order.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the D.C. Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214 (D.C. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 502 U.S. 810, 112 S. Ct. 57, 116 L. Ed.2d 33 (1991), that the Back Pay Act provided a retrospective remedy only when a promotion was mandatory. To the extent that the court in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> may have been correct in concluding that the Back Pay Act covers only mandatory or nondiscretionary promotion, the Board's final decision here, which finds that the appellant would have been selected for the GS-14 positions absent the illegal retaliation, constitutes a finding under the WPA that he is clearly entitled to a promotion retroactive to the date of the unlawful retaliation<span class="Italic">. See</span> ID at 13-29; <span class="Italic">Russell v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department</span> of <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 317, 326-28 (1997). Therefore, we find that our decision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Brown</span>. We further note, however, that neither party relied on <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> and the D.C. Circuit is not our reviewing court and <span id="Page_4962"></span>its decisions [are] not binding on the Board<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703; <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 50 MSPR 523, 529 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, our review of the legislative history of the Back Pay Act shows Congress's intent that the Act should provide "make whole" relief to an employee when there is a finding that an agency committed an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." Congress also expressed its intent that such make-whole relief include retroactive promotions and attendant back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 115, 1978 USCCAN at 2837. Thus, we read the Back Pay Act as allowing us to award back pay to the appellant for a retroactive promotion. The Board's final decision here finding that the appellant would have been selected for the GS-14 positions absent the illegal retaliation constitutes a finding under the WPA that he is clearly entitled to a promotion retroactive to the date of the unlawful retaliation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 317, 326-28 (1997); <span class="Italic">cf. Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR 156, 160-61 (1988) (the appellant failed to show entitlement to a retroactive promotion because his "arguments and affidavit statements are speculative in nature and fail to establish that he would have been promoted to any of the positions he cites").</p>
