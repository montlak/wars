<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An action may be taken against an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title by the agency in which the administrative law judge is employed only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The actions covered by this section are--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a suspension;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay; and</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a reduction-in-force action under section 3502 of this title; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;any action initiated under section 1215 of this title.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the course of deciding an issue relating to the eligibility of a civil service annuitant for appointment to an ALJ position and determining that the applicant could be appointed if the annuity were waived during the incumbency of the appointment, <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 605 (Fed. Cir. 1994), the court said of the "good cause" requirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By protecting the tenure of the ALJ in this manner, Congress obviously intended to insulate and protect the judges from agency influence and manipulation. <span class="Italic">See Ramspeck v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners Conference</span>, 73 S. Ct. 570 (1953), cited in <span class="Italic">Vesser</span>, traced the evolution of the corps of "trial examiners" that would later become administrative law judges. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Benton v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Butler</span>, CB-7521-14-0014-T-1 (NP 8/25/2016), summarized the "good cause" formulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate actions against ALJs. An agency may take an action against an ALJ only for "good cause" as determined after a hearing by the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a). SSA must prove good cause by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 12 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Congress has not defined the term "good cause" for purposes of section 7521. The Board has adopted a flexible approach in which good cause is defined according to the individual circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">Department of Labor v. Avery</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 150, &#x00B6; 5 (2013), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Berlin v. Department of Labor</span>, 772 F.3d 890 (Fed. Cir. 2014). However, the baseline for evaluating good cause in any action against an ALJ is whether the action improperly interferes with the ALJ's ability to function as an independent and impartial decision maker. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

Therefore, the Board has held that ALJs are required to conduct themselves in a fitting manner. <span class="italic">Social Security Administration v. Manion</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 298, 302 (1984). This means, at a minimum, they must not violate generally accepted rules of conduct. <span class="italic">See Social Security Administration v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has held that the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of ALJs. <span class="italic">Whittlesey</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 696; <span class="italic">Matter of Chocallo</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 612, 652-53 (1978). The ABA Model Code (February 2007) provides in pertinent part at Canon 1, Rule 1.2:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AHE 12 at 10.[8] Comment [1] to Canon 1 explains that, "Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by improper conduct," and that the principle "applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a judge." <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;"Actual improprieties include violations of law, court rules or provisions of this Code.

AHE at 10, Comment [5].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner has proven that the respondent's actions were conduct unbecoming an ALJ, i.e., conduct which was improper, unsuitable or detracting from one's character or reputation. <span class="italic">Cf.

Further, the respondent's physical altercation with his domestic partner, resulting in the involvement of neighbors and the intervention of police officers, clearly violated generally accepted rules of conduct. His conduct was inconsistent with maintaining respect for the administrative adjudicatory process. Accordingly, we find that the petitioner has shown good cause for disciplinary action against the respondent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Long</span> was reviewed in the Federal Circuit, and that court gave an extensive explanation of its view of the statutory "good cause" requirement, including the significance of the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, in <span class="Italic">Long v. SSA</span>, 635 F.3d 526, 533-38 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (Judge Dyk, concurring) (aff'g <span class="Italic">SSA v. Long</span>, 113 MSPR 190, 207-13 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 40-54, 2010 MSPB 19 (2010) (the Board decision is discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-176.html#sec6-174">Other Misconduct</a>")), resulting from a complaint involving an off-duty incident:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, the Agency was permitted to remove or suspend Long, an ALJ, "only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 787 F.2d 1559, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1986). In addressing "good cause," the Board noted that the ALJ position is one of "prominence," meant to engender "great respect. The Board therefore held that an ALJ must not conduct himself in a manner that "undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board explained that it has held that the American Bar Association Model Code of Judicial Conduct ("ABA Model Code") is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of ALJs and quoted Canon 1, Rule 1.2 of the ABA Model Code: "A judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety." Further, the Board explained that, in contrast to the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), "good cause" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a) does not require a "separate analysis of nexus."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the facts of this case, the Board found that Long's "physical altercation with his domestic partner, resulting in the involvement of neighbors and the intervention of police officers...was inconsistent with maintaining respect for the administrative adjudicatory process." The Board found that this conduct meets the "good cause standard for disciplinary action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Long does not contest the Board's "good cause" standard and conceded, at oral argument, that the standard is acceptable and appropriate. In contrast, <span class="Italic">Amicus Curiae</span>, the Association of Administrative Law Judges ("AALJ"), objects to the Board's construction of "good cause" and disputes the Agency's argument that the Board's interpretation is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. We therefore address the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Procedures Act ("APA") does not define "good cause." <span class="Italic">See Brennan,</span> 787 F.2d at 1561. Indeed, we have recognized that "Congress intentionally failed to define 'good cause' in the...Act. Rather, 'good cause' is to be given meaning through judicial interpretation...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1561-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the "'good cause' standard was left to the courts to define," courts have not provided a "succinct definition for 'good cause."' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1562. Courts have, however, articulated "what 'good cause' is not." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1563. The Supreme Court, in <span class="Italic">Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners Conference,</span> 345 U.S. 128 (1953), held that "good cause" is not equivalent to the "good behavior" standard applicable to Article III judges. <span class="Italic">Brennan,</span> 787 F.2d at 1562. In addition, this court has held that a charge cannot constitute "good cause" if it is "based on reasons which constitute an improper interference with the ALJ's performance of his quasi-judicial functions." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1563. These holdings help narrow and frame the "good cause" standard but do not define "good cause."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a controlling interpretation of "good cause" by the Supreme Court or this court, the Agency argues that we must give <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the Board's interpretation of "good cause." We agree. In <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 407 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005), we addressed the issue of whether the Board's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. We explained that the Supreme Court has "recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> treatment i[s] express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1336 (quoting<span class="Italic"> United States v. Mead Corp.,</span> 533 U.S. 218, 229 (2001)). We concluded that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1305, which states that "for the purpose of section 7521 of this title, the...Board may investigate, prescribe regulations, appoint advisory committees as necessary, [and] recommend legislation," provides such express congressional authorization for the Board to engage in rulemaking with respect to section 7521. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We further determined that "section 7521 authorizes the Board to adjudicate whether an agency has established good cause for disciplinary action against an ALJ."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Thus, we held that "[t]he Board has been charged with administering section 7521 through both rulemaking and adjudication and is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference in these activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, under <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in section 7521 is subject to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AALJ, however, contends that the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in section 7521 is not entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference because courts have left open the question of whether <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is applicable where more than one agency is responsible for interpreting and implementing a statute. For support, the AALJ points to the Office of Personnel Management's ("OPM's") role in interpreting and rulemaking with respect to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), which includes the "efficiency of the service" standard. It is true that courts have addressed but left unresolved the issue of whether <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference is appropriate where multiple agencies are responsible for administering a statute. <span class="Italic">Bragdon v. Abbott,</span> 524 U.S. 624, 642 (1998); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 295 F.3d 1298, 1307 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2002). We conclude, however, that this open question does not affect the applicability of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the Board's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 because the Board has exclusive rulemaking and adjudicatory authority with respect to section 7521. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1305, 7521; <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> 407 F.3d at 1336. OPM's role in interpreting section 7513 is irrelevant. As such, our review of the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in section 7521 is governed by <span class="Italic">Chevron.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the two-part test of <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> a court must first determine "whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Everhart,</span> 494 U.S. 83, 89-90 (1990). If so, that is the end of the inquiry because "the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 89. If, however, "the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue," the court must sustain the agency's construction if it is a "permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.; see Yellow Transp., Inc. v. Mich.,</span> 537 U.S. 36, 45 (2002). Specifically, the court must decide "whether the agency's construction <span id="Page_2238"></span>is 'rational and consistent with the statute."' <span class="Italic">Sullivan,</span> 494 U.S. at 89. "If the agency's reading fills a gap or defines a term in a reasonable way in light of the Legislature's design," a court must give "that reading controlling weight, even if it is not the answer 'the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding."' <span class="Italic">Regions Hosp. v. Shalala,</span> 522 U.S. 448, 457 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear that Congress has not "directly spoken to the precise question at issue," namely the meaning of "good cause" in section 7521, as "Congress intentionally failed to define" the term. <span class="Italic">Brennan,</span> 787 F.2d at 1561-62. Because section 7521, as well as the rest of the APA, is "silent or ambiguous" regarding the meaning of "good cause," we must evaluate whether the Board's construction of "good cause" is "permissible." We conclude that the Board's interpretation of "good cause" to encompass conduct that "undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process," as informed by the ABA Model Code, is a permissible construction of the statutory language. In our view, the Board's construction is rational, consistent with the APA, and reasonable in light of the APA's design. We do not agree with the AALJ's assertion that the Board's interpretation of "good cause" prohibits ALJs from acting with the independence required by the APA. The APA does indeed have provisions to ensure the "decisional independence" of ALJs and prohibits "substantive reviews and supervision of an ALJ's...quasi-judicial functions." <span class="Italic">Brennan,</span> 787 F.2d at 1562. Yet the Board's interpretation of "good cause" to cover conduct that "undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process" is not inconsistent with or in conflict with such independence. Accordingly, under <span class="Italic">Chevron,</span> we must uphold the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In upholding the Board's interpretation of "good cause," we note that the Board's "good cause" standard does not require a "separate analysis of nexus. Again, Long concedes this point. The AALJ, however, takes issue with the Board's failure to require an agency to establish a nexus linking the proven misconduct to the ALJ's judicial duties, or to the agency's reputation and ability to discharge its mission. For support, the AALJ largely relies on cases involving the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Section 7513(a) provides that an agency may take certain disciplinary actions against an employee "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). We have held that this "efficiency of the service" standard requires that there be a "nexus between the employee's misconduct and the work of the agency, i.e., the agency's performance of its functions." <span class="Italic">Doe v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 565 F.3d 1375, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2009). The "efficiency of the service" standard of section 7513(a), however, is distinct from the "good cause" standard of section 7521(a), applicable to ALJs like Long. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a), 7521(a). The Board has repeatedly held, as it did here, that the "good cause" standard of section 7521 is not equivalent to the "efficiency of the service" standard of section 7513. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Carr,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 338 (1998), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Mills,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 463, 467-68 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 124 F.3d 228 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (table). Thus, although a finding of nexus is required under the "efficiency of the service" standard of section 7513, the Board's failure to require a "separate analysis of nexus" for "good cause" under section 7521 was not error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we reject the arguments put forward by the AALJ and to a lesser extent, Long, that the Board's failure to require a "nexus" analysis for "good cause" under section 7521 allows ALJs to be disciplined for misconduct entirely unrelated to an ALJ's judicial duties or the relevant agency. Specifically, the AALJ contends that the Board's "good cause" standard allows an agency to police an ALJ's private, immoral behavior as well as his personal lifestyle choices, which have no impact on the agency or the ALJ's ability to perform his duties. These arguments overlook the substance of the Board's "good cause" standard, which encompasses only conduct that "undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process." This standard ensures that misconduct constituting "good cause" for disciplinary action relates in some way to the character traits expected of an ALJ or to the agency's mission generally. Indeed, misconduct wholly unrelated to an ALJ's position, the characteristics expected of an ALJ, or the agency's performance and mission would not in any way "undermine public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process." As such, despite the lack of a separate nexus requirement, the Board's interpretation of "good cause" ensures that an ALJ's misconduct must have some relationship to the agency or to the ALJ's position in order to subject the ALJ to discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we uphold the Board's interpretation of "good cause" in section 7521(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both Long and the AALJ object to the Board's application of its "good cause" standard to the facts of this case, arguing that the Board erred in finding that Long's conduct was inconsistent with maintaining confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the January 27, 2008 Incident, Long was physically violent with his domestic partner, Castro, both within and outside the home they shared. Long followed Castro, who held their child in her arms, into several different rooms of their house, escalating the incident with repeated physical assaults. Further, when Castro fled the house on foot, Long pursued her. As a result, the argument and Long's physical violence against Castro spread into the neighborhood. The incident ultimately resulted in the involvement of neighbors and the intervention of police.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the AALJ's attempts to classify Long's misconduct as purely immoral, Long's actions on the night of January 27, 2008 were violent, abusive, and potentially criminal. Such violence is undoubtedly inconsistent with maintaining respect for and confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. Long's behavior calls into question his ability to perform his duties as an ALJ and to uphold the reputation of the Agency, as it raises serious doubts regarding his possession of characteristics essential to the ALJ position, including judicial temperament, demeanor, control, and judgment. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Long's conduct undermined public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so holding, we reject Long's and the AALJ's argument that the January 27, 2008 Incident did not result in sufficient notoriety or public awareness to warrant "good cause" for disciplinary action against Long. As the Board recognized, the January 27, 2008 Incident did not receive press coverage or substantial public notoriety. Nevertheless, the record belies Long's and the AALJ's suggestion that the incident was a private matter about which the public was unaware. The January 27, 2008 Incident spread into the neighborhood when Castro left the house and Long followed her in his car. The verbal argument and Long's physical violence against Castro continued in public view. At least two neighbors, the Feeneys, who lived almost a mile from Long and Castro's home, became actively involved in the incident when Castro arrived at their home, frightened and seeking help. Moreover, after the police intervened and arrested Long, the police posted his mug shot on the publicly accessible Broward County Sheriffs Office's website. Long's co-workers and other ALJs were also aware of the incident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we disagree with the AALJ's implication at oral argument that an ALJ's misconduct must actually receive negative publicity, e.g., through the newspaper, television, or the internet, in order to raise concerns regarding public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. Such press coverage is not required for an ALJ's conduct to undermine public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. The propriety of disciplinary action against an ALJ does not rest on the happenstance of media attention regarding the ALJ's behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, both Long and the AALJ dispute the Board's finding of "good cause" on the grounds that there was no evidence that Long's conduct actually impacted his workplace or ability to perform his duties. The Board's "good cause" standard, however, requires only that the ALJ's conduct undermine confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. Such an undermining of confidence occurs where the conduct creates doubts in the ALJ's ability to carry out his responsibilities or raises concerns that the ALJ's behavior will reflect poorly on the agency and its adjudicatory process. Here, Long's supervisors, including the Chief ALJ and the Regional Chief ALJ, testified that his behavior caused them to have serious concerns regarding his ability to adequately perform his duties. Moreover, the fact that the incident was not purely private raised realistic concerns that the public would share such doubts as to Long's ability and the propriety of the Agency's adjudicatory process. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 208 n.9 (quoting Lisa Feeney and Donald Feeney's impressions regarding Long's conduct in relation to his position as an ALJ). As such, we uphold the Board's finding that Long's conduct during the January 27, 2008 Incident constituted "good cause" for disciplinary action against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Long argues that the court should mitigate the penalty of removal because the Board misapplied the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and removal is so unconscionably disproportionate to Long's conduct that it amounts to an abuse of discretion. We may overturn a penalty imposed by the Board for an ALJ's misconduct "[o]nly in the exceptional case in which the penalty exceeds that permitted by statute or regulations or is so harsh that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Brennan,</span> 787 F.2d at 1563. Here, the Board conducted a thorough analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and found the nature and seriousness of Long's misconduct, as well as its negative impact on the Agency and his supervisors' confidence in his ability to adequately perform his judicial duties, warranted removal. Particularly in light of the gravity of the sustained misconduct and evidence that this conduct caused Long's supervisors to have serious concerns regarding his ability to effectively serve as an ALJ, we cannot conclude that the imposed penalty of removal was so harsh that it amounts to an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we uphold the Board's penalty of removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a concurring opinion, Judge Dyk urged caution by the Board before it sustains against federal employees for off-duty conduct, 635 F.3d at 538-39:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While I join the majority opinion, I write separately to express my concerns about the claimed role of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") in determining whether federal employees have engaged in <span id="Page_2239"></span>misconduct outside the workplace.[1] Whether the standard is the usual "efficiency of the service" standard, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, or the "good cause" standard governing discipline for administrative law judges ("ALJs"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, I doubt that Congress intended to broadly authorize the Board to conduct investigations into federal employees' private conduct. Neither the Board nor federal agencies are given a general warrant to ferret out misconduct in the private lives of federal employees. It is one thing for the Board to sustain the dismissal of an employee based on a criminal conviction; it is quite another for the Board to adjudicate criminal behavior when state or federal authorities have declined prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In addition to this case, our opinion in <span class="Italic">Doe v. Department of Justice,</span> 565 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2009), involving alleged off-duty misconduct by a federal law enforcement officer, raised similar issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the Board's disclaimers, that is effectively what the Board did here; it adjudicated criminal conduct. The procedures and evidentiary standards were, however, substantially different than in criminal proceedings. The petitioner was not afforded a jury trial. Moreover, most of the evidence on which the Board relied would have been inadmissible in a criminal trial. Not only does most of the evidence (e.g., the transcript of Ms. Castro's statement on the night of the incident and the testimony by the two police officers and Mr. and Mrs. Feeney about what Ms. Castro told them happened on the night of the incident) constitute hearsay, but the critical item of hearsay--the transcript of the police interview with Ms. Castro on the night of the incident--was not even authenticated, <span class="Italic">see</span> Fed. R. Evid. 901. On top of this, the Board rejected some of the factual findings of the administrative judge who, unlike the Board, heard live witness testimony. Although these failings do not constitute reversible error in this case, they certainly raise concerns about fairness in these types of proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, neither the Office of Personnel Management nor the Board has articulated any consistent or comprehensive standard for when private, off-duty actions may lead to workplace discipline, whether they constitute "good cause" or satisfy the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">See Doe,</span> 565 F.3d at 1380-81. In <span class="Italic">Doe,</span> we overturned the Board's decision sustaining the removal of a federal law enforcement officer for "clearly dishonest" conduct because the Board "failed to articulate a meaningful standard as to when private dishonesty rises to [a] level of misconduct" where discipline is warranted under the "efficiency of the service" standard. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1380. We explained that "without a predetermined standard [concerning when off-duty misconduct can subject employees to discipline] ...federal employees are not on notice as to what off-duty behavior is subject to investigation and the government could use this overly broad standard to legitimize removals made for personal or political reasons." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1381. Although the standards issue was not properly raised by the petitioner in this case, these same concerns also apply to the removal of ALJs for off-duty misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These features of the present case--the criminal nature of the charges, the prevalence of hearsay and non-authenticated evidence, the rejection of the administrative judge's findings, and the lack of a comprehensive standard--are disquieting. There is room for such Board action in unusual cases, and this appears to be one of those cases. This is so because of the seriousness of the charge, the fact that the altercation spurred police involvement, the strength of the hearsay evidence, the relatively small number of differences between the Board and administrative judge on their views of the facts, and the failure of Long to raise the standards issue. However, the Board must engage in such proceedings only in the most unusual circumstances or risk reversal by this court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Citing <span class="Italic">Long</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Boini,</span> CB-7521-13-0192-T-1 (NP 2/22/2016), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board consistently has held that the position of an administrative law judge is one of prominence and that an administrative law judge must not conduct himself in a manner that undermines public confidence in the administrative adjudicatory process. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 40. This means, at a minimum, that an administrative law judge must not violate generally accepted rules of conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board also has found that the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct is an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of administrative law judges. <span class="Italic">Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 41. The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct underscores that confidence in the judiciary is eroded by both professional and personal misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct is cited in several Board decisions involving ALJ discipline and would likely be relied on by agencies and the Board in misconduct cases affecting the trustworthiness of a judge or the appearance of issues concerning a judge's integrity.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">VA v. Chiappetta</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/CHIAPPETTA_DENNIS_CB_7521_16_0014_N_1_FINAL_ORDER_AND_ORDER_DENYING_REQUEST_FOR_A_STAY_1982835.pdf">CB-7521-16-0014-N-1</a> (NP 12/2/2022), departed from the Board's reliance on the Model Code in a penalty analysis, possibly, in part, because the agency did not rely on it in its complaint against the judge, and possibly, in part, because of the need to examine the facts of a case rather than broad pronouncements of the Code:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although he found that the issue of good cause was not in dispute, the ALJ nevertheless found it appropriate to review the facts establishing good cause. In doing so, he considered the American Bar Association's (ABA) Model Code of Judicial Conduct, upon which the agency also relied in establishing good cause in its complaint. <span class="italic">See Social Security Administration v. Long</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 41 (2010) (finding the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct to be an appropriate guide for evaluating the conduct of ALJs), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 635 F.3d 526 (Fed. Cir. 2011). He found that the respondent's actions and inactions violated ABA Model Rule 1.2, which provides that "[a] judge shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the independence, integrity, and impartiality of the judiciary, and shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. " He further found that the respondent's failure to report offensive emails sent by other FOH members violated Model Rule 2.15, which sets forth requirements to report certain misconduct by other judges and attorneys.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the respondent's arguments concerning the Model Code pertain chiefly to Model Rule 2.15, he also appears to argue that the ALJ treated his violation of Model Rule 1.2 as an aggravating factor in the penalty analysis, and that the ALJ erred in doing so. We are not convinced by this argument. First, the respondent does not explain why he believes that his violation of Model Rule 1.2 should not have figured into the penalty determination. <span class="italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133-34 (1980). Second, the ALJ does not appear to have considered the violation of Model Rule 1.2 as an aggravating factor, although he did mention it in assessing the nature and seriousness of the offense. The ALJ considered this matter primarily in connection with his good cause determination, and we find that it was completely appropriate for him to do so. <span class="italic">See Long v. Social Security Administration</span>, 635 F.3d 526, 535 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Nevertheless, we find that the respondent's violation of Model Rule 1.2 is far less instructive on the issue of penalty than it is on good cause because the Model Rule is written so broadly that nearly any sort of actionable misconduct could fall within its purview. Although this fits well with the good cause standard, which is itself quite broad, <span class="italic">see Long</span>, 635 F.3d at 535-36, the mere fact that the respondent violated Model Rule 1.2 tells us almost nothing about the particular circumstances of his case, <span class="italic">cf. McGowan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 314, 317 (1985) (explaining that the Board tailors its penalty analysis to the unique circumstances of each case). We therefore find that the respondent's violation of Rule 1.2 of the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct carries little weight in the penalty analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Mills</span>, 73 MSPR 463, 467-69 (1996), provided an explanation of the "good cause" requirement without analysis of or reliance on the Model Code:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By statute, an agency may take an action against an Administrative Law Judge only for "good cause," as determined by the Board. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7521(a) (1994). An action includes removal<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7521(b)(1). The "good cause" standard was included in the original text of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which created the position of hearing examiner (predecessor to the ALJ). APA, Pub. L. No. 79-404, &#x00A7; 11, 60 Stat. 237, 244 (1946)<span class="Italic">. See</span> Pub. L. No. 95-251, 92 Stat. 183 (1978) (changing title of federal hearing examiner to Administrative Law Judge). Congress explicitly declined to define the phrase "good cause," used in several sections of the law, in order to allow the appropriate authorities to interpret it "within the context of the provision in which it is found, and the purpose of the entire section and bill." <span class="Italic">See</span> APA: Legislative History at 215 (statement of Senator McCarren).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, if the agency takes action against an ALJ, and that action may be characterized as either arbitrary or politically-motivated interference, or as an attempt to influence decisional independence, the action cannot be found to be supported by good cause<span class="Italic">. See Brennan v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1563 (Fed. Cir.) (agency's decision to suspend petitioner for up to 60 days for disruptive and insubordinate conduct does not constitute interference with decisional independence), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 985 (1986); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR 321, 327-28 (1984) (performance-based actions against ALJ's are not precluded as a matter of law). This is a question of fact, to be decided on a case by case basis<span class="Italic">. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR at 328. If the agency's action is not a result of improper interference, then the Board may consider whether the evidence presented establishes good cause<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Once the agency makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the removal was for good cause, the employee has the burden of rebutting the evidence<span class="Italic">. Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1563.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain an adverse action against an employee, an agency is normally required to show only that the action promotes the "efficiency of the service." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a). While the good cause and efficiency of the <span id="Page_2240"></span>service standards are not the same, efficiency of the service cases can "provide guidance" in section 7521 cases<span class="Italic">. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR at 330 n.8. In <span class="Italic">Ward v. General Services Administration</span>, 28 MSPR 207, 208 (1985), decided under the section 7513 efficiency of the service standard, the appellant was removed from her position because of a physical inability to perform her duties. The Board held that "an employee's absence for which no foreseeable end is in sight constitutes a burden which no employer can efficiently endure. Such absences have long been considered just cause for removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 209. We agree with the CALJ that the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> is equally applicable to subchapter III removals under the good cause standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also held that good cause is not the equivalent of the good behavior standard for federal judges<span class="Italic">. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR at 326. Thus, while federal judges may only be removed, after impeachment and conviction, for "Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors," U.S. Const. art. II, &#x00A7; 4, ALJ's can be, and have been, removed for other reasons<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McEachern v. Macy</span>, 341 F.2d 895 (4th Cir. 1965) (financial irresponsibility); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Burris</span>, 39 MSPR 51 (1988) (insubordination, intemperate use of abusive language, and misuse of free mail privilege), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 878 F.2d 1445 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 493 U.S. 855 (1989); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57 (1984) (poor performance).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Definition of "good cause" concerning actions against ALJs is developed in <span class="Italic">Brennan v. DHHS</span>, 787 F.2d 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1986), involving a complaint brought against an ALJ who was alleged to have "displayed a pattern of disruptive, insubordinate, obstructionist and dilatory conduct...and followed his own procedures regardless of established office routine and standard procedures." On its first review of the case (before a remand to the Board's ALJ for further analysis), the Board declared in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Brennan</span>, 19 MSPR 335, 340 (1984), that insubordinate conduct could be good cause for removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An ALJ's independence is qualified. It does not provide immunity from appropriate supervision. Where a management need exists to impose reasonable requirements which would not affect an ALJ's ability to provide full and fair hearings and to render impartial and complete decisions, an ALJ would not be justified in refusing to comply with such instructions. Respondent's defense to the third specification should be analyzed in order to determine if the manner in which the agency was attempting to meet its proven need for greater productivity improperly interfered with respondent's ability to hold full and fair hearings and render complete and reasoned decisions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a remand decision, the Board authorized the agency to suspend Judge Brennan for 60 days. The Board commented on the ALJ's alleged disruptive office behavior and insubordinate speech, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Brennan</span>, 27 MSPR 242, 248-51 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the testimony, respondent insisted that all mail on his cases be delivered first to him. This prevented the support staff from determining whether necessary steps in processing a case had been accomplished or whether it was necessary and appropriate for them to initiate other or exceptional actions. They were unable to report on the status of a case to interested parties and for valid managerial planning purposes. Witnesses testified that respondent actively resisted using the standard worksheets and documenting case processing, with similar disruptive effects. This conduct continued over at least a substantial part of 1981, the period to which the complaint was limited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent's contention that his personal preferences in these matters is "arguably" within the zone of his decisional independence is hollow. His own testimony clearly establishes that he would not cooperate because he preferred to do things his own way.... [R]espondent utterly fails to show that the office procedures were unreasonable or that if respondent had adhered to them he would have been unable to give full and fair hearings to complainants or to render impartial and independent decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor can respondent successfully claim his disruptive conduct was protected expression under the First Amendment. The record here presents clear and uncontradictory evidence that respondent knew the purpose of the changes within the hearing office where he was employed and the procedures whereby they would be effectuated. He himself characterized his behavioral response as expressing a difference in approach to office procedures. The situation presented by respondent's reactions is not unlike that in <span class="Italic">Foster v.</span> <span class="Italic">Ripley,</span> 645 F.2d 1142 (D.C. Cir. 1981). In that case the court held that the internal reorganization of the Library of Congress was a matter of little public interest and concern in the context of the First Amendment. In particular, the court held: "...Foster was not speaking out on issues of general public concern, [he] was merely airing an internal dispute over the extent of his supervisory powers." 645 F.2d at 1149. The conclusion is inescapable on this record that the office situation here was not a matter of public concern. <span class="Italic">See Connick v. Myers,</span> 461 U.S. 138, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 75 L. Ed.2d 708 (1983). Respondent's disruptive conduct was an expression of his personal dissatisfaction and enjoys no constitutional protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has failed in his defenses. We find his disruptive conduct good cause for discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The third issue still before the Board concerns the specification in support of Charge 11 that respondent was personally abusive to the ALJIC of the office where respondent worked. Judge Reidy found this allegation proven and found that the personal abuse of the ALJIC constituted good cause for discipline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The alleged personal abuse arose from a memorandum written to the ALJIC by respondent. The memorandum is not in the record. Respondent admitted during his testimony, however, that he wrote a memorandum to the ALJIC commenting that the ALJIC was not properly handling his own cases and that he controlled his staff by improper authorization of overtime and promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its Opinion and Order remanding this proceeding the Board noted that disrespectful comments by a subordinate may support an adverse action under the efficiency of the service standard because disrespect disrupts the supervisory relationship. The Board asked for a determination as to whether similar comments made by an ALJ to an ALJIC should constitute good cause under section 7521. The Board stated that the form, manner, and content of respondent's memorandum to the ALJIC were relevant and expressed the need for an analysis of the effect of the memorandum on the professional relationship between an ALJ and an ALJIC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this instance, so far as the record shows, the critical comments were directed to the ALJIC only; they occurred in a single memorandum; they were not disseminated elsewhere, either within or without the office; they were not expressed in abusive or threatening language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, without deciding, that the comments enjoyed no Constitutional protection under the First Amendment, we must nevertheless find against the agency. The ALJIC testified that he considered the comments abusive and demeaning. He did not testify to what, if any, effect the comments might have had on his professional relationship with the respondent or with the administrative prerogatives the ALJIC exercised over members of the support staff or other ALJs. Although the comments were made during the period of respondent's disruptive conduct, the ALJIC did not testify that he considered his administrative authority affected in any way by the respondent's remarks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Those situations in which a subordinate shows disrespect to a supervisor affect the relationship because of the close association between supervisor and subordinate and the need for the supervisor to have confidence in and loyalty from the subordinate in the performance of his duties. Disrespectful comments by a subordinate to a supervisor may be cause for discipline because of the <span class="Italic">effect</span> such comments are considered to have on the efficiency of the service.[8] The Board has observed that insolent disrespect toward supervisors so seriously undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline that it goes to the heart of the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 6 MSPB 297, 6 MSPR 348 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In appeals decisions under the efficiency of the service standard, the Board has distinguished merely critical comments from loud, abusive, threatening, obscene, or sexually suggestive comments. <span class="Italic">Compare Wheat v. Veterans Administration,</span> 21 MSPR 54 (1984) (appellant's telling his supervisor that he was untruthful and that appellant did not trust him was not insulting or insubordinate) <span class="Italic">with Muldrow v. Veterans Administration,</span> 22 MSPR 586 (1984) (shouting and making sexually suggestive and threatening comments was insubordinate) and <span class="Italic">Hemelt v. Veterans Administration,</span> 21 MSPR 74 (1984) (use of insulting, abusive, and obscene language was insubordinate).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike those situations, the ALJ and the ALJIC perform their adjudicatory functions independently of each other. The ALJIC's performance of his limited administrative functions within the office does not require the personal loyalty of respondent or entail a professional relationship that would be damaged by respondent's critical comments. Nor is the efficiency of the service the standard in disciplining an ALJ. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover,</span> 23 MSPR 57 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case of an ALJIC and ALJ, whether disrespectful comments would impair the relationship is a matter of proof. Considering the largely independent performance of their duties, the limited administrative function of an ALJIC, the circumstances of respondent's comments here and the lack of any evidence of an adverse effect on the relationship resulting from these comments, we find that the agency has failed to establish the critical memorandum as good cause for discipline.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57 (1984). The Board held that the single private use of a vulgar epithet by an ALJ to an ALJIC who was trying to resolve an administrative matter was not serious in the context of the case. Nevertheless, the Board considered it misconduct to be considered with more serious misconduct in assessing the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2241"></span>The respondent's disruption of the office is serious. It continued throughout a substantial portion of 1981. Respondent holds the position of administrative law judge, a position of prominence, whose incumbents usually engender great respect and whose cooperation within the office should be taken for granted. We note that respondent has served as an administrative law judge for some nine years without incident and during the time in question here was experiencing some nagging physical ailments. Considering these factors, the Board believes that a penalty of a 60-day suspension without pay is reasonable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reviewed the Board's <span class="Italic">Brennan</span> decisions and addressed the definition of "good cause," in <span class="Italic">Brennan v. DHHS</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 787 F.2d at 1561-63:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress intentionally failed to define "good cause" in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Rather, "good cause" is to be given meaning through judicial interpretation as is evident by Senator McCarran's comments in the APA's legislative history:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t will be the duty of reviewing courts...to determine the meaning of the words and phrases used, insofar as they have not been defined in the bill itself. For example, in several provisions of the bill, the expression "good cause" is used. The cause so specified must be interpreted by the context of the provision in which it is found, and the purpose of the entire section and bill. The cause found must be real and demonstrable. If the agency is proceeding upon a statutory hearing and record the cause will appear there; otherwise, it must be such that the agency may show the facts and considerations warranting the finding in any proceeding in which the finding is challenged. The same would be true in the case of findings other than of good cause, required in the bill....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A succinct definition for "good cause" has not been provided by the judiciary. However, in <span class="Italic">Ramspeck v. Federal Trial Examiners Conference</span>, 345 U.S. 128 (1953), the Court ruled that reduction in force procedures were applicable to ALJs. In so ruling, the Court rejected the assertion that by enacting the APA Congress intended ALJs to be the equivalent of federal judges and that "good cause" should be equated with the "good behavior" standard applicable to Article III judges. While Congress' "good cause" standard was left to the courts to define, APA does provide the parameters within which the courts must work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The APA has provisions to insure the decisional independence of the ALJs[1], and prohibits substantive review and supervision of an ALJ's performance of his quasi-judicial functions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 500, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> (1982).[2] This is not to say that there are prohibitions against appropriate administrative supervision that is required in the course of general office management. Federal appellate courts have shed some light as to the proper interpretation of the statutory "good cause" standard and have authorized removals for financial irresponsibility, <span class="Italic">McEachern v. Macy</span>, 233 F. Supp. 5166 (D.S.C. 1964), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 341 F.2d 895 (4th Cir. 1965), and physical incapacitation. <span class="Italic">Benton v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1017 (Ct. Cl. 1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;As observed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Butz v. Economou</span>, 438 U.S. 478, 513 (1978), "the process of agency adjudication is currently structured so as to assure that the hearing examiner exercises his independent judgment on the evidence before him, free from pressures by the parties or other officials within the agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;ALJs are exempt from performance appraisals under Chapter 43. 5 USC 4301 (1982). ALJs are independent of investigative or prosecutorial personnel in the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 554(d). Periodic step pay increases are given without certification by the employing agency that the ALJ is performing at an acceptable level of competence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 5335. Once appointed an ALJ is not subject to the usual probationary period for agency employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 3321(c). An ALJ can be disqualified from a case only upon petition by either the agency or a private party. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 554(d). Cases are assigned to the ALJs in rotation so far as practicable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 3105. The ALJs may not perform duties that are inconsistent with their duties as judges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 3105. The ALJ may issue subpoenas, rule on proffered evidence, and regulate the course of the hearing.... An ALJ may not consult any person or party, including agency officials, concerning a fact at issue in the hearing, unless a notice and an opportunity for all parties to participate is provided. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. 554(d)(1). Parties present their case by oral and documentary evidence...and the transcript of testimony, exhibits, and pleadings constitute the exclusive record for decision.... The ALJs in all their decisions must make findings and conclusions on all issues of fact, law, or discretion presented on the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Determining the existence of "good cause" is not a simple task, but a task that is commenced by stating what "good cause" is not. If the agency bases a charge on reasons which constitute an improper interference with the ALJ's performance of his quasi-judicial functions, the charge cannot constitute "good cause." Whether the charge is based on reasons which interfere with the quasi-judicial function is a question of fact and must be answered on a case by case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Board, after a full hearing, determined that the nature of the charge brought against petitioner amounted to his failure to comply with office administrative procedures. The Board further determined that the procedures did not interfere with the ALJ's decisional independence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner contends that the agency failed to prove that the charge did not interfere with his decisional independence. Petitioner further asserts that the burden of proving such interference was erroneously placed on him. On the contrary, petitioner has mischaracterized what actually occurred at his hearing. The burden of proving the charge by a preponderance of the evidence is and remains throughout the proceeding upon the agency. However, "once an agency has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing, the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut that showing necessarily shifts to the employee.... Absent effective rebuttal, the agency must be held to have carried its burden of persuasion."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here...the Board took into account all facts and circumstances and we find that the record clearly contains substantial evidence to support the finding of no decisional interference. <span class="Italic">Consolidated Edison Co. v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938). We cannot as a matter of law rule that the administrative procedures complained of by petitioner interfere with an ALJ's decisional independence. Therefore, the Board's determination is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brennan</span> affirmed the 60-day suspension that was approved by the Board. The court concluded that the determination of the penalty was primarily within the agency's discretion, that not all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors must be considered, that only relevant factors need be considered, and that the penalty would be set aside only if it was grossly disproportionate to the offense or if the penalty exceeded that permitted by statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v.
