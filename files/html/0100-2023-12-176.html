<h5 class="h5" id="sec5-175"><span class="space">f.</span> Physical or Mental Condition of Appellant or Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There are four points bearing upon applications to excuse PFRs filed belatedly because of the appellant's medical condition. First, there is the matter of whether the appellant was ill; second, the Board expects that there be a connection made between the effects of the illness and the delay in filing; third, the appellant may be expected to produce documentation of the illness before the Board will seriously consider the waiver request; fourth, the appellant must file her PFR quickly after cessation of the disabling condition. Some decisions involving late PFRs may suggest that if an individual is incapacitated for a portion of the filing period, she should use the remainder of the filing period to perfect the PFR. But there are decisions in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-064.html#sec2-63">Sickness or Hospitalization</a>," involving late appeals that imply that if a person is disabled for a portion of the filing period for the appeal, the appellant should have the benefit of the full filing period once the disability ceases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The delay in filing a PFR by an individual suffering a medical condition will receive consideration from the Board based on that condition and other factors, <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ORTIZ_ISAIAS_CH_0752_02_0318_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247235.pdf">103 MSPR 621</a>, 627-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-25, 2006 MSPB 305 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant acknowledges that his PFR was filed "long after the Board's finality date." As noted above, the PFR was filed slightly more than 3 years after the finality date. The appellant argues, however, that the effects of his depression and other medical conditions constitute good cause for the delay in filing his PFR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will excuse the untimely filing of a PFR only upon a showing of good cause for the delay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(f). To establish good cause for an untimely filing, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">the Board must consider the length of the delay in every good cause determination<span class="Italic">. Walls v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Here, the length of the delay in filing the PFR--more than 3 years--is very significant. <span class="Italic">See Summers v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 403, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 12 (2000) (describing delays of 15 days and 1 month in filing petitions for review as "significant"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 25 Fed. Appx. 827 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant relies on his illnesses to justify his delay in filing. To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, the party must: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering all of the relevant factors under <span class="Italic">Moorman</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 62-63, we conclude that the appellant has not shown good cause for the delay of more than 3 years in filing his PFR. He clearly suffered from depression and other conditions during the relevant time period, and it appears from the appellant's statement and Dr. Cantor's letter that those conditions had at least some impact on his ability to meet the filing deadline. Certainly, the appellant's medical conditions would justify some amount of delay in filing his PFR. <span class="Italic">See Earl v. Department of the Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-10 (1998) (finding good cause for a delay of slightly more than 3 months where the appellant's depression and other conditions caused a "significant decline in her overall level of cognitive functioning"); <span class="Italic">Le Master v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1998) (finding good cause for a delay of 8 days where the appellant's depression "made him unable to complete routine life tasks"). However, given the extremely lengthy delay in this case, we find that the evidence submitted by the appellant is insufficient to justify the entire period of the delay. Dr. Cantor's letter indicates that the appellant had difficulty remaining employed, but does not state that his condition was so severe that he could not file a PFR or seek help to do so. <span class="Italic">E.g., Earl</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 194, &#x00B6; 9 (the appellant's doctor indicated that she was not competent to file forms or claims during the period of the delay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant, an attorney, was able to represent himself quite competently before the administrative judge. He responded promptly and appropriately to the administrative judge's order and provided both legal and factual support for his claims. We further note that the appellant has represented himself in an equally competent manner on PFR. He has made reasoned legal arguments and presented supporting evidence for his positions with respect to both the merits and the timeliness of his PFR. There is no evidence showing that the appellant's condition in November and December 2002, during which he should have timely filed his PFR, was significantly worse than earlier in 2002, when he was able to represent himself before the administrative judge. Nor is there evidence that his condition in December 2005, when he eventually filed his PFR, was significantly better than at any time during the preceding 3 years. In the absence of such evidence, we are unable to conclude that the appellant's medical conditions justify the lengthy delay in filing his PFR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's medical conditions, while serious, simply do not justify his failure to file his PFR or to request an extension, either on his own or with the assistance of others, for more than 3 years after the filing deadline. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not shown good cause for the untimely filing of his PFR, and we therefore dismiss it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The type of information that should be supplied to the Board to excuse an untimely PFR was indirectly described in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LACY_GREGORY_M_SF_0752_97_0367_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199726.pdf">78 MSPR 434</a>, 437-38 (1998), imposing on AJs the requirement of notifying an appellant what information must be provided to the AJ when the appellant asserts that injury or illness affected his ability to file a timely appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will find good cause for waiver of its filing time limits where a party demonstrates that he suffered from an illness that affected his ability to file on time. <span class="Italic">See generally Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 MSPR 254, 256 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 991 F.2d 808 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, the party must: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See generally Andrews v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 MSPR 147, 151 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an appellant states that the reason for a filing delay is physical or mental illness, he must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis, and he must be afforded a fair opportunity to submit evidence and argument to show that he met that standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement that information to the appellant be provided by the Board as to how a waiver can be requested applies to belated PFRs, if the Board is on notice that a medical condition is urged to excuse the filing delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. MSPB</span>, 168 F.3d 1305 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Simpson v.

The <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice described in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 434, 437-38 (1998), is not optional. It cannot be omitted when the Board is on fair notice that the appellant asserts that illness may have resulted in a late PFR, irrespective of the Board's belief that the appellant would not have been able to comply with or meet the <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kelley v. MSPB</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 103, 105-06 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP).</p>

OPM</span>, 85 MSPR 371, 374-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2000), concerning waiver of the deadline for a PFR filed by a person who was apparently suffering from mental incompetence while she attempted to secure (and litigated the denial of) a retirement annuity, that it is "inappropriate to require strict adherence to Board procedures by mentally ill appellants":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that good cause exists for waiving the petition for review filing deadline. In that regard, we find that the evidence submitted is <span id="Page_1757"></span>sufficient to meet the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 434 (1998). For example, in an August 3, 1993 letter to OPM, Dr. Thomas C. Scott stated that the appellant had been a patient of his since October 10, 1992. He further stated that she has a "disabling emotional problem that has prohibited her from understanding her disability and the process involved," and "very direct evidence of a personality disorder and a manic-depressive disorder." He concluded "with all reasonable medical certainty that [the appellant] is permanently and totally disabled." Where a party is diagnosed with a medical condition that is by its nature permanent or progressive in severity, it will be assumed to continue to exist after the date of diagnosis absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Saroli v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 MSPR 249, 252 &#x00B6; 9 (1999); <span class="Italic">see also Terry v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 MSPR 128, 130 &#x00B6; 5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More significantly, in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">reh'g denied</span>, 823 F.2d 489 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, having found that the appellant was presently mentally incompetent, not only instructed the Board to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation in disability retirement appeals for appellants who assert that they are incompetent, but also held that it is patently unreasonable and fundamentally unfair to require or allow a presently incompetent person to show his own incompetence for many years in the past. In doing so, it cited the obvious desire of Congress that employees who become disabled during honorable service as a result of mental incompetence not lose their entitlements because of the effects of their illness. It noted that an appellant need not have been a "raving lunatic" continuously from the period in issue to trigger the statutory waiver provision. Rather, the statute may be satisfied "by one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1119-20; <span class="Italic">see Saroli,</span> 83 MSPR 249, 252-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, it is clear that both Congress and the court believe it inappropriate to require strict adherence to Board procedures by mentally ill appellants. Accordingly, we find that it is in the interests of adjudicatory efficiency to find that the appellant is presently incompetent and to waive our time limits for filing a petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Terry,</span> 83 MSPR 128, 129-30 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a mental disorder claimed to have caused a filing delay, there may be a duty of the Board to exercise special care in examining the record for supporting evidence. Alternatively, the Board may be expected to take special pains to ensure the record is adequately developed to make an informed finding on the claimed mental impairment and its relationship to the delayed filing. The Federal Circuit stated as to a belated petition for enforcement, <span class="Italic">Vargo v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3410):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The attorney for Vargo contends, as he did before the board, that the mental condition of his client prevented gaining access to Vargo's medical information to file with the board. He proffers to this court some sketchy evidence that could indicate mental disability. The history of this case, including the board's earlier waiver of an untimely filing and the findings of the United States Postal Service (USPS), seems to support the claim of mental disability. The MSPB in Vargo's original appeal recognized that he suffered from mental and emotional problems and found that good cause existed for the untimely filing of that appeal. It is also undisputed that the USPS documentation at the time Vargo was suspended from his position indicated that he had "mental and/or emotional problems" that classify him as "a hazard to [himself] or [his] fellow employees." There are, thus, clear indications that Vargo has in the past suffered from some mental disabilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the record in this particular petition for enforcement, the board found that Vargo was able to pursue back pay and benefits from the USPS following his settlement agreement and that no evidence established mental disability sufficient to show good cause for the untimely filing. While that may be true on the limited record in this case, we are convinced that the board should consider fully the record in the prior board cases involving Vargo and such evidence as may be in the USPS files that relate to Vargo's disability. The board may also consider the sketchy evidence presented to this court together with any evidence of recent treatment if Vargo's attorney can obtain authorization for its release promptly. Based on such additional information, the board can determine more accurately whether Vargo has a continuing mental disability that would give rise to good cause for waiving the untimeliness of his petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Pyles v. MSPB</span>, 45 F.3d 411, 413 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Turman-Kent</span> was affirmed by the Federal Circuit (Circuit Judge Reyna dissenting), <span class="Italic">Turman-Kent v. MSPB</span>, 657 F.3d 1280, 1282-84 (Fed. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering Ms. Turman-Kent's motion, the Board denied her petition for review as untimely filed. The Board found the statement of Dr. Cavanaugh insufficient to support Ms. Turman-Kent's claim because Dr. Cavanaugh had not examined Ms. Turman-Kent for several years during the six-year period of delay in filing her petition for review. The Board noted that Dr. Cavanaugh did not allege that she reviewed Ms. Turman-Kent's medical records for that time period, and it observed that Dr. Cavanaugh's statement post-dated the filing of Ms. Turman-Kent's petition for review. Finding no credible medical evidence regarding Ms. Turman-Kent's condition between June 2004 and July 2006, the Board determined that Ms. Turman-Kent "ha[d] not submitted sufficient evidence to support that her medical condition impaired her ability to timely file her petition for review, or to request an extension of time."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Turman-Kent bears a "heavy burden" to overturn the Board's determination that good cause has not been shown for her untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 332 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">see Mendoza v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) ("whether the regulatory time limit for an appeal should be waived based upon a showing of good cause is a matter committed to the Board's discretion"). Board regulations require tardy petitioners to file a "specific and detailed description of the circumstances causing the late filing, accompanied by supporting documentation or other evidence." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(f). The Board has held that when petitioners allege delay for medical reasons, they must affirmatively identify medical evidence that addresses the entire period of delay. <span class="Italic">Jerusalem v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 660, 663, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 280 Fed. Appx. 973 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Turman-Kent did not provide the Board with medical evidence that accounted for the entire six-year period of delay at issue in this case. In particular, there was no medical evidence regarding her condition between June 2004 and July 2006. The Board found it probative that Dr. Cavanaugh had not examined Ms. Turman-Kent during the year prior to her husband's death or for a three-year period after his death. Ms. Turman-Kent states that she saw two other physicians during that period when she lived in Georgia, yet no evidence from either of those physicians was presented, nor did Dr. Cavanaugh purport to rely on any such evidence in her evaluation of Ms. Turman-Kent's condition during that period. The dissent refers to a letter written by Ms. Turman-Kent's neurologist in 1988. That letter, which predates the period in question by 16 years, simply addresses the circumstances giving rise to Ms. Turman-Kent's illness and the fact that she would not be able to continue in her previous profession as an accountant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recognized that the length of delay is an important factor for the Board to consider in determining whether a petitioner has shown good cause for an untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The length of delay in this case--six years--is exceptional. Even in cases of ongoing illness, the Board has found the absence of medical evidence covering the entirety of a multi-year period to be fatal to a finding of good cause. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 223, 227 (1999) (noting that documentation of mental illness from 1988 to 1996 did not excuse absence of medical evidence from period between 1996 and 1999); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 305, 309 (1998) (evidence of "recurrent major depressive disorder" diagnosed in 1995 did not establish petitioner's condition between 1995 and 1997). The Board did not abuse its discretion in demanding a well-documented explanation of the cause for Ms. Turman-Kent's delay in filing her appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before this court, Ms. Turman-Kent has submitted several pieces of medical evidence that were not presented to the Board. That evidence includes several annual disability certifications issued to her by the Social Security Administration, numerous pharmacy reports of medicines prescribed to her between 2003 and 2011, and an additional letter from Dr. Cavanaugh dated March 2011 that elaborates on Ms. Turman-Kent's condition. Because those items were not presented to the Board, they are not part of the record on appeal and are not properly before us. <span class="Italic">See Mueller v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 76 F.3d 1198, 1201-02 (Fed. Cir. 1996) ("Because we are limited to reviewing decisions of the Board based on the record before the deciding official, we decline to base our judgment on evidence that was not part of the record before the administrative judge.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1758"></span>The dissent relies on our decision in <span class="Italic">Pyles v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 45 F.3d 411 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> presented the Board with a medical finding that she had "increasingly severe dementia," a "progressive organic brain disease[ ]" defined by "the loss of intellectual faculties." This court concluded that unrebutted medical evidence of dementia was sufficient to establish good cause for untimely filing. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 415. The dissent argues that because brain cell death caused by an intracerebral hemorrhage is permanent, <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> requires the Board to adopt a presumption that Ms. Turman-Kent's cognitive function could not have improved at any point during her six-year delay in filing a petition for review. However, our holding in <span class="Italic">Pyles</span> was predicated not only on the permanence of dementia but also on its very nature as "[a] structurally caused permanent or progressive decline in several dimensions of intellectual function that interferes substantially with the individual's normal social or economic activity." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The medical literature cited by the dissent does not suggest that cognitive function never improves in persons who have suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Turman-Kent's motion before the Board states that her illness had temporarily "flare[d] out of control," but that at some later time her condition had "shifted" and "improved" and she "became better able to remember business details, at times." That statement conflicts with Dr. Cavanaugh's assessment of Ms. Turman-Kent's condition as "stable" throughout the six-year period of delay. Moreover, Ms. Turman-Kent timely filed pleadings before OPM in 2003 and before the Board in 2004. Those filings were made during the multiyear period in which she was not under the care of Dr. Cavanaugh, and they undermine her claim of an ongoing, irreversible medical condition suffered a quarter-century ago that has permanently prevented her from timely filing paperwork in support of her claim. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 621, 630 (2006) (finding no good cause for delay due to ongoing illness where evidence did not explain change in circumstances between period in which appellant complied with Board deadlines and period in which he failed to comply); <span class="Italic">Choco v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 638, 641 (1996) (rejecting appellant's contention that he was precluded from timely filing a petition for review for more than five years, "especially in view of the fact that he was able to file a petition for review with the Board's regional office" four months before his petition for review was due for filing); <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 559, 562 (1995) (no good cause for eight-month delay in filing petition for review when appellant "was capable of filing a petition for enforcement [of a settlement agreement]" early in that period); <span class="Italic">Sing v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1991) (finding appellant's allegations of incapacity to file paperwork in a timely fashion undermined by timely filing of other papers during the period in question).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The procedures set forth in this court's decision in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1987), for claimants seeking disability retirement benefits are available only upon a showing of incompetence. <span class="Italic">See Rapp v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 483 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Frank v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 206, 209 (2009) (same for claimant seeking survivor annuity). In this case, the Board found that Ms. Turman-Kent has not shown that she was incompetent or otherwise incapable of filing a petition for review during the entire period of delay. Therefore, the decision in <span class="Italic">French</span> does not provide an independent ground for reversing the Board's ruling in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Turman-Kent also alleges that she did not receive "proper forms" in a timely manner and was therefore unable to file a timely petition for review. The document that she references is the January 2004 OPM reconsideration decision letter that denied her claim for survivor benefits. Following her receipt of that letter, Ms. Turman-Kent filed a timely appeal with the Board contesting OPM's denial of her claim for benefits. The OPM reconsideration letter is irrelevant to the timeliness of her subsequent petition for review by the full Board of the administrative judge's initial decision, which is the issue before us. Ms. Turman-Kent has never alleged that she did not receive the administrative judge's initial decision informing her of the deadline for submitting a petition for review to the full Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Ms. Turman-Kent states that she was hospitalized for hallucinations and seizures during the period following her return to Illinois. That allegation does not constitute evidence of her condition between June 2004 and July 2006 because she did not return to Illinois until after that time period. Her statement therefore cannot undermine the Board's ruling. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Ms. Turman-Kent's petition for review as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant claims he was too ill to file the PFR, he should demonstrate that a representative already involved, or someone else, could not have filed it on his behalf or requested an extension of time for filing. <span class="Italic">Duatin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's determination that Petitioner's medical evidence failed to show good cause based on illness was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner contends that the delay was the result of depression and deep vein thrombosis, but did not provide evidence of a medical condition that prevented a timely filing between April 30, 2009 and April 17, 2010--the entire period of delay. The record evidence describing Petitioner's depression is limited to episodes occurring in mid-2008, many months prior to the relevant period. The only medical evidence actually dated from within the period of delay was for deep vein thrombosis; but, as the Board properly found, there is no accompanying explanation of how this condition prevented a timely filing.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's supporting medical documentation, Dr. Acosta stated in his January 10, 1995 medical statement that the appellant was "suffering from severe stress, aggravating her physical health," and advised that she be permitted "a leave of absence for about 6 weeks."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his January 18, 1995 medical statement, Dr. Acosta stated that the appellant was under his care, that she was suffering from chronic anxiety that was controlled with medication, and that she had recently been experiencing many physical symptoms that she claimed were stress related. Dr. Acosta stated that he agreed that the appellant's "stress and anxiety level [was] very high, and she need[ed] to learn to cope." He noted that the appellant believed that her job was "one of her major stressors" and recommended that she be granted a 6-week absence from work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his March 6, 1995 medical statement, Dr. Acosta, in addition to reiterating the appellant's conditions, stated that she was "emotionally in no shape to return to work" and recommended a continued leave of absence for an additional 3-weeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in his April 3, 1995 medical statement, Dr. Acosta stated that the <span id="Page_1761"></span>appellant still remained under his care and was unable to return to work at that time. He recommended an additional 2 weeks of leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Dr. Acosta's medical statements indicate that the appellant was experiencing job-related stress and anxiety problems, those statements neither establish that the appellant's problems prevented her from timely filing her appeal nor explain how they prevented her from doing so. <span class="Italic">See Blaine</span>, 59 MSPR at 452; <span class="Italic">see also Booker</span>, 53 MSPR at 470.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Reed v. GSA</span>, 38 MSPR 346, 348 (1988), after the appellant lost his case before the Board with an attorney and, after he unsuccessfully pursued an appeal to the Federal Circuit <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, he engaged another attorney, filed a PFR, and sought to have the Board reopen his case to receive additional evidence substantiating his claim that he was suffering from a mental disability. The appellant provided the affidavit of a physician who said that the appellant's "judgment and thinking have been more impaired than had been suspected." In his affidavit to the Board, the appellant stated that he was under a psychiatrist's care and was not mentally competent to "assist" in his appeal. The Board declined to waive the time limit that barred the PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he medical report from the appellant's doctor merely states in a conclusory manner that the appellant's judgment and thinking must have been more impaired than had been suspected given the handling of his appeal. It is also significant that the report does not state that the appellant was mentally incompetent. Moreover, his designation of an attorney to represent him in his appeal, and his subsequent <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appeal of the initial decision to the Federal Circuit, are actions that belie an assertion of mental incompetence....</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marquez v. OPM</span>, 54 MSPR 89, 91 (1992), illustrated the Board's approach to some cases involving appellants who seek to justify long delays in filing based on illness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim of poor health alone is not sufficient to establish a medical condition that rendered him immobile and unable to function on his own behalf every day of the nearly 2 1/2 year delay period. The appellant has not claimed that he could not leave his bed or that he was incapacitated to the point that he could not have asked someone to assist him in appealing his case. The appellant's doctor has corroborated the appellant's arthritis and high blood pressure but has not provided any analysis of the severity of these conditions. Thus, the appellant has not shown that his poor health precluded him from taking any affirmative action to prosecute his appeal during the entire 28 month period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Whittington v. DHHS</span>, 51 MSPR 141, 143 (1991), declined to waive the time limit exceeded by a few days by an appellant who claimed that he had, during most or all of the filing period, been medically incapacitated and was an in-patient being treated for alcohol and drug abuse. The Board observed that "[a]lthough the appellant's affidavit is unrefuted, it is insufficient to establish that he was so incapacitated that he could not timely file. The appellant did not furnish any details or supporting documentary evidence to buttress his bare assertion of incapacity," Board Vice Chairman Amador dissented in <span class="Italic">Whittington</span>, arguing that the Clerk's show cause order to the appellant did not inform him of the type of information that was required to support his claim of incapacitation. <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 114, 116 (1991), collected reasons for denying late PFRs unsupported by medical evidence with the explanation that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not established that his ailments were of sufficient severity or duration to prevent him from timely refiling his petition.... The appellant's statement that he was ill for the "past month or so," is unsworn, and does not address the entire period of the delay.... Moreover, the appellant's comments regarding his various ailments and their effect on his ability to open the Board's correspondence are not supported by medical evidence and thus do not establish good cause for the delay....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sing v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 251, 253-54 (1991), recited that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant has not established that his condition was of sufficient severity or duration to prevent him from timely filing his petition.... The medical documents do not address the entire period of the delay, and any implied mental incapacity is belied by the appellant's letters to the agency concerning the settlement agreement, and his workers' compensation claim...which included a medical history.... In addition, the appellant has not explained his failure to have someone else file the petition for him or seek an extension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it accepts and relies on appellants' statements of their medical condition that are submitted in disability retirement cases, <span class="Italic">see, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Easterwood v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 125, 132 (1991), the Board expects that, as to the procedural issue of the timeliness of a PFR, assertions concerning medical impairments preventing timely filings should be accompanied by corroborative evidence and that the information from the appellant should be submitted in the form of an affidavit or a statement signed under the penalty of perjury. <span class="Italic">Gentry v. OPM</span>, 40 MSPR 46, 48 (1989) (additionally, failure to notify the Board of an address change is not excusable neglect); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. VA</span>, 55 MSPR 227, 229 (1992) ("In her statements on the issue of timeliness, the appellant appears to allege that she was hospitalized on March 27, 1992, and from April 21-30, 1992, and was thus unable to file a petition for review. However, the appellant submitted no evidence in support of this allegation and has failed twice in response to show-cause orders on timeliness to provide an affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury that explained her delay in filing. Waiver of the timeliness requirement here thus is not appropriate."); <span class="Italic">Morton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 165, 167 (1992) ("We find that the appellant's assertions that she occasionally suffers from "depressive states" because of her unemployment, which is unsupported by medical evidence, and that she worked on her petition during her spare time, even if true, do not demonstrate that degree of diligence and prudence required for a good cause showing."); <span class="Italic">Chaney v.

<p class="Body-Text">General claims that the delay was caused by the time spent by appellant recovering from illness will not excuse a late PFR. <span class="Italic">Stibbe v. GPO</span>, 57 MSPR 5, 6-7 (1993) (a physical therapy program and studies did not excuse delayed a PFR); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DeMar v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 67 MSPR 69, 72 (1995) ("[a] generalized claim of a medical problem, without a specific explanation of how the problem prevented [the appellant] from meeting the filing deadline, does not constitute good cause for the untimeliness" of a PFR); <span class="Italic">Peras v.

In the absence of further specification or supporting evidence, this is not sufficient to constitute good cause for waiver of the Board's time limits.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1762"></span>Medical evidence showing good cause for a late PFR must be submitted by the appellant, it must be specific, and it must be timely. The Board did not abuse its discretion by refusing to excuse a late PFR from an employee who stated she was ill in the months following issuance of the initial decision and invited the Board to contact her physician for further information. It was not the Board's duty to seek evidence from her physician. <span class="Italic">Ragland v. DOD</span>, 32 MSPR 177, 178 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Ragland v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3306). A months old statement from a physician indicating that the appellant was suffering from anxiety and depression and was unable to withstand ordinary stresses of everyday living was not enough to show that the appellant was unaware of her responsibilities in prosecuting her appeal or in finding a representative. <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 455, 456 n.* (1985). The medical explanation must show that the condition disabled the appellant from filing the PFR during the period that the condition existed. There must be a demonstration of a causal relationship, not evidence of a medical problem at a time unrelated to the time that the PFR was to have been filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Worley v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 6, 8 (1988) (evidence of epilepsy and psychological problems did not alone justify a nine month delay in filing a PFR). If an appellant is hospitalized and relies upon his confinement to justify a late PFR, he must provide some indication of the dates of the hospitalization to justify the filing delay. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 15 MSPR 365, 367 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 646, 648 (1994) ("[T]he appellant's bare assertion that his physician confined him to 'bed rest' without supporting proof as to the nature of the disability and how this condition precluded him from timely filing his petition does not establish good cause.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An assertion that the appellant was ill during the two days that his PFR was delayed and that he could not obtain medical documentation until after the appeal period expired was insufficient when no documentation or affidavit supported the allegation of illness. <span class="Italic">Jacobo v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 219, 220 (1987). An allegation that it was impossible to obtain medical documentation in a timely fashion because of the appellant's inability to pay for the production of that information was insufficient to warrant waiver of the delay of many months in producing the evidence. The Board reasoned that "appellant had ample time either to resolve her financial difficulties or to make alternative arrangements to produce other medical evidence...." <span class="Italic">Dozier v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 35 MSPR 258, 260 n.2 (1987).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delos Reyes v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 54, 55-56 (1992), provided typical discussion of a PFR arguably delayed by medical and other problems:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 19, 1992, the appellant's brother sent a letter to the Board, stating that the appellant was sick and could not speak or write. No medical documentation was submitted in support of this statement. The letter was not sworn to and did not specifically mention or address the issue of timeliness. These unverified statements fail to comply with the requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(f) and do not constitute good cause for the untimely filing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if we consider the letter, to the extent that the statement of the appellant's health in it can be construed as an explanation for the untimely petition, it does not establish good cause for the untimely filing. A mere assertion that illness prevented an appellant from timely filing a petition for review is insufficient to establish good cause for delay.... Because the appellant has not shown how his illness prevented him from meeting the Board's filing requirements, and did not submit corroborating medical evidence, he has not established good cause for his delay.... Accordingly, the appellant's petition for review must be dismissed as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Flocco v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 505, 508 (1990) (insufficient showing of disabling anxiety, stress, depression, and other medical problems when the evidence consisted of letters from the appellant, his family, and his doctor that failed to identify the time period of incapacitation and did not explain how the condition prevented him from timely filing a PFR or requesting an extension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability to work may support a determination that a medical condition did not prevent the appellant from filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">Wirzberger v.

Active participation by the appellant in other legal proceedings may suggest that the appellant's medical condition did not prevent her from timely filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stribling v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 107 MSPR 166, 2007 MSPB 261 (2007) (during the period leading to the PFR deadline the appellant filed an application for disability retirement and responded to a communication from OPM and the appellant made written submissions in the course of a state administrative proceeding). <span class="Italic">Wade v. USPS,</span> DA-0353-10-0418-I-1 (NP 8/18/2011), explained how participation in litigation-related activities during a period of incapacitation may undercut a request to waive a PFR deadline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that an appellant's ability to participate in other litigation during a period of purported disability fatally undermines the appellant's claim that his disability prevented him from filing a petition for review or a request for an extension. <span class="Italic">See Stribling v. Department of Education</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 166, &#x00B6; 14 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 19 (2008) (the appellant's claim that his delay was due to his medical condition was fatally undermined by his repeated attempts to contact his attorney and the bar association); <span class="Italic">see generally Pradier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 495, &#x00B6; 12 (2010) (the appellant failed to establish good cause for his delay where he pursued informal attempts to resolve the claim in the interim).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, any alleged mental or physical incapacity is belied by the circumstantial evidence of capacity in this case. For example: The appellant applied for and was awarded OPM disability retirement benefits on or about July 1996; he appealed an unfavorable state unemployment compensation decision on July 11, 1996, and January 27, 1997; he appealed OWCP's decision to discontinue his workers' compensation benefits on July 30, 1996, and January 2, 1998; he conducted settlement negotiations with the agency's representative concerning his removal on July 31, 1996; he filed and pursued a grievance of his removal from September 1996-98; and on November 8, 1996, he requested reconsideration of EEOC's decision dismissing his discrimination complaint as untimely filed. All of these <span class="Italic">pro se</span> acts constitute significant circumstantial evidence that the appellant was not mentally or physically incapacitated from filing a petition for review or requesting an extension of time from June 1996 through January 27, 1999. Accordingly, because the appellant has not shown that his mental or physical condition prevented him from filing a petition for review or requesting an extension of time during the entire 31-month period of the delay, he has failed to show good cause to excuse the untimeliness of his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Nesby,</span> 81 MSPR 118 &#x00B6; 7.</p>
