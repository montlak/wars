<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-264"><span class="space">3.</span> Appeal of RIF; Classification</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 5366:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)(2)Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the right of any employee to appeal--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) under section 5112(b) or 5346(c) of this title, or otherwise, any reclassification of a position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, any reduction-in-force action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 5112 regulates classification authority, with an appeal or review right to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Notwithstanding section 5107 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management may--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;ascertain currently the facts as to the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements of a position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;place in an appropriate class and grade a newly created position or a position coming initially under this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;decide whether a position is in its appropriate class and grade; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;change a position from one class or grade to another class or grade when the facts warrant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office shall certify to the agency concerned its action under paragraph (2) or (4) of this subsection. The agency shall act in accordance with the certificate, and the certificate is binding on all administrative, certifying, payroll, disbursing, and accounting officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;An employee affected or an agency may request at any time that the Office exercise the authority granted to it by subsection (a) of this section and the Office shall act on the request.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 5346 authorizes OPM to establish a job grading system.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 5366(a)(2) provides that any action with grade or pay retention is not appealable, with but two exceptions: a classification appeal to OPM and a reduction in force appeal. The RIF appeal, to the Board, is established at 5 CFR Part 351. <span class="Italic">Lew v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 2 MSPR 532, 533 &#x0026; n.1, 3 MSPB 53 (1980); <span class="Italic">see Warfield v. GSA</span>, 3 MSPR 233, 234 &#x0026; n.1, 3 MSPB 328 (1980); 5 USC 5366(a)(2). RIF actions are appealable even if they result in grade and pay retention. <span class="Italic">See Gometz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 69 MSPR 284, 286 (1996) ("A reduction in grade that includes grade retention may be appealed if the grade reduction was the result of a RIF."); <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 58 MSPR 345, 347 (1993) (Board has jurisdiction over a RIF demotion despite receipt of retained pay and grade); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 680, 684 (1990) ("While a grade reduction that includes grade retention is generally not appealable to the Board, the action may be appealed where the grade reduction resulted from a RIF."); <span class="Italic">Dalla v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 2 MSPR 550, 551-52 n.1 (1980) ("An action which is the basis for grade and pay retention benefits may be appealed to the Board in one circumstance...where the retention benefit rights arose as a result of reduction-in-force action taken by the agency under 5 CFR Part 351. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5366(a)(2)(B)."). It appears that the limitations apply even when pay retention is granted retroactively after the appeal is filed. <span class="Italic">Jewell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 66, 66-67, 6 MSPB 67 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Only the RIF is subject to appeal. There is no Board appeal from the termination of the retained benefits. <span class="Italic">Mason v. NASA</span>, 11 MSPR 475, 476 (1982). Nor is there an appeal if a dispute over the level of the employee's salary arises years after the RIF that led to pay retention benefits. <span class="Italic">Chaney v. VA</span>, 906 F.2d 697 (Fed. Cir. 1990). To entertain an appeal from a RIF that involves grade retention, the AJ must determine that the action appealed is a RIF, for without an appealable reduction in pay, an action entitling an employee to grade retention is not subject to adverse action coverage. <span class="Italic">Mims v. DOD</span>, 71 MSPR 74, 80 n.2 (1996) (relying upon the then-extant versions of 5 CFR 536.101(a), 752.401(b)(8)). [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-036.html#sec10-37">Classification Issue</a>," for the application of RIF rights to downgradings caused by changes in duties and reclassification; refer to Chapter 17, "Position Classification," for judicial remedies for misclassification.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the appellant received grade and pay retention and accepted a lower-graded position during the RIF process as an alternative to possible separation through the RIF does not diminish his entitlement to appeal the RIF, <span class="Italic">Marcoux v. USPS</span>, 63 MSPR 373, 376-77 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the assignment was accompanied by indefinite saved grade and pay. This assertion provides no support, however, for the proposition that that action was anything other than a RIF action. As we noted in <span class="Italic">Robinson v. United States Postal Service</span>, 63 MSPR 307, 313-24 (1994), an employee's receipt of indefinite saved grade and pay does not preclude a finding that his assignment to a lower-grade position constitutes a RIF demotion. The agency's assertion that the appellant accepted his assignment voluntarily also does not support the proposition that the action was not a RIF demotion. The agency states only that the appellant voluntarily accepted an offer of assignment to his new position, and that he could have chosen to wait for another assignment. All, or virtually all, RIF demotions are preceded by an agency offer and by the employee's acceptance of the offer,[4] and in all, or virtually all, RIF cases in which the employees accept initial offers of assignment to lower-grade positions, the employees could have declined the offers in the hope that they would receive better offers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(a) (when an employee has assignment rights to another position, an agency generally is required to offer to assign him to that position in lieu of furloughing or separating him).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There may be difficulty distinguishing a RIF from a position reclassification. <span id="Page_430"></span>The distinction is significant because Board appeal rights attach to the RIF, but not to a reclassification action resulting in saved grade and pay. If there is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute as to the nature of the underlying action, the Board should hear the appeal so that it can resolve its jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Goodrich v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 686 F.2d 169, 171-75, 177-78 (3d Cir. 1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The critical issue involved in this appeal is whether the MSPB properly determined that it was without jurisdiction to consider an appeal from an agency decision to downgrade an employee, when the employee is entitled to retained grade and pay....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The classification of a position is the standard by which an employee's compensation, benefits and other personnel decisions are made. Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (the Act), a federal agency is allowed to change the government service grade of positions within its administration. 5 USC 5107. Where a position is lowered in grade through no fault of an employee, however, the Act permits the employee to retain the higher grade for a two year period for the purpose of determining compensation and fringe benefits. 5 USC 5362. In addition, at the end of the two year period, pursuant to 5 USC 5363 the employee is entitled to retain the basic rate of pay of his former position. Although the downgraded employee retains his basic rate of pay, he does forego periodic salary increases and other benefits enjoyed by employees at the former grade of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981), the District of Columbia Circuit held that Congress intended to preclude appeals to the MSPB of individual downgradings following reclassification where grade and pay retention are available to the employee. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 282. The court, after conducting a thorough examination of the statutory scheme of the Act and its legislative history, concluded that the Act expanded the pay and grade retention benefits which were available prior to the Act, and as a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span> for these rights, Congress intended to eliminate the right of downgraded employees to appeal the individual downgrading decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 279.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> decision construed two arguably conflicting provisions of the Act. Section 7512 explicitly provides that reductions in grade are appealable actions. 5 USC 7512. Section 5366(b), however, provides that "any action which is the basis of an individual's entitlement [to grade and pay retention benefits] ..." is not an appealable action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> case dealt with the reclassification and downgrading of employees because of the application of revised classification standards or the correction of classification errors. According to the court's examination of the legislative history and construction of the Act, such actions are governed, not by the appellate procedures established by section 7512(3), but by the explicit limitation of section 5366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, Goodrich argues that he was reduced in grade pursuant to a reduction in the agency's workforce, and not because of a correction in his classification. Such actions against an employee, Goodrich contends, in spite of retained grade and pay, give rise to a right of appeal to the MSPB in the affected employee. The <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> court itself recognized that grade retention benefits alone are not dispositive of the existence of a right to appeal a downward classification to the MSPB, 670 F.2d at 280, and that, under other circumstances, the MSPB might have jurisdiction over such an appeal. We now turn to those other circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 5366(a)(2) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(2) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the right of any employee to appeal--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, any <span class="Italic">reduction-in-force action.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 5366(a)(2) (emphasis added). In addition, section 5366(b), the statutory provision at issue in <span class="Italic">Atwell</span>, explicitly excludes appeals from reduction-in-force actions from its limitation on appellate rights. The construction of &#x00A7; 5366(b) reached in <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> thus does not control an individual's right of appeal to the MSPB when he is affected by a reduction-in-force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that an employee reduced in grade due to a reduction-in-force may be entitled to retention of his grade and pay in the same manner as an employee demoted due to a classification correction. 5 USC 5362.12. The jurisdiction of the MSPB over an appeal from a reduction in grade depends, therefore, not on the availability of grade and pay retention, but on the nature of the demotion action taken against the affected employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The factual question remains whether Goodrich was reduced in grade pursuant to a reclassification or a reduction-in-force....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the MSPB held the hearing on the jurisdictional issue, the only evidence before it relevant to the nature of the reasons for Goodrich's downgrade was the Standard Form 50, attached to the memorandum to Goodrich informing him of the classification change.....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From the evidence which was omitted from the administrative record, it appears that Goodrich was downgraded due to an erosion away from his position of supervisory and other responsibilities, rather than due to an erroneous classification of his position. Goodrich characterizes a downgrading of this type as due to a reduction-in-force....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Goodrich was demoted as a result of a reduction-in-force, the agency was bound to follow its own procedures in implementing the action. That the agency did not do so is evident from the administrative record in this case....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Goodrich's contention that he was demoted due to a reduction-in-force requires proof and fact finding and it is proper that the issue be decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board.... If Goodrich pursues his administrative remedies, he has the burden of proving that he was affected by a reduction-in-force and that the MSPB therefore has jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the record is too confused to determine an agency action's true nature, the AJ must sort out the chronology and determine whether the action is a reclassification with retained pay and grade benefits beyond the Board's jurisdiction, or whether the action is an adverse action or RIF within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 73 MSPR 296, 298-99 (1997), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 79 MSPR 686, 690 &#x00B6; 10 (1998), remanded an appeal for that purpose:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM is responsible for setting position classification standards, and is authorized to change the class or grade of a particular position. 5 USC 5105, 5112. OPM classification decisions are subject to appellate review within OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 511.604, 511.612. An employing agency also has the authority to "change a position which it has placed in a class or grade...to another class or grade." 5 USC 5107. The incumbent of a position that is reclassified downward has no right to appeal to the Board if the incumbent receives retained grade and pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 5362, 5366(b); 5 CFR 752.401(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272, 285-86 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 274, 276 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants are correct that it was their employing agency, and not OPM, that took the actions under appeal. The agency did not purport to act under authority of 5 USC 5107, however. Indeed, the agency maintains that the regulation cited in the SF-50s, 5 CFR 335.102, authorizes its action. Section 335.102 governs an agency's authority to promote, demote, and reassign its employees; it says nothing about position classification. Furthermore, contrary to the finding in the initial decision, there is no indication in either the SF-50s or the letters issued to the appellants that the appellants received grade and pay retention. In fact, the agency states that the appellants "were not entitled to grade retention." It is manifest, then, that the agency did not take a position reclassification action of the sort described above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exactly what the agency did is unclear. With an exception that may apply here, a reduction in grade without grade and pay retention is appealable to the Board as an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7512(3), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Atwell</span>, 670 F.2d at 286. The exception to this rule is a RIF demotion, which is excluded from the coverage of the adverse action provisions of 5 USC ch. 75, subch. II, but which is appealable to the Board by regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7512(B); 5 CFR 351.901. The appellants argue that the agency should have followed RIF procedures. If the "25% oil and gas production/inspection/enforcement" responsibilities added to their positions so fundamentally altered their duties that their Production Accountability Specialist positions can be considered to have been abolished, and if one of the conditions triggering application of RIF procedures was present, then the appellants' downgrading may have been in the nature of a RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2); <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 130-31 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It does not appear that the agency followed either adverse action procedures or RIF procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7513(b); 5 CFR Part 351. It would be inappropriate for us to determine on this record which procedures should have been followed, though. The administrative judge's show-cause order stated that the appellants were "challenging a reclassification of [their] position[s] with retained grade and pay," and that it appeared that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeals. Neither the show-cause order nor the initial decision discussed the possibility of adverse action or RIF jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cf. Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish Board jurisdiction). We will not adjudicate the merits of an appeal where, as here, the record is not sufficiently developed for us to determine the basis for the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board concluded that Wade appeared to have been the subject of a RIF rather than a reclassification. The appeal was again remanded, for consideration of whether the RIF was properly conducted. <span class="Italic">See Wade v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 79 MSPR 686, 690 (1998) [discussed in Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-038.html#sec10-39">Intentional Changes in Duties</a>"] .</p>
