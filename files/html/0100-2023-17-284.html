<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-281"><span class="space">u.</span> Awards</h5>
<p class="noindent">The improper denial of a monetary award to an employee is an unjustified "personnel action" supporting a remedy under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Area II and AFGE</span>, 48 FLRA 370, 378 (1993). <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Local 2431</span>, 55 FLRA 493, 496 (1999), sustained an award of compensation to employees who complained of the agency's unilateral reduction in the levels of performance awards:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Defense,</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools and Federal Education Association, </span>54 FLRA 773, 785 (1998). Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency changed a past practice of "all but automatic" awards of 2 percent/1 percent, in violation of the CBA. He found that the CBA required the Agency to give notice of its intention to reduce the awards and to discuss the proposed change in past practice, as well as to keep employees informed about the relationship of performance appraisals to awards. Further, he determined that the reduction in awards violated the CBA. We defer to the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA and the factual finding of a past practice. <span class="Italic">See HHS. </span>This violation of the CBA constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, we are required to determine whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the standard of law to be applied. In this case, the question is whether there is a causal connection between the unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and the loss of pay. We conclude, based on the Arbitrator's factual findings to which we defer, that there is such a causal connection, because the change in award percentage rates directly resulted in lowered annual performance awards, which constituted a loss of pay, allowances, or differentials.</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators may direct agencies to provide awards to employees if contracts require that the awards be made, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 46 FLRA 1126, 1132-33 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(e) on the ground that the amount of the grievant's performance award cannot be appealed. The matter before the Arbitrator arose from a grievance filed under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure established pursuant to section 7121 of the Statute. The OPM regulation in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(e) pertains to appeals before the Merit Systems Protection Board or to other forms of administrative appeals under the Civil Service Reform Act, but has no bearing on the content of negotiated grievance procedures under the Statute....&#8197;The only matters that are excluded automatically from coverage under a negotiated grievance procedure are those matters listed in section 7121(c) of the Statute. Section 7121(c) does not list matters pertaining to the granting of a performance award or the amount of a performance award. Moreover, the Agency has not shown that the grievance in this case concerns a matter that the parties have agreed to exclude from their negotiated grievance procedure, as they are permitted to do under section 7121(a)(2) of the Statute. Therefore, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(e) does not bar the arbitration of the grievance in this case and the Agency's exception in this regard will be denied....</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may enforce a contract, without violating management rights, that requires the grant of an award under criteria set by management. <span class="Italic">Ind. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 72 FLRA 571, 573 (2021) (Chairman DuBester concurring) (den. recon. of <span class="Italic">Ind. Union of Pension Employees and PBGC</span>, 72 FLRA 281 (2021)), explained:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A grievant may be entitled to compensation, under the BPA, "when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials."[10] This test is met only where the arbitrator finds that there is a causal connection between an agency's violation of the agreement or law and a grievant's injury.[11] The BPA's requirements have not been met in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator found that the grievant performed certain duties not listed in her position description, he never determined that the performance of those duties constituted an "unjustified or unwarranted personnel action."[12] Nor did the Arbitrator conclude that the Agency violated any contractual provision or statute. Therefore, the Arbitrator's creative fabrication of "special contribution" and "spot" awards to justify an award of $5000 to the grievant for being a "team player" is not consistent with the BPA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 873.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union cites several cases to support the Arbitrator's award, but those cases are distinguishable from this matter. Some are not comparable because they involved agency exceptions that an award interfered with management rights.[15] And, the others are not comparable because in those cases a connection was established between a grievant's loss of pay and a proven unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.[16]</p>

In this case, the BPA is the only law identified by the parties in which the United States waived its sovereign immunity. As the Agency correctly argues, the Arbitrator's award is improper under the BPA. In the absence of evidence that the Agency violated another law that permits suit against the government, the award must be set aside. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2145</span>, 66 FLRA 911, 912 (2012) (upholding decision that monetary remedy would be contrary to law where union "has not provided any statutory authority [that] would authorize a waiver of sovereign immunity").</p>
<p class="noindent">Set aside as contrary to law was an arbitrator's direction to an agency to pay an award that contravened a provision in an agency appropriations statute directing that the agency consider employee conduct issues when determining to issue a performance award.

The arbitrator directed a retroactive award to the grievant. FLRA rejected the agency's argument that the arbitrator improperly failed to apply the reconstruction process then required by <span class="Italic">BEP</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because it does not constitute a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done if it not violated the MOU and the Circular.&#x2003;Exceptions at 8-9 <span class="Italic">(citing BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 152-53). However, before applying <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin., </span>55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does not affect a management right, then <span class="Italic">BEP</span> does not apply and the exception will be denied. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Gulf Coast, Pascagoula, Miss.,</span> 62 FLRA 328, 330 (2007);<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of Transp., FAA, </span>61 FLRA 54, 56-57 (2005); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth, Va., </span>55 FLRA 1103, 1105 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency does not argue that the award affects a management right; instead, it cites a case in which the Authority stated that it applies the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework where a party challenges an arbitrator's cancellation of a performance rating and the arbitrator's substitution of a specific performance rating in its place. Exceptions at 12-13 <span class="Italic">(citing United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Health Resources Servs. Admin., Rockville, Md., </span>60 FLRA 118 (2004)). However, the Agency is not challenging the cancellation of a performance rating, but the failure to award a CSA. Thus, this precedent is inapposite.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously determined that a provision establishing an employee's eligibility for an "incentive pay bonus" did not affect management's rights to direct employees or assign work because it did not "prescribe the type of work unit employees will perform nor does it establish the performance level necessary to avoid disciplinary action." <span id="page_2245"></span><span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates &#x0026; Pilots, </span>36 FLRA 555, 566 (1990); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 793 F.2d 371, 375 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Applying this precedent here, the Agency has failed to demonstrate that the award affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work, and, as such, we do not apply <span class="Italic">BEP. See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transp., FAA,</span> 61 FLRA at 56-7 (no application of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> where agency provided no basis for finding that the award affected management's right to assign employees or work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute). Accordingly, the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute and we deny the Agency's exception. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator may determine whether an employee should receive an award based upon performance or an evaluation, if the arbitrator grants the requested award, the arbitrator must ensure that the "but for" test is met. There must be a showing and explanation of how the particular wrongful management act deprived the individual of the specific award sought through the grievance. There must also be identification of a contract provision, or regulation, law, or rule mandating an award for the amount sought. The corollary of that principle is that if the amount of the award is discretionary, management's discretion as to the amount of the award may not be set aside. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ft. Worth and AFGE Council of Prison Locals Union 1298</span>, 32 FLRA 128, 131-32 (1988); <span class="Italic">see Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 58 FLRA 760, 762 (2003) (setting aside portion of award because failure of agency to hold performance discussions with grievant was not found by the arbitrator, explicitly or implicitly, to have resulted in any loss of pay, through denial of cash award, for grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once management exercises its discretion by setting the grievant's appraisal at a level justifying an award, management's discretion to approve or disapprove an award under the then-controlling regulation, 5 CFR 430.504(d), was not abridged by an arbitrator's directive that the employee be granted the award justified by his appraisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC N.

<p class="noindent">If a contract calls for a salary adjustment, and a cash award in lieu of the adjustment if the employee is receiving the statutory maximum pay, an arbitrator improperly rewrote the contract clause and awarded an employee who, receiving maximum pay, retired from the agency after his appraisal and was no longer in pay status. <span class="Italic">See Library of Congress and CREA</span>, <a href="http://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-136.html">60 FLRA 715</a>, 718 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 60 FLRA 939 (2005). <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273</span>, 62 FLRA 356 (2008), sustained an arbitrator's direction to award the grievant a Corporate Success Award based on contract criteria. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 275</span>, 65 FLRA 348 (2010) (sustaining award directing grievant receive corporate success award).<span class="Italic"> FDIC and NTEU Chap. 274</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-148.html">61 FLRA 735</a>, 735-37 (2006), reviewed an award directing a corporate success award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievant was eligible for a corporate success award (CSA) nomination in 2004, based on his 2003 performance, but that the grievant was not nominated for the award. The Arbitrator found, based on witness testimony and other record evidence, that the "[g]rievant's contributions equaled or exceeded those of at least three other nominees from the Region who were ultimately awarded CSA's in 2004." The Arbitrator also found that the Agency did not demonstrate that it acted fairly and equitably when it did not nominate the grievant for an award. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's witness was unable to explain why some employees were nominated for a CSA and the grievant was not, and provided only vague and unresponsive answers to questions concerning the comparison of the grievant's contributions to those of the nominated employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the grievant was "denied access to the process which may, or may not, have resulted in his being selected for a CSA." In this connection, the Arbitrator acknowledged that the grievant's "eligibility for a CSA does not automatically entitle him to receive one" but he found that "it would clearly be an abuse of discretion to exclude him for non-meritorious or arbitrary reasons."<span class="Italic"> </span>Based on the record evidence about the nomination process, the Arbitrator found "nothing within the record to support the Agency's claim that this decision was simply the proper exercise of its broad discretion rather than arbitrary or capricious behavior." Accordingly, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement and abused its discretion when it declined to nominate the grievant for a CSA. To remedy the violation, the Arbitrator granted the grievant a three percent increase to his base pay as set forth in &#x00A7; II.C of the parties' agreement. However, the Arbitrator clarified that the "remedy should...not be interpreted as a CSA award to [the g]rievant. Rather, it is a make whole remedy to the Agency's violation of the agreement and abuse of discretion in not nominating him for this award."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an award violates a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. Under prong I of that framework, upon finding that an award affects a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law under &#x00A7; (a)(2) of the Statute or a contract provision that was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Under prong II, the Authority examines whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside, modified, or remanded, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the Agency's claim that the award affects management's rights to assign work and direct employees or that it enforces a contract provision that was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute, thus satisfying <span class="Italic">BEP </span>prong I. As such, our inquiry begins with prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>framework. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., El Reno, Okla.</span>, 59 FLRA 536, 538-39 (2003) (addressing only prong I where affect on management's rights and prong II were not in dispute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by not nominating the grievant for a CSA and that it, therefore, denied the grievant the opportunity to be considered for a CSA. However, the Arbitrator did not determine that, had the grievant been nominated for a CSA, he would have received one. To the contrary, acknowledging the Agency's "broad discretion" in selecting award recipients, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's eligibility did not automatically entitle him to receive a CSA. Moreover, although the Arbitrator found that the grievant's "contributions equaled or exceeded those of at least three other nominees[,]" he expressly found that the evidence was "not conclusive" as to whether the grievant would have been selected for a CSA. Indeed, the Arbitrator expressly found that a proper nomination "may, or may not, have resulted in his being selected for a CSA."<span class="Italic"> </span>Based on the foregoing, we cannot conclude that the Agency would have selected the grievant for a CSA had it not violated the parties' agreement. Consequently, we find that an award of a three percent pay increase to the grievant does not reconstruct what the Agency would have done in the absence of the violation, and we therefore conclude that the remedy awarded fails to satisfy <span class="Italic">BEP </span>prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record establishes that, absent the violation of the agreement, the Agency would have nominated and considered the grievant for an award, as the parties' agreement requires. The Agency acknowledges that requiring it to consider the grievant for a CSA would reconstruct what it would have done absent the violation and requests that the Authority modify the award to reflect this appropriate remedy. The Agency's request for a modification of the award is consistent with Authority precedent and we, therefore, modify the award, as requested, to reflect the appropriate remedy of permitting the Agency to consider the grievant for a CSA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Health Resources Servs. Admin., Rockville, Md.</span>, 60 FLRA 118 (2004) (modifying award and directing agency to re-evaluate grievant where arbitrator correctly found performance appraisal deficient, but improperly changed the appraisal); <span class="Italic">accord,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Aviation &#x0026; Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal, Ala.</span>, 58 FLRA 400 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award is modified by striking the portion of the award that grants the grievant a three percent pay increase and the Agency is directed to consider the grievant for a CSA.</p>
<p class="noindent">Awards may not be required unless they are the result of individualized review and approval by management officials. Budget considerations and the appropriate distribution of awards throughout an agency are legitimate considerations for reviewing officials in determining whether to grant performance awards. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft.

<p class="noindent">The question of whether an arbitrator's award concerning the magnitude of an incentive award interfered with the agency's right to determine its budget surfaced in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Brookhaven Serv. Ctr. and NTEU Chap. 99</span>, 37 FLRA 1176, 1183-86 (1990). The grievance concerned the amount of an incentive award that the grievant received for sustained superior performance. The grievant claimed that the amount of the award, 5% of his salary, did not reflect the extent that his performance exceeded the performance level for an outstanding rating. The arbitrator sustained the grievance, concluding that the agency's guidance permitted awards of 5-10% of salary and that the agency had imposed an arbitrary cap on the awards of 5%. The arbitrator remanded the grievance to the parties for a redetermination of the amount of the award. FLRA rejected the agency's argument that the award interfered with its right to set its budget:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2246"></span>The Agency argues, based on [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force,</span>] <span class="Italic">Langley Air Force Base</span> [<span class="Italic">v. FLRA</span>, 878 F.2d 1430 (4th Cir. 1989) (unpublished decision)], that the award violates its right to determine its budget....&#8197;Specifically, the Agency contends that Article 18, Section 1 A recognizes management's right to determine its budget, and that management's determination to limit most cash awards to 5 percent was a proper exercise of this right....&#8197;We disagree.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Tidewater Virginia Federal Employees Metal Trades Council and U.S. Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 37 FLRA No. 79, slip op. at 11-12 (1990)...we found, relying on the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Ft. Stewart</span>, that a proposal which delineated the ranges of performance awards payable to unit employees for the attainment of various levels of performance did not directly interfere with management's right to determine its budget....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Arbitrator found...that management's action in limiting the grievant's performance award to 5 percent was contrary to Articles 4 and 18...and to the guidelines contained in the IRM, which permit awards of up to 10 percent for employees like the grievant who receive outstanding ratings on all critical job elements. The record evidence does not establish that the award would require the inclusion of a particular program or amount in the Agency's budget or that the award would result in significant and unavoidable increases to the Agency....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although management argues that a determination had been made to limit awards to 5 percent based on its budget, the evidence does not establish that the award would result in significant and unavoidable increases in costs to the Agency. The evidence shows that the 5 percent limitation was a guideline rather than a budgetary requirement....&#8197;[M]anagement...testified that "we never stop the award process," and that if funds were exhausted before the end of the year payment would be delayed and paid out of the next year's funds or money within the budget would be reallocated to cover the awards....&#8197;Further, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's Branch Chief was unaware of the volume of the grievant's work and that he admitted that knowledge of that factor could have resulted in a higher award. Thus, consistent with the Arbitrator's determination, the record evidence does not establish that budgetary considerations required management to limit the award to five percent. We conclude, therefore, that the award requiring the parties to determine the amount of the grievant's award within the ranges determined by the Arbitrator does not directly interfere with management's right to determine the budget.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>...where we found that proposal delineating the ranges of performance awards was nonnegotiable because it conflicts with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.503(c)(1). The proposal in that case did not allow meaningful review of the award by the budget reviewing official as required by the regulation. The official would have had no authority to disapprove an award. In this case, management had determined, pursuant to procedures set forth in the agreement and an Agency regulation, that the grievant should receive a performance award. Awards are granted under these procedures on the basis of "merit and within applicable budget limitations." <span class="Italic">See</span> Article 18 in the Appendix. Thus, under these procedures management...had an opportunity to approve or disapprove the award. The Arbitrator's award only interprets and enforces these procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's award granting performance awards on a retroactive basis would not likely interfere with the right of the agency to determine its budget. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC N. Chicago and AFGE Local 2107</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v52/52-037.html">52 FLRA 387</a>, 393-94 (1996). An arbitrator properly enforced an MOU of the parties that reserved the right to monetary awards pending full funding following sequestration, <span class="Italic">DHHS, Nat'l Inst. of Envtl. Health Sciences and AFGE Local 2923</span>, 68 FLRA 1049, 1049, 1051-52 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency allocated funds in its fiscal year (FY) 2013 budget for bargaining-unit employee performance awards (awards). Before the Agency could distribute the awards, Congress passed the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA)[1] and limited federal spending. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued two guidance memoranda advising agencies on the use of discretionary spending under sequestration....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Pub. L. No. 112-25 (Aug. 2, 2011).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The BCA did not specify how discretionary spending should be eliminated, but the OMB issued two guidance memoranda on discretionary spending under sequestration. The first OMB memorandum, issued before sequestration, advised that monetary awards to employees "should occur 'only if legally required.'" But this memorandum offered no definition or explanation of "legally required." The second OMB memorandum, issued after sequestration, explained that "[l]egal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective[-]bargaining agreements." The memorandum also expressly advised agencies to seek the advice of agency counsel as to whether awards are "legally required" and to "consider bargaining with employee representatives 'to explore revisions to such provisions in existing collective[-]bargaining agreements.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The BCA became effective and OMB issued its guidance, after the parties executed the PMAP MOA. The Arbitrator considered Article 3, Sections 1 and 3 of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement to determine whether it prohibited the Agency from distributing awards. He found that these provisions subjected "other agreements between the parties[, such as the PMAP MOA,] to supervening legal commands." Section 1 states, in relevant part, that the parties are "governed by existing and future laws and regulations of appropriate authorities...and by subsequent [A]gency policies and regulations required by law or by the regulations [of] appropriate authorities." And Section 3 states that "changes in law, regulations of appropriate authority, or decisions of appropriate authority may necessitate changes in...matters affecting working conditions. If the changes leave [the Agency] with no discretion in the matter, the Union will be informed of the impending change."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to the OMB memoranda and the BCA.&#x2003;The Agency further argues that whether performance awards are "legally required"[47] under the OMB memoranda must be read in the context of sequestration and OMB "directives."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;OMB M-13-05 at 3; OMB M-13-11 at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency fails to show that the award is contrary to law.&#x2003;Even assuming, as the Arbitrator did, that OMB memoranda bound the Agency, the Agency does not show, and it is not otherwise apparent, that the memoranda prohibited the Agency from paying awards. The OMB memoranda explicitly state that awards should be issued if "legally required," such as when an agency is required to distribute awards in "compliance with provisions in collective[-]bargaining agreements."[51] The Arbitrator found that the parties' collective-bargaining agreement and the PMAP MOA "legally required" the Agency to pay the awards,[52] and the Agency does not challenge this finding on essence grounds. Therefore, as the Agency does not challenge the Arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement and the PMAP MOA, or the relevance of the OMB memoranda language the Arbitrator cites, it fails to establish that the Arbitrator's award is inconsistent with OMB memoranda.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[51]&#x2003;Award at 2 (internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 7-8 (quoting OMB M-13-05 at 3; OMB M-13-11 at 3).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent's reliance on OMB's guidance overlooks key objectives of the memoranda--to "address questions that have been raised"[53] to OMB and to "ensure that [agencies] are fully aware of[,] and in compliance with[,] any and all collective[-]bargaining requirements."[54] Similarly, the dissent entirely ignores the memoranda's guidance as to whether distribution of awards is "legally required"[55] despite the limitations of sequestration: "Legal requirements include compliance with provisions in collective[-]bargaining agreements governing awards."[56] Here, that includes the requirements of the PMAP MOA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;OMB M-13-05 at 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[55]&#x2003;OMB M-13-05 at 3; OMB M-13-11 at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[56]&#x2003;OMB M-13-11 at 3; <span class="Italic">see also</span> OMB M-13-05 at 3.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the first OMB memorandum also reminded agencies of Executive Order 13,522 and its requirement that agencies engage in pre-decisional involvement with employees' exclusive representatives "with regard to any planned personnel actions to reduce [f]ederal civilian workforce costs."[57] And OMB later reiterated this guidance with specific reference to awards: "Consistent with legal requirements, agencies may consider engaging in discussions with employees' exclusive representatives to explore revisions to such provisions in existing collective[-]bargaining agreements."[58]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[57]&#x2003;OMB M-13-05 at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[58]&#x2003;OMB M-13-11 at 3 n.1.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, although the dissent claims that the Arbitrator "selectively cherry-picked a handful of words from two contextually distinct mandates," it is clear that the Arbitrator's interpretation of the OMB memoranda is entirely consistent with the memoranda's plain language and intent. Read together, the guidance provides that awards should be distributed if required under a collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2247"></span>More generally, the dissent's discomfort with the institution of collective bargaining--and the partnership it creates among agencies, employees, and their representatives--is evident. The dissent asserts that the Authority should not interfere with the missions and budgets of other federal agencies. But Congress has expressly and unequivocally determined that the rights afforded agencies, employees, and their representatives under the Statute "contribute[&#8197;] to the effective conduct of public business" and are "in the public interest." The issue in this case is the effect of sequestration-related OMB guidance on a collectively-bargained agreement, in this case, the PMAP MOA. The dissent should recognize, as OMB did in its memoranda, the role and legal ramifications of collectively-bargained agreements, and the importance of using the collective-bargaining partnership the Statute creates between agencies and labor organizations to enhance, rather than impede, an agency's ability to conduct its activities and accomplish its statutory mission responsibilities.</p>
<p class="noindent">To resolve a monetary award dispute, the analysis of the arbitrator need be no more complex than the collective bargaining contract he interprets. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 46 FLRA 1297, 1302 (1993), sustained a monetary award directed by an arbitrator on the basis of some general contract language and comparison of the treatment by the agency of the grievant and coworkers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no merit in the Agency's contention that the award is contrary to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(d) on the basis that it deprives the Agency of the right to approve or disapprove performance awards at a higher level of review. We also conclude that the Arbitrator's award is not contrary to section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute on the ground that it interferes with the Agency's right to establish its budget. The Agency had already agreed that the grievant was entitled to a performance appraisal of "excellent." The record before the Arbitrator established that other employees who had received performance ratings equal to that of the grievant had also received monetary awards. The Arbitrator was merely enforcing the agreement provision requiring that matters of personnel administration be applied to all employees fairly and equitably. On that basis, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant was entitled to the same monetary award and certificate of recognition that was given to other employees rated "excellent." We find nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(d) or in management's right to determine its budget under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute that prevents the Arbitrator from granting an incentive award as a remedy for the improper appraisal in this case. Specifically, as to section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute, we find that the award does not prescribe a program, operation, or dollar amount that the Agency must include in its budget. Rather, the award only enforces...the local supplemental agreement in determining the remedy in this case to require that performance awards be distributed fairly and equitably....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to set aside an arbitration award requiring that a union official receive a monetary award based on that official's rating. FLRA applied its law concerning the relation between official time and the rating process to sustain the award, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 46 FLRA 1126, 1132 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency had already agreed to a minimum amount of award for employees rated "outstanding." The Arbitrator interpreted the parties' agreement and determined that the Agency had improperly decided that the grievant should not be treated like other full-time employees due to the amount of official time that she had used during the appraisal period. As we noted in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, "official time under the Statute 'is time which counts toward the fulfillment of an employee's basic work requirement.'" 46 FLRA at 175, citing <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 65 and Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 25 FLRA 373, 376 n.3 (1987). This case does not concern the Agency's right to approve or disapprove the granting of a performance award to the grievant or the amount of such award, but rather concerns the application of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and the Agency's regulations. The cases cited by the Agency in its exceptions concern the negotiability of bargaining proposals that were found to preclude an agency from exercising the right to approve or disapprove performance awards under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.504(d) and are not applicable in this case....&#8197;Consequently, the Agency's contention that the award is contrary to 5 CFR 430.504(d) provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another award properly directed monetary awards to full-time union officials with "carryover" ratings of "excellent." <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals and AFGE Council 215</span>, 48 FLRA 357, 364 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">Under OPM regulations, awards are for performance. FLRA set aside an award that sought to enforce a (rescinded) agency policy that granted awards for preceptorship work, longevity in the agency, perfect quarterly attendance, and acquisition of a higher degree in nursing, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and VAMC Asheville</span>, 59 FLRA 461, 463-65 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employee awards are governed by federal law and regulations.&#x2003;According to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4503 and 4505(a), agencies may grant employees awards for acts<span class="Italic"> </span>that contribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of operations, or are in the public interest as well as awards for performance ratings that reach a certain level. OPM implementing regulations regarding awards programs state that an agency may grant an award for a superior accomplishment or personal effort contributing to the improvement of the operations of the federal government, for a special act in the public interest, or for an employee's most recent performance rating. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.104. The law and regulations do not provide definitions for "superior accomplishment" or "personal effort."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under principles of statutory interpretation, terms that are undefined in a statute or its legislative history are understood to have their ordinary meaning, which includes dictionary definitions. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1827,</span> 58 FLRA 344, 345-46 (2003) <span class="Italic">(citing Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. v. United States, </span>36 F.3d 1565, 1571 n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1994)); <span class="Italic">ACT, Razorback Chpt. 117, </span>56 FLRA 427, 430 (2000);<span class="Italic"> Columbia Power Trades Council,</span> 54 FLRA 189, 193 (1998). The Authority has found, "[a]ccomplishment is defined as 'the act of accomplishing' and 'accomplish' is defined as 'to execute fully' or 'perform, achieve[.]' 'Effort' is defined as the 'conscious exertion of physical or mental power[.]'" <span class="Italic">See Local R1-109, </span>53 FLRA at 274 <span class="Italic">(</span>citing Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986) (Unabridged)). Given these dictionary definitions, the Authority concluded that the law and regulations require that an award be based on an employee's performance or activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The awards created in Issue 93 are contrary to law because they are not performance based.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When reviewing the award, the Authority defers to the Arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1437, </span>53 FLRA at 1710. The Arbitrator decided that none of the awards in Issue 93 were performance based. The Arbitrator concluded that the award for the nonuse of sick leave did not constitute a "superior accomplishment" or a "personal effort." The Arbitrator found that the award for preceptor work was based on the assignment as a preceptor and did not recognize an employee's "superior accomplishment." The Arbitrator determined that the award for longevity was not connected to an employee's performance or accomplishments as many factors lead to longevity. Finally, the Arbitrator found no correlation between obtaining a higher degree and an employee's job performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to Authority precedent, a proposal to continue to implement an incentive awards program rewarding employees for the nonuse of sick leave was inconsistent with law and regulations. <span class="Italic">Local R1-109, </span>53 FLRA at 273. The Authority found that awards must<span class="Italic"> </span>be performance based and that if the Agency were required to grant an incentive award based on an employee not becoming sick, the Agency would be required to "grant an incentive award to an employee on a basis that does not involve performance or activity by that employee."<span class="Italic"> </span>Based on the Arbitrator's factual finding that the award for the nonuse of sick leave did not constitute a "superior accomplishment" or a "personal effort" and Authority precedent, the portion of Issue 93 creating awards for the nonuse of sick leave is contrary to the relevant law and regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the step increases granted under Issue 93 to employees who earned a higher degree in nursing were not based on normal step increases and therefore must meet the definition of a QSI.&#x2003;The Authority has held that a proposal requiring an agency to grant a QSI to employees who obtain higher degrees was nonnegotiable because it was contrary to government regulations. <span class="Italic">IBPO,</span> 47 FLRA at 403. The Authority found that QSIs, authorized in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.504, may be granted to recognize "high quality job performance" and could not, consistent with regulations, be granted for educational attainment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Given the Arbitrator's factual findings, the regulations governing QSIs and Authority precedent, the portion of Issue 93 granting QSIs to employees who earn higher degrees is contrary to the relevant law and regulations. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that Issue 93 rewarded employees for being selected to perform preceptor work and not for an employee's work as a preceptor. The Union, in its exceptions, does not deny that the award is for the selection, but rather justifies the award by explaining the additional contributions and the importance of preceptors and explaining that no employee is guaranteed to be selected. The Authority has found that awards must be based on an employee's performance or activity in order to comply with the law and regulations governing employee awards. <span class="Italic">See Local R1-109, </span>53 FLRA at 274. We conclude that the Arbitrator's factual finding that the award recognizes an employee for being selected to act as a preceptor, requires that we find the award is not based on an employee's performance or activity. Therefore, the portion of Issue 93 that rewards employees who are selected to perform preceptor work is contrary to the relevant law and regulations. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">When examining the longevity award created in Issue 93, the Authority must determine if the award recognizes an employee's performance or activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Union argues that this award recognizes an employee's <span class="Italic">i</span>ncremental contributions and performance over a period of time. The Union does not present any evidence that an employee who continues to be employed by the Agency and comes to work without performing <span id="page_2248"></span>in a superior way would not receive this award. The Union also does not contest the Arbitrator's finding that the award is not connected to an employee's performance or accomplishments. Thus, we conclude that this award does not recognize an employee's superior accomplishment or personal activity. Thus, that portion of Issue 93 creating an award for longevity is contrary to the relevant law and regulations. <span class="Italic">See Local R1-109, </span>53 FLRA at 274.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is necessary to address the Union's statement, "[t]here is a difference between being specially authorized by a statute and being forbidden by a statute." The Authority has held "an expenditure of appropriated funds for a particular purpose is permitted only if there is a statutory or regulatory authority for such expenditure." <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>58 FLRA 611, 614 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring)<span class="Italic"> (quoting Downs v. Office of Personnel Management, </span>69 F.3d 1141, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("The United States Constitution limits payments of monies from the Federal Treasury to those authorized by statute."))<span class="Italic"> (citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, </span>496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990));<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Local 1978, </span>56 FLRA 894, 896 (2000) <span class="Italic">(AFGE)</span>. The law and regulations governing awards only authorize awards for an employee's superior performance or activity, and the Union does not cite to any other authority that would permit an agency to make an expenditure for awards such as those created in Issue 93. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4503 and 4505; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.103; <span class="Italic">Local R1-109, </span>53 FLRA at 274. In addition, the OPM regulations limit the Agency's discretion to giving awards for performance based activities and the Agency may not take action inconsistent with the regulations. <span class="Italic">See cf. AFGE, </span>56 FLRA at 898 (holding that proposals granting pay retention to employees to whom OPM did not, in 5 C.F.R. 536, grant pay retention were not within the duty to bargain because, "OPM regulations do not authorize pay retention for employees affected by [the proposals].");<span class="Italic"> Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n, </span>53 FLRA 625, 649 (1997) (stating, "[t]he Authority has found proposals to be inconsistent with a regulation where the regulation states an express standard governing the exercise of an agency's authority, and the proposal either expanded or contracted that regulatory standard.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Under statute and OPM regulations, a "time off" award requires an affirmative finding of superior accomplishment, personal effort, or at least some standard higher than "mere performance of duty," <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chapters 22, 34 &#x0026; 60</span>, 61 FLRA 168, 170-71 (2005) (vacated and remanded, <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

<p class="noindent-1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4502(e), agencies are authorized, consistent with OPM regulations, to grant employees, as an incentive award, time off from duty "in recognition of superior accomplishment or other personal effort that contributes to the quality, efficiency, or economy of Government operations." <span class="Italic">Accord</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R1-109</span>, 53 FLRA 271, 273 (1997). OPM regulations provides that agencies may grant time-off awards on the basis of, as relevant here, "[a] suggestion, invention, superior accomplishment, productivity gain, or other personal effort that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations or achieves a significant reduction in paperwork[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 451.104(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Sections 4502(e) and 451.104(a)(1) do not define "superior accomplishment" or "personal effort." <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, 53 FLRA at 274. In <span class="Italic">NAGE</span>, the Authority applied dictionary definitions to hold that "accomplishment" means "the act of accomplishing," and that to "accomplish" means "to execute fully" or "perform, achieve[.]" 53 FLRA at 274. The Authority also held that "effort" means the "conscious exertion of physical or mental power[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Authority concluded that &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4502(e) and 451.104(a)(1) require that an award be based on performance or activity by an employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, mere performance or activity is not sufficient to warrant a time-off award. In this connection, as noted above, both &#x00A7; 4502(e) and &#x00A7; 451.104(a) require that the performance or activity contribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations. Performance that is less than minimally successful does not contribute to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 446</span>, 59 FLRA 461, 465 (2003) (Authority found longevity awards contrary to law, noting union's failure to "present any evidence that an employee who continues to be employed by the [a]gency and comes to work without performing in a superior way would not receive this award.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that employees were entitled to time-off awards for merely volunteering. He did not limit that entitlement to employees who were performing at any particular level. In fact, as noted above, the Arbitrator specifically rejected the Agency's argument that "merely volunteering was not sufficient to make an employee eligible for a [time-off award] under the law[,]" finding that employees were entitled to time-off awards for merely "volunteering[.]" Thus, the Arbitrator directed time-off awards without regard to whether the employees' performance contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations. Consequently, the award is inconsistent with &#x00A7; 4502(e) and &#x00A7; 451.104(a), and we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit set aside and remanded FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapters 22, 34 &#x0026; 60</span>, 61 FLRA 168 (2005), directing additional factfinding as to the meaning of underlying memoranda of understanding and conflicting evidence concerning the practices of the parties. <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not direct negotiation over changes in an incentive awards system.
