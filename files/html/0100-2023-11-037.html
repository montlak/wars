<h3 class="h3" id="sec3-38"><span class="space">D.</span> REPRESENTATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7131, official time for representation during negotiations is required:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Any employee representing an exclusive representative in the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement under this chapter shall be authorized official time for such purposes, including attendance at impasse proceeding, during the time the employee otherwise would be in a duty status. The number of employees for whom official time is authorized under this subsection shall not exceed the number of individuals designated as representing the agency for such purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7131(c), official time is required for time spent for representation in "proceedings before the Authority." Under 5 USC 7131(b) official time for internal union business is precluded; those activities are performed when the employee is in nonduty status.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to time spent on representation of employees, e.g. grievances or assistance in formal discussions, official time is negotiable rather than required, 5 USC 7131:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Except as provided in the preceding subsections of this section--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;any employee representing an exclusive representative, or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;in connection with any other matter covered by this chapter, any employee in an appropriate unit represented by an exclusive representative,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">shall be granted official time in any amount the agency and the exclusive representative involved agree to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent">Representational activities generate the greatest demand for official time. The grant, as for collective bargaining, is statutory, but the union defines the statutory grant through negotiations. FLRA explained in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Mine Warfare Eng'g Activity, Yorktown and NAGE Local R4-97</span>, 39 FLRA 1207, 1214 (1991), reviewing and denying exceptions to an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e reject the essence of the Union's exception, which is that section 7114 of the Statute entitles an exclusive representative to perform representational activities of the type covered by section 7131(d) on official time. In our view, section 7114 provides no such right or entitlement. As we noted, the Statute provides quite the opposite: section 7131(d) provides that unions and agencies may negotiate an amount of official time for representational duties that is reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest....&#8197;Congress in section 7131(d) committed the determination of the amount of official time to the union and the agency together, not to either party alone.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contract limitations on the use of official time will be observed even if an official time grant under the Statute, without the contract provision, might be more generous. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 3432 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 60 FLRA 641, 643 (2005) (reviewing arbitration award).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's general view is that &#x00A7; 7131(d), authorizing official time that the parties agree "to be reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest," carves out an exception to management's right to assign work. The obligation to furnish official time allocations is negotiable unless there is an emergency or unless there are special circumstances. Generalized concerns submitted by the agency concerning interference of grants of official time with agency mission requirements will not displace the specific congressionally enacted provision for the negotiability of official time proposals. <span class="Italic">Ft. Bragg Ass'n of Educators, NEA and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Sch.</span>, 30 FLRA 508, 512 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Locals 214 v. FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d 1525, 1531 (D.C. Cir. 1986) ("to the extent that the FLRA considers official time nonnegotiable because it would require an agency to hire another employee or change its staffing pattern, its approach is an unreasonable interpretation of the Statute"); <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles and AFGE Local 2866</span>, 25 FLRA 685, 688 (1987) (agency unilaterally changed policy concerning when unit employees can use official time to meet with nonemployee union representatives; generalized concerns about agency's mission were insufficient: "[t]o the extent that the Agency's objection to negotiating over the substance of its decision to change its policy regarding amounts of official time available to employees during morning hours is grounded in a generalized concern to carry out its mission, such as generalized concern 'cannot displace a specific congressional provision providing for the negotiability of official time proposals.' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, insofar as the Agency's objection to negotiating over the substance of its policy change is based on management's right to assign work under section 7106(a) of the Statute, this objection must also be rejected. Section 7131(d) 'carves out an exception' to management's right to assign work."). Along with the amount of official time that representatives may utilize, the union may negotiate the number of union representatives entitled to official time generally or at a particular proceeding. That number is not set or limited by the number of agency representatives. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Randolph AFB and AFGE Local 1840</span>, 45 FLRA 727, 728 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command and AFGE Council 214</span>, 49 FLRA 1111, 1119-20 (1994), determined that parties may negotiate the location where official time will be granted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he parties to a collective bargaining relationship are required to negotiate over proposals involving the amount of official time available for use by union representatives during any particular time period. <span class="Italic">American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Council of Locals No. 214 </span>v. <span class="Italic">FLRA</span>, 798 F.2d 1525 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Thus, if a matter is encompassed within the definition of section 7131(d), it will constitute a mandatory subject of bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station, Los Angeles</span>, <span class="Italic">California</span>, 25 FLRA 685, 689 (1987), the Authority held that the use of official time under section 7131(d) includes "its amount, allocation and scheduling...." Similarly, we now find that the location at which official time is to be exercised is also inextricably connected to the use of official time and is, therefore, a matter over which bargaining is required. We note, in this regard, the statement in the legislative history of the Statute that the provision that became section 7131(d) "makes <span class="Italic">all other matters</span> concerning official time for unit employees engaged in labor-management relations activity subject to negotiation...." H.R. Rep. No. 1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 59 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., <span class="Italic">Legislative History of the Federal Service Labor-Management</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Statute, Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act</span> <span class="Italic">of 1978</span>, (Comm. Print No. 96-7), at 705 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arriving at this finding, we specifically reject the Union's claim that the location at which official time is granted is a permissive subject of bargaining under Authority precedent involving a union's right to designate its own representatives. The determination of the location of representatives who may engage in representational activity on official time in no way dictates the identity of the union's representatives. Similarly, although the negotiation of official time for a national union officer would be a mandatory subject of bargaining under section 7131(d), the union would remain free to determine the identity of that officer. As we have stated, there is no statutory entitlement to perform on official time representational duties of the type covered by section 7131(d). <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Mine Warfare Engineering Activity, Yorktown, Virginia and National Association of Government Employees, Local R4-97</span>, 39 FLRA 1207, 1214 (1991) (agreement concerning the amount of time during which representational duties may be performed on official time does not encroach on the Union's duty to represent unit employees). Thus, regardless of the amount of official time available for section 7131(d) purposes, a union is free to designate as many representatives as it wishes at any location it chooses. But those representatives may not perform their duties on official time for matters covered by section 7131(d) unless the parties have negotiated an agreement to that effect.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's preservation of the negotiability of official time for representation weathered agency attempts to avoid related proposals after <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (proposals were nonnegotiable relating to contracting out practices). <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Fin. Mgmt. Serv.</span>, 45 FLRA 696, 698, 701-05 (1992), affirmed the negotiability of Provision 1, seeking agreement on an allocation of official time for representational purposes, unless the absence of the employee or union representative would create a "severe workload problem":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its supplemental statement of position, the Agency states that, in view of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 110 S. Ct. 1623 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>), it does not concede that the application of the Authority's excessive interference test, which was set forth in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>), is proper. The Agency asserts that, based on <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, no appropriate arrangement negotiated in accordance with section 7106(b)(3) can interfere at all with the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the threshold portion of the test that was set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span> requires that the Union show that this provision constitutes an arrangement for adversely affected employees. The Agency asserts that to satisfy this portion of the test, the Union must show that the provision addresses reasonably foreseeable adverse effects on employees that flow from the exercise of management's rights....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_271"></span>Initially, we reject the Agency's argument that the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> requires a conclusion that a matter cannot be negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) if it interferes with management's right under section 7106(a)....&#8197;By its terms, section 7106 unequivocally establishes that management's rights under section 7106 are "subject to" the Union's right to negotiate "appropriate arrangements" under section 7106(b)(3)....&#8197;Thus, the literal wording and structure of section 7106 support a conclusion that a proposal that constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) is negotiable notwithstanding "some constraints upon rights generally reserved (in other contexts) to management<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 1188.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This provision is similar to Provisions 2 and 6 in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, 45 FLRA No. 30 (1992) (<span class="Italic">BATF</span>), in that this provision places restrictions on the Agency's ability to deny a request that an employee and/or Union representative be excused from performing assigned duties in order to meet with each other. The Union contends, as did the Union in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, that this provision concerns the use of official time, which operates as an exception to management's rights under section 7106. In <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we reviewed our approach to the relationship between section 7131(d) of the Statute, which authorizes the negotiation of official time, and section 7106, which concerns management rights, in view of the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, the Authority held that section 7131(d) carved out an exception to section 7106(a) and that "the use of official time under section 7131(d)--that is, its amount, allocation and scheduling--is negotiable absent an emergency or other special circumstances...." <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing Station</span>, 25 FLRA at 689. In reviewing the approach that was adopted in <span class="Italic">Military Entrance Processing</span> <span class="Italic">Station</span>, we stated in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">In our view, Congress intended by section 7131(d) of the Statute to authorize unions to negotiate over the use of official time for representational activity. However, the breadth and effect that the Court has ascribed to the phrase "nothing in this chapter," which appears in section 7106(a) of the Statute, requires us to reconsider our previous conclusion that section 7131(d) carves out an exception to section 7106(a). A strict reading of the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> leads to a conclusion that section 7131(d) does not override section 7106(a) of the Statute and, thus, that any proposals concerning official time that are negotiated under section 7131(d) are subject to section 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 45 FLRA No. 30, slip op. at 9-10.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether to adopt this approach in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we expressed our concern that subordinating section 7131(d) to section 7106(a) of the Statute would effectively void section 7131(d). We noted the elementary rule of statutory construction that effect must be given to every word, clause, and sentence of a statute so that no part is "rendered inoperative or insignificant."...&#8197;In view of the need to give effect to all provisions of the Statute, we stated that we read <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> to apply to situations where according predominance to the rights established by section 7106 could be achieved without eviscerating another provision of the Statute as was the case in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>. Because sections 7106 and 7131(d) could not be reconciled in a manner that continued to give effect to section 7131(d), we stated that we would continue to carve out an exception to section 7106 "in order to maintain the negotiability, where otherwise warranted, of matters involving official time<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as an alternative to finding Provisions 2 and 6 negotiable based on application of the theory set forth above, the majority in that case (Member Armendariz concurring in part and dissenting in part) also analyzed those provisions to determine whether they were negotiable as appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute by applying the analytical framework that was set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>. As was the circumstance in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, the Union in this case, in addition to arguing that this proposal is negotiable under the approach taken in <span class="Italic">Military Entrance</span> <span class="Italic">Processing Station</span>, contends that it is negotiable as an appropriate arrangement. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we will analyze this provision to determine whether it constitutes an appropriate arrangement, which is negotiable under section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For those reasons expressed in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we conclude that Provision 1 directly interferes with management's right to assign work because it places restrictions on the Agency's ability to deny a request that an employee be excused from performing assigned duties in the circumstances specified in the provision. 45 FLRA No. 30, slip op. at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 in this case establishes conditions similar to those established by Provisions 2 and 6 in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> to govern Agency denials of requests that employees be released from their duties for the purpose of using official time. In <span class="Italic">BATF</span> the majority found that the use of official time authorized under section 7131(d) is an integral part of the representational process, which, in turn, generally is a response to management actions taken pursuant to the exercise of the rights reserved to management under section 7106 and which have an adverse effect on employees. The majority found that Provisions 2 and 6 were intended to enable employees to address the myriad adverse effects that foreseeably could flow from the exercise of management rights set forth in section 7106 of the Statute and, consequently, constituted an arrangement for employees within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3). Additionally, in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> the majority found that in those few circumstances where the need to engage in representational activity was not attributable to the exercise of a management right, Provisions 2 and 6 served as arrangements for employees whose ability to seek and obtain union representation would be curtailed by the Agency's exercise of its right to assign work. In this regard, the majority found that agency denials of requests to use official time for a purpose that had been agreed to under section 7131(d) undermined the statutory scheme of enabling employees to protect their work-related interests through collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We view the circumstances regarding Provision 1 in this case as sufficiently similar to those surrounding Provisions 2 and 6 in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> that the rationale applied to those two provisions is equally applicable here. Thus, for the reasons expressed in conjunction with Provisions 2 and 6 in <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, we conclude that Provision 1 constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the issue of whether this arrangement is appropriate, we find that nothing in the record in this case suggests that a different outcome from that reached in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> is warranted with respect to the second portion of the <span class="Italic">KANG</span> analysis. Because the reasoning expressed in conjunction with Provisions 2 and 6 in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> is equally applicable to Provision 1 in this case, we adopt it in this case. Thus, based on an examination of the competing practical needs of the parties, we conclude that the benefits that this arrangement confers on employees outweigh the negative impact on management's right to assign work. Therefore, we conclude that Provision 1 constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
