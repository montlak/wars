<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-72"><span class="space">4.</span> Appointment Pending Conversion to Competitive Service</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 USC 7511, the definition of an employee for purposes of MSPB appeal rights includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service[.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For term employees, OPM defines a trial period, 5 CFR 316.304 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Trial period</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The first year of service of a term employee is a trial period regardless of the method of appointment. Prior Federal civilian service is credited toward completion of the required trial period in the same manner as prescribed by &#x00A7; 315.802 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The agency may terminate a term employee at any time during the trial period. The employee is entitled to the procedures set forth in &#x00A7; 315.804 or &#x00A7; 315.805 of this chapter as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Few Board decisions interpret the statutory phrase. But extensive discussion in <span class="Italic">Nelson v. DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/NELSON_LARA_DE_3443_11_0109_B_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_788308.pdf">119 MSPR 276</a>, 278-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2013 MSPB 4 (2013), determined that for the employee whose appointment is pending conversion, the focus is on "whether the agency required the appellant to serve a probationary or trial period and whether the appellant successfully completed the probationary period at the time of her termination or removal":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was appointed to a position with the Indian Health Service under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3116(b)(8),[2] a Schedule A excepted service hiring authority granting Indian hiring preference. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101;[3] 42 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 136.42(b). The agency terminated her employment on November 18, 2010, less than 2 years after the November 23, 2008 effective date of her appointment. She filed an appeal, arguing that she was entitled to Board appeal rights and that she was improperly terminated. She asserted that she was not serving a probationary period and that, even if she was required to serve a 2-year probationary period, she had already served the 2 years because she was appointed on October 31, 2008, and the agency terminated her employment on November 18, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 213.3116(b)(8) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3116(b)(8)) identifies as Schedule A appointments: "All positions in the Public Health Service and other positions in the Department of Health and Human Services directly and primarily related to providing services to Indians when filled by the appointment of Indians." 64 Fed. Reg. 48,462, 48,468 (Sept. 3, 1999); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101 (concerning the authorization for and recording of appointments to Schedule A positions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 213.3101 (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101) states in part: "Positions filled under this authority are excepted from the competitive service and constitute Schedule A. For each authorization under this section, [the Office of Personnel Management] shall assign an identifying number from 213.3102 through 213.3199 to be used by the appointing agency in recording appointments made under that authorization." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.103(c) (requiring the Office of Personnel Management to annually publish in the Federal Register a consolidated listing of Schedule A, B, and C excepted appointing authorities); 64 Fed. Reg. at 48,468.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, finding that the appellant was required to serve a 2-year probationary period under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). He further found that her probationary period began on November 24, 2008, the date that she reported to work. He concluded that she did not satisfy the definition of employee because she did not serve in her position for 2 years prior to her termination on November 18, 2010. The Board affirmed the administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not satisfy the definition of "employee" set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) but remanded on the issue of whether the appellant satisfied the definition of employee set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because there was evidence in the record that she was serving in an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge found that the appellant was serving in an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service and that she was serving a probationary period at the time of her termination because, as a matter of law, the entire time served in such appointments is a probationary or trial period within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), irrespective of the probationary requirement specifically imposed by the agency. Thus, he concluded that the appellant was not an "employee" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). He also incorporated his prior finding, which the Board had affirmed, that the appellant was not an "employee" as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because she had not completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that the agency failed to cite to any statutory or regulatory provisions requiring her appointment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3116(b)(8) to be subject to a probationary period. Further, she asserts that the administrative judge erroneously relied upon <span class="Italic">Lopez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 55 (2006), and <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Navy</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 99 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1999), to find that the period of time that she served in the excepted service prior to conversion to the competitive service was a probationary or trial period within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). The agency has filed an opposition to her petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;In this context, a preference eligible generally means a veteran who served on active duty in the armed forces during a war or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized, or during certain other designated periods; a disabled veteran; or, in some cases, a widow or widower, spouse, or mother of a veteran. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2108(3); <span class="Italic">see Alley v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was appointed to a Schedule A excepted service position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3116(b)(8), an Indian preference hiring authority, in an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 450i(m); 42 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 136.42(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101; 64 Fed. Reg. at 48,468. The parties dispute whether the appellant was serving a probationary or trial period at the time of the termination of her employment. As discussed above, the administrative judge found that the appellant was serving a probationary period in the excepted service on the basis that any service prior to conversion to the competitive service was a probationary or trial period within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). <span class="Italic">See Lopez</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 55, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11; <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lopez</span>, the Board cited the interim guidance of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) concerning its adoption of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(11), which applies to "nonpreference eligible employees in excepted service appointments pending conversion to the competitive service." 103 M.S.P.R. 55, &#x00B6; 10; 57 Fed. Reg. 20,041 (May 11, 1992);[5] <span class="Italic">see Taylor</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 102. The guidance specifically states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These special types of appointments are made with the intent of <span id="Page_99"></span>converting the employee to an appointment in the competitive service and provide noncompetitive conversion eligibility if the employee has satisfied eligibility requirements. Those requirements include a demonstration of satisfactory performance or training, and constitute the "probationary or trial period" referred to in 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). Employees under these appointments have no procedural or appeal rights, but gain such rights upon conversion to the competitive service. These special appointments include those made under the Presidential Management Intern Program, the Student Work-Study Program ("co-ops"), Veterans Readjustment Appointments (VRA), certain Schedule A appointments of the severely disabled, and others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">57 Fed. Reg. at 21,041.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;OPM has revised 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(11) since the <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> and <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> decisions, but the revisions do not affect our analysis here. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(d)(11) (2007); 73 Fed. Reg. 7,187, 7,188 (Feb. 7, 2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As evident by the language above, OPM's regulations apply to Schedule A appointments, including an Indian hiring preference appointment under 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 450i(m). Furthermore, <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> and <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> adopted OPM's interpretation of the statute to mean that the entire period of these special appointments is a "probationary or trial period" in which the incumbent does not obtain appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that this interpretation of the statute is contrary to accepted canons of statutory construction. <span class="Italic">See Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (a statute should not be interpreted so as to render part of it meaningless). If the entire period of an appointment pending conversion to the competitive service is a "probationary or trial period," then 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) should simply state that appeal rights attach if an individual "is not serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." Instead, the complete language of the section states the definition of employee includes an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible) "who is not serving <span class="Italic">a probationary or trial period</span> under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) (emphasis added). The highlighted language strongly suggests that whether an individual had the type of appointment covered by the section and whether the individual had completed a probationary or trial period are separate inquiries. Indeed, defining the entire period of an excepted service appointment pending conversion to the competitive service as a trial period would make 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) meaningless because, upon conversion, the individual's rights are governed by the competitive service appeal rights provision in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). In other words, under this interpretation of the statute, there could never be a scenario under which an individual would have appeal rights under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) because any individual with this type of appointment would always be serving a probationary or trial period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute, which on its face sets out "alternative" ways under subsections (C)(i) and (ii) for a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service to attain tenure and appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151, should not be interpreted as foreclosing satisfaction of the first alternative in every conceivable situation. In this regard, the Board has already rejected by implication, a reading of the statute that would treat a Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP) internship as a trial period <span class="Italic">per se</span>. <span class="Italic">See McCrary v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-15 (2006) (finding that an individual whose FCIP appointment was terminated in its first 2 years had appeal rights under subsection (C)(i) because she was entitled to credit toward completion of probation based on prior service); <span class="Italic">see also Martinez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 6 (2012) (remanding an appeal to determine whether the appellant could tack his prior service toward completion of the probationary or trial period of an FCIP appointment under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i)). The better reading of the statute, as illustrated in <span class="Italic">McCrary</span> and <span class="Italic">Martinez</span>, is that it is possible to complete a probationary or trial period under these special appointments prior to the expiration of the appointment. Therefore, to avoid making this provision meaningless, we find that the statute contemplates that appointments to an excepted service position pending conversion to the competitive service may include some period after completion of a probationary or trial period when the individual qualifies as an "employee" under section 7511(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, to the extent that <span class="Italic">Lopez</span> and <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> interpret 5 U.S.C. 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) to require that the entire period of these special appointments is a probationary or trial period in which the incumbent does not obtain appeal rights, they are overruled. Instead, we find that the necessary determination on jurisdiction to be made with regard to these special appointments is whether the agency required the appellant to serve a probationary or trial period and whether the appellant successfully completed the probationary period at the time of her termination or removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows that the agency required nonpreference eligible employees hired under its Schedule A Indian Preference program to serve a 2-year probationary period, and the appellant was informed of this requirement. Furthermore, as we found previously, the appellant served in her position for less than 2 years; therefore, the agency terminated the appellant's employment prior to the completion of her probationary period. Accordingly, this appeal was properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective March 4, 2005, the agency terminated the appellant from her excepted service Guidance Counselor position during her probationary period for post-appointment reasons. At the time of her termination, the appellant had been in her position since July 26, 2004, and had prior service as a Guidance Counselor in a series of consecutive term appointments in the competitive service, the last of which ended on July 3, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that she is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) <span class="Italic">and</span> (ii). That statute provides that an "employee" is a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C). It is undisputed that the appellant was a nonpreference eligible in an excepted service appointment, so she is an "employee" only if she meets the criteria in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We address subsection (C)(ii) first. The appellant contends that she has two years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. "Current continuous service" means service immediately prior to the action at issue without a break in service of a work day. <span class="Italic">Beets v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 7 (2005); <span class="Italic">Ellefson v. Department of the Army,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 14 (2005). The appellant contends that the break in service rule applies only to positions in the competitive service. However, the Board has held that the definition of "current continuous service" is the same in competitive service and excepted service cases. <span class="Italic">See Jolivette v. Department of the Navy,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 10 (2005); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b). Because the appellant's July 26, 2004 appointment as a Guidance Counselor was preceded by a break in service of more than one workday, she is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue is whether the appellant was serving a probationary period at the time of her separation. The record reflects that the appellant was appointed on July 26, 2004, pursuant to the Federal Career Intern Program (FCIP), which is an excepted service appointment pending conversion to the competitive service upon the successful completion of a two-year trial period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6), 315.712.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that her prior service as a Guidance Counselor from June 3, 2002, to July 3, 2004, counts towards completion of her probationary period. Prior service in <span class="Italic">competitive</span> service positions can be credited towards completion of a later probationary or trial period in a competitive service position if the employee shows that: (1) The prior service was performed in the same agency; (2) it was performed in the same line of work; and (3) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ellefson</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 16; <span class="Italic">Francis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 545, 547-48 (1992). We have not yet had the opportunity to consider whether this standard applies in <span class="Italic">excepted</span> service cases. We find that it does.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has applied the competitive service standard set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b) to excepted service appointments made under the Veterans Readjustment Act (VRA). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Enocencio v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 5 (1998); <span class="Italic">McLoughlin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 150, 154-55 (1998). As noted above, 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H does not apply to excepted service appointments. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6; 9. However, employees in VRA appointments have been afforded the same appeal rights during the first year of their trial periods as competitive service employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 307.104. Most other excepted service appointments, including FCIP appointments, do not have rights under 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H. Nevertheless, neither Congress nor the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) have seen fit to provide any guidance as to whether any prior service should count <span id="Page_100"></span>towards the completion of a probationary period in non-VRA excepted service appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of any such guidance, it falls to us to decide if and when prior service should count towards the completion of a probationary period in the excepted service. As noted above, we have applied competitive service definitions of "current continuous service" to the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jolivette</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 216, &#x00B6; 10. We are aware of no reason why we should not also apply competitive service concepts of tacking in the context of probationary periods to the excepted service. Furthermore, absent any direction from Congress or OPM, we find that applying the 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H notion of tacking to excepted service positions promotes the goals of uniformity and clarity and prevents the further complication of our precedent regarding the statutory definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). Accordingly, we hold that prior service can be tacked towards the completion of a probationary period in the excepted service where: (1) The prior service was performed in the same agency; (2) it was performed in the same line of work; and (3) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this standard to this case, the record reflects that the appellant's prior service, occurring with a break in service of less than 30 days, meets these criteria if her prior service was in the same agency and in the same line of work. It is clear that her prior service was in the same agency; both her prior appointments and the appointment from which she was terminated were in the Department of the Army, Fort Gordon, Directorate of Human Resources, Education and Career Development Division. The only remaining question is whether the positions were in the same line of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions are in the same line of work if they involve work that is so similar that the positions require the same qualifications, and the nature of the work would place them in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes. <span class="Italic">Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 11. Another interpretation of the phrase "same line of work" is that the positions involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar knowledge, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Beets</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's prior service was as a Guidance Counselor, GS-1740-09. The position at issue in this appeal was a Guidance Counselor, GS-1740-05. Despite the difference in grade, the undisputed duties and responsibilities listed on the cover page of the appellant's performance standards for the performance years beginning November 1, 2002, and July 26, 2004, are identical. We find, therefore, that the appellant's prior service was in the same line of work as the position from which she was terminated. Thus, her prior service counts towards the completion of her probationary period, and she is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) with the right to appeal her separation to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d), 7701(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">McCrary</span> can be better understood with some information about the appellant's employment history, taken from the initial decision leading to the Board's 2006 final decision. From that nonprecedential initial decision, <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Dept. of Army,</span> AT-315H-06-0120-I-1 (December 29, 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following facts are not in dispute. The appellant was placed in a term appointment as a guidance counselor, for a period not to exceed four years, effective June 3, 2002. Effective July 1, 2003, the term was continued for another one-year period. In the spring of 2004, the Installation Management Agency (IMA) instructed installation garrison commanders to eliminate all term appointments not essential for support of the Global War on Terror. Therefore, in accordance with this directive, the appellant's term appointment was terminated on July 3, 2004. Effective July 26, 2004, the appellant accepted an excepted service position with the Federal Career Intern Program which included a two-year trial/probationary period. On March 4, 2005, the appellant was terminated from the Federal Career Intern Program based upon her inability to maintain effective relationships with co-workers and with her supervisor. Furthermore, the agency found that the appellant was argumentative and showed a lack of understanding to differing opinions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The result in <span class="Italic">McCrary</span> is that for the nonpreference eligible, it is not the nature of the appointment preceding the termination that is important, but its duration, the similarity of duties, and the identity of agencies. The termination was reversed on remand for lack of constitutional due process (AT-315H-06-0120-B-1 Initial Decision of December 4, 2006). The Board denied a further appeal following remand on the timeliness of McCrary's appeal (AT-315H-06-0120-B-1, July 13, 2007). The <span class="Italic">McCrary</span> analysis was summarized in <span class="Italic">Martinez v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 154, 156-57 &#x00B6; 6, 2012 MSPB 69 (2012), also involving an FCIP appointment, determining the positions of Border Patrol Agent and Customs and Border Protection Officer to be sufficiently similar for a hearing on the jurisdictional issue of excepted service tacking).

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Francis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 120 MSPR 138, 145-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-21, 2013 MSPB 73 (2013), involving termination of an FCIP employee, the Board looked to external sources, including agency regulations, to determine if a period of probation was required or established that, once completed, enabled an employee to appeal from an adverse action imposed during service pending appointment to a competitive position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has described the FCIP as providing for an excepted appointment pending conversion to the competitive service after successful completion of "a two-year trial period," <span class="Italic">McCrary v. Department of the Army</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 9 (2006), but the authorities cited for this statement, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 213.3202(o)(6) and 315.712, do not support it. Furthermore, the preface to the Federal Register notice announcing the government-wide rules concerning the FCIP says nothing about a probationary or trial period, and the rules themselves are silent on the matter. 70 Fed. Reg. 44219 (2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3202(o). Likewise, Executive Order No. 13,162, which authorized the FCIP, does not mention a probationary or trial period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statement in <span class="Italic">McCrary</span> that an FCIP appointment comes with a two-year "trial period" may have been intended to mean that the entire internship is a "trial period." The problem with this approach is that it renders part of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) superfluous, contrary to accepted canons of statutory construction. <span class="Italic">See Holley v. United States</span>, 124 F.3d 1462, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (a statute should not be interpreted so as to render part of it meaningless). If an appointment pending conversion to the competitive service is a "trial period," then the statute should simply state that appeal rights attach if an individual "is not serving under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service." The complete language--"not serving <span class="Italic">a probationary or trial period</span> under an initial appointment pending conversion to the competitive service"--strongly suggests that whether an individual had the type of appointment covered by subsection (C)(i) and whether he completed the requisite probationary or trial period under such an appointment are separate inquiries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, treating an appointment pending conversion to the competitive service as a "trial period" would make all of subsection (C)(i) meaningless, since upon conversion the individual's rights would be governed by the competitive-service appeal rights provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). There could never be a scenario under which an individual would have appeal rights under subsection (C)(i) because any individual with the type of appointment described therein--excepted, pending conversion to the competitive service--would <span class="Italic">always</span> be serving a trial period. The statute, which on its face sets out "alternative" ways for a non-preference eligible in the excepted service to attain tenure and appeal rights, <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1148, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999), should not be interpreted as foreclosing satisfaction of the first alternative in every conceivable situation. We therefore hold that an excepted appointment pending conversion to the competitive service should not be viewed as a probationary or trial period <span class="Italic">per se</span>; instead, whether an individual holding such an appointment is serving a probationary or trial period must be determined under some authority outside of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) that establishes the probationary or trial period.[9]</p>

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (2013), where we held that an individual who held a Schedule A appointment under the Indian Preference Act and implementing regulations, <span class="Italic">see</span> 25 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 450i(m) &#x0026; 472; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3101, could not be deemed to have been serving a probationary or trial period merely because her appointment was in the excepted service pending conversion to the competitive service. Instead, in determining whether that individual was an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(1), we looked to the agency's rule, which established a two-year probationary period for that type of appointment. 119 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, the agency does not cite any authority for its assertion that the appellant in the present case was required to serve a two-year probationary period. However, our research indicates that the Department of Defense (DOD) issued DOD-1400.25-M on April 28, 2006. Section SC1950 pertains to DOD's staffing and employment policies.[10] <span class="Italic">See</span> DOD-1400.25-M, <a href="http://www.lejeune.usmc.mil/hroeast/1950_StaffingAndEmployment.pdf.SC1950.2">www.lejeune.usmc.mil/hroeast/1950_StaffingAndEmployment.pdf.SC1950.2</a> provides that the policy applies to "the Military Departments," among other agencies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2. SC1950.5.2.1.1.2. provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees appointed under excepted service appointment types in Table SC1950-1 shall serve a probationary period commensurate with the period of time expected for conversion to the competitive service. Prior to conversion to competitive status, employees must meet the applicable probationary period requirements specified for the type of appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3. This subsection includes Table SC1950-1, Probationary Period Requirements for Excepted Service Positions, which provides that an FCIP appointment is subject to 2-year probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;We take judicial notice of the April 28, 2006 version of DOD-<span id="Page_101"></span>1400.25-M, which is readily available to the public. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.64.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on DOD-1400.25-M, SC1950.5.2.1.1.2, Table SC1950-1, which appears to be an agency-specific rule regarding the length of FCIP probationary periods, we question whether the SF-50 documenting the appellant's appointment is correct in stating that the appellant's appointment was subject to a 1-year probationary period, and therefore whether the agency terminated the appellant during her probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Grigsby v. Department of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (an SF-50 containing incorrect information will not control an individual's legal status). However, we have no way of knowing whether DOD issued a more recent staffing and employment policy after April 28, 2006, whether the agency supplemented this policy, or whether the agency is exempt from the requirements under SC1950. As the record is not sufficiently developed for us to decide the jurisdictional issue, we FORWARD the file to the Atlanta Regional Office for docketing of a chapter 75 appeal and adjudication of the jurisdictional issue in accordance with this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to excepted service employees not in positions that will be converted to competitive service, the calculus reverts to analysis of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. The agency need not be the same, <span class="Italic">Maibaum v. VA</span>, 116 MSPR 234, 238 &#x00B6; 9, 2011 MSPB 18 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...for a preference eligible in the excepted service, the absence or completion of a probationary or trial period is not determinative of "employee" status. Rather, the dispositive issue is whether the appellant satisfied the 1-year current continuous service requirement at the time of his separation. <span class="Italic">See Zambito v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 550, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). We must therefore determine whether the appellant's prior employment as a Postal Service Clerk may be tacked on to his service with the agency to meet that requirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through similar analysis, in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-4324-13-0112-I-1 (NP 4/22/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was a preference eligible in an excepted service appointment. Accordingly, he is an "employee" only if he meets the criteria under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). Because the appellant served under his November 16, 2009 appointment for less than one year and such appointment was preceded by a break in service of more than one workday, he is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See Maibaum</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 234, &#x00B6; 14 (although a single break in service of less than 30 days is permissible when tacking on prior service to complete a probationary or trial period, such 30-day rule is inapplicable in determining whether prior service may be counted toward the "current continuous service" requirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)). Therefore, the administrative judges properly determined that the appellant is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) with adverse action appeal rights.</p>
