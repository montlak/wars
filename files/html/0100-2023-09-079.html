<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-78"><span class="space">c.</span> Constructive Receipt of Decision Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Constructive receipt may start the clock for an appeal. Delivery of a decision notice to a residence, rather than to the appellant, appears sufficient to trigger a filing period even if the appellant does not receive the notice. Under current regulations, effective in 2012, 5 CFR 1201.22(b) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying the 2012 regulation, when the appellant designated to the agency his father's address as his address of record, the appeal time ran from delivery to that address, <span class="Italic">Marcantel v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 121 MSPR 330, 333-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9, 2014 MSPB 50 (2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulation regarding an appellant's obligation to keep the agency informed of his address for purposes of receiving an agency decision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), went into effect on November 13, 2012, and is applicable to this matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> Merit Systems Protection Board Practices and Procedures, 77 Fed. Reg. 62350, 62352 (Oct. 12, 2012) (stating that the regulation became effective November 13, 2012). The regulation reads as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3). The rule also includes illustrative examples of circumstances in which an appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision, including an appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his post office box and a roommate's receipt of an agency decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Examples A, C.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, through his attorney, stated below that he (the appellant) was working on an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico at the time his removal was effected. Although the appellant does not dispute that he provided his father's address to the agency for the purpose of receiving correspondence, he explained below that he did not return to his father's address and did not personally receive the notice of decision until March 28, 2013. The appellant further asserted that April 29, 2013, was the first business day following the 30th day after service on March 28, 2013, and thus, his appeal was timely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by the appellant's arguments on review. In particular, the record does not support the appellant's assertion that he rebutted the presumption that the letter was "delivered to the addressee" as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3) because he did not actually receive the letter or have notice of its contents until March 28, 2013. Importantly, the agency properly sent the decision letter to the appellant's address of record, and the appellant's father signed the certified mail return receipt for the notice on the appellant's behalf on March 16, 2013. We find that this service constitutes receipt by the appellant pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_970"></span>The appellant's claim that he had "no notice of impending delivery," is inconsistent with the fact that he was on notice that the agency might render a decision on the proposed removal, which had been issued in October 2012. Moreover, the record reflects that, due to the ongoing issues regarding his "Q" access authorization dating as far back as February 2012, the appellant secured employment on an off-shore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico during the 2012-2013 time frame. Thus, having been aware that the agency would likely issue a decision on the proposed removal while he was working on the off-shore oil rig, the appellant provided his father's address to the agency for correspondence, and he cannot now assert that the agency's delivery of the decision letter to that address, and his father's signature on the certified mail receipt, does not constitute effective receipt for purposes of the filing time limit in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations further provide that "an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3). Example A in the regulation highlights that an appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision when he fails to pick up mail delivered to his post office box. Here, as noted above, the appellant used his father's address as his address of record while working off-shore. The agency properly sent the notice to that address. The appellant returned to his home from the off-shore assignment on March 19, 2013, and then waited until March 28, 2013, before talking with his father and learning of the delivery of the letter. Thus, regardless of appellant's claims that his father was not his designated representative and that he did not reside with his father, we find that he constructively received the letter on March 16, 2013, because his failure to timely retrieve or otherwise learn of his mail cannot be used to frustrate the actual service of the decision. Moreover, even if we accept that the appellant was unable to receive the decision until his return on March 19, 2013, his April 29, 2013 Board appeal was still untimely filed by 10 days.</p>

OPM</span>, DE-0845-17-0017-I-1 (NP 3/16/2023), involving delivery of an OPM reconsideration decision to a private mail holding establishment while the appellant was traveling and promptly appealed after returning to home and retrieving the mail--leading the Board to accept her appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the timeliness order, the appellant explained that she had been traveling from August 9 through August 23, 2016, and that the day after her return, on August 24, 2016, her husband visited their mailbox at Mail-N-Copy--a private mail service company the appellant used as her mailing address of record--and first retrieved OPM's reconsideration decision. She also provided a copy of a restaurant receipt as proof of her departure date and an airline confirmation document showing her return date. She argued that, because she did not know that OPM sent its reconsideration decision to her while she was away from home and she did not receive the decision until August 24, 2016, her appeal dated September 23, 2016, was timely filed within 30 calendar days of her receipt of the decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Regarding the appellant's receipt of an agency's decision, the Board's regulations provide that there is a rebuttable presumption that correspondence that is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address of record via postal or a commercial delivery service is presumed to have been duly delivered. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3). While the regulation provides that there is a rebuttable presumption of delivery, it further provides that the presumption "may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3). However, service may not be avoided by the appellant's intentional or negligent conduct. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulation also provides that an appellant may be "deemed" to have received an agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. <span class="italic">Id</span>. The Board has held that when a statute or a regulation "deems" something to have been done, the event is considered to have occurred whether or not it actually did. <span class="italic">Maurer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 156, &#x00B6; 12 (1999), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 236 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The regulation provides three examples of situations in which an appellant may or may not be deemed to have received an agency's decision.[6] <span class="italic">Id</span>. The use of language such as an appellant "<span class="italic">may</span>...be deemed to have received" an agency's decision and an appellant "<span class="italic">may</span>" overcome the presumption of receipt, <span class="italic">make clear that the Board has the discretion to determine if the presumption of delivery should apply in a given case, and thus, whether the appellant should be deemed to have received the decision on a particular date</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In the Federal Register Notice promulgating the 2012 changes to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), one commenter objected to the use of the examples in the regulations because they might be read as determinative. 77 Fed. Reg. 62,350, 62,352 (Oct. 12, 2012) (codified at 5 C.F.R. parts 1200, 1201, 1203, 1208, and 1209). In response, the Board explained that the examples were offered only as a means to explain the rule to <span class="italic">pro se</span> litigants and emphasized that the cited circumstances "may" establish the contested issue. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the instant appeal, we agree with the administrative judge that OPM's reconsideration decision was properly sent to the appellant's address of record at her mailbox at the Mail-N-Copy, and that it was received at that location on August 19, 2016, thereby creating a rebuttable presumption that the appellant received the reconsideration decision on that date. We nevertheless conclude, based on the circumstances of this case, that the appellant has rebutted the presumption of receipt on August 19, 2016, by providing evidence that she did not physically receive the reconsideration decision until 5 days later when her husband retrieved it from the Mail-N-Copy mailbox on August 24, 2022.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge analogized the appellant's situation to that in <span class="italic">Marcantel v. Department of Energy</span>, the circumstances of that case are factually distinguishable from the circumstances here. In <span class="italic">Marcantel</span>, the Board cited Example A of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), which provides that "[a]n appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision." 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 9. Mr. Marcantel was deemed to have received the agency's removal decision when the decision was sent to his address of record, which was also his father's home, while he was working on an off-shore oil rig, and his father signed the certified mail receipt and received the document on his behalf. <span class="italic">Marcantel</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-7, 9. Mr. Marcantel did not personally receive the removal decision until he had been back from the oil rig for 9 days, which was 12 days after his father accepted delivery on his behalf. The Board found his appeal, filed 14 days after the 30-day filing period, was untimely filed without good cause for the delay. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12. In declining to find that Mr. Marcantel rebutted the presumption of constructive receipt as of the date his father signed for the agency decision, the Board emphasized the language in section 1201.22(b)(3), stating that an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision through intentional or negligent conduct that frustrates actual service. <span class="italic">Marcantel</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike the circumstances in <span class="italic">Marcantel</span> in which Mr. Marcantel's father signed the certified mail receipt and physically received the decision on his son's behalf at his son's address of record, there is no indication that an employee of Mail-N-Copy signed for and received OPM's reconsideration decision on the appellant's behalf, and the appellant asserts that no employee of Mail-N-Copy resides with her. <span class="italic">See Marcantel</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 7. Additionally, the appellant's husband expeditiously retrieved OPM's decision from their mailbox the day after their return from the out-of-state trip. Thus, there is no indication that the appellant engaged in any intentional or negligent conduct that was designed to frustrate actual service. <span class="italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;1201.22(b)(3). This supports the finding that the appellant rebutted the presumption of receipt as of the date the reconsideration decision was placed in her mailbox.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the issuance of the initial decision in this appeal and the filing of most of the pleadings on petition for review, the Board issued its decision in <span class="italic">Little v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 183 (2017). Like <span class="italic">Marcantel</span>, <span class="italic">Little</span> is also distinguishable from the instant appeal. In Little, the appellant checked his post office box on January 12, 2016--the day before the final agency decision (FAD) on his formal equal employment opportunity complaint was placed in the post office box.[7] <span class="italic">Little</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 9. He did not check his post office box again until 4 days later, on January 16, 2016--3 days after the FAD had been placed in his post office box. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. Mr. Little subsequently filed his Board appeal on February 13, 2016, and contended that the filing period should have been calculated based on January 16, 2016, the date that he physically retrieved the decision from his post office box. <span class="italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 9. In its decision, the Board again relied on Example A from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3) to conclude that the appellant was deemed to have constructively received the agency's decision when it was placed in his post office box. <span class="italic">Little</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="italic">Little</span> involved the timeliness of a Board appeal challenging a final agency decision regarding discrimination filed pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154. <span class="italic">Little</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 8. However, the date an appellant is deemed to have received the final agency decision is determined as set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), so <span class="italic">Little</span> is instructive here. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, the appellant in this case did not return home from her trip until more than 4 days after the agency decision had been placed in her mailbox. Her husband checked the mailbox on her behalf the day after their return, and she calculated her filing timeline based on that date. Unlike the appellant, who was out of her state of residence at the time the agency decision was delivered, and who checked her mailbox at the first available opportunity, Mr. Little had the opportunity to retrieve the agency's decision from his P.O. box at any time after it was placed in his mailbox on January 13, 2016, and so his delay in receiving the agency decision was the consequence of his own conduct, driven <span id="Page_971"></span>by considerations of personal convenience. <span class="italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3) (stating that an appellant "may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, in <span class="italic">Little</span> the Board observed that the appellant was under a "heightened obligation" to monitor his incoming mail, given that an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission administrative judge had recently remanded his case to the agency for issuance of a FAD. <span class="italic">Little</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 3 n.1, &#x00B6; 9 n.2. In this case, however, the appellant had waited nearly 3 years for OPM to issue a reconsideration decision and thus she would have had little reason to expect it during a brief 14-day window when she was out of state and unable to retrieve her mail. The last correspondence she had received from OPM was a June 29, 2016 request for an updated Financial Resources Questionnaire, which made no mention that issuance of a reconsideration decision was imminent, provided that the appellant timely responded with the requested information, which OPM has not argued that she failed to do.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, based on the facts of this case, we find that the appellant successfully rebutted the presumption that she received OPM's reconsideration decision on August 19, 2016, and instead established that she did not actually receive the decision until August 24, 2016. Therefore, that is the date that controls for determining the timeliness of her Board appeal. Consequently, we conclude that her Board appeal, filed 30 days later on September 23, 2016, was timely, and the administrative judge erred by dismissing the appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Construing constructive service of a removal decision, <span class="Italic">De Vaughn v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, CH-0752-14-0040-I-1 (NP 7/17/2014), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, regardless of whether the agency sent the letter only via FedEx, or via both FedEx and U.S. mail, the appellant constructively received the letter when she failed to take any steps to retrieve it after receiving notice of its attempted delivery. An appellant is presumed to have received an agency's decision that is properly addressed and sent to her address via postal or commercial delivery. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3); <span class="Italic">see Butler v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 112, &#x00B6; 4 n.2 (2013) (indicating that revised section 1201.22(b)(3), applies to appeals filed after its effective date of November 13, 2012). The appellant may not avoid service by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3). For example, an appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant received notice of the attempted delivery of her letter of decision in June 2013. Although the appellant claims that she did not know who sent the package, she also acknowledged that the agency had consistently sent communications to her via UPS, FedEx, or certified mail since 2007, and that her receipt of letters from FedEx "ha[d] been a frequent occurrence." Further, within the prior 3 months, the appellant had received and responded to the agency's proposed removal, and thus was or should have been aware that a decision was imminent. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant constructively received the letter of decision on June 27, 2013, and that her appeal in <span class="Italic">DeVaughn I</span> was therefore properly dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Landgren v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-0752-15-0369-I-1 (NP 9/28/2015), dismissed as untimely another appeal when constructive service was proved:</p>

We find that, under these circumstances, the appellant avoided service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct that frustrated actual service, and that her appeal, filed more than 30 days after the March 18, 2015 effective date of the agency action is properly dismissed as untimely filed....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Decisions before the 2012 regulation applied precedent that developed the concept of constructive receipt. According to <span class="Italic">Sator v. OPM</span>, 25 MSPR 456, 456-57 (1984), involving a retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit in appellant's argument that he did not receive actual notice of the Office of Personnel Management's reconsideration decision affirming the denial of his application for disability retirement. Relying on <span class="Italic">Matsibekker v. Heckler,</span> 738 F.2d 79 (2d Cir. 1984), appellant argues that it was incumbent upon OPM to refute his claim of non-receipt of OPM's decision notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that <span class="Italic">Matsibekker</span> is applicable to the instant case, we read that opinion as turning on the agency's failure to offer proof of delivery of its decision notice to the claimant's home address rather than actual receipt of the notice by the claimant. In the instant case, OPM submitted the proof found lacking in <span class="Italic">Matsibekker,</span> i.e., a certified mail return receipt showing that its decision notice had been delivered to an Oxon Hill, Maryland, address apparently furnished by appellant. Thus, that case offers no basis for reversal of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has proffered as new and material evidence an affidavit from the individual who signed the return receipt. This individual asserts that appellant never came back to the house and she was unable to locate him. Even if the proffered evidence is new, we do not find it sufficient to warrant a waiver of the time limit under our decision in <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180 (1980). Although appellant asserts that he was not residing full-time at the Oxon Hill address, he does not contend that he notified OPM of this circumstance or made other arrangements to insure receipt of OPM's decision notice after moving from that address. Since appellant was aware that OPM was going to issue a decision on his disability claim and that the decision notice would be sent to his last known address, appellant failed to exercise the care of a reasonably prudent person by not checking at that address. <span class="Italic">See Oates v. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 6 MSPB 325, 6 MSPR 382 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note, as did the presiding official, that appellant waited over four months to file his petition for appeal after his Congressman was specifically notified by OPM that appellant's disability retirement had been denied in October 1982. Thus, appellant has also failed to establish good cause for his delay in filing a petition after his Congressman had been notified of OPM's denial of his disability retirement application even if the earlier delay could be found to be excusable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of constructive receipt of a personnel action was discussed in <span class="Italic">Crearer v. DOJ</span>, 84 MSPR 434, 436 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Board and its reviewing court have found constructive receipt where documents are received by relatives at the addresses designated by the appellants for the receipt of notice.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the record reflects that the agency sent its Notice of Personnel Action to the address provided on the appellant's petition for appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the appellant contends that the time period for filing his appeal did not begin to run until August 13, 2005, the date he alleges he actually received the final agency decision. This argument is without merit. Both the Board and our reviewing court have found constructive receipt so as to trigger the period for filing an appeal where documents are received by relatives at the addresses designated by appellants. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crearer v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Washington v. GPO,</span> DC-0752-10-0245-I-1 (NP 10/15/2010), also addressed constructive receipt of a decision notice at the appellant's address of record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[Appellant] contends that he did not actually receive the agency's decision letter until December 7, 2009 upon returning from out-of-town. Even if the Board were to entertain this argument, the appellant does not deny that the decision letter was delivered to his address of record, his parents' home, on December 5, 2009, as shown by the FedEx online tracking information. Under these circumstances, we deem the appellant to have constructively received the decision letter at the time of delivery. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d 537, 541 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (upholding agency ruling that the appellant received notice of proposed removal when his mother signed for it at his address of record, rather than four days later, when he personally received the document); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 230 F. App'x 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (holding that the Board did not abuse its discretion in finding that an employee constructively received a final decision, when the employee's mother-in-law signed for the certified letter while the employee was out-of-town).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, while not disputing that FedEx delivered the decision letter on December 5, 2009, to his address of record, the appellant objects to the fact that it was delivered without a signature for receipt. However, the Federal Circuit has previously held, in an unpublished decision, that substantial evidence supported the administrative judge's finding that the appellant received the FedEx package containing her decision letter on the date it was delivered, even though, as here, FedEx left the package at the employee's address of record without obtaining a signature. <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 225 F. App'x 871, 873-74 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Likewise, here, we find that the fact that the letter was left at appellant's address of record with no signature of receipt does not alter our finding that the appellant is deemed to have received the letter on the date that it was delivered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the delivery of the letter to his address of record did not comport with the agency's past practice. However, beyond the unsubstantiated claim of his representative, the appellant submits no evidence of any agency policy, rule or regulation that was transgressed by the agency's decision to serve the decision letter upon him by overnight delivery and regular mail at his address of record.
