<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-41"><span class="space">a.</span> Identification of Positions for Transfer</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If the position is incorrectly identified for transfer and the employee is subjected to a RIF by the gaining agency, the RIF will be reversed. <span class="Italic">Rich v. USDA</span>, 26 MSPR 228, 232 (1985). Under <span class="Italic">Rich,</span> the identification process in a transfer of function is vital to the basic rights of an employee. It is by this analysis that the retention rights of the employee are determined. Proper identification is required because in a transfer of function, the performance of a particular function that is transferred may trigger the invocation of RIF procedures should there develop a surplus of employees assigned to the gaining organization. If an organization has functions that remain as well as some functions that transfer, the identification process is of greater significance. An error during this process may result in an employee improperly competing for retention at the gaining agency instead of the losing agency. On challenge, the agency must establish the propriety of the identification procedures. Citing <span class="Italic">Hurley v. United States</span>, 575 F.2d 792 (10th Cir. 1978), <span class="Italic">Rich</span> noted that during identification of employees in a transfer of function, the actual duties of an individual are controlling; they are of more evidentiary weight than either outdated position descriptions or duties an appellant might have performed if an assignment resulted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Biter v. ICC</span>, 76 MSPR 82, 88 (1997) (in an appeal involving a transfer of function, the agency must, when challenged, specifically establish the propriety of identification procedures; OPM identification procedures at 5 CFR 351.303 (2022) were applicable to the SES (case of Appellant Biter)). <span class="Italic">Rich</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, mirrored a court's sentiments in <span class="Italic">Hurley v. United States</span>, 575 F.2d 792, 797-98 (10th Cir. 1978):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The duty of the administrative agency is to be particularly sensitive in identifying employees with transferring functions so as to insure that their rights and obligations are protected....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Logic alone would dictate that the usefulness of any written statement as proof of its content is necessarily linked to its accuracy. Therefore, the gross inaccuracy of the position description resulting from the agency's own failure to comply with proscribed record keeping procedures effectively undermines any evidentiary usefulness it otherwise might provide. We also observe that as between duties and responsibilities actually performed and those merely listed in obsolete job descriptions, but not performed, the former must carry greater evidentiary weight in any rational standard of what determines grade-controlling duties....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 21 MSPR 379, 383-84, 390-94 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Certain Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 762 F.2d 978 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">post</span>, discussed application of law concerning transfers of function from one agency to another and the responsibility the transferring agency properly to identify the employees associated with the transferred function:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue before the Board is whether a transfer of function has occurred. Before examining the functions now performed by OSC and determining whether those functions transferred from CSA, however, we begin our analysis by examining the term "function." Although this term evolved from the Reorganization Act of 1939 (53 Stat. 562) and the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, neither of those statutes defined function. Subsequently, the former Civil Service Commission defined function as "all, or a clearly identifiable segment of, an agency's mission (including all integral parts of that mission), regardless of how it is performed." 5 CFR 351.203(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this definition may be imprecise, we see no reason to disregard it or alter this definition since it has been utilized by both the Commission and the Office of Personnel Management. However, we will examine in detail the past application of this term in order to provide guidance to resolve this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">McNamara v. Dick</span>, 323 F.2d 276 (D.C. Cir. 1963) <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 375 U.S. 895, 84 S. Ct. 171, 11 L. Ed.2d 124 (1963), the court held the term had to be associated with the "authority, powers and duties" that an agency was "expressly authorized by law" to perform. Therefore, a function has to be a clearly identifiable activity of the agency's mission which consists of substantial authorities, powers, and duties authorized by law which combine to form a segment of the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Enos v. Macy</span>, 321 F.2d 747, 748 (D.C. Cir. 1963). In addition, there must be either a quantitative or qualitative method of identifying the activity as a function. This is necessary in order to ensure traceability when the function is transferred from one entity to another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, it is the functional activities that are described in an agency's enabling legislation, organization manuals, and delegations of authority that are clearly of most significance in determining whether a function has been transferred. Such documents describe the general activities that form the nucleus of the agency missions from which all other activities stem.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once the functions of any two entities are isolated in this fashion, the function of the first entity can be traced to determine whether the function has been transferred or otherwise disposed of, as envisioned by the transfer of function regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.203(h)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The ALJ relied on the legislative statement of an agency's purpose as determinative in resolving the transfer of function issue. While an agency's general "manifesto" of its purpose is relevant, it cannot, in and of itself, be a function. Such a statement provides insufficient information to ascertain the actual and specific "authorities, powers and duties" that form the central operations performed by an agency. The "manifesto" is not a segment of the agency's mission but rather the result desired. Its intangible nature precludes any type of measurement and the traceability envisioned by the transfer of function regulations. 5 CFR 351.303. Moreover, the adoption of such an approach over-simplifies the complexities of government and understates the assortment and possible duplication of activities performed by agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the enabling legislation is of some value, the <span class="Italic">performance</span> of a particular activity is of far more relevance. Thus, if the evidence shows that the functions performed by CSA and OCS are interchangeable and are now being performed by OCS, a transfer of function has been accomplished. On the other hand, if the evidence shows that the functions of OCS are new and different, the result must be that no transfer of function has taken place....&#8197;We must proceed to examine the functional statements of authority, available organizational information and the enabling legislation and its history of both agencies in order to facilitate resolution of the transfer issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, a transfer of function is "the transfer of the performance of a continuing function from one competitive area and its addition to one or more competitive areas." 5 CFR 351.203(h)(1). Moreover, 5 USC 3503 specifically provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a function is transferred from one agency to another, each preference eligible employed in the function shall be transferred to the receiving agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the receiving agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR 351.302(a) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position identified with the transferring function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or her employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, if the transfer of function requires a reduction in force in the losing agency, the employees identified with the function must be afforded the opportunity to transfer with that function to the gaining agency. Significantly, a losing agency is not obliged to conduct a reduction in force to accommodate employees who refuse to transfer with their function. A transfer of function may result in the transfer of an entire staff of an organization. However, if the gaining agency discovers that the transfer of function entails the acquisition of more employees than are needed to perform that function, the gaining agency may find it necessary to have a reduction in force. In this situation the incoming employees not only have a right to compete among themselves but also are entitled to compete with other employees already engaged in the <span id="Page_3051"></span>performance of that function. Significantly, the gaining agency is to treat those incoming employees as its own for reduction in force purposes. The rights of the incoming employees are protected by merging the retention registers of the segment that is being transferred with the retention registers of the gaining agency. The employees not only compete for retention during the first round of competition, but also have rights of assignment in the second round of competition.[20] To assist agencies in the accomplishment of this consistent with the RIF procedures, OPM has promulgated regulations which outline two methods of identifying positions with a transferring function. The regulations envision that the identification of employee[s] will occur prior to the actual transfer of function.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;The first round of competition entails the process whereby employees compete within their respective competitive levels. The second round of competition relates to those employees who have been released from their competitive levels and are afforded assignment rights consistent with 5 CFR 351.703. In this connection, it is significant to note that a transfer of function does not require the actual physical transfer of all employees to the gaining agency. Where, as in this case, the gaining agency determines that there will be a surplus of employees, the losing agency may act as agent for the gaining agency in separating those employees who unsuccessfully compete for retention at the gaining agency. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Department of Commerce</span>, 19 MSPR 589 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that upon invoking the transfer of function procedures, the agency failed to utilize either of the permissible methods of identification. The agency attempts to justify its noncompliance by contending that the identification procedures used were appropriate due to the unique circumstances in this situation. In lieu of the required procedures the agency adopted procedures which consisted of considering all former CSA employees as being identified with the functions transferred to OCS. The agency then identified all positions in OCS which involved a continuation of a function performed by CSA. Finally, the agency developed master retention registers of competing employees and extended offers of assignment to the highest ranking employee on the appropriate register for each of the designated positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An examination of the record in this case reflects that while the agency attempted to identify the functions that were to continue at OCS, it failed to match those continuing functions with any individual employee who had been identified with that function prior to the transfer. This was error and circumvents the retention preference order established by the regulations. As previously noted, in a transfer of function, the operation of the function must cease in one competitive area and be carried on in another competitive area. Therefore, a function is transferred when it disappears in one location and appears in an identifiable form at another location. In contrast, a function which is discontinued does not appear at another location. Employees whose positions are liquidated and who are not identified with an operating function specifically authorized at the time of the transfer are not competing employees for positions at the gaining agency. 5 CFR 351.302(b). Moreover, the transfer of function regulations contemplate that only those employees whose functions are continuing in the gaining agency (OCS) are entitled to compete for retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper identification of employees in a transfer of function is vital to the entire scheme established by the regulations, in that the rights of the individual employees for retention are established at this stage. Significantly there is an obligation placed upon the agency to ensure the propriety of the identification process. The agency is required to be particularly sensitive in identifying employees with a continuing function. <span class="Italic">Hurley v. United States</span>, 575 F.2d 792, 797 (10th Cir. 1977). Accordingly, we find that the agency was remiss in meeting the responsibilities and obligations imposed by the regulations. 5 CFR 351.303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our finding regarding the transfer of function is sufficient to establish the agency's initial burden of justifying the need for the reduction in force. <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce Commission</span> 2 MSPB 361 (1980). The focus of the inquiry now moves to the identification process where the primary question is one of retention, i.e., which of the former CSA employees have superior rights of retention with OCS. Our finding of error in the identification process does not permit us under the circumstances in this case to invalidate the entire reduction in force. Although 5 USC 3502 establishes rights among employees and promotes competition for retention, it does not create an absolute statutory right of continued employment. <span class="Italic">American Fed. Govt. Emp., AFL-CIO v. Stetson</span>, 460 F.2d 642, 645 (5th Cir. 1981). Where, as in this case, the ultimate question for resolution relates to the retention of substantially fewer employees than were necessary prior to the transfer, the agency's noncompliance with certain provisions of part 351 does not warrant unconditional reversal of the entire reduction in force since many of those employees would have been subjected to separation from the federal service in any event. However, the agency is not relieved from its obligation to establish, when raised by an individual appellant, that no infringement of that individual's substantive rights occurred. <span class="Italic">Wilburn v. Department of Transportation</span>, 19 MSPR 483 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The effects of this agency error as it relates to each appellant have yet to be determined. Upon remand, each individual appellant must be afforded an opportunity to present with some degree of specificity, evidence which tends to establish that he was denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled under 5 CFR 351.303<span class="Italic">. Debold v. Department of the Navy</span>, 9 MSPB 95 (1982). It is therefore incumbent upon each appellant to assert that he was identified with a continuing function that is now being performed by OCS. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. National Transportation Safety Board</span>, 18 MSPR 626 (1984). In addition, the appellant must identify a position or positions for which he was qualified that have been assigned to other employees with less retention standing or positions occupied by employees who had no initial entitlement to transfer. <span class="Italic">Jackson, supra</span>, at 628. Once these factors have been established by the appellant, the agency may refute the contentions made or prove that that appellant's rights have not been abridged by showing that notwithstanding the evidence, the appellant would not, in any event, have been retained. <span class="Italic">Speaker v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Education</span>, 11 MSPB 430 (1982). Should an individual appellant present evidence that tends to establish that he was denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled under 5 CFR 351.303 and the agency is unable or unwilling to refute such evidence by showing it to be untrue or that his retention standing would not have provided such benefit, the appellant would prevail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Certain Former CSA Employees v. DHHS</span>, 762 F.2d 978, 982-85 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 3503 of Title 5 of the United States Code (1982) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;When a function is transferred from one agency to another, each competing employee in the function shall be transferred to the receiving agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the receiving agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;When one agency is replaced by another, each competing employee in the agency to be replaced shall be transferred to the replacing agency for employment in a position for which he is qualified before the replacing agency may make an appointment from another source to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsection (a) thus requires that, when there has been a transfer of function from one agency to another, an employee of the transferring agency shall be transferred to the receiving agency for employment "in a position for which he is qualified" before the receiving agency appoints a person not from the transferring agency to that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An implementing regulation provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;Before a reduction in force is made in connection with the transfer of any or all of the functions of a competitive area to another continuing competitive area, each competing employee in a position identified with the transferring function or functions shall be transferred to the continuing competitive area without any change in the tenure of his or her employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. Sec. 351.302(a) (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board found that the block grant function was a new function and therefore had not been transferred from the Community Services Administration to the Office of Community Services, but that the other functions of the former agency had been so transferred. That finding is supported by substantial evidence, and we have no basis to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department conceded, both in the administrative proceedings and before this court, that all the Community Services Administration employees were "identified" with the functions that were transferred from that agency to the Office of Community Services. In the light of that concession, section 3503(a) required the Department to offer Community Services Administration employees positions in the Office of Community Services for which they were qualified before hiring anyone else for those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department did not do so initially, since it took the position that because the Community Services Administration was being abolished, its employees had no reassignment rights. Following the district court's decision in the Schweiker case (<span class="Italic">supra</span>, p. 980), however, the Department corrected its error. It filled all of the jobs in the Office of Community Services associated with the transferred functions with former employees of the Community Services Administration, made the appointments of those employees effective as of October 1, 1981, and gave the employees backpay to that date. The result of this action was retroactively to give the reemployed Community Services Administration employees all the rights they had under section 3503(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recognized that at the time of the termination of the Community Services Administration and the establishment of the Office of Community Services--which the Department treated as a reduction-in-force--<span id="Page_3052"></span>the Department had not followed the governing reduction-in-force procedures. The Board, however, refused to "invalidate the entire reduction in force." It ruled:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where, as in this case, the ultimate question for resolution relates to the retention of substantially fewer employees than were necessary prior to the transfer, the agency's noncompliance with certain provisions of part 351 does not warrant unconditional reversal of the entire reduction in force since many of those employees would have been subjected to separation from the federal service in any event.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board remanded the case to determine "[t]he effects of this agency error as it relates to each [petitioner]." In these proceedings, each petitioner could present "evidence that tends to establish that he was denied retention to which he was otherwise entitled," and to "identify a position or positions for which he was qualified that have been assigned to other employees with less retention standing or positions occupied by employees who had no initial entitlement to transfer."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In challenging this ruling, the petitioners contend that "an illegal separation is null and void," that each employee therefore "must be treated for pay purposes as if the separation had not occurred, subject, of course, to any valid subsequent separation action," and that each is now entitled to reinstatement with backpay. Alternatively, they contend that reversal is required "because the government failed to create and maintain the records needed to calculate the hypothetical reduction in force."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that all of them are entitled to reinstatement with backpay, the petitioners rely primarily upon <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton,</span> 359 U.S. 535, 79 S. Ct. 968, 3 L. Ed.2d 1012 (1959). There the government had dismissed Vitarelli as a security risk. The Court set aside the dismissal as "illegal and of no effect," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 545, 79 S. Ct. at 975, because the proceedings by which it had been effected violated the governing regulations. It concluded: "It follows from what we have said that petitioner is entitled to the reinstatement which he seeks, subject, of course to any lawful exercise of the Secretary's authority hereafter to dismiss him from employment in the Department of the Interior." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 546, 79 S. Ct. at 976.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case is far removed from <span class="Italic">Vitarelli.</span> There only a single employee was involved, the Court held that he had been improperly discharged from his position, and it ordered him reinstated to the position he had occupied. The present case, in contrast, involved a reduction-in-force in which more than 900 employees sought reinstatement with a new agency that had only 165 positions to fill. There was no way in which the Office of Community Services could have hired all the former employees of the Community Services Administration. Only a relatively small percentage of the Community Services Administration employees were entitled to employment at the Office of Community Services. All or most of the employees so entitled, in fact, may have been hired. We decline to extend the principle applied in <span class="Italic">Vitarelli</span> (and in the other similar cases upon which the petitioners rely) to the wholly different factual situation here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In selecting the 165 employees to fill the positions at the Office of Community Services, the Department relied upon master lists establishing priority retention rankings for all the former Community Services Administration employees. <span class="Italic">Supra</span>, p. 981. Those lists did not satisfy the requirements of traditional reduction-in-force registers, since they did not show the competitive levels of each employee, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 351.403 (1984), and there were no separate retention registers for each competitive level, 5 C.F.R. Sec. 351.404 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, there may have been some former Community Services Administration employees who were not given jobs with the Office of Community Services to which they would have been entitled if the Community Services Administration had conducted a proper reduction-in-force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remand procedure that the Board adopted in this case was designed to enable individual employees who are in that situation to obtain the jobs they should have obtained. As noted, under the procedure, individual former Community Services Administration employees will be given the opportunity to show that there was a position in the new agency "assigned to [an] other [former Community Services Administration] employee[&#8197;] with less retention standing or...occupied by [an] employee[&#8197;] who had no initial entitlement to transfer." If an employee makes such a showing, the burden then will shift to the Department to refute that showing. If the Department cannot do so, the employee will be entitled to that position. Since it is conceded by all parties before us that all Community Services Administration employees were identified with functions that were transferred, the only issue on the remand will be the relative retention priorities of the employee claiming the particular position and the employee appointed to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In directing this procedure, the Board rejected the Department's contention that the retention rights of individual employees who had not been appointed to positions with the Office of Community Services could not be determined. It stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We specifically reject the agency's contention that it is impossible to determine identification of the employee because of inaccurate position descriptions. There is ample evidence available in the file concerning the organization and functional activities of CSA. In addition, we note that many of the positions within CSA were identical and located in the same organization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the petitioners challenge the factual basis for these findings, we conclude that they are supported by substantial evidence. Ms. Olivari, a department classification specialist, was the only witness who had reviewed the Community Services Administration records. She found that they were sufficient to make a "functional comparison" of the position descriptions to determine what functions of the Community Services Administration had been transferred to the Office of Community Services. Ms. Olivari also testified that the necessary information could be obtained through a procedure known as a "desk audit," and that one could "conduct a regular desk audit after an agency has been abolished."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioners contend, however, that because the government was at fault in not having proper reduction-in-force registers for the Community Services Administration employees, the Board was precluded from adopting the remedy it selected, on the ground that the government should not be permitted to profit from its own wrongdoing. There is no issue here about the government's "profiting" from the failure to maintain proper records. As we have held, only a relatively small number of Community Services Administration employees were entitled to employment at the Office of Community Services (165 out of 900).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board has devised an appropriate procedure to determine whether any of the employees of the former agency who were not employed at the latter agency should have been so employed because of their retention priorities. We also have upheld, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> p. 985, as supported by substantial evidence, the Board's finding that the retention priorities of Community Services Administration employees who were not transferred can now be determined. These conclusions answer and require rejection of the petitioners' argument based on the government's fault in not providing reduction-in-force registers for the Community Services Agency employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating the Department's and the Board's treatment of this case, it is essential to recognize that this was not a typical reduction-in-force situation. Normally, reductions-in-force result from a decrease in the agency's available funds, a change in the agency's workload, or a transfer to another agency of a portion of an agency's work. The present case, however, resulted from the elimination of an entire agency in connection with a significant change in the program that agency had administered, and the creation of a new agency to handle under a different program some of the work the old agency did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's handling of this case constituted a reasonable method of dealing with perhaps a unique and certainly most unusual situation. In our opinion, it was one that fairly and appropriately adjusted and accommodated the competing and substantially conflicting interests of the employees and the government.</p>
