<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-113"><span class="space">a.</span> Nonfrivolous Allegations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">To confer Board jurisdiction through allegations of discrimination based on marital status or partisan political reasons, an allegation must be "nonfrivolous." The allegation must, on initial examination by the AJ, appear to be made in good faith and supported by some evidence, although it need not succeed on the merits. An appeal based upon marital status discrimination must clearly raise that issue; there should at least be alleged some facts placing an AJ on notice that a claim of marital status discrimination is made or implied. <span class="Italic">Hurst v. GSA</span>, 2 MSPR 497, 500, 3 MSPB 21 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Stokes v. FAA</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("That burden is not met...upon the mere filing of allegations. Nor is it sustained by allegations shown to have been totally without foundation. To carry his burden of establishing jurisdiction, the probationary employee must profer sufficient evidence to enable the presiding official reasonably to conclude that the allegations are non-frivolous, i.e., a showing which, if not controverted, would indicate that marital discrimination was the basis for the agency's adverse action.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2015 the Board offered a regulatory definition of a nonfrivolous allegation, summarizing cases, 5 CFR 1201.4 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(s)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Nonfrivolous allegation</span>. A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue. An allegation generally will be considered nonfrivolous when, under oath or penalty of perjury, an individual makes an allegation that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is more than conclusory;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is plausible on its face; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Is material to the legal issues in the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Jurisdictional allegations of partisan political or marital discrimination are to be asserted when the appeal is filed; they cannot be raised belatedly through a PFR. <span class="Italic">Guipre v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 4 MSPR 13, 14-15, 4 MSPB 107 (1980); <span class="Italic">Shepard v. USDA</span>, 2 MSPR 528, 530, 3 MSPB 49 (1980) ("The appellant's attempt to invoke the Board's jurisdiction by adding an allegation that the action was taken due to his marital status, which was not raised to the presiding official, is insufficient."). If there is insufficient jurisdiction to permit review of marital status or political discrimination, there is no jurisdiction to consider other allegations of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Cassidy v. DLA</span>, 8 MSPR 264, 267, 7 MSPB 726 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional analysis in probationers' appeals was summarized, <span class="Italic">Doebele v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 46 MSPR 31, 33 n.* (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a probationary employee raises an allegation of discrimination based on marital status or on partisan political reasons, he must complete a two-step process to establish jurisdiction. First, the allegation must be supported by factual assertions indicating that the allegation is not <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>. If a nonfrivolous and supported allegation is made, the employee has a right to a jurisdictional hearing. Second, at the hearing the allegation must be supported with a showing of facts which would, if not controverted, require a finding that the alleged discrimination was the basis for the discharge<span class="Italic">. Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 686 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 38 MSPR 487, 490 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marrero-Maldonado v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 566, 568 n.* (1990) (restating the two-step jurisdictional analysis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stowell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-315H-13-0029-I-1 (NP 2/28/2014), provides jurisdictional analysis for a termination the appellant asserted was motivated by his superior's displeasure over the appellant's divorce:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether an appellant has established jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b), the Board follows a two-step process. <span class="Italic">Marynowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 321, &#x00B6; 5 (2012) (citations omitted). First, the appellant must make nonfrivolous claims of jurisdiction, i.e., factual allegations that, if proven, would establish that the agency based his termination on partisan political reasons or marital status. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. An appellant who makes such nonfrivolous claims is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing at which he must then prove the basis for jurisdiction, by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Because the appellant in this case waived his right to a hearing, and he does not claim on review that the administrative judge erred in deciding this matter without a hearing, the issue presented on review is whether the appellant established jurisdiction by proving his claim of marital status discrimination by a preponderance of evidence based on the written record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who alleges marital status discrimination has the same burden of proving a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case as an employee who alleges discrimination prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an adverse action case, which is subject to the burden-shifting scheme in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). <span class="Italic">See Gregory v. Department of the Army</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 40 (2010); <span class="Italic">McClintock v. Veterans Administration</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 475, 478 (1981). Here, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action, i.e., the appellant's purported unacceptable performance and conduct; therefore, the agency has done everything that would be required of it if the appellant had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case under the burden-shifting scheme in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">See Gregory</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 40. Accordingly, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving marital status discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The specific question to be resolved then is whether the appellant has produced sufficient evidence to show that the agency's proffered reason was not the actual reason for the removal and that the agency intentionally discriminated against him. <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 41 (citations omitted). The evidence to be considered at this stage may include: (1) the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) any evidence the employee presents to attack the employer's proffered explanations for its actions; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination or retaliation that may be available to the employee, such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer, or any contrary evidence that may be available to the employer, such as a strong track record in equal opportunity employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). While such evidence may include proof that the employer treated similarly situated employees differently, an appellant may also prevail by introducing evidence: (1) that the employer lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the employer's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of minority employees or those who engage in protected activities; (5) of incriminating statements by the employer. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant claims that he presented evidence showing that the agency terminated him based on his marital status, specifically because of his divorce, and restates the arguments he made on appeal below. The appellant claims that the Fire Chief had a tainted view of the appellant because of his divorce, that the Fire Chief's discriminatory opinion influenced the supervisory chain and the reasons stated by his supervisors for his termination were mere pretext.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, although the appellant made a <span id="Page_169"></span>nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction based on his claim of marital status discrimination, the appellant failed to meet his ultimate burden of proving that that his probationary termination was based on his marital status. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the appellant provided no evidence of similarly-situated employees that the agency did not terminate. He further found that the appellant failed to show that his direct supervisor did not honestly believe that the appellant: (1) was at fault in an accident on April 4, 2012, when he ran over the grill on his direct supervisor's truck; (2) damaged a trailer on May 4, 2012, and did not report it to his direct supervisor; and (3) was at fault for failing to inform his direct supervisor about a May 8, 2012 accident when the appellant backed one fire engine into another, although he was not required to file a written accident report. The administrative judge also found that the appellant provided no evidence of inconsistencies in the agency's explanation for his termination and no evidence of procedural irregularities, general maltreatment of employees based on their marital status, or incriminating statements by the Deputy Fire Chief, Deputy Chief Ranger, or Deputy Superintendent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the documentary evidence, which included excerpts from depositions in addition to declarations from the appellant's supervisors and other agency personnel sworn under the penalty of perjury, the administrative judge found that the appellant's first- and second-level supervisors were the impetus behind his termination and acted independently from the Fire Chief. The administrative judge also found that, even assuming that the Fire Chief had animus against divorced persons, the Fire Chief did not influence the appellant's supervisors in their decision to terminate him. The administrative judge further found, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that, when the appellant's supervisors initiated the termination process in or around May 2012, the Fire Chief favored continuing the appellant's employment.[5] The administrative judge's findings on these issues, and his determination that the appellant failed to satisfy his burden of proving his claim of marital status discrimination, are supported by the record and in accordance with the applicable law. <span class="Italic">See McClintock</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. at 478; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.806(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Contrary to the appellant's argument on review, the administrative judge was not required to analyze the appellant's claims under the "mixed-motive" theory of discrimination. Even if we were to decide that a mixed motive analysis is applicable to a probationary termination appeal, it would only be appropriate in cases where the Board finds the appellant has shown that marital status discrimination was a factor in his termination. In that event, the agency would be permitted to prove that it still would have removed the appellant in the absence of the marital status discrimination. Here, the appellant has failed to prove that marital status was a factor in the agency's termination decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the quantum of evidence necessary to invoke jurisdiction need not be sufficient to prevail on the merits, a wholly unspecific allegation of marital status or partisan political discrimination is frivolous. If the appellant provides no supporting evidence or argument, the Board need conduct no further inquiry into the merits of the case. The AJ is justified in dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Bates v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 327, 330, 6 MSPB 279 (1981). A bare allegation of partisan political or marital status discrimination does not confer jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3445) (argument that termination "could only be for partisan political reasons" because the agency presented no evidence of poor performance did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of facts sufficient to raise a reasonable inference of discrimination based on partisan political reasons); <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 480, 482 (1983) (insufficient to allege only that termination resulted from political party affiliation); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. IRS</span>, 15 MSPR 350, 352 (1983) (bare allegation of partisan political discrimination does not confer jurisdiction).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board explained its approach to nonfrivolous allegations in <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 388, 394-95 (1994), involving a probationer discharged for preemployment reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency terminates an employee entitled to the limited procedural rights under 5 CFR Part 315, for pre-employment reasons, the agency must provide the employee with the following: (1) Advanced notice of the reasons for the proposed action; (2) a reasonable time to answer the charges, including the right to submit affidavits (if the employee does answer the agency must consider the answer in reaching its decision); and (3) written notice of the agency's decision delivered to the employee at or before the time the decision will be made effective. The notice shall inform the employee of the reasons for the action and inform the employee of her right to appeal to the Board, including the time limitation for filing the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 315.805. In the case below, the appellant argued that she was not provided with reasonable time for filing a written answer and further argued that the agency did not notify her in writing of its decision at or before the time the action was effective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a probationary employee makes factual assertions under 5 CFR 315.805 that are facially non-frivolous, the employee has the right to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Stokes v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 761 F.2d 682, 685-86 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The appellant's allegations are non-frivolous if such allegations, if true, would establish that the termination was not effected in accordance with the procedures set forth at 5 CFR 315.805<span class="Italic">. See Munson v. Department of Justice</span>, 55 MSPR 246, 251 n.2 (1992), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Graham v. Department of Justice</span>, 50 MSPR 285, 288 (1991). Because the appellant's allegations (insufficient time to answer and an untimely served notice of decision), if deemed true would establish Board jurisdiction under 5 CFR 315.805, we find that she has made non-frivolous allegations that entitle her to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 685-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, however, the appellant has raised a claim of sex discrimination under 5 CFR 315.806(d). Whether she is also entitled to be heard on it, we find, depends on her ability to support her allegation of procedural impropriety. Specifically, we note that the court in <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> found that if the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, he must meet a second test: that is, "he must support his allegation with a showing of facts which would, if not controverted, require a finding that marital discrimination was the basis for the discharge"; or, as applied to this case, that the termination was effected under improper procedure. If such showing is made, then beyond this point the appeal could not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[w]hen the Board dismisses a probationary employee's appeal for failure to support the jurisdictional allegation..."lack of jurisdiction" is...an adequate description of the basis for that dismissal. When...the Board goes on to determine that the agency had articulated and supported [the propriety of its action] and the probationary employee had not shown [the rebuttal] to be mere pretext, that description of the basis for dismissal is, for a number of reasons, inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Stokes</span>, 761 F.2d at 687.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, as noted, <span class="Italic">Stokes</span> addresses an allegation under 5 CFR 315.806(b), we find that as applied to one under section 315.806(c), Board jurisdiction attaches to examine the additional claim of sex discrimination pursuant to section 315.806(d) only at [the] point the appellant makes her factual showing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wren v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 2 MSPB 174, 2 MSPR 1, 2 (1980) (the Board may not consider a claim of discrimination absent a finding of jurisdiction over the matter appealed), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
