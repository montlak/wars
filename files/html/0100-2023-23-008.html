<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-10"><span class="space">a.</span> Intent That Agreement Be Subject to MSPB Enforcement Authority</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A settlement will be entered into the record for purposes of enforcement only if both parties agree to do so. Without that agreement, the Board will not accept the agreement for enforcement, but the Board may still dismiss the appeal if the Board is informed that the case has been settled and one side states it does not want the agreement incorporated into the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aylward v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 40, 43 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (record revealed the parties agreed the Board would not retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement); <span class="Italic">McCarter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 114 MSPR 599, 604-05 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 181 (2010) (rule is the same for oral settlements: if they are enforceable by the Board, the record must reflect that the parties agreed to the inclusion of the settlement for purposes of enforcement); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Baker</span>, 75 MSPR 155, 156 (1997) (petitioner did not request in a motion to dismiss, and parties did not indicate a desire in the body of the settlement, that the Board accept the agreement into the record for purposes of enforcement; dismissal of the complaint was the only action the petitioner requested in the motion to dismiss); <span class="Italic">Mooney v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 377, 379 (1993) ("The agency stated that it did not want the agreement to be enforceable by the Board. The appellant asserted that it did not matter to him whether or not the agreement would be enforceable by the Board. Because the parties have not agreed that the settlement should be entered into the record for enforcement purposes, the appeal is dismissed as withdrawn and the settlement will not be entered into the record for enforcement by the Board."); <span class="Italic">Haas v. DOD</span>, 47 MSPR 499, 500-01 (1991) (when the AJ issued an initial decision accepting an agreement for purposes of enforcement, but the agreement said nothing concerning its inclusion in the record and the initial decision was issued before the agency could respond to the appellant's request that it be made a part of the record, the Board modified the initial decision to exclude the agreement from the record for purposes of enforcement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before an appeal is dismissed based on a settlement, "it must be clear whether the parties want the Board to enforce the settlement." <span class="Italic">Outterbridge v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 353, 354 (1991). To avoid the problem of submitting a settlement for purposes of enforcement and having the AJ dismiss the case without accepting the settlement for enforcement, the parties may explicitly state in the settlement that its effectiveness is conditioned on its acceptance by the Board into the record for purposes of enforcement and the appellant (or the agency) will then submit a motion to dismiss the appeal as settled with language conditioning the motion on acceptance of the agreement for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">James v. VA,</span> DA-0752-11-0225-I-1 (NP 10/21/2011), restated that the AJ must affirmatively determine whether the parties have settled on terms that are understood and whether the parties wish the settlement entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal without documenting for the record that the parties reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed whether or not it was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See McCarter v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 6 (2010); <span class="Italic">Linares-Rosado v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 12 (2009); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4749"></span>Here, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal pursuant to her receipt of a motion indicating that the parties had resolved their disputes. The parties' submission, however, does not state whether they indeed had entered into a settlement agreement and understood its terms, and the record is silent on these matters. Further, it appears from the record that the administrative judge concluded, based upon the parties' submission, that the settlement agreement would not be enforceable by the Board because neither party attached a copy of the agreement to the submission. This conclusion was improper, as the record does not indicate that the administrative judge specifically ascertained the parties' intention on the matter. <span class="Italic">See Jimenez v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 24, 26 (1996); <span class="Italic">Boucher v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 40, 44 (1995). Thus, remand is necessary. <span class="Italic">Jimenez</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 26-27.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Pencofski v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 73 MSPR 171, 173 (1997), the parties' agreement provided that the settlement would be transmitted to the Board for entry into the case file, but there was no mention of Board enforcement. Another provision of the agreement stated that the parties "waive any further procedural steps before the MSPB, except a decision dismissing the appeal." From that provision the Board concluded that the right to initiate enforcement proceedings was waived, although that was not the clear intent of the parties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the second sentence specifically provides that the parties contemplate no more procedures before the Board. A petition seeking enforcement of the settlement agreement would clearly constitute an additional procedure before the Board. Thus, by its terms, the settlement agreement reflects an intent by the parties not to have the Board retain authority to enforce the settlement agreement.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The settlement agreement has been placed in the Board's record in this appeal for the sole purpose of documenting settlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wood v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 420, 422 (1997) (when the parties submitted a settlement agreement stating that it was not to be entered into record for purposes of enforcement, the Board treated the submission as evidence that the settlement effected the appellant's withdrawal of the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If it appears that if an AJ's initial decision, dismissing an appeal as settled, incorrectly states that the agreement is accepted for purposes of enforcement, the Board will review the evidence available to it (e.g., the tape recording of a conference discussing the settlement) to determine if the parties intended the agreement to be made a part of the Board's record for later enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Aylward v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 40, 43 &#x00B6; 6 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stewart v. USPS</span>, 73 MSPR 104, 105-08 (1997), essentially established a rebuttable presumption that if the parties both request that an agreement be entered into the record, the request will be construed as a request that the Board accept the agreement for purposes of enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the processing of the appellant's indefinite suspension appeal, the parties entered into a settlement agreement under which the appellant agreed to withdraw his Board appeal. The agency sent a copy of the agreement to the administrative judge, who entered it into the case file.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After finding that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal, that a settlement agreement was reached, that the parties understood the agreement and entered into it voluntarily, and that its provisions were legal and enforceable under civil service law, the administrative judge issued a March 10, 1994 initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, however, that although the agreement was "jointly moved" into the record, the agreement did not provide that its terms were enforceable by the Board, and the parties did not inform him that the agreement should include such a provision. He therefore found that the Board "will not retain jurisdiction over this matter for purposes of enforcement." The initial decision became final on April 14, 1994, when neither party filed a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 20, 1995, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement of the agreement. The administrative judge ordered the appellant to show that the Board had jurisdiction over the petition. In his response, the appellant asserted that the Board could enforce the agreement because the Board had jurisdiction over the underlying action, the agreement was made a part of the record, and the agreement was approved by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, however, dismissed the petition, finding that the settlement agreement had been placed in the record for purposes of explaining the appellant's withdrawal, but neither the explicit terms of the agreement, nor any extraneous explanation of it, provided that the Board would retain jurisdiction over the appeal for purposes of enforcement. The administrative judge found that, because neither party objected to the ruling in the March 10, 1994 initial decision that the Board did not retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement, that ruling became final when the initial decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant alleges that the settlement agreement is enforceable because the requirements of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i) were met. The appellant effectively raised this issue below by arguing that the Board has enforcement jurisdiction if the agreement is legal, freely reached by the parties, and entered into the record. ([I]n response to the jurisdictional show cause order, the appellant asserted that "[t]here is...no question that the agreement was made a part of the record and was approved by the Board," the same criteria that are included in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1201.41(c)(2)(i) provides that "[i]f the parties offer the [settlement] agreement for inclusion in the record, and if the AJ approves the agreement, it will be made a part of the record, and the Board will retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement." This regulation is specific. If a settlement agreement is entered into the record by the parties, and the administrative judge approves the agreement, it will be enforced by the Board. Here, the settlement agreement was entered into the record by the parties, and the administrative judge approved it. Therefore, our regulations require that it be enforced by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent contends that the appellant is untimely challenging the merits initial decision. The Board, however, acquired enforcement jurisdiction over the settlement agreement when the administrative judge accepted the agreement into the record. The administrative judge's erroneous finding that the Board did not have enforcement jurisdiction did not deprive the Board of such jurisdiction. Thus, by asking the Board to enforce the agreement, the appellant is not challenging any jurisdictional findings in the merits initial decision; rather, he is simply asserting that the Board has had jurisdiction to enforce the agreement since the merits initial decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that, in <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 47 MSPR 331, 332 n.1 (1991), the Board stated that "[n]either the Board nor the administrative judge approves agreements; instead, agreements are accepted into the record if the criteria under" <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 MSPR 146, 148-49 (1988), <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 5 MSPR 248, 250 (1981), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">Shaw v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 586 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> are met. <span class="Italic">Littlejohn</span>, however, does not discuss the "approval" provision set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i), even though that regulation was in existence at the time of the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i) (1991).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although the dissent argues that the Board's case law has "overtaken" 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i), <span class="Italic">Littlejohn</span> merely held that enforcement jurisdiction is acquired by meeting certain criteria, and that there is no formal approval process for settlement agreements reached before the Board or the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Littlejohn</span>, 47 MSPR at 332. Neither <span class="Italic">Littlejohn</span> nor any other Board decision states that 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i) has been overruled. Indeed, the Board's relevant case law does not even cite to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that "approval" under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i) is the equivalent of a finding that the criteria for accepting a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement purposes under <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> have been met, and we modify <span class="Italic">Littlejohn</span> accordingly. Thus, if the parties offer a settlement agreement for inclusion in the record, and the administrative judge finds that the agreement is lawful on its face, that it has been freely entered into by the parties, and that the subject matter of the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see Shaw</span>, 39 MSPR at 594, "it will be made a part of the record, and the Board will retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2)(i). The Board's long-standing policy favoring settlement agreements supports finding enforcement jurisdiction under these circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Richardson</span>, 5 MSPR at 250.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the parties to this appeal jointly requested that the settlement agreement be entered into the record, under our regulation they were demonstrating their intent to have the Board retain jurisdiction for purposes of enforcement. The Board would not have the authority to enforce a settlement agreement entered into the record in accordance with <span class="Italic">Shaw</span> only if the parties specifically state that they do not want the Board to retain enforcement jurisdiction. Under our regulation, therefore, it is error for an administrative judge to infer that the parties do not want the Board to enforce a settlement agreement if the parties ask that it be entered into the record.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that it was also error for the administrative judge to dismiss this appeal as settled without documenting whether the parties had agreed that the settlement agreement would be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Mahoney</span>, 37 MSPR at 149.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, not only have the parties not provided any statement to the administrative judge which in any way implies that they did not want the agreement enforced, but they both have acted at all times consistent with a belief that the Board would retain enforcement authority. The appellant filed a compliance action. The agency responded with proof of compliance, not with an argument that the agreement was not enforceable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the controlling principle, as set forth in our regulation, is that if the parties enter an agreement into the record, and the agreement is approved by the administrative judge, it will be enforceable by the <span id="Page_4750"></span>Board unless the parties clearly specify that they do not want Board enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under law before <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, when it was unclear whether the parties agreed that a settlement would be entered into the record for enforcement, the Board could remand the case to the region for development of evidence of the parties' intent when the appellant asserted through a PFR that he believed the agreement would be accepted for purposes of enforcement.

<p class="Body-Text">The AJ must take affirmative steps to determine if the parties seek to have their settlement entered into the record for purposes of enforcement. However, if the parties reach a settlement, but they disagree on whether the agreement should be entered into the record for enforcement, the AJ may dismiss the case as settled without accepting the agreement into the record, <span class="Italic">Hester v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 149, 151-52 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal based on a settlement agreement without documenting for the record whether the parties reached a settlement agreement, whether they understand the agreement's terms, and whether they have agreed that the settlement agreement is to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Jimenez v. DHHS</span>, 70 MSPR 24, 26 (1996); <span class="Italic">Parks v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 56 MSPR 74, 76 (1992). Here, the administrative judge erred when she dismissed this appeal without documenting for the record whether the parties agreed that the settlement agreement is to be enforceable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Parks</span>, 56 MSPR at 77-78, the Board remanded the case to determine the parties' intention in this regard. In <span class="Italic">Parks</span>, however, the Board found that there was no evidence below as to the parties' intentions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 76. Here, although the agreement is silent in this regard, the record contains the administrative judge's note to the record, prepared after the initial decision, establishing that while the appellant wanted the agreement entered into the record, the agency had no such intention. When the parties have not agreed that the settlement is to be entered into the record for enforcement purposes, it will not be so entered. <span class="Italic">See Parks</span>, 56 MSPR at 77. Therefore, the administrative judge's error was harmless. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Before dismissing a matter as settled, the Board must decide whether the parties have entered into a settlement agreement, understand its terms, and intend to have the agreement entered into the record for enforcement by the Board. <span class="Italic">Bruce v. Social Security Administration</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 339, &#x00B6; 3 (2008); <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1988). The Board has repeatedly held that it is error for an administrative judge to dismiss an appeal based on a settlement agreement without documenting for the record whether the parties reached a settlement agreement, whether they understand the agreement's terms, and whether they have agreed that the settlement agreement is to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hester v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Gerdts</span>, the Board accepted evidence from the agency demonstrating that the appellant did not dispute the agency's refusal to enter the agreement into the record for purposes of Board enforcement, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 417-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-17:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in response to the appellant's sworn motion to waive the filing deadline and pursuant to the Clerk's show cause order on review, the agency submitted evidence, which was also submitted during compliance proceedings below, to rebut the appellant's assertions. Specifically, the agency has submitted copies of email correspondence during settlement negotiations with the appellant showing that, although an October 1, 2008 draft of the settlement agreement included a clause providing for Board enforceability of the agreement, the agency notified the appellant on October 2, 2008, that it had removed the draft Board enforceability clause from the agreement based on its understanding that the Board would not have jurisdiction to enforce the agreement. The agency's evidence shows that, although the appellant responded to the agency's October 2, 2008 email with other changes he wanted made to the settlement agreement, he did not dispute or address the agency's removal of the draft clause concerning Board enforceability of the settlement agreement. The agency asserts, therefore, that the appellant has not shown good cause for waiving the filing deadline because he cannot show that he first learned that the settlement agreement was not enforceable by the Board at the time the administrative judge issued the December 9, 2008 compliance initial decision dismissing his petition for enforcement for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the evidence submitted by the agency rebuts the appellant's sworn assertions that he first learned that the settlement agreement was not enforceable by the Board when the administrative judge issued the compliance initial decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Schaefer v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 592, 595 (1989) (the appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that his petition for review was filed in a timely manner where his affidavit on the timeliness issue was rebutted by the affidavit of the agency's representative). Therefore, although the settlement agreement is silent on the issue of enforceability, because the record shows that the appellant was aware during settlement negotiations that the settlement agreement would not be enforceable by the Board, his assertion that he first learned that the agreement is not enforceable by the Board when the administrative judge issued the compliance initial decision is without merit. Thus, because the filing delay is not minimal and the appellant's proffered reason for his untimely filing is contradicted by the evidence of record, we find that the appellant has not shown that good cause exists to waive the deadline for filing his petition for review of the initial decision that was untimely filed by twenty-one days. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 396, 398 (1996) (eighteen-day delay in filing a petition for review was not minimal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a dispute as to whether the parties were told that they could, if they desired, file their settlement, the Board looks to the representations of the parties. The Board, however, does not say how it resolves conflicting representations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. DLA</span>, 53 MSPR 269, 273 (1992) (noting that the appellant did not submit any "evidence" supporting his claim that he was not informed by the AJ about the possibility of entering the agreement into the record; the initial decision referenced that the appellant's withdrawal of his appeal was based "on the parties' '<span class="Italic">private</span> settlement agreement'"). Under law predating <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, the Board could make a finding that an agreement was to be entered into the record and subject to Board enforcement if the agreement suggested but did not explicitly state that the parties desired that result. The Board came to that conclusion in <span class="Italic">McGann v. DHUD</span>, 56 MSPR 17, 18-19 (1992), when it accepted a settlement after the parties filed a PFR and cross-PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties did not specifically state whether they intended that the agreement be enforceable by the Board. Based on the terms of the settlement agreement, a copy of which was submitted with the Dismissal, however, the Board infers that the parties intend that the agreement be enforceable by the Board. The settlement provides that, in the event of breach, the parties agree that the petition and cross-petition will be reinstated. That term can be effected only if the Board has enforcement authority. Thus, the Board hereby accepts the settlement agreement into the record and it is subject to the Board's authority to enforce compliance with its terms. 5 USCA 1204(a)(2). Accordingly, the petition for review and cross petition for review are DISMISSED with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Parks v. DOD</span>, 56 MSPR 74, 77 (1992), the settlement did not reflect whether the agreement was to be subject to Board enforcement, and the record did not reflect the parties' intent on including or excluding the agreement from the record. The case was remanded for the AJ to determine the parties' intent as to Board enforcement of the settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand to the St. Louis Regional Office, the administrative judge shall take additional argument and evidence from the parties to determine whether they desired the Board to enforce the settlement agreement. If the administrative judge finds that the parties agreed that the settlement agreement was not to be enforced by the Board, then the settlement agreement remains and the appeal is properly dismissed as withdrawn. Similarly, the settlement agreement will remain and the appeal will be dismissed if the administrative judge finds that the parties did not agree whether the settlement was to be entered into the record for enforcement purposes<span class="Italic">. See Sitas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 41 MSPR 214, 216 (1989). If the administrative judge determines that both parties desired the agreement to be subject to Board enforcement, then he must determine whether the Board has subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal before accepting the agreement into the record<span class="Italic">. See id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">MSPB will honor a settlement, and dismiss an appeal as settled, that calls for EEOC enforcement of the agreement. See</span> <span class="Italic">Kulkarni v.

As the words of the agreement itself are of paramount importance in determining the intent of the parties at the time they contracted, we find that the parties did not intend the settlement agreement to be entered into the record for enforcement by the Board but instead for the appellant to pursue enforcement through the alternate process specified in the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988)."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Fitzpatrick v.
