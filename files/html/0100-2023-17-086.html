<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-84"><span class="space">4.</span> Timely Filing</h4>
<p class="noindent">The time for filing exceptions is statutory. Under 5 USC 7122:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title). If upon review the Authority finds that the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding. An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award. The award may include the payment of backpay (as provided in section 5596 of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's regulations on timing of exceptions, revised in 2010 and 2012, 5 CFR 2425.2-.3 (2022), provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness requirements--general. </span>The time limit for filing an exception to an arbitration award is thirty (30) days after the date of service of the award. This thirty (30)-day time limit may not be extended or waived. In computing the thirty (30)-day period, the first day counted is the day after, not the day of, service of the arbitration award. Example: If an award is served on May 1, then May 2 is counted as day 1, and May 31 is day 30; an exception filed on May 31 would be timely, and an exception filed on June 1 would be untimely. In order to determine the date of service of the award, <span class="Italic">see </span>the rules set forth in subsection (c) of this section, and for additional rules regarding computing the filing date, <span class="Italic">see </span>5 CFR 2429.21 and 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods of service of arbitration award; determining date of service of arbitration award for purposes of calculating time limits for exceptions.</span> If the parties have reached an agreement as to what is an appropriate method(s) of service of the arbitration award, then that agreement--whether expressed in a collective bargaining agreement or otherwise--is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. If the parties have not reached such an agreement, then the arbitrator may use any commonly used method--including, but not limited to, electronic mail (hereinafter "e-mail"), facsimile transmission (hereinafter "fax"), regular mail, commercial delivery, or personal delivery--and the arbitrator's selected method is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. The following rules apply to determine the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions, and assume that the method(s) of service discussed are either consistent with the parties' agreement or chosen by the arbitrator absent such an agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;If the award is served by regular mail, then the date of service is the postmark date or, if there is no legible postmark, then the date of the award; for awards served by regular mail, the excepting party will receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions under 5 CFR 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;If the award is served by commercial delivery, then the date of service is the date on which the award was deposited with the commercial delivery service or, if that date is not indicated, then the date of the award; for awards served by commercial delivery, the excepting party will receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions under 5 CFR 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the award is served by e-mail or fax, then the date of service is the date of transmission, and the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;If the award is served by personal delivery, then the date of personal delivery is the date of service, and the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;If the award is served by more than one method, then the first method of service is controlling when determining the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions. However, if the award is served by e-mail, fax, or personal delivery on one day, and by mail or commercial delivery on the same day, the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions, even if the award was postmarked or deposited with the commercial delivery service before the e-mail or fax was transmitted.</p>

<p class="noindent">When the question was whether the packet of exceptions to FLRA was placed into a UPS dropbox on the last day allowed for filing, the agency failed to establish timely filing, even though preliminary steps were taken to prepare the United Parcel Service paperwork, when the agency failed to provide an affidavit from someone who actually knew when the packet was placed into the dropbox and UPS showed a collection date one day after the deadline. <span class="Italic">VA Northern Calif.

<p class="noindent">2010 regulatory revisions would change some of the decisional analysis that follows.</p>
<p class="noindent">Procedural requirements in the parties' contract, for example, calling for prenotification of the intent to file an exception to an award, do not provide a basis for dismissing exceptions if the contract requirement is not met, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Exec. Office for Immigration Review and AFGE Local 3525</span>, 65 FLRA 657, 657 n.2 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[2]&#x2003;In its opposition, the Union argues that the Agency's exceptions should be dismissed for failure to comply with Article 7.7 of the parties' agreement, which states: "Prior to filing for an exception to the [Authority], written notification must be provided to the other party." However, the Authority has held that a procedural requirement in a collective bargaining agreement does not provide a basis for dismissing exceptions that comply with the Authority's statutory and regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Army Aviation Sys. Command</span>, 22 FLRA 379, 379 n.* (1986) (<span class="Italic">AASC</span>) (Authority did not dismiss exceptions for failure to comply with contract provision requiring ten-day notice prior to filing exceptions). The Union attempts to distinguish <span class="Italic">AASC </span>on the basis that compliance with the ten-day notice requirement in that case would have deprived the excepting party of the entire thirty-day filing period, unlike the contractual provision here, which merely requires "prior" notice. However, the Authority's decision to consider the exceptions in <span class="Italic">AASC </span>was based upon the exceptions' compliance with Authority filing requirements, not the length of the contractual notice period at issue. <span class="Italic">See AASC</span>, 22 FLRA at 379 n.*. Thus, <span class="Italic">AASC </span>applies here, and, as the Agency's exceptions were timely filed in accordance with the requirements of &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute and the Authority's Regulations, we consider the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the award is first served by mail, and then by email, FLRA looks to the first method of service, allowing the five additional days. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 966, 967 (2005) ("When an award is served by two methods, the Authority's practice is to determine the timeliness of exceptions based on the earlier date of service of the award."). <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 916, 918 (2010), noted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that e-mail is a legitimate method of service of arbitration awards by arbitrators and that five days are not added to the filing period when the award is served by e-mail. <span class="Italic">E.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 64 FLRA 306, 306 (2009). However, when an award is served by two methods, the Authority determines the timeliness of exceptions based on the earlier date of service of the award. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 966, 967 (2005). Here, there is no dispute that the Arbitrator served the award by mail three days before he e-mailed a copy to the parties. Thus, under &#x00A7; 2429.22 of the Authority's Regulations, the Agency was entitled to an additional five days for filing, and its exceptions are timely. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">If the first mailing of the award by the arbitrator is unsuccessful, the timeliness of exceptions is measured from the later, successful mailing. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Northwestern Div. and UPTO</span>, 69 FLRA 226, 227 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-092.html#sec9-92">Award Served by Email</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Under regulations in effect before 2010, the time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award is 30 days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party. The date of service is the date the arbitration award is deposited in the U.S. mail or is delivered in person. Without contrary evidence, the date of the award is presumed to be the date of service of the award. If the award is served by mail, five days are added to the period for filing exceptions. The five-day allowance for service by mail does not extend the prescribed statutory period for filing documents; rather it is an allowance for mail service. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 46 FLRA 1297, 1301 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD, Washington and AFGE Local 476</span>, 48 FLRA 1360, 1361 (1994) ("The Arbitrator's award was served (postmarked) on the Agency October 26, 1993. Accordingly, the 30-day period for the Agency to file exceptions to the award began on October 26, 1993, and expired on November 24, 1993. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). Because the award was served by mail, 5 additional days were added to the due date. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.22. Therefore, any exception to the award had to be either postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service or received in person at the Authority no later than November 29, 1993, in order to be timely filed. The Agency's exceptions were dated and filed (personal delivery) with the Authority on November 30, 1993....&#8197;Adding the 5-day allowance to the "prescribed period" does not extend the prescribed period for filing documents but rather is an allowance for mail service."); <span class="Italic">IAM Lodge 2261 and Dept. of Army, Tooele Army Depot</span>, 47 FLRA 427, 433 (1993) (rejecting challenge to five-day rule). Certified mail is mail for purposes of FLRA calculations. Though delivery may be restricted, it is not the same as personal delivery. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Resale Activity, Guam and AFGE Local 1689</span>, 39 FLRA 1109, 1110 (1991). If exceptions are filed by Federal Express, they are not deemed postmarked because they are not deposited in the mail. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 43 FLRA 1359, 1361 (1992) (current regulations speak of date of deposit with commercial delivery service and record showing date of deposit with the service, 5 CFR 2429.21(b)(1)(iv) (2022)). Exceptions sent through government-franked mail (penalty labels) are considered to have been mailed, without a postmark, five days prior to receipt by the Authority. <span class="Italic">VA, Pershing Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2338</span>, 45 FLRA 791, 791-92 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Nogales and NTEU Chap. 116</span>, 47 FLRA 1391, 1392 (1993) ("Under Section 2429.21(b) of the Authority's Rules and Regulations, if no postmark is evident, a filing is presumed to have been mailed 5 days prior to receipt by the Authority."). If the award is served in parts, it seems that the time for exceptions starts to run upon the service of the final portion of the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2004 and DOD, DLA. Depot Susquehanna</span>, 59 FLRA 47, 47 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the service date for an award cannot be determined, the date of the award is the presumed service date, <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU</span>, 64 FLRA 1177, 1181 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(b) of the Statute provides, in pertinent part, that exceptions to an arbitrator's award must be filed "during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b). <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b) ("The time limit for filing an exception to an arbitration award is thirty (30) days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party."). Where the date of service is not in the record, the date of an arbitration award is presumed to be the date of service. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., U.S. Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., U.S. Border Patrol</span>, 63 FLRA 345, 346 (2009) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>). If the last day of the thirty-day period falls on a weekend or federal holiday, then the due date for the exceptions is the end of the next day that is not a weekend day or federal holiday. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.21(a). In addition, if the award was served on the excepting party by mail, then the time period is extended an additional five days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.22.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no evidence in the record of the service date of the award, other than the date of the award. Thus, the award is considered to have been served on August 24, 2007. <span class="Italic">DHS</span>, 63 FLRA at 346. Counting thirty days beginning on August 24, the due date for filing exceptions was September 22. As September 22 was a Saturday, the due date for filing then became Monday, September 24. In addition, as the award was served by mail, the time period is extended for five days, until Saturday, September 29, and then is further extended until Monday, October 1. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.22; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.21(a). <span class="Italic">See also U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Nat'l Distrib. Ctr., Bloomington, Ill.</span>, 64 FLRA 586, 591 (2010). As the Union's exceptions were filed on October 1, we find that those exceptions were timely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent">A variation on a theme involves the timing of exceptions to an interest arbitration award issued under 5 USC 7119(b)(2). Under <span class="Italic">DODDS, Alexandria and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 41 FLRA 982, 985-86 (1991), exceptions are due within 30 days beginning on the date the last decision was served on the parties and there was no other action necessary for the execution of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The elements of timely filing of exceptions were summarized, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Maxwell AFB and AFGE Local 997</span>, 51 FLRA 754, 756 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award is 30 days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party.&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). The date of service is the date the arbitration award is deposited in the U.S. mail or is delivered in person. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27(d). If the award is served by mail, 5 days are added to the period for filing exceptions to the award. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.22. All documents filed with the Authority must be filed in the Docket Room of the Authority's Case Control Office, 607 14th Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20424-0001. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.24(a).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is strict about the timely filing of exceptions. In the extraordinary case of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Billings Area Office and NFFE Local 478</span>, 38 FLRA 256, 257 (1990), the agency relied on some improper advice from an FLRA employee concerning the date for filing exceptions. Too bad:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The advice provided by the Authority's agent is inexcusable, and the Authority does not condone it. Although the circumstances of this case are regrettable, the time limit for filing an exception to an Arbitrator's award may not be extended or waived by the Authority....</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq. 92nd Bomb Wing, Fairchild AFB and NFFE Local 11</span>, 48 FLRA 783, 785 (1993), determined:</p>

<p class="noindent">Denying a petition for reconsideration, FLRA added in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and NFFE Local 478</span>, 39 FLRA 238, 240 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We are not empowered to take into account equitable considerations to waive the time limit for filing exceptions to arbitration awards.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, Washington and AFGE Local 12</span>, 46 FLRA 890, 892 (1992) ("the time limit for filing exceptions to arbitration awards may not be extended or waived by the Authority"); <span class="Italic">DOD, DLA, Defense Depot Memphis and AFGE Local 2501</span>, 44 FLRA 1602, 1603 (1992) (untimely exceptions: "even if an Authority agency furnished incorrect information, parties dealing with the Federal Government are still charged with knowledge of, and are bound by, statutes and lawfully promulgated regulations"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2437 and VAMC Dallas</span>, 53 FLRA 980, 982 (1997) (significance of issues presented in exceptions does not influence FLRA's disposition of a motion to reconsider exceptions dismissed for failure to correct deficient service; delay was not excused by unavailability of union's part-time counsel and failure of computer). Delay was not excused when the award was sent to a medical center of the agency rather than the agency counsel's office at another location. FLRA noted that "[c]ontrary to the Agency's assertion, nothing in the record establishes that the Arbitrator was informed during the arbitration hearing, or at any other time in advance of the issuance of the Arbitrator's award, that the Agency's copy of the award was to be served on it at a location other than the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center." <span class="Italic">VAMC, Bronx and AFGE Local 1168</span>, 45 FLRA 789, 790 (1992).
