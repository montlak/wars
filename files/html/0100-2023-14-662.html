<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-663"><span class="space">H.</span> NUMBER OF APPRAISAL LEVELS</h3>
<p class="noindent">A union seeking to avoid a change in pass/fail appraisal system could not negotiate the number of levels of performance ratings, <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 70 FLRA 701, 701-06 (2018) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20191203123">943 F.3d 486</a> (D.C. Cir. 2019), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed this negotiability appeal (petition) under &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute). The case concerns the negotiability of two proposals, which would limit the rating levels the Agency uses to evaluate employees' performance. The Agency filed a statement of position, to which the Union filed a response. The Agency did not file a reply to the Union's response.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The main question before us is whether the proposals impermissibly affect the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute or whether the proposals fall within an exception to those rights. For the reasons discussed in Section IV., below, we find that the first proposal affects those rights and does not fall within an exception under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. We also deny the Union's severance request. Finally, we dismiss the Union's petition as to the second proposal because the proposal is "inextricably intertwined" [3] with the nonnegotiable part of the first proposal.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-100</span>, 61 FLRA 480, 484 (2006) (<span class="Italic">Local R-100</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">IFPTE, Local 49</span>, 52 FLRA 813, 821 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Local 49</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Member Abbott notes that during his confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs to become a Member of the Authority on November 7, 2017, he pledged that one of his foremost objectives was to bring "clarity" to decisions which are issued by the Authority and to ensure that these decisions would be written in such a manner that they could be understood by the federal labor-management relations community. In keeping with that pledge, he concurs in the outcome of this decision but not with its overly lengthy, archaic, and legalistic analysis. The Authority's decisions do not help to avoid and resolve future disputes when they are difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Wording</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proposal 1</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There will be no performance appraisal rating levels above the [s]uccessful rating level for purposes of the annual appraisal process. Nothing in this proposal prevents the [Agency] from establishing performance levels between the [s]uccessful and [u]nacceptable rating levels. In the event that the Agency decides to establish such a performance level(s) it will notify and provide [the Union] the opportunity to bargain at the national level in accordance with law and the procedures contained in Article 26: Bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Proposal 2</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The performance rating levels set forth above do not bar or otherwise inhibit [the Agency's] right to define and set the number of critical elements, core competencies, or the number of performance goals that will be included in each performance plan. Similarly, the performance rating levels set forth above do not bar or otherwise inhibit [the Agency's] right to determine the performance standards that must be met for each performance goal and core competency in order for an employee to be appraised at the two performance levels set forth above. Finally, the limitation on the number of performance levels may not be interpreted to bar [the Agency] from assigning work or directing its employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Meaning</span>[17]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Generally, if the parties do not dispute the meaning of a proposal, and that meaning is consistent with the proposal's wording, then the Authority bases its negotiability determination on the proposal's undisputed meaning.[18] However, when the undisputed meaning of a proposal is inconsistent with the proposal's wording, the Authority construes the meaning based on the record as a whole.[19]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree about Proposal 1's fundamental purpose. In the parties' view, Proposal 1 would require the Agency to retain the Agency's existing pass/fail employee performance evaluation system consisting of two rating levels: "successful" and "unacceptable." The parties acknowledge, however, that the proposal also permits the Agency to add additional rating levels between "successful" and "unacceptable."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the record as a whole, we agree that substantively, Proposal 1--specifically its first sentence--would require the Agency to retain its pass/fail rating system. That the proposal allows the Agency to establish an indefinite number of degrees of "failure" between the "successful" and "unacceptable" rating levels does not change this. The proposal is still focused, essentially, on a performance evaluation system with only two basic outcomes--"pass" and "fail," and bars the Agency from establishing any performance levels above "pass."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to Proposal 2, although that proposal deals with some matters not mentioned in Proposal 1, the parties agree that "Proposal 2 has no independent meaning apart from Proposal 1." The parties also agree that "Proposal 2 means that the Agency would retain the right to define critical elements, competencies, goals, and performance standards for each goal and competency, for employees to be rated under [Proposal 1's] appraisal rating levels." We adopt this understanding of Proposal 2's meaning.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that Proposal 1 is nonnegotiable because it impermissibly affects the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. We agree.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Proposals restricting an agency's determination of the rating levels in a performance evaluation system affect an agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.[27] Determining a performance evaluation system's rating levels "directly affects the degree of precision with which management can establish and communicate job requirements (performance standards), the range of judgments which management can make regarding performance in the context of performance appraisals, and the range of rewards and sanctions which management can apply to such performance."[28] Consequently, "[t]he number of [rating] levels for both individual job elements and overall performance are essential aspects of the rights to assign work and direct employees."[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 restricts the Agency's determination of the rating levels in the Agency's performance-evaluation system to levels compatible with a pass/fail rating system. Specifically, the proposal bars the Agency from establishing any rating levels above "[s]uccessful." Thus, the proposal requires a performance evaluation system that is--substantively--limited to pass or fail rating levels. As such, the proposal affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union acknowledges the Authority's case law on this issue, but argues that the Authority should overrule its precedent and find that Proposal 1 does not affect management's rights to direct employees and assign work. In support, the Union cites the opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit's (D.C. Circuit) decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA </span>(<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>),[32] a case involving a proposal setting the level of incentive pay employees should receive as part of a trial incentive-pay program.[33] The Authority's decision held that the proposal affected management's rights to direct employees and assign work.[34] The court disagreed with the Authority and vacated the Authority's decision.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We find the Union's argument unpersuasive. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was restricted to incentive-pay matters,[36] and did not address the Authority's case law concerning the negotiability of proposals determining rating levels. Moreover, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> is distinguishable in other respects. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the court found that the right to set the level of incentive pay was not "implicit" in management's rights to direct employees and assign work.[37] Rather, the court found, setting the level of incentive pay--like the rights to direct employees and assign work--was simply a means "for getting the agency's work done," but was not part of either of those reserved management rights.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's case law concerning rating-level determinations is different. As the Authority has made clear, determining the number of rating levels is one of the ways in which an agency directs employees and assigns work.[39] It is thus an "essential aspect" of those rights.[40] It is not simply an alternative means "for getting the agency's work done,"[41] as in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>. Accordingly, we decline the Union's request that we overrule our precedent holding that proposals determining rating levels affect management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">i. <span class="Italic">Proposal 1 is an arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that even if Proposal 1 affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work, the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and is therefore negotiable.[42] The Agency does not dispute that Proposal 1 is an arrangement. Therefore, we find that this proposal is an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).[44]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[42]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., NAIL, Local 5</span>, 67 FLRA 85, 89 (2012) (<span class="Italic">NAIL</span>) (A proposal that affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute is negotiable if it constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).); <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31 (1986) (same).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">ii.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether an arrangement is appropriate, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the proposal's burden on the exercise of management's rights.[45] The Union asserts that "th[e] proposal would relieve Agency managers from having to make granular distinctions they are incapable of making." This would benefit employees by "retain[ing] objective appraisal ratings and [by] avoid[ing] the adverse impacts of invalid subjective ratings on...performance appraisals, awards, promotions, details, [temporary duty assignments] and [reductions in forces]." That is, "by retaining the two-level pass/fail appraisal system," performance appraisals would remain objective and would be "credible, believable, and accepted" by employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[45]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NAIL</span>, 67 FLRA at 87.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that by precluding the Agency from "determin[ing] the number of tiers within a performance evaluation system," "this proposal would have a negative effect on employee morale and would prevent the Agency from recognizing employees based on performance or creating a more structured format for reviewing employees and how they are or are not meeting expectations."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Considering first the benefits afforded to employees, the Union's claim that the proposal's pass/fail rating system would ensure that employees would receive "objective" ratings, rather than "invalid subjective ratings," is unsubstantiated. We make this finding cognizant of the Union's citation and extensive discussion of studies critical of the performance appraisal process. But as the Union cites and discusses them, the studies upon which the Union relies are critical of the performance appraisal process generally, and do not differentiate between pass/fail and multi-tiered performance appraisal systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast, the proposal's burden on the Agency's exercise of its management rights is clear. As discussed previously, the Authority has found that making a performance-appraisal system's rating level determinations enables an agency to control "the degree of precision with which management can establish and communicate job requirements (performance standards), the range of judgments which management can make regarding performance in the context of performance appraisals, and the range of rewards and sanctions which management can apply to such performance."[53] Based on the record in this case, we find that this burden on the Agency's exercise of its management rights outweighs the demonstrated benefits afforded to employees by the proposal's arrangement. Accordingly, based on the record, we find that Proposal 1 excessively interferes with management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFSCME</span>, 13 FLRA at 580-81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we find that Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), it impermissibly affects the pertinent management rights, and is therefore outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a proposal is outside the duty to bargain, and another proposal is "inextricably intertwined" with the former proposal, we will dismiss a petition as to the latter proposal.[60] Here, Proposal 2 is inextricably intertwined with Proposal 1.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local R1-100</span>, 61 FLRA at 484 (citing <span class="Italic">Local 49</span>, 52 FLRA at 821).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As set forth above, Proposal 2 provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">The performance rating levels set forth above do not bar or otherwise inhibit [the Agency's] right to define and set the number of critical elements, core competencies, or the number of performance goals that will be included in each performance plan. Similarly, the performance rating levels set forth above do not bar or otherwise inhibit [the Agency's] right to determine the performance standards that must be met for each performance goal and core competency in order for an employee to be appraised at the two performance levels set forth above. Finally, the limitation on the number of performance levels may not be interpreted to bar [the Agency] from assigning work or directing its employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties agree that "Proposal 2 has no independent meaning apart from Proposal 1." We also agree. Specifically, Proposal 2 assumes the existence of a performance-rating system limited to "the two performance levels set forth above" in Proposal 1, and explains the actions that Proposal 1 permits the Agency to take. Without Proposal 1, Proposal 2 refers to nothing, and would, as the parties agree, be meaningless. Moreover, the parties did not present independent arguments concerning the negotiability of Proposal 2. Rather, they relied on the arguments they made concerning the negotiability of Proposal 1. In these circumstances, we dismiss the petition as to Proposal 2 because it is "inextricably intertwined"[65] with Proposal 1, which we have found outside the Agency's duty to bargain.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Council 26</span>, 13 F.L.R.A. at 580-81). It is clear that the Authority's position in this case emanates from its decisions concerning the negotiability of proposals that interfere with an agency's ability to set performance standards or determine whether (and to what degree) those standards are being met. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Emps. Local R1-144</span>, 38 F.L.R.A. 456, 473 (1990) (emphasizing the connection between the rights to direct and assign and the ability to establish job requirements for "various levels of performance"); <span class="Italic">Am.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has defined the right to "direct employees" as the right to "supervise and guide them in the performance of their duties[.]" <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span> (<span class="Italic">Bureau of Public Debt</span>), 3 F.L.R.A. 768, 775 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU 1982</span>), 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982). The right to "assign work," on the other hand, includes the right to decide what responsibilities to assign, to whom to assign them, and on what schedule. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)-(B), at least in the negotiability decisions that bear most directly on this case, the Authority often fails to distinguish between the right to direct employees and the right to assign work. This may be because the FLRA sees little daylight between them. Or it may be because directing employees often involves the assignment of work, making it difficult to differentiate the rights in practice. <span class="Italic">See Int'l Plate Printers Union of N. Am., Local 2</span>, 25 F.L.R.A. 113, 119 (1987) (noting that "[t]he right to direct employees is...reflected in the supervisory function of assigning work to employees"). <span id="page_1111"></span>This court has also treated the rights to direct employees and assign work as generally "co-extensive." <span class="Italic">See Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 827 F.2d 814, 819 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("In general, the right to assign work and the right to direct employees, if not actually interchangeable, will be coextensive."); <span class="Italic">NTEU 1986</span>, 793 F.2d 371, 373 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the rights to direct employees and assign work may overlap in many instances, the rights are not coterminous. In the Authority's view, however, these statutory terms, taken together, generally give agencies the nonnegotiable right to supervise their employees and determine the quality, quantity, and timeliness of their work. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of Public Debt</span>, 3 F.L.R.A. 768, 775-76 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. NTEU 1982</span>, 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (discussing both together); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. 27, 56 (1991) (same). We have summarized the point by saying that the rights to direct employees and assign work amount to the "nonnegotiable right to determine what work will be done, and by whom and when." 691 F.2d at 562.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Over the years, FLRA precedent has established that the rights to direct employees and assign work include at least two critical features that are relevant in this case. First, the Authority has held that the Statute affords agencies a nonnegotiable right to establish performance standards. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Public Debt</span>, 3 F.L.R.A. 768 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. NTEU 1982</span>, 691 F.2d 553 (D.C. Cir. 1982). On this point, the FLRA has consistently found that performance standards allow agencies to effectively exercise their rights to supervise employees and determine what they must do. <span class="Italic">See NTEU 1982</span>, 691 F.2d at 562-63; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 555-56 (explaining why agencies must formulate "performance standards"). In the Authority's view, these standards play an important forwardlooking role that make them central to assigning and directing. That is, they enable management to effectively communicate to employees what a job requires and how it should be done--to "mark out beforehand the amount, quality and timeliness of the work employees are to perform." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 562.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has adopted this view about all performance standards, not just "minimum" performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 13 F.L.R.A. 325, 327-28 (1983) (holding that "[a]n agency is not limited to merely prescribing the minimum level of performance which will be required from an employee for job retention"). We declined to address this issue in <span class="Italic">NTEU 1986</span>, 793 F.2d 371, 375 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1986). Two years later, however, we stated without qualification that "the content of performance standards is nonnegotiable." <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (explaining that "[b]argaining over the content of performance standards would interfere with management's formulation of the quality, quantity, and timeliness criteria necessary to assign work and direct employees"); <span class="Italic">see also Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 47 F.3d 1217, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU 1982</span> for the rule that agencies have "the right to set substantive standards").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the FLRA has held that an agency's rights to direct employees and assign work include the right to determine whether (and to what degree) its employees are meeting those standards. Without the right to "review and evaluate employee performance of assigned duties," the Authority has said, the rights to direct employees and assign work would be "virtually meaningless." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 6 F.L.R.A. 522, 531 (1981). As a result, the Authority has held that "[t]he evaluation of employee performance is an exercise of management's rights to direct employees...and to assign work[.]" <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 1760</span>, 28 F.L.R.A. 160, 169 (1987). In the Authority's view, this "right to evaluate employee performance extends to the determination of the rating to be given[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's conclusions about the connection between the rights to direct and assign and the right to evaluate are eminently reasonable. For one thing, restrictions on an agency's ability to evaluate its employees are likely to restrict the performance standards that management can set. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 47 F.L.R.A. 705, 710 (1993) (restricting an employer's ability to enforce standards through employee evaluations can "effectively alter the content of th[ose] standards"); <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 872 F.2d 1032, 1034 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (restricting the use of certain evaluative criteria "would prevent the agency from establishing any performance standard which relied on such [criteria]"). For another, restrictions on an agency's ability to evaluate its employees can interfere with its deliberative process--interfere, that is, with an agency's ability to collect information, deliberate over its import, and put it to use via updated directions and assignments. <span class="Italic">NLRB Union</span>, 42 F.L.R.A. 1305, 1318-19 (1991) (noting that "proposals that limit management's deliberations concerning employee evaluations directly interfere with management's right to direct employees and assign work"), <span class="Italic">petition for review granted sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (denying enforcement of the Authority's order on separate grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these precedents in mind, we turn back to the Authority's conclusion that "[t]he number of performance levels for both individual job elements and overall performance are essential aspects of the rights to assign work and direct employees." <span class="Italic">AFSCME, Council 26</span>, 13 F.L.R.A. 578, 580 (1984). To support this view, the Authority has stressed the connections between an agency's ability to decide how many rating levels to use and "the degree of precision with which [it] can establish and communicate job requirements (performance standards)" and "the range of judgments which [it] can make regarding performance[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 580-81. In other words, the Authority has sensibly connected an agency's ability to control the number of rating levels it uses to the effective exercise of its rights to set performance standards and evaluate employee performance--two indisputable incidents of the rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Council of GSA Locals Council 236</span>, 55 F.L.R.A. 449, 452 (1999) (connecting the "number and designation of rating levels" to "how an agency evaluates the manner in which its employees perform the work to which they have been assigned," and connecting both evaluations and work assignments to the rights to direct employees and assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What the Authority's decisions recognize is that the rights to direct employees and assign work include dynamic aspects. In general, forward-looking decisions about work assignments and directions are based on backward-looking assessments. At the same time, management's appraisal system--if understood by employees--can help to clarify or reinforce its directions and assignments. To effectively exercise the rights to direct employees and assign work, then, Congress afforded agencies latitude under the Statute to evaluate their employees as they see fit consistent with the agencies' lawful objectives. The Authority has determined that this latitude involves the ability to decide how many rating levels to include in a performance appraisal system. We hold that this determination is based on permissible and reasonable interpretations of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union, which does not dispute that FLRA decisions are stacked against it, contends that the Authority's interpretation of the Statute is inconsistent with this court's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU 1986</span>, 793 F.2d 371, at least insofar as the FLRA means to say that proposals concerning "superior" ratings are nonnegotiable. In <span class="Italic">NTEU 1986</span>, we reversed an FLRA decision holding that the rights to direct employees and assign work include the right to determine the rate of incentive pay for superior work. The court reasoned as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Authority's reasoning--that level of incentive pay "directly relate[s] to the potential success of the incentive in motivating the performance of particular job tasks," and thus "to some extent determine[s] the priorities for accomplishing the agency's work," which is the very objective of the reserved management right to assign work--is an example of a familiar defect of statutory construction that might be called substituting the end for the means. It may well be that the rights to assign work and to reward superior performance of assigned work are both means to the objective of enabling the agency to determine its work priorities, just as the carrot and the stick are both means of getting a donkey to move. But the similarity of purpose does not establish that when Congress says carrot it means stick as well. It is for Congress, and not for the Authority or the courts, to determine what means it is willing to employ to achieve particular ends, and it usurps that prerogative to say that if Congress has rendered work assignment nonbargainable, then also nonbargainable is any activity that has the same effect as work assignment. If the latter principle were applied consistently, it is difficult to imagine any agency prescriptions regarding terms and conditions of work for particular classes of employees that would remain bargainable....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">793 F.2d at 374-75 (alterations in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 14 F.L.R.A. 463, 470 (1984), <span class="Italic">vacated sub nom. NTEU 1986</span>, 793 F.2d 371). The Union submits that the Authority's reasoning in this case suffers from this same defect. In the Union's view, "giving an employee a rating above successful," like awarding an employee incentive pay, is "simply another way of rewarding...superior work." And there is no nonnegotiable management right to reward superior work, the Union argues, even if such rewards help the Agency get its work done.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree.&#x2003;It is true, of course, that both incentive pay and superior ratings may indicate that an employee's work is above par. But the Union is mistaken in suggesting that a superior rating is simply another "reward" for superior performance. Rather, a superior rating is an evaluative judgment that enables management to more effectively exercise its nonnegotiable rights to (re)direct employees and (re)assign work. The fact that this evaluative judgment might also make an employee eligible for a negotiable reward is of no consequence. In addition, performance ratings and incentive pay are not necessarily two sides of the same coin. There may be situations in which an employee earns high incentive pay but receives less-than-favorable performance assessments due to work deficiencies having nothing to do with the incentive pay calculus.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's claim that the Authority's position in this case rests on the rationale that we rejected in <span class="Italic">NTEU 1986</span> misses the mark. The Authority's <span id="page_1112"></span>decision in this case rests on a permissible and reasonable interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A)-(B), which, as explained above, reasonably accepts the view that an agency's ability to decide how many rating levels to use is clearly tied to its rights to direct employees and assign work. Without the right to "review and evaluate employee performance of assigned duties," the rights to direct employees and assign work would be "virtually meaningless." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 6 F.L.R.A. 522, 531 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we have no grounds to reject the Authority's position that the number of rating levels in an employee appraisal system is inextricably tied to both the right to assign work and the right to direct employees. Both rights depend, for their effective exercise, on an agency's ability to measure and evaluate its employees against pre-established performance standards. Without this ability, an agency will be limited in making effective decisions about how (and to whom) to assign work or how to supervise and guide its employees. Because proposals restricting the number of performance ratings interfere with an agency's ability to measure and evaluate its employees, then, they interfere with an agency's nonnegotiable rights to assign work and direct employees. The Authority's position rests on a permissible and reasonable construction of the Statute and it is consistent with well-established precedent. Therefore, we find no merit in the petition for review.</p>
