<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-75"><span class="space">2.</span> MSPB Treatment of <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">At first it seemed the Board accepted <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>. The Board recognized the case stood for the proposition that evidence available to an agency prior to the hearing was irrelevant in determining whether counsel fees were warranted. The substantial innocence test referred to the outcome of the case. The Board accepted the principle that it is the characterization of the evidence in the initial decision on the merits of the appeal that controls adjudication of the subsequent counsel fee motion. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. VA</span>, 30 MSPR 97, 99 (1986); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 29 MSPR 584, 587 (1986) ("[i]n denying that motion she characterized the evidence and her findings in a manner somewhat more favorable to the agency than she had done in the original decision on the merits of the removal."); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 371, 372 n.1 (1985) ("it is the presiding official's characterization of the evidence made in the initial decision which became final on the merits of the appeal that controls upon review of this subsequent attorney fee request"). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Cason v. NASA</span>, 46 MSPR 401, 403-04 (1990) (allowing a rather limited exception when a factual issue, e.g., an allegation of discrimination, is legitimately raised during compliance proceedings).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was not significant that an agency witness proved to be not credible, resulting in agency surprise. <span class="Italic">Land v. FAA</span>, 26 MSPR 445, 446 (1985) (awarding fees when "the agency's entire case in support of its possession of marijuana charge was based on the testimony of one witness which the presiding official found not credible because the testimony was conflicting and inconsistent on essential points"); <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 26 MSPR 108, 112 (1985) ("The agency argues that it could not have known Mr. Thoihas would impeach his credibility at the hearing. The fact that the agency was surprised by Mr. Thomas's testimony, however, is irrelevant under this category's standard of substantial innocence, because the presiding official, who heard the testimony, found that the agency failed to corroborate its charges."). Nor was it significant that the agency established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of, for example, strike participation or absence without leave; again, <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> established that the significant factor was the result, not the evidence and information available prior to the hearing. <span class="Italic">Gustin v. FAA</span>, 28 MSPR 236, 238 (1985) (agency presented no evidence contradicting appellant's claim of coercion: "Because the Board thus found that the charges against the appellant were wholly unfounded and were fully countered by him, we hold that the appellant was substantially innocent of them[.] "). That an agency presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case did not preclude a conclusion that the appellant was substantially innocent. <span class="Italic">May v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 28 MSPR 357, 360 (1985). Fees were awarded to an employee substantially innocent of strike participation (coupled with an alternate determination that the agency should have known the removal would not be sustained). The employee called in sick, the normal procedure for requesting sick leave. The agency denied the leave, but did not tell the employee. Although the strike produced a complex and confusing situation for the agency, the employee nevertheless was innocent of the charge of striking and deserved fees. <span class="Italic">Wise v. TVA</span>, 24 MSPR 166, 169-70 (1984). <span class="Italic">Trachy v. Defense Communications Agency</span>, 24 MSPR 678, 681 (1984), followed <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, awarding fees to an appellant against whom the only evidence was a statement questionable on its face and contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4604"></span><span class="Italic">Weldon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 220, 222-23 (1985), embraced <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Allen v. United States Postal Service,</span> 2 MSPB 582, 2 MSPR 420 (1980), the Board set forth examples for determining whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Two categories delineated by the Board, and cited by the presiding official in this case, are: where the agency's action was clearly without merit, or was wholly unfounded, or the employee is substantially innocent of the charges brought by the agency; and where the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 593, 2 MSPR at 434-35. The presiding official did not discuss the differences between these two categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a case issued after the addendum decision, however, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit distinguished them. It found that the latter category requires an appraisal of the agency's decision to carry out the action against an employee, stating that if an agency never possessed trustworthy, admissible evidence, or if the agency was negligent in its conduct of the investigation, the agency knew or should have known not to take the action. Conversely, the former category refers to the result of the case at the Board, not the evidence and information available prior to the hearing. Therefore, the evidence accumulated prior to the hearing is irrelevant to whether attorney fees are warranted under this standard. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 746 F.2d 1454, 1457, 1458 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the presiding official erred in finding that attorney fees were not warranted under the substantially innocent standard (footnote omitted). The presiding official found that the agency failed to prove both charges against appellant, including both specifications under the second charge. Therefore, appellant met one criteria of the substantially innocent standard by prevailing on all the charges<span class="Italic">. Yorkshire, supra,</span> at 1457. Further, the presiding official, in essence, found the evidence and testimony offered by the agency woefully inadequate. He described various elements of it as "largely unsubstantiated," "quite incredible...," "implausible," "unlikely," and "quite contradictory." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id</span>. at 1455, 1455 n.3, 1457 n.6, 1458 n.8.[2] Therefore we find that the initial decision shows that appellant was substantially innocent of the charges brought against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;That the presiding official recharacterized this as a "close case" in the addendum decision is not determinative. The evaluation in the addendum decision is not a reconsideration of the evidence in a new light. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> 746 F.2d at 1458.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brunner v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-10-0274-A-1 (NP 1/14/2013), reaffirmed application of <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> with an outcome-determinative test, despite credibility resolutions central to disposition of the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "substantially innocent" criterion is based upon the result of the case before the Board, not upon the evidence and information available to the agency at the time it took the action. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Department of Transportation</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 138, 148 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). The substantially innocent standard warrants fees in the interest of justice where the employee prevails on substantially all of the charges and the Board or the administrative judge finds that the agency's unsustained charges were wholly unfounded because incredible or unspecific evidence was presented which was fully countered by the employee. <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 106, 110 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, the administrative judge's decision on the merits is the Board's final decision, it is not subject to recharacterization in the attorney fees proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). The findings from the initial decision on the merits when that decision became the final decision of the Board, not re-review of the full record developed below or the administrative judge's recharacterization of his findings in the attorney fee decision, control in determining whether an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. <span class="Italic">Gensburg v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 187, &#x00B6; 16 (1998). In the merits initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant prevailed on the only charge against him. Thus, whether the appellant prevailed is not an issue on petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency asserts, in the merits initial decision, the administrative judge did not analyze the appellant's and the charging witness's testimony pursuant to <span class="Italic">Hillen.</span> He found, "[o]n the evidence presented, it is certainly possible that the appellant committed the acts with which he was charged but, in light of the conflicting evidence and other factors which detract from [the complaining witness's] testimony, one cannot say that, more likely than not, he actually did." Although a credibility finding that is based on an analysis using the <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> factors is persuasive, the Board has not required that an administrative judge articulate the <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> factors as underpinning credibility findings. The Board has long recognized that a credibility finding may be implicit when based on observation of the demeanor of a witness testifying before the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so). By finding that conflicting evidence and other factors detracted from the complaining witness's testimony, the administrative judge, without making similar findings regarding the appellant, was implicitly finding that the complaining witness was not credible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's explicit finding in the attorney fee decision that the complaining witness was not credible does not constitute a recharacterization of his findings in the initial decision on the merits that would warrant a finding of error. Under the circumstances as here, where the only persons who were present at the time of the alleged misconduct were the appellant and the complaining witness, to find that the complaining witness was not credible is tantamount to a finding that the agency evidence of the charged misconduct was incredible and fully countered by the appellant. Thus, the administrative judge properly found that fees were warranted in the interest of justice because the appellant was substantially innocent of the charged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After initial acceptance of the decision, for some years the Board attempted to reduce the impact of the <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> analysis, perhaps to retreat to the earlier position that it is the motivation of the action that counts rather than the result achieved. The Board determined that under the "substantial innocence" standard of <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, even if all disciplinary action is reversed because the agency failed to prove its case by a preponderance of evidence or if the agency policy claimed to be violated is unclear, the AJ should <span id="Page_4605"></span>examine the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action. <span class="Italic">McMonagle v. BATF</span>, 26 MSPR 49, 51-52 (1985)<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Ketchem v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 26 MSPR 313, 314 (1985) ("The presiding official found that appellant was not substantially innocent because the agency had reasonable cause to conclude that appellant's absence on August 9 was because of his participation in the nation-wide strike. An award of attorney fees under the criterion of 'substantially innocent' of the charges is not punitive; it is an effort to minimize the burden that an unsubstantiated accusation places on an innocent employee.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another example of the Board's reluctance to follow <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> was <span class="Italic">Benavides v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 378, 378-79 n.* (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no merit to appellant's contention that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice. The presiding official's findings with respect to the merits of the charged misconduct reflect that the agency acted reasonably in bringing the charges based on the information then before it and that in failing to sustain the charged misconduct the presiding official merely found appellant's testimony more credible than that of the witnesses for the agency....&#8197;Thus, the agency's action which was reversed by the presiding official was neither wholly unfounded when taken nor was the agency's proof before the presiding official so woefully inadequate or incredible as to justify a finding that appellant met the substantially innocent criterion for awarding fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The dilution of <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> continued in <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 400, 402 (1985). Removal for AWOL was reversed because the agency abused its discretion by denying a request for leave without pay. As to a charge of excessive absence, the agency failed to show that the absence constituted a burden on the agency or its employees sufficient to justify removal, but fees were denied:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Board's finding that the agency abused its discretion in denying the request for leave without pay, we find that the charge of absence without leave is wholly unfounded. With respect to the charge of excessive absenteeism, however, we note that the record does include some credible evidence that the agency was justified in initiating action against the appellant. The record shows that the appellant had been absent for more than ten months before his accrued leave was exhausted, and that he had failed to respond to notices requesting information concerning his return to duty. Furthermore, although the Board found in this case that the agency had failed to show that the appellant's "excessive absenteeism" warranted his removal, it also noted that under some circumstances a charge of that nature may be a proper basis for removal....&#8197;We therefore find that the action at issue in this case, when both charges are considered, was neither clearly without merit nor wholly unfounded; and that the appellant is not "substantially innocent" of the charge against him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board occasionally acknowledged that substantial innocence is determined by output rather than input. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ledeaux v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 585, 587 (1986) (discussing whether appellant made false and defamatory statements about his supervisor). Yet at the end of 1987, the Board ruled in <span class="Italic">Truss v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 574, 579-80 (1987), involving the fee application of an employee whose removal for physical inability to perform his work was reversed as a result of favorable medical evidence introduced during the Board hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>,...we found that, in making a determination of whether an employee is substantially innocent, the administrative judge should examine the degree of fault on the employee's part and the existence of any reasonable basis for the agency's action. Further, the court held in <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>...that the substantially innocent criterion for awarding attorney fees is an effort to minimize the burden unsubstantiated accusations place upon innocent employees. Recently, in <span class="Italic">Kent v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 361, 365 (1987), we found that the legislative history of 5 USC 7701(g)(1), strongly suggests that the agency's action must be found blameworthy in some respect before fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge's findings in the initial decision clearly demonstrate that the agency proved the appellant could not perform the duties of his position when it initiated the action. Under these circumstances, the agency had a reasonable basis for its action. The agency's charge in this case was not an unsubstantiated allegation; the agency had over three years of medical documentation which indicated the appellant was unable to perform the duties of his position. Thus, the agency cannot be found to be blameworthy in any respect for the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances of this case, it is not appropriate to award fees under the substantially innocent criterion, looking no further than to the results obtained before the Board. To do so would equate prevailing with the interest of justice standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Goodman</span>, 33 MSPR 325, 330 (1987), recited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Goodman's arguments can be read as urging a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that the Board's failure to sustain an agency's charge or charges should automatically equate to a finding that the employee was substantially innocent, we cannot agree. As the agency correctly points out, the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Boese</span> [discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>] suggests that whether the employee prevailed on the merits of the action as opposed to "some technical defect" is an important consideration in determining whether the employee was "substantially innocent." Moreover, such a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule is contrary to the statutory language since it would equate the "prevailing party" requirement with the "interest of justice" requirement and render the latter "mere excess verbiage and a nullity." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 MSPR at 428.</p>
