<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-24"><span class="space">7.</span> Settlement Requiring Specific Action by Judge</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">When the parties offer a settlement agreement into the record for enforcement, the settlement may not require a specific order by the AJ other than acceptance of the settlement. Enforcement is at the option of the parties, but the settlement itself cannot be made self-enforcing to the point that the settlement compels the AJ to issue an order other than entry of the agreement into the record, as was pointed out in <span class="Italic">Yuan v. Dept. of State</span>, DC-4324-12-0523-I-1 (NP 1/13/2014), involving a settlement that called upon the AJ to enter an order directing a retroactive change in a promotion date--a condition that led to the settlement being set aside as based on a mistake by the parties as to the AJ's authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, the appellant, a Foreign Service Officer, alleged that the agency discriminated against him based on his uniformed service in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), and also violated his rights under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312(a), 4313(a)(2)(A), and 4314(a). During adjudication, on January 29, 2013, the agency representative notified the administrative judge that the parties had reached a settlement, and he submitted a copy of the signed agreement. It provided in pertinent part that, in consideration of the appellant's agreement to the dismissal of his appeal with prejudice, the agency would request from the administrative judge an order directing the agency to retroactively change the effective date of the appellant's promotion to the FS-03 grade level to October 25, 2009, in accordance with 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4006 and the terms of the agreement. The agreement contained numerous other terms that flowed from the retroactive promotion. The agency representative advised the administrative judge in a Notice of Settlement accompanying the agreement that the agency's authority to carry out the terms of the agreement was limited by 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4006, which requires a decision or order of the Merit Systems Protection Board to effect a Foreign Service promotion, and that, therefore, in accordance with the terms of the agreement, the parties were requesting that the administrative judge grant an order directing the agency to implement the terms of the settlement agreement. The agency representative attached for the administrative judge's signature a proposed order directing the agency to retroactively change the effective date of the appellant's promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a January 31, 2013 Order, the administrative judge acknowledged the parties' request, but explained that she could not grant an order directing the agency to implement the terms of the settlement agreement as such an order would be properly obtained through the Board's enforcement procedures, in the event either party believed there had not been full compliance with the settlement agreement. She indicated, however, that, if it would assist the agency with the "22 U.S.C. 4006 issue," she would include the following language in the initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties are required to comply with the terms of the January 29, 2013 Settlement Agreement, and if either part [sic] does not comply with those terms, the other party may file a "petition for enforcement" in accordance with the notice provision set forth at the end of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further advised that the initial decision dismissing the appeal would be issued shortly. She did not sign the proposed order provided by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following day, on February 1, 2013, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as settled. She first found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. She then stated that she had reviewed the settlement agreement and determined that it was lawful on its face, that the parties had entered into it freely and understood its terms, and that they intended to have the agreement entered into the record for enforcement by the Board. She then included as a final paragraph of her initial decision the language referenced above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge's refusal to issue the Order requested by the parties is inconsistent with law and an abuse of discretion, thwarts the intent of the parties, and goes against the Board's and public policy's stated interests in favoring settlement agreements. The appellant requests an opportunity to present oral argument on this issue before the Board so that he can provide additional evidence and argument regarding the public policy implications and potential chilling effect of the administrative judge's decision on future USERRA claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION OF ARGUMENTS ON REVIEW</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As part of the settlement agreement, the parties in this case sought to have the administrative judge grant the Order directing the agency to effect the appellant's retroactive promotion. The appellant argues that the administrative judge's authority to grant the Order stems from 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41. Specifically, the appellant refers to section 1201.41(a), which provides that the Board's administrative judges may exercise authority as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) on their own motion or on the motion of a party, as appropriate. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(a). Paragraph (b) provides that administrative judges have all powers necessary to issue decisions unless those powers are otherwise limited by law and sets forth a nonexhaustive list of 16 such powers. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b). The appellant argues that those nonexhaustive powers do not preclude the administrative judge from issuing the requested Order in this case and do not provide a basis for her refusal to do so. Paragraph (b) also refers to the authority of administrative judges to conduct fair and impartial hearings and issue timely and clear decisions based on statutes and legal precedents. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Paragraph (c) addresses settlement discussions and agreements. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c). It provides that, if the parties agree to settle their dispute, the settlement agreement is the final and binding resolution of the appeal, and the administrative judge will dismiss the appeal with prejudice, accepting the agreement into the record where the parties so offer and if the administrative judge otherwise approves it. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(c)(2). Contrary to the appellant's claim, the Board's regulations do not provide the administrative judge with the authority to do any more where the parties elect to forego adjudication in favor of settlement. In the absence of any finding of wrongdoing by the agency, there was no basis for the administrative judge to order the agency to take any action.[5] The Board's remedial authority order stems from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), giving the Board broad powers to require an agency to take any action necessary to effectuate a Board decision. The administrative judge's decision in this case dismissed the appeal as settled. Lacking the authority to take any further action, the administrative judge did not have the discretion to issue the Order and therefore cannot be said to have abused her discretion in declining to do so, despite the appellant's claim that issuance of the Order was necessary to effectuate the intent of the parties and the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The administrative judge could only order the agency to comply with the agreement and that would be done in the context of a petition for enforcement. However, as pertains to this matter, the agreement only required the agency to request the administrative judge to issue the Order directing the agency to effect the appellant's retroactive promotion, and both parties acknowledge that the agency did so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(3) provides support for his position that the administrative judge had the authority to issue the Order. That subsection provides that each initial decision will contain an order making final disposition of the case, including appropriate relief. As noted, the initial decision in this case did contain a final disposition, that is, dismissal of the appeal based on the parties having reached a settlement. No relief was provided as none was appropriate. The appellant asserts that the administrative judge should have issued the Order as part of the initial decision as necessary to ensure a fair and proper final disposition. However, the parties to the agreement, the appellant and the agency, could not obligate the administrative judge to take any further action, and she lacked the authority to do so because the parties elected to settle the appeal and thereby forego a decision on the merits of the appellant's claim.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Inasmuch as the administrative judge's declining to grant the Order was not based on a particular Board regulation, we need not address the appellant's argument that good cause exists for waiver of any such regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly points out that the Board has long noted the well-established public policy favoring settlement agreements that serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues. The appellant argues that the administrative judge's declining to issue the Order in this case goes against that policy. While we readily acknowledge that the Board favors the settlement of actions between an agency and its employees, <span class="Italic">McCarter v. Department of the Navy</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 6 (2010), the administrative judge must make certain findings before dismissing an appeal on that basis. In accepting the agreement into the record and before dismissing the appeal, the administrative judge was required to document for the record that the parties reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed whether it was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 148-49 (1988). The administrative judge found that the agreement in this case met those requirements. However, based on the parties' clear representations, we find that the administrative judge incorrectly determined that the parties understood the terms of the agreement. In fact, she knew that they believed that, without the Order they were requesting from her, the agency was precluded by statute from effecting the appellant's retroactive promotion and that they believed that she would, upon accepting the agreement, issue the Order. The administrative judge also knew that she was precluded from providing such an Order and that she would not do so. Under the circumstances, the administrative judge erred in accepting the agreement into the record because she knew that the parties labored under a significant misconception about a key term and if it could, and would, be effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4776"></span>Moreover, a settlement agreement may be invalid if it was based on a mutual mistake of material fact. E.g., <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 8 (2002). A material fact is "one in existence at the time of the agreement, one that involves a basic assumption of the [agreement], and one that materially affects...performance [of the agreement]." <span class="Italic">As'Salaam v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 417, 421 (1994). When a settlement agreement is based on a mutual mistake that goes to a basic assumption about a material fact in existence at the time of the agreement, it must be set aside by the Board. <span class="Italic">Farrero v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 9 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 232 F.3d 916 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the parties both mistakenly believed that the administrative judge could, and would, issue the Order. The language of the agreement itself is evidence that the administrative judge's issuance of the Order was a material fact affecting performance of the agreement as both parties understood that, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4006, the agency could not effect the appellant's retroactive promotion without such an Order. Moreover, numerous of the agreement's other provisions were dependent, for their effectuation, on the appellant's retroactive promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For these reasons, and despite the fact that the parties do not seek to set the agreement aside, the Board finds that it must set the agreement aside and return this appeal to the regional office for adjudication on the merits.</p>
