<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-245"><span class="space">b.</span> USERRA Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In an unusual procedural context, involving concession in court by the Board that its underlying decision was wrong, the Federal Circuit determined in <span class="Italic">Russell v. MSPB</span>, 324 Fed. Appx. 872, 872-75 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 18, 2008 NP No. 2008-3106) (distinguishing an adverse action case involving USERRA claims, <span class="Italic">Pittman v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://openjurist.org/486/f3d/1276/pittman-v-department-of-justice">486 F.3d 1276</a> (Fed. Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">post</span>), that USERRA reemployment claims cannot be divested from Board jurisdiction through a negotiated grievance procedure:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Russell, an officer in the Army reserves, was called up for active military duty while employed as a trial attorney with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) at the agency's Jackson, Mississippi office. Upon her return after nearly two years of active duty, the EEOC immediately transferred Russell to its Birmingham, Alabama office. Russell invoked a grievance procedure in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between her union and the agency to raise her claim that she was entitled to be reemployed with the agency's Jackson office. Her grievance was ultimately denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Russell then petitioned the board for relief, asserting that her transfer constituted a violation of USERRA and that she was entitled to reemployment under the statute. Her petition was initially denied by the Administrative Judge (AJ) on the merits, although the AJ raised the issue of whether Russell's grievance through the CBA was the exclusive remedy. The AJ cited as potentially applicable 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a), which governs CBA grievance mechanisms for federal employees and states in pertinent part that unless that statute otherwise provides, "the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Russell petitioned the full board for review of the AJ's decision. On <span id="Page_402"></span>review, the board held that it had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 14 (2006) (Russell I). The board primarily relied on the language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b), which provides that USERRA "supersedes any...contract, agreement,...or other matter that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter...." The board concluded, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that "the agency and the union's failure to exclude USERRA claims from the CBA's grievance procedure constitutes an impermissible attempt under section 4302(b) to limit individual USERRA rights by agreement."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Regarding the merits, the board remanded for the AJ to properly inform Russell of the appropriate burdens of proof in USERRA cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ again ruled against Russell on the merits and Russell subsequently petitioned the board for review. The board <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> concluded that this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 486 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2007) required that the board dismiss Russell's case for lack of jurisdiction. In <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> this court held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) requires the board to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction a USERRA adverse action appeal if the employee first elected to grieve the same or similar matter through a CBA grievance procedure mechanism. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1282. The board noted that Russell's case differed from Pittman because Russell's case involves section 7121(a) rather than an election of grievance remedies under section 7121(e). Nonetheless, the board held that <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> required dismissing Russell's petition without addressing the merits. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 171, 174 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Russell II</span>). Russell timely petitioned this court for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Russell seeks reversal of the board's determination that it lacked jurisdiction to decide her USERRA reemployment claim. Whether the board has jurisdiction is a question of law that we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 145 F.3d 1480, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1998). We note that, in the briefs filed by Russell, the board, the EEOC, and <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span>, it is unanimously argued that the board erred in determining that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has long provided reserve military personnel reemployment as a statutory protective right against potential disadvantages due to an extended absence while on active duty. <span class="Italic">See Nichols v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 (a)-(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision in <span class="Italic">Russell II,</span> the board felt compelled to dismiss Russell's case because of our decision in<span class="Italic"> Pittman.</span> The board now states that <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> does not control disposition of Russell's case. In the present case, the board's decision was based on the holding in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> that a party who elects to grieve an adverse action under section 7121(e)(1) cannot later file a USERRA action concerning a similar matter at the board. As the board now concedes, however, that holding must be confined to the specific statutory contours involved in that case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(e)(1), which governs grievances of adverse actions, provides that an employee's election to file a grievance waives that employee's right to seek relief from the board on that same matter or "similar matters arising under other personnel systems." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> 486 F.3d at 1282. As Russell argues in her brief unlike the petitioner in <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> she did not elect to grieve the reemployment issues <span class="Italic">per se</span>ction 7121(e)(1) because the collective bargaining agreement required that she do so. <span class="Italic">Compare Pittman,</span> 486 F.3d at 1278 ("The letter informed Pittman that he had a right to grieve his removal under the negotiated grievance procedure or to file an appeal to the Board, but that only one procedure could be elected.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board, in its brief, states that section 7121(e) applies in a USERRA case when the employee had the right to file a grievance or file an adverse action appeal and the employee elects to pursue grievance. Notably, in <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> this court did not dismiss for lack of jurisdiction Pittman's separate USERRA reemployment claim, the very claim now asserted by Russell. Instead, this court in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> addressed the reemployment claim on the merits, affirming the board's decision in that regard. <span class="Italic">See Pittman,</span> 486 F.3d at 1279-1280 (finding substantial evidence to support the AJ's decision denying Pittman's reemployment claim). We agree with the parties that Pittman's jurisdictional holding regarding a challenge to a removal action does not control this case, which instead concerns a challenge to an alleged denial of reemployment due to transfer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree that the board should not have departed from its initial conclusion in <span class="Italic">Russell I</span> that a CBA cannot require an employee to grieve a USERRA claim. In <span class="Italic">Russell I,</span> the board found that the plain language of section 4302(b) cannot establish an additional prerequisite to the exercise of USERRA rights. <span class="Italic">Russell I,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. at 19. The board explained that "the failure of the union and the agency to exclude USERRA claims from the coverage of the CBA, when considered in light of section 7121(a)'s exclusivity provision, amounts to an impermissible attempt to subordinate individual rights under USERRA to majoritarian collective bargaining processes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Russell I</span> persuasive. CBA grievance procedure mechanisms clearly fall within the meaning of a "contract, agreement...or other matter" that cannot "reduce, limit, or eliminate" a petitioner's right to bring a USERRA reemployment claim at the board. Thus, as required by the plain language of section 4302(b), Russell's statutory right to appeal the reemployment matter to the board is not affected by the CBA's requirement that she file a grievance because the CBA cannot impose a requirement that the employee grieve a USERRA matter. USERRA's legislative history also confirms this result. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 20 (1993), as reprinted in 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2453 ("Moreover, [section 4302(b)] would reaffirm that additional resort to mechanisms such as grievance procedures or arbitration or similar administrative appeals is not required.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weiberg v. MSPB</span>, 328 Fed. Appx. 619 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP), replicated the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the 2008 Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Russell v. EEOC</span>, 107 MSPR 171, 173-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5-7, 2007 MSPB 262 (2007), in turn reversing a 2006 determination in the same case, concluded that if the grievance procedure of a collective bargaining agreement embraces, and does not exclude, a USERRA claim, the matter must be pursued through the grievance process and not through an MSPB USERRA appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A full discussion of the background of this appeal may be found in <span class="Italic">Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 14 (2006). This case concerns the appellant's claim that the agency violated USERRA when it assigned her to a different duty station upon her return to her Attorney position after active duty with the U.S. Army. A question existed, however, regarding whether the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) constituted the exclusive remedy for resolving the appellant's claim, and whether the appeal was therefore beyond the Board's jurisdiction. 104 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 4, 9....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not decide the issues raised on review because we conclude that we lack jurisdiction over this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, the Board discussed the question of jurisdiction over a USERRA claim when an appellant is covered by a CBA. It first noted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 governs the labor-management relations portion of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 8. It then explained that both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that this section provides that, when an employee is covered by a CBA, matters that usually would be within the Board's jurisdiction are deemed covered by the negotiated grievance procedure and are beyond the Board's jurisdiction, unless the matter is excluded from the grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 9. It further noted that, with respect to certain prohibited personnel practices and matters also covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512, the employee may choose between filing a grievance or appealing to the Board, but not both. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board then concluded, however, that section 7121's exclusivity provision did not apply to USERRA, and that an employee may bring a USERRA appeal even if she was otherwise covered by a CBA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board issued this decision, the Federal Circuit decided <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Department of Justice,</span> 486 F.3d 1276 (Fed. Cir. 2007). There, the appellant first filed a grievance of his removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e), and then filed a Board appeal, claiming that his removal violated USERRA. 486 F.3d at 1278-79, 1281. The court held that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal as either a Chapter 75 adverse action or in the context of a USERRA discrimination claim because the appellant had previously elected to raise those issues in a grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1280-82.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> differs from the present case because it concerned <span id="Page_404"></span>an election under section 7121(e), the decision finds that claims of USERRA violations fall within the scope of section 7121. As explained above, that statute provides that the CBA is the exclusive procedure for resolving claims that fall within its coverage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a); <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9. Here, the CBA does not exclude from its coverage the appellant's grievance concerning her allegation that the agency violated USERRA when it assigned her to a different duty station upon her return to her Attorney position after active duty with the U.S. Army. Indeed, the appellant filed a grievance under the CBA raising this claim. <span class="Italic">Russell</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 3. Because we are bound by the decisions of the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Mills,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 463, 469 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 124 F.3d 228 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table), we conclude here that we lack jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA claim because the CBA constituted the exclusive means for pursuing the appellant's USERRA claim. We must therefore dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Russell</span> previously produced the opposite result. <span class="Italic">Russell v. EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20170509140">104 MSPR 14</a>, 17-21 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16, 2006 MSPB 319 (2006), explained the primacy of the Board's jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Board jurisdiction, we find that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) and its legislative history establish that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal notwithstanding the CBA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121, and the appellant's filing of a grievance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121 governs the labor-management relations portion of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). It provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d) [relating to claims of discrimination], (e) [relating to adverse actions for misconduct or poor performance], and (g) [relating to claims of whistleblower retaliation] of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that this statutory provision means that, when an employee is covered by a CBA, matters that usually would be within the Board's jurisdiction are deemed covered by the negotiated grievance procedure and are beyond the Board's jurisdiction, unless the matter is excluded from the grievance procedure, although limited exceptions to this rule exist with respect to certain prohibited personnel practices and matters also covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 and 7512. <span class="Italic">See Dunklebarger v.

With respect to these latter matters, the employee may choose between filing a grievance or appealing to the Board, but not both. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sixteen years after the passage of the CSRA, Congress enacted USERRA, which provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;This chapter [USERRA] <span class="Italic">supersedes any</span> State law (including any local law or ordinance), <span class="Italic">contract, agreement</span>, policy, plan, practice, <span class="Italic">or other matter</span> that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided by this chapter, including the establishment of any additional prerequisites to the exercise of any such right or the receipt of any such benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that section 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision falls under section 4302(b)'s prohibition against "any contract, agreement,...or other matter" limiting an appellant's right to bring a USERRA claim before the Board and that, in any event, the agency and the union's failure to exclude USERRA claims from the CBA's <span id="Page_405"></span>grievance procedure constitutes an impermissible attempt under section 4302(b) to limit individual USERRA rights by agreement. These conclusions are consistent with well-settled law that a CBA cannot limit an individual's substantive rights under a federal law mandating reemployment of veterans following military duty. <span class="Italic">See Fishgold v. Sullivan Drydock &#x0026; Repair Corp.</span>, 328 U.S. 275, 285 (1946).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the issue of whether the CBA here can limit the availability of procedures for seeking redress under USERRA is similar to the argument addressed in <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co.</span>, 415 U.S. 36, 51, 58 n.19 (1974). There, the Court held that a CBA cannot prospectively waive an employee's right to bring a civil action under Title VII because that title concerns an individual's right under federal law to be free from discriminatory practices. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court found that this individual right cannot be subordinated to majoritarian collective bargaining processes. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Title VII and veterans' reemployment laws are analogous regarding whether a CBA may limit "matters of remedy and procedure." <span class="Italic">Kidder v. Eastern Airlines, Inc.</span>, 469 F. Supp. 1060, 1064 n.3 (S.D. Fla. 1978); <span class="Italic">see also McKinney v. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co.</span>, 357 U.S. 265, 268-69 (1958) (an employee claiming a violation of his reemployment rights under the Universal Military Training and Service Act could bypass the grievance procedure provided for in a CBA and file suit directly in court; petitioner sues not merely as an employee under a CBA but as a veteran asserting special rights afforded in furtherance of a federal policy to protect those who have served in the armed forces).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA embodies these principles in stating that it "supersedes <span class="Italic">any...contract, agreement,...or other matter</span> that reduces, limits, or eliminates in any manner any right or benefit provided." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) (emphasis supplied). The right to file a Board appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324 is manifestly a right covered by section 4302(b). Thus, while the CBA between the appellant's union and the agency purports to make the grievance procedure the exclusive means for complaining about a decision affecting the terms and conditions of employment, USERRA preempts, or "supersedes," the CBA to permit the appellant to bring this appeal. Similarly, although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a) states that a negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive means for contesting subjects that fall within its coverage, USERRA supersedes section 7121. In effect, section 7121(a) is an "other matter" under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b) that cannot limit an individual's rights under USERRA. Alternatively, the failure of the union and the agency to exclude USERRA claims from the coverage of the CBA, when considered in light of section 7121(a)'s exclusivity provision, amounts to an impermissible attempt to subordinate individual rights under USERRA to majoritarian collective bargaining processes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that, while resorting to legislative history is unnecessary because 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 is clear on its face, legislative history, in fact, strongly supports our conclusion that the CBA cannot bar a Board USERRA appeal. House Report 103-65 states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 4302(b) would reaffirm a general preemption as to State and local laws and ordinances, as well as to employer practices and agreements, which provide fewer rights or otherwise limit rights provided under amended chapter 43 or put additional conditions on those rights. <span class="Italic">See Peel v. Florida Department of Transportation</span>, 600 F.2d 1070 (5th Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Cronin v. Police Dept. of City of New York</span>, 675 F. Supp. 847 (S.D. N.Y. 1987); and <span class="Italic">Fishgold, supra</span>, 328 U.S. at 285, which provide that no employer practice or agreement can reduce, limit or eliminate any right under chapter 43. Moreover, this section would reaffirm that additional resort to mechanisms such as grievance procedures or arbitration or similar administrative appeal is not required. <span class="Italic">See McKinney v. Missouri-K-T R. Co</span>., 357 U.S. 265, 270 (1958); <span class="Italic">Beckley v. Lipe-Rollway Corp.</span>, 448 F. Supp. 563, 567 (N.D.N.Y. 1978). It is the Committee's intent that, even if a person protected under the Act resorts to arbitration, any arbitration decision shall not be binding as a matter of law. <span class="Italic">See Kidder v. Eastern Airlines, In</span>c., 469 F. Supp. 1060, 1064-65 (S.D. Fla. 1978). The Committee wishes to stress that rights under chapter 43 belong to the claimant, and he or she may waive those rights, either explicitly or impliedly, through conduct. Because of the remedial purposes of chapter 43, any waiver must, however, be clear, convincing, specific, unequivocal, and not under duress. Moreover, only known rights which are already in existence may be waived. <span class="Italic">See Leonard v. United Airlines, Inc.</span>, 972 F.2d 155, 159 (7th Cir. 1992). An express waiver of future statutory rights, such as one that an employer might wish to require as a condition of employment, would be contrary to the public policy embodied in the Committee bill and would be void.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">H.R. No. 103-65, at 20 (1993), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2449, 2453.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that finding that a negotiated grievance procedure is the exclusive means for a federal employee covered by a CBA to raise a USERRA claim, assuming the matter is not excluded from the CBA's grievance procedure, implies that federal employees have lesser rights under USERRA than similarly situated state or private sector employees covered by a CBA. Such state or private sector employees could raise USERRA claims by filing a grievance, an action in court under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4323, or both, while a federal employee covered by a CBA would be limited to just filing a grievance because USERRA does not allow an individual who raises a USERRA claim against a federal executive agency to request judicial review of the claim until after the Board has issued a final order or decision regarding the matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(d)(1). Given the broad language of section 4302(b) and its legislative history, we find no reason to conclude that Congress intended the rights of federal employees seeking redress under USERRA to be inferior to the rights of state and private sector employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we hold that section 7121(a)(1)'s exclusivity provision falls under section 4302(b)'s "any...other matter" that cannot limit the appellant's right to bring a USERRA claim before the Board. In any event, we also find that, under section 7121's exclusivity provision, the failure of the agency and the union to exclude USERRA matters from the CBA's grievance procedure constitutes an impermissible attempt to limit individual USERRA rights by agreement, contrary to section 4302(b), and that the appellant's grievance filing was not a binding choice to forego a Board appeal under general election-of-remedies principles. <span class="Italic">See Kidder</span>, 469 F. Supp. at 1062-65. Moreover, the appellant's grievance filing did not constitute a valid election of remedies under section 7121. That section requires an election between the grievance procedure and a Board appeal when the employee claims discrimination under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1), was subjected to an adverse action based on performance or conduct, or claims retaliation for whistleblowing, and none of those circumstances are present here.[2] We also hold that any pre-USERRA decision, such as <span class="Italic">Morales v. Department of Defense</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 226 (1992),[3] suggesting that the right to file a reemployment appeal with the Board may be foreclosed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1), is no longer valid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We leave open, however, the question of section 4302(b)'s effect on Board jurisdiction where an appellant first elects to grieve an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e) and then later files an appeal with the Board claiming that the adverse action violated USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Morales</span> involved the interplay between section 7121(a)(1) and the Board's pre-USERRA regulatory jurisdiction over reemployment disputes.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 C.F.R. Part 353 (1993). USERRA, enacted in 1994, made the Board's jurisdiction over reemployment disputes statutory, and included the section 4302(b) CBA supersession provision that supplants pre-USERRA caselaw, such as Morales. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit restored the result in the Board's original decision in the court's 2008 determination. But on (further) remand, the Board concluded that the appellant's reemployment rights were not violated. <span class="Italic">Russell v. EEOC</span>, 110 MSPR 557, 2009 MSPB 26 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The procedural tangle involving USERRA and contract grievance procedures was described in <span class="Italic">Rivera v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding a hearing, the AJ issued an ID dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The AJ explained that in<span class="Italic"> Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 171, &#x00B6; 7 (2007) <span class="Italic">(Russell II),</span> the Board held that it lacks jurisdiction over USERRA cases in instances where an appellant has a right to pursue the matter under a negotiated procedure. Here, the AJ found, the appellant is covered under a CBA which includes a negotiated grievance procedure which does not exclude from consideration a grievance of the matter under appeal. The AJ concluded that, "[i]t therefore appears that the grievance procedure is the exclusive means of remedy for [the] appellant's claim."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant asserts that his USERRA claim is "covered under [the Board's] appeal process" and contends that this claim would be untimely under the negotiated grievance procedure of the CBA. The agency did not file a response to the PFR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 15, 2008, while the appellant's PFR was pending, the Board asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to vacate the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Russell II</span> and to remand the case to the Board for reconsideration and a new decision. <span class="Italic">Rivera v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 119, &#x00B6; 6 (2008).

Cir. 2007), required dismissal of the case for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Russell II,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 171, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8. In <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> the Federal Circuit held that the Board lacked jurisdiction over an appellant's claim that his removal violated USERRA where the appellant had previously elected to raise this claim under the negotiated grievance procedure. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 6. Noting that the Board is bound by the decisions of Federal Circuit, the Board found that, under <span class="Italic">Pittman,</span> the CBA constituted the exclusive means for pursuing the appellant's USERRA claim and the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction over her USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then sought judicial review of this decision to the Federal Circuit, asserting that the Board erred in finding that it lacked USERRA jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Russell,</span> No. 2008-3106. The court agreed, finding <span class="Italic">Pittman'</span>s jurisdictional holding, which involved a challenge to a removal action, did not control the present case, which concerned a challenge to an alleged denial of reemployment due to a transfer. The court also agreed that the Board should not have departed from its initial conclusion in <span class="Italic">Russell I</span> that a CBA cannot require an employee to grieve a USERRA claim, and that the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Russell I</span> was persuasive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court, therefore, remanded the case to the Board for consideration of the appellant's PFR.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the Board vacated its decision in <span class="Italic">Russell II</span> and adopted the jurisdictional reasoning and conclusion in <span class="Italic">Russell I. Russell v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission,</span> 2009 MSPB 26, &#x00B6; 1. Thus, <span class="Italic">Russell I</span> is good law and an employee may bring a USERRA appeal even if he is otherwise covered by a CBA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's USERRA appeal and remand is required to address the appellant's USERRA claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Pittman v. DOJ</span>, <a href="http://openjurist.org/486/f3d/1276/pittman-v-department-of-justice">486 F.3d 1276</a>, 1280-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (dismissed on remand, <span class="Italic">Pittman v. DOJ</span>, 107 MSPR 249, 2007 MSPB 251 (2007)), the employee was discharged because of misconduct that occurred during military service that the agency deemed to be of sufficient nexus and severity relative to his civilian position as to warrant his discharge from that position following his reemployment after the conclusion of his military service. The employee filed a grievance of the discharge and, after filing the grievance, appealed to MSPB under USERRA. The question for the court was whether the grievance over the discharge precluded the Board's jurisdiction over a USERRA appeal seeking to reverse the discharge because it discriminated against the employee because of his prior military service. The court concluded that the grievance constituted an election of remedies and that the subsequent USERRA appeal to the Board was barred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin by examining the Board's jurisdiction over Pittman's improper removal claims under sections 4311(a) and 4316(c). Section 7121 of Title 5 governs the grievance procedures for governmental employees that are members of a collective bargaining agreement. That section provides, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. <span class="Italic">Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems</span> applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e) (emphasis added). Here, because Pittman elected to grieve his removal--an action covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512--it is undisputed that his removal cannot be appealed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. The AJ, however, found jurisdiction over Pittman's USERRA claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b), a provision of the personnel system protecting veterans' benefits.[2] We therefore must consider whether the matter raised in Pittman's improper removal claims under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(a) and 4316(c) is similar to the matter raised in Pittman's grievance; if so, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal of those claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969 (1978) (discussing "matters similar to those listed above which may arise under other personnel systems, such as those provided in title 38, United States Code [relating to veterans' benefits] ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4311(a) prohibits discrimination on the basis of military service and states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A person who is a member of, applies to be a member of, performs, has performed, applies to perform, or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial <span id="Page_406"></span>employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment by an employer on the basis of that membership, application for membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). As we held in <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, section 4311(a) requires an employee making a claim under that provision to "bear the initial burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee's military service was 'a substantial or motivating factor' in the adverse employment action." 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing<span class="Italic"> NLRB v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp</span>., 462 U.S. 393, 400-01 (1983)). "If this requirement is met, the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Id.; see also</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(1) ("An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited under subsection (a)...unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of [military status]."). Therefore, the inquiry presented here under section 4311 is, at bottom, a question of cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4316(c) is a specific benefit for employees that are absent due to military service and provides that "[a] person who is reemployed by an employer under this chapter shall not be discharged from such employment, <span class="Italic">except for cause</span>" for periods of either a year or half of a year depending on the length of the employee's military service. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4316(c) (emphasis added). Much like section 4311, the benefit provided by section 4316(c) is subject to an employer's ability to show that valid cause exists for discharging the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pittman's election to grieve his removal under the applicable collective bargaining agreement challenged that he was "terminated without just cause for Off-Duty Misconduct and Conviction." The collective bargaining agreement provides that adverse actions may only be taken "for just and sufficient cause and to promote the efficiency of the service." As Pittman's election makes clear, the underlying agency action that Pittman raised under the negotiated grievance procedure--his termination--is the same underlying agency action that is challenged in Pittman's improper removal claims under sections 4311(a) and 4316(c). That is further demonstrated by the inquiries presented by Pittman's improper removal claims, which are similar to, and overlap with, the inquiry facing the arbitrator--whether Pittman's termination was for cause. We therefore conclude that Pittman's USERRA claims for improper removal under sections 4311(a) and 4316(c) are "similar matters which arise under other personnel systems" that he had previously elected to raise under the negotiated grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e). Because of that election, Pittman is precluded by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e) from bringing those claims before the Board under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b). Accordingly, the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider Pittman's improper removal claims, and the AJ's denial of those claims on the merits was in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Pittman's improper removal claims, we need not--and do not--address the question of whether an employee can be removed for cause under USERRA predicated on the employee's conduct during military service that results in an adjudication by a military tribunal but does not disqualify the employee from a separation under honorable conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ did not err in finding that the agency reemployed Pittman following the completion of his military service, we affirm the Board's denial of Pittman's "failure to reemploy" claim under USERRA. Because the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e) lacked jurisdiction over Pittman's improper removal claims, we vacate the Board's denial of Pittman's improper removal claims under USERRA and remand with instructions to dismiss those claims.</p>
