<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-209"><span class="space">r.</span> Union Animus</h5>
<p class="noindent">The standard for reviewing awards involving promotion claims intermixed with charges of union animus was stated in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHHS, Family Support Admin.</span>, 35 FLRA 501, 507-11 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA No. 15 (1990), the Authority discussed the analytical framework to be applied in determining whether an agency improperly discriminated against employees because of their union activities. The Authority stated that "[i]n all cases of alleged discrimination, whether 'pretext' or 'mixed motive,' the General Counsel must establish that (1) the employee against whom the alleged discriminatory action was taken was engaged in protected activity; and (2) such activity was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, slip op. at 6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, the Authority held that an agency may seek to rebut a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that it has improperly discriminated against an employee by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that there was a legitimate justification for its action and the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator correctly set forth and applied the Authority's analytical framework for determining whether the Agency's failure to promote the grievant was improper. The Arbitrator found that the grievant was engaged in protected activity...and that the...activity was a motivating factor in his not being properly considered and selected for the position.... On that basis, the Arbitrator ruled that the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the grievant was discriminated against because of his union activity. The Arbitrator heard testimony from the Agency in which the Agency attempted to rebut the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination by showing that it would not have selected the grievant in any event. However, the Arbitrator was not persuaded...and concluded that the Agency failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the grievant would not have been selected in the absence of protected activity. The Arbitrator found that the grievant's record of work experience demonstrated that he possessed "exactly those skills" listed in the vacancy announcement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2070"></span>Section 7106(a)(2)(C) provides that management has the right in filling positions to select from a group of properly ranked and certified candidates for promotion or from any other appropriate source. Management's right to make selections for promotion can be abridged by an award of an arbitrator only when that arbitrator finds a direct connection between improper agency action and the failure of a specific employee to be selected for promotion.... In order to require an agency to select a particular employee for a promotion, the arbitrator must reconstruct what the responsible selecting official would have done if the unwarranted agency action had not occurred and must find that the selecting official would have selected the grievant but for the unwarranted actions....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator failed to find a direct connection between an improper action by the Agency and the failure of the grievant to be promoted.&#x2003;We disagree and find that the Arbitrator did establish such a connection. The Arbitrator found that the Agency's actions amounted to failure to give the grievant "appropriate consideration" as required by the Federal Personnel Manual. He also considered the reasons given by the selecting official for not selecting the grievant and found that the selecting official erroneously considered the grievant to be unqualified for the position. The Arbitrator concluded "that the agency has not proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have found grievant unqualified for the vacant GS-1101-13 position absent his protected activity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Arbitrator reconstructed the promotion action to determine that the grievant would have been selected if he had been interviewed in a timely manner. For that reason, we conclude that the Arbitrator established a direct causal connection between the Agency's discrimination against the grievant and his nonselection. Therefore, the Arbitrator established the required condition for ordering the grievant's retroactive selection with backpay to the position....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We conclude that the Arbitrator's finding of such a causal connection between the improper Agency action and the grievant's failure to be promoted constitutes the required finding under the Back Pay Act that the grievant was the victim of an unwarranted or unjustified personnel action but for which he would not have suffered a loss or reduction in pay....</p>
<p class="noindent">The analytical framework for considering allegations of the taint of union animus in the selection process was reiterated, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 58 FLRA 390, 393 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union asserts that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute because the Agency discriminated against Marcinek based on protected activity in making the selection. When a grievance under &#x00A7; 7121 of the Statute involves an alleged unfair labor practice (ULP), the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that would be applied by an administrative law judge in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529, </span>57 FLRA 464, 465 (2001). In a grievance alleging a ULP by an agency, the Union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged unfair labor practice by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>As in other arbitration cases, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's findings of fact. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">In Letterkenny Army Depot, </span>35 FLRA 113, 117-23 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>), the Authority addressed the analytical framework to be applied in cases alleging a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute. Under this framework, if the required <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>showing is made, an agency may seek to establish the affirmative defense that there was a legitimate justification for its action and that the same action would have been taken even in the absence of protected activity. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny, </span>35 FLRA at 118.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's findings--that assuming the Union established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case, the Agency established a legitimate justification for its action--are consistent with the <span class="Italic">Letterkenny </span>requirements. Specifically, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency had established that Marcinek had worked primarily on cases other than complex income tax cases within the last year, and the Arbitrator rejected the Union's assertion that the Agency's reason for not selecting Marcinek was pretextual. In so doing, the Arbitrator determined that Marcinek and the selecting official had a generally positive relationship despite disagreements, that the selecting official did not take any action against Marcinek for uttering an anti-management epithet, and that one of the selectees was a union official.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union disputes the Arbitrator's finding, claiming that Marcinek and the selecting official had a contentious labor-management relationship. However, the evidence provided by the Union fails to establish that the Arbitrator erred in finding that a generally positive relationship existed. Although the Union cites examples of disagreements between Marcinek and the selecting official, the Arbitrator noted that some disagreements occurred. In addition, the Union does not dispute that no action was taken against Marcinek or that one of the selectees was a union official. The Union has therefore not established that the Arbitrator's evaluation of the evidence and his conclusion based thereon are improper. Thus, as we defer to an arbitrator's factual findings, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When contract provisions mirror, or are intended to be interpreted in the same manner as, the Statute, the Authority has applied statutory standards in assessing the application of those contract provisions.[60] And when a grievance involves an alleged ULP, the arbitrator must apply the same standards and burdens that an administrative law judge would apply in a ULP proceeding under &#x00A7; 7118 of the Statute.[61] In a grievance alleging a ULP by an agency, the union bears the burden of proving the elements of the alleged ULP by a preponderance of the evidence.[62]</p>

<p class="noindent">In<span class="Italic"> GPO and IBEW Local 121</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-080.html">62 FLRA 419</a>, 419-26 (2008), the grievant was a victim of both reprisal based on union activities and discrimination based on age when he was denied a promotion--granted by the arbitrator, sustained by FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the grievance at issue in this case, the grievant, a Union steward, applied, but was not selected, for an Electrician Leader position. After his non-selection, the grievant filed a grievance that was resolved by an arbitrator who ordered the Agency to rerun the selection. After the selection was rerun, the grievant again was not selected for the position. Subsequently, the grievant applied for a second Electrician Leader position, and despite being placed on the best qualified list, the grievant was not selected and the position was filled with another candidate, the selectee. The grievant filed another grievance, alleging that his non-selection for the second Electrician Leader position was based on his Union activities and his age. When the grievance was unresolved, it was submitted to arbitration, and the Arbitrator framed the issues as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the Agency violate the collective bargaining agreement or any law, rule, or regulation when it did not select the grievant...for the position of Electrician Leader? If so, what is the proper remedy for the violation?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Letterkenny Army Depot</span>, 35 FLRA 113 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>), the Arbitrator found that "the grievant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case of discrimination based on his protected union activities in violation of 5 U.S.C. [&#x00A7;] 7116(a)(2) and the parties' agreement." Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was an active Union steward who had filed "numerous grievances and [Equal Employment Opportunity] EEO complaints for unit employees over the years" and had even "successfully challenged certain actions taken by" the selecting official in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted two incidents in particular in support of her finding that the grievant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie </span>case. First, she found that, prior to the grievant's non-selection, the grievant had consistently received outstanding performance ratings. However, "around the time of the selection process at issue in this case[,]" the selecting official rated the grievant "fully successful on one critical element" of his performance appraisal. According to the Arbitrator, this rating was given "unfairly[,] in order to make [the grievant's] candidacy for promotion less viable and to retaliate for his protected challenges to supervisory authority." Second, the Arbitrator found that, after the selection was announced, the selecting official made a comment in the presence of the Union president, the grievant, and another Agency official, that the Union president was not selected for the position because of the "things he...had done" at the Agency. According to the Arbitrator, the other Agency official added that the Union president "should consider what he was doing...." The Arbitrator found that these comments referred to the Union president's union activities and that they were "equally applicable" to the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's asserted legitimate reasons for not selecting the grievant for the position and found them to be pretext for unlawful discrimination. Specifically, the Arbitrator rejected the selecting official's explanation that he selected the selectee because he possessed qualities such as "good feedback, good production, working well with others, getting things done on time, and giving progress reports on the status of work assignments." According to the Arbitrator, the selecting official conceded that there was no evidence that the grievant lacked any of these same qualities. The Arbitrator also found that the grievant had served as the acting Electrician Leader in the past without incident, as compared to the selectee, who was considered by employees to be "bossy and difficult" whenever he served as the acting Electrician Leader. The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's claim that it would not have selected the grievant in any event because he had a verbal warning on his record, explaining that the verbal warning was the "least serious" form of discipline that could be imposed and that it was of "temporary <span id="page_2071"></span>duration and minor importance." Additionally, the Arbitrator found that the selecting official "vastly overstated the importance of the incident that caused him to issue the verbal warning."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that the grievant possessed several qualities that made him a better candidate for the position than the selectee.&#x2003;According to the Arbitrator, the selecting official conceded that the Electrician Leader "would be required to perform...'troubleshooting' or repair work on the Agency's aging printing equipment...." The Arbitrator found that the grievant had performed this duty "well ever since he was hired by the Agency in 1983, whereas [the selectee] has had no troubleshooting experience on the Agency's printing equipment since he was hired in 2002." Acknowledging that "there is no selection prerequisite for an Electrician Leader to possess master electrician certificates," the Arbitrator found that it was undisputed that "the experience and demonstrated expertise necessary to obtain and retain such certificates is indicative of the best qualified candidate." The Arbitrator found that the grievant possessed many master electrician certificates and the selectee possessed none.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also found that the grievant was not selected for the position because of his age, in violation of the Age Discrimination In Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1). The Arbitrator found that the grievant established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of age discrimination because he was a member of a protected class (over 40 years old), applied and was qualified for a position, was not selected for the position despite his qualifications, and someone outside of the protected class was selected for the position. The Arbitrator rejected the Agency's asserted legitimate reasons for not selecting the grievant and found them to be pretext for unlawful discrimination. Again, the Arbitrator relied on the grievant's seniority and the fact that the grievant held several master electrician certificates. The Arbitrator also relied on the fact that the grievant had the ability to repair printing equipment, and the selectee did not, explaining that "one of the most critical skills an Electrician Leader...should possess is the ability to repair printing equipment...." The Arbitrator relied on testimony from the Assistant Maintenance Manager at the Washington Post, whom she qualified as an expert witness because he "was well-acquainted with the Agency's printing operations and had over 25 years of experience as a supervisory electrician[.] "The Arbitrator credited the witness' testimony, in which he "unequivocally concluded that [the grievant] was the better qualified" candidate, which the Arbitrator found "reinforce[d her] own independent conclusions." The Arbitrator also rejected the Agency's claims that the selectee "got along better with his co-workers" and that the grievant was not selected because of a verbal warning that was on his record.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Arbitrator, "other record evidence supports the inference that age played a significant role in the decision to promote the much younger man." In this regard, the Arbitrator credited testimony that, out of 12 Electrician Leader positions that have been filled at the Agency in the last 25 years, none were filled with a candidate that was older than 50 years of age, "and in the last five years the trend toward selecting younger candidates has accelerated." The Arbitrator also credited testimony that on several occasions, management officials "questioned [the grievant] about his retirement plans and his interest in accepting an Agency 'buyout.'"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having concluded that the Agency unlawfully discriminated against the grievant, the Arbitrator considered the Union's requested remedy of a retroactive promotion with backpay. In this regard, the Arbitrator noted that there were seven applicants for the position, one being the Union President, who did not file a grievance. The Arbitrator credited the Union President's testimony that he and the grievant were "about equally qualified for the promotion" and that "they both are better qualified than the selectee...." As such, the Arbitrator was "uncertain whether a retroactive promotion with back pay for the grievant...would satisfy the 'but for' test embodied in the Back Pay Act." Therefore, the Arbitrator issued an interim award sustaining the grievance and ordering the parties to attempt to resolve the remedial question and the issue of reasonable attorney fees within 30 days from the date of the award. The interim award further provided that if the parties' resolution attempt was unsuccessful, then the parties were ordered to submit briefs to the Arbitrator addressing the Union's requests for a retroactive promotion with back pay and attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties did not resolve the dispute, and they submitted briefs to the Arbitrator addressing the issues set forth in the interim award. In her final award, the Arbitrator stated that in her interim award, she "found that [the grievant] would have been selected for the vacant Electrician Leader position but for the Agency's unlawful discrimination based on his protected union activities and age." The Arbitrator then compared the grievant's qualifications to another applicant, employee L, whose application packet was submitted in evidence. Crediting the expert witness' testimony that the grievant's qualifications were "way beyond" employee L's qualifications, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant was more qualified than employee L.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Arbitrator, the Union President's "application was not included in the record and therefore no meaningful comparison [could] be made between his qualifications and those of" the grievant. As such, the expert witness was not asked to review the Union President's qualifications or compare them to those of the grievant's. However, the Union President testified at the hearing as to his qualifications. The Arbitrator found that the Union President had 30 years experience as an electrician, but that he had never served as a supervisor of electricians. The Arbitrator found that the Union President's candidacy "did not preclude [the grievant's] selection in the absence of unlawful discrimination" and that "the Agency should have selected [the grievant] for the Electrician Leader position...." In so concluding, the Arbitrator found that the circumstances here are similar to those in <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec. Admin., Woodlawn, Md.</span>, 54 FLRA 1570 (1998), where the Authority upheld an award of a retroactive promotion with backpay even though the record did not contain the relative qualifications of other candidates on the best qualified list.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Arbitrator awarded the grievant a retroactive promotion with backpay, finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified, unwarranted personnel action that resulted in a loss of pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1. The Award Does Not Violate Management's Right to Select Under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception alleges that an award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>). If it does, then the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Treasury, BEP, Wash., D.C.</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). <span class="Italic">See SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 184. Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the award reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had management not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an award requiring an agency to make a selection for appointment affects management's right to make selections under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(C). <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Labor, Wash., D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 511, 514 (2003) (citing<span class="Italic"> AFGE, Council 220, </span>54 FLRA 1227, 1235 (1998)<span class="Italic">; United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin., San Francisco Region</span>, 48 FLRA 293, 302 (1993)). As the award requires the Agency to promote the grievant, it affects management's right to make selections.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not expressly challenge the award under prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>framework and we, therefore, will not apply prong I. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Def., Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 54 FLRA 487, 491-92 (1998) (addressing only prong II where agency did not dispute prong I). The Agency makes two arguments that the award does not satisfy prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>framework. First, the Agency claims that the Arbitrator did not consider the concurring official's role in the selection process. Second, the Agency claims that the Arbitrator did not find that the grievant would have been selected out of all seven applicants for the position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's first argument fails because the Agency does not dispute the Arbitrator's finding that the selecting official was motivated by unlawful discrimination. As such, the selecting official's discriminatory motive is sufficient to warrant a conclusion that the grievant was unlawfully discriminated against, without the concurring official's motive. In this connection, discrimination based on protected activity can be established by showing that the employee's protected conduct was a motivating factor in the agency's treatment of the employee in connection with hiring, tenure, promotion, or other conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Letterkenny</span>, 35 FLRA at 118. In addition, the circumstances here are similar to circumstances arising in the private sector where anti-union animus on behalf of one management official has been imputed to the company, even though the management official who actually took the adverse action did not share that animus. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., JMC Transp., Inc. v. NLRB</span>, 776 F.2d 612, 619 (6th Cir. 1985) (imputing supervisor's anti-labor motivation to company where officers who actually made the firing decision did not share that animus); <span class="Italic">see also Boston Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. NLRB</span>, 692 F.2d 169, 171 (1st Cir. 1982) (granting enforcement of the NLRB's order even though the management official who ultimately fired the complainant was unaware of that employee's union activity). Applying the foregoing, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award finding that the Agency unlawfully discriminated against the grievant is deficient, such that an award of a retroactive promotion to the grievant would not be warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's second argument--that the Arbitrator ignored most of the <span id="page_2072"></span>applicants and did not find that the grievant would have been selected out of all seven applicants--also fails. In this regard, the record contains application packets for only three of the applicants. In addition to considering this evidence, the Arbitrator considered the Union President's testimony about his own qualifications for the position. The Arbitrator could not consider evidence concerning the other applicants, as such evidence was not submitted. Furthermore, consistent with Authority precedent, the fact that not all of the application packets were submitted in evidence does not preclude a finding that the grievant was entitled to the disputed position. In this connection, the Authority has found that an award ordering a retroactive promotion satisfied prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>framework where the arbitrator made detailed findings that the grievant was more qualified than the selectee and no evidence was submitted as to the other applicants' qualifications. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Woodlawn, Md.</span>, 54 FLRA at 1578. Here, the Arbitrator made detailed findings that the grievant was more qualified than the selectee and concluded, based on the record evidence, that the grievant would have been selected for the position but for the Agency's unlawful discrimination. The Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator erred in these findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also relies on <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>arguing that the award violates its right to make selections because the Arbitrator made her own determination as to the qualifications of the position. However, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span> is distinguishable from this case. In <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>the Authority found that the arbitrator changed the relative weights and values assigned to the agency's four selective factors, which were contained in the record. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA at 959.<span class="Italic"> </span>Here, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator changed any of the Agency's established factors or changed any weights or values to be given to those factors. In this connection, the Agency has not provided the Authority with the four selective factors that it claims were changed. Moreover, there is no indication in the award that the Arbitrator changed any weights or values to be given to the selective factors. Rather, the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not demonstrate that the grievant lacked any of the qualities that the selecting official claimed he considered in selecting the selectee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Against this backdrop, the Arbitrator assessed whether the grievant's non-selection was based on unlawful discrimination. In this context, she considered direct evidence of discrimination as well as the grievant's superior work experience and qualifications, which included qualities that were not necessarily included in the selective factors, such as the grievant's trouble shooting experience and master electrician licenses. In considering this evidence, the Arbitrator did not change or re-weigh the selective factors. Instead, the Arbitrator considered the record as a whole to determine that the Agency's stated reasons for the selection were, in fact, pretext for unlawful discrimination based on his age in violation of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1). It is well settled that consideration of the record as a whole when assessing discrimination claims is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU and NTEU, Chapter 48</span>, 54 FLRA 1197, 1206-07 (1998) (holding that "it is the record as a whole...that supports an ultimate finding of discrimination"). Moreover, an award finding a direct connection between unlawful discrimination and failure to select an employee for promotion does not impermissibly affect management's<span class="Italic"> </span>right to select employees. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA at 964 (citing <span class="Italic">Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., Chi. Region</span>, 45 FLRA 437, 443 (1992) (award did not violate management's right to select where arbitrator found direct connection between grievant's failure to be selected for promotion and agency's reprisal against grievant for protected EEO activities)). Unlike the Arbitrator in this case, the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>expressly found "no evidence of discrimination[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>As such, <span class="Italic">AFGE </span>provides no basis on which to find the award deficient. Based on the foregoing, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2. The Award Does Not Violate The Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that an award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1218-19 (1998). The Agency's sole argument that the award of a retroactive promotion and attorney fees violates the Back Pay Act is that the Arbitrator erred in finding that the grievant would have been selected for the position. However, as already explained, the Arbitrator expressly found that the grievant would have been selected for the position but for the Agency's unlawful discrimination, and the Agency has not shown that this conclusion is contrary to law. As such, the Arbitrator properly awarded the grievant a retroactive promotion, which entitles him to backpay if he lost pay as a result of the Agency's unjustified personnel action. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Helena Dist., </span>37 FLRA 1410 (1990) (denying exception to an award of a retroactive promotion with backpay where the arbitrator found that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and that in the absence of discrimination, the grievant would have been awarded the position). The Agency does not dispute the award of attorney fees on the merits and, thus, provides no basis for the Authority to review the award further in this regard. Consequently, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3. The Award Is Not Contrary To Law Because The Arbitrator Found An Inference Of Discrimination Based On The Grievant's Qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found an inference of age discrimination based, in part, on a comparison of the grievant's and the selectee's qualifications. Relying on <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Ashcroft</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>the Agency argues that the Arbitrator erred in drawing an "inference" of unlawful discrimination based "[i]n large part" on the grievant's "superior" qualifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Ashcroft</span>, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld the District Court's finding that the appellant failed to rebut the agency's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the appellant's non-selection: because the selectee was more qualified than the appellant. As relevant here, the appellant argued that the agency's stated reason for not selecting him was a pretext for unlawful discrimination and attempted to establish this by comparing his qualifications to the selectee's qualifications. However, the court found that the appellant did not establish that he was "discernibly better" qualified than the selectee and established only "fine distinctions" between the employees' qualifications, which was insufficient to warrant an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Ashcroft</span>, 352 F.3d at 429-30. The court explained that it would not reexamine an agency's promotion decision where the selection was based on "`assessing the significance of small differences in the qualifications' and making 'a judgment call[,]'" particularly "when there is no other evidence that [the employee's protected class] played a part in the decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The case here is distinguishable from the <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Ashcroft</span> case in two ways. First, the Arbitrator found more than "fine distinctions" in the employees' qualifications. Specifically, the Arbitrator found, consistent with the selecting official's concession, that there was no record that the grievant lacked any of the qualities that the selectee possessed. She also found that the grievant possessed additional relevant qualities that the selectee did not possess. In particular, the Arbitrator noted that the grievant had "significantly more experience as an electrician with the Agency--almost a quarter century-as compared with two [years] for the individual selected." The Arbitrator also found that the grievant had over 20 years of troubleshooting experience, a duty the selecting official admitted would be required in the position, while the selectee had none. Finally, the Arbitrator found that the grievant possessed master electrician certificates, which although not required, indicated his superior qualifications, as compared to the selectee, who had no master electrician certificates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, unlike <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Ashcroft</span>, where the court found "no other evidence" that the appellant's protected class "played a part in the decision[,]" the Arbitrator found that "other record evidence supports the inference that age played a significant role in the decision to promote the much younger man. In this regard, the Arbitrator considered evidence that none of the 12 Electrician Leader positions that have been filled in the last 25 years were filled with an individual over 50 years of age, adding that the Agency's trend toward selecting younger candidates has accelerated within the last 5 years. In addition, the Arbitrator found that Agency officials questioned the grievant about his retirement plans and interest in accepting a buyout, which she found was an indication of their desire "in having the retirement-eligible [grievant] just go away." The Agency does not dispute the Arbitrator's findings in this regard, which support her conclusion of unlawful age discrimination. Consequently, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Pembina Dist. and NTEU Chap. 157</span>, 41 FLRA 1420 (1991), the grievant, a union official, was selected for promotion to a distant station but not selected for promotion at his home station. The grievant declined the promotion coupled with reassignment. An arbitrator found that the promotion coupled with a geographical reassignment was based on union animus. The remedy directed was promotion, with back pay, at the home station. FLRA sustained the award: the agency action was unjustified, that it violated provisions of the contract, and retroactive promotion was an appropriate remedy. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-166.html#sec8-166">Denial of Promotion</a>," for related ULP cases.]</p>
