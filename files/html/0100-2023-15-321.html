<p class="Body-Text">The Board analyzes a disability discrimination (including failure to accommodate) defense to a charge that an employee fails to meet medical or physical standards for a job, <span class="Italic">Cousin v. DHS,</span> DC-0752-13-0261-I-2 (NP 7/24/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that he was not required to identify any comparator employees because the agency's action was explicitly based on his perceived disability. We agree. <span class="Italic">See generally Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island</span>, 544 F.3d 1201, 1209 (11th Cir. 2008) (noting three distinct theories of disability discrimination: disparate treatment, disparate impact, and failure to reasonably accommodate). A disparate treatment claim may be supported not only by evidence of comparator employees but by other evidence as well, including discriminatory statements by the employer. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Interior</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 205, &#x00B6; 26 (2014). In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant's disability, real or perceived, was the underlying reason for his removal. <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 54, 79 (1997) (the agency's charge of inability to work due to depression constituted direct evidence of disability discrimination). Having been presented with this evidence, the administrative judge should not have denied the appellant's disability discrimination claim solely for lack of comparator evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency in this case did not advance an independent, nondiscriminatory reason for the removal, the only remaining question is whether the agency's admittedly discriminatory act was prohibited or permissible, i.e., whether the appellant was a "qualified" individual with a disability under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).[9] <span class="Italic">See Ellshoff,</span> 76 M.S.P.R. at 79. The appellant is qualified if he can perform the essential functions of the Customs and Border Protection Officer position, or a position to which he might be reassigned, with or without reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Coates v. Department of the Navy,</span> 74 M.S.P.R. 362, 368 (1997); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). For the reasons set forth above, we find that the appellant's psychological condition rendered him unable to perform the essential functions of the Customs and Boarder Protection Officer position without accommodation. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-16. Nor has the appellant articulated any accommodation that would allow him to perform in that position, given our finding that he does, in fact, suffer from a disqualifying condition. As explained above, the parties engaged in the interactive process, and the agency located two positions to which it could have reassigned the appellant, but he declined the offer of reassignment. <span class="Italic">Supra</span> &#x00B6; 4 &#x0026; n.3. Because the appellant has not shown that he was a qualified individual with a disability, he has not proven his disability discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">See Henson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Regardless of whether the appellant is actually disabled (as claimed by the agency) or merely perceived as such (as claimed by the appellant), he meets the definition of an individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g)(1)(i), (iii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-30 (2022), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, clarified accommodative requirements as to individuals with medical standards who are removed for present inability to perform under those standards. <span class="Italic">Haas</span> reviewed the removal of a border patrol officer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge denied all of the appellant's affirmative defenses. The appellant's petition for review focuses on whether the agency could have provided him with a reasonable accommodation and whether the agency retaliated against him for engaging in protected EEO activity. Accordingly, we focus on these affirmative defenses. We also examine the administrative judge's analysis of the appellant's affirmative defense of disparate treatment disability discrimination. We affirm her findings as to all three of these affirmative defenses, as modified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board adjudicates claims of disability discrimination raised in connection with an otherwise appealable action under the substantive standards of section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act.[7] <span class="Italic">Pridgen v. Office of Management &#x0026; Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 35. The Rehabilitation Act has incorporated the standards of the ADA, as amended by the ADAAA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Therefore, we apply those standards here to determine if there has been a Rehabilitation Act violation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In particular, the ADA provides that it is illegal for an employer to "discriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of disability." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(a). A qualified individual with a disability is one who can "perform the essential functions of the...position that such individual holds or desires" with or without reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). An employer is also required to provide reasonable accommodations to an otherwise qualified individual with a disability. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5). Thus, both a claim of disability discrimination based on an individual's status as disabled and a claim based on an agency's failure to reasonably accommodate that disability require that the individual be "qualified." <span class="Italic">See Flaherty v. Entergy Nuclear Operations, Inc</span>., 946 F.3d 41, 49, 53-56 (1st Cir. 2019) (explaining that a terminated employee could not succeed on his status-based and failure to accommodate disability discrimination claims when he could not prove he was otherwise qualified for his position); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. City of Union City, Georgia</span>, 934 F.3d 1169, 1172-73, 1179, 1182-83, 1190-91 (11th Cir. 2019) (remanding a terminated employee's disability discrimination claim for the district court to permit a jury to decide whether the appellant was a qualified individual); <span class="Italic">Scheidler v. Indiana</span>, 914 F.3d 535, 541 (7th Cir. 2019) (reflecting that disability discrimination claims under both disparate treatment and failure to accommodate theories require proof that the plaintiff was qualified); <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Rite Aid Corporation</span>, 851 F.3d 224, 226-31 (2d Cir. 2017) (affirming a district court's dismissal of a discharged employee's reasonable accommodation claim because he was not a qualified individual with a disability); <span class="Italic">McNab v. Department of the Army</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 661, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 n.5, 9 (2014) (recognizing that only a qualified individual with a disability is entitled to relief for his claims of status-based disability discrimination and denial of reasonable accommodation, but denying his claim on other grounds); <span class="Italic">Clemens</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 10-11, 17 (reversing an administrative judge's finding that an agency denied reasonable accommodation, concluding, as relevant here, that the appellant was not a qualified individual); <span class="Italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 34 (concluding that an appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability and therefore did not prove her claim that the agency wrongfully denied her reasonable accommodation); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 9-11 (2006) (finding that an administrative judge properly rejected an appellant's status-based disability discrimination claim because he was not qualified); <span class="Italic">Pickens v. Social Security Administration</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 525, &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (stating that an appellant alleging status-based disability discrimination must establish that she is a qualified individual with a disability); <span class="Italic">Verla G. v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120160990, 2018 WL 1061888, at *1-2 (Feb. 8, 2018) (providing that an employee alleging disparate treatment disability discrimination must prove, in pertinent part, that she is a qualified individual with a disability); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.4(a)(1), 1630.9(a)-(b) (reflecting, with exceptions not applicable here, that "[i]t is unlawful" to discriminate against, or deny reasonable accommodation to, a "qualified" individual with a disability).[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Because we affirm the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to show that any prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the agency's action, we need not resolve the issue of whether the appellant proved that discrimination or retaliation was a "but-for" cause of the agency's decisions. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen v. Office of Management &#x0026; Budget</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22, 29-33.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The Board generally defers to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. <span class="Italic">Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 40.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the past, the Board has, on occasion, omitted from its discussion of an appellant's burden to prove disability discrimination the requirement that he prove he is a qualified individual. <span class="Italic">E.g., Thome v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2015) (omitting the qualified individual requirement from the discussion of disability discrimination); <span class="Italic">Burton v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16 (2009) (omitting the qualified individual requirement from the analysis of a status-based disability discrimination claim); <span class="Italic">Doe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 493, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2004) (omitting the qualified individual requirement from the discussion of a status-based disability discrimination claim), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Marcell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 33, &#x00B6; 7. To the extent this has caused confusion, we take this opportunity to clarify that only an otherwise qualified individual with a disability is entitled to relief under the ADA for a claim of status-based discrimination or denial of reasonable accommodation.[9]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;Some disability discrimination claims can be resolved without <span id="Page_2865"></span>reaching the issue of whether an appellant is otherwise qualified. For example, in <span class="Italic">Thome</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 315, &#x00B6; 25, the Board determined that the appellant did not prove her disability discrimination claim because she did not prove she was disabled. The Board did not address whether the appellant was qualified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because an appellant must prove both that she is disabled and qualified, the fact she did not prove she was disabled was determinative, and a finding on whether she was qualified was not necessary. Similarly, the issue of whether an individual is qualified may not be in dispute in every case. <span class="Italic">See Pridgen</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6; 38 n.11 (declining to address whether an appellant was a qualified individual with a disability because the parties did not dispute that she was).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability. Regarding reasonable accommodation, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant could not perform his position's core duties. We also agree that performing these duties was an essential function of his position. While the appellant suggests that his performance history supports a finding that he is qualified, we disagree. Our conclusion is based on the nature of bipolar disorder, his work-related incidents between 2008 and 2015, the appellant's own representations of his condition, and medical opinions offered by both the agency and the appellant. Finally, the appellant has not identified an alternative position that he desires. <span class="Italic">See Rosario-Fabregas v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 18 (2015) (indicating that an appellant failed to engage in the interactive process when, as relevant here, he did not identify any vacant, funded position to which the agency might have reassigned him), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.3d 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Instead, the appellant rejected the agency's offers of reassignment. For the foregoing reasons, he cannot prevail on his claim of disability discrimination based on either a reasonable accommodation or disparate treatment theory.</p>

GSA,</span> SF-0752-13-0050-B-2 (NP 5/3/2016) ("In providing reasonable accommodation, an agency is not required to modify or eliminate duties that are an essential function of a position. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 10 (2013).

However, for the limited purposes of proving the charge, the agency is not required to show that it was unable to reasonably accommodate the appellant by assigning her to a vacant position for which she was qualified; whether it could do so goes to the affirmative defense of disability discrimination and/or the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Id."</span>); <span class="Italic">Scott v.

The agency, moreover, also considered reassigning the appellant to another position of employment as a form of reasonable accommodation, which she declined. The Board has found that an appellant cannot establish a disability-based denial of reasonable accommodation when she declines an agency's reasonable accommodation offer, and it has further found that an appellant does not have the right to the accommodation of her choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v.
