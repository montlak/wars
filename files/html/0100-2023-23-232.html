<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-218a"><span class="space">19.</span> Damages Unavailable for Breach of Clause Requiring Affirmative Reference, Other Violations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Damages are not awarded by MSPB to remedy breaches of settlements. <span class="Italic">Hambrick v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-14-0454-C-2 (NP 1/6/2017) ("[t]he Board has no authority to award damages for the breach of a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 3 (2006)."). Damages aside, assuming a choice is made to enforce an agreement, the Board has not always provided to the appellant the full benefit of his bargain, although in recent years the Board has been more critical of agencies that defy settlements calling for affirmative references. The Board fell short of enforcing a settlement in <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 385, 391-92 (1989), involving an agreement that employment reference checks be routed through one individual at the employing agency who would provide a favorable reference. When a private sector employer made an inquiry, the inquiry was answered by an unauthorized individual who provided a negative reference. The employee was told he was not hired because of the reference. When the agency learned of the error, it attempted to rectify the situation by giving the prospective employer a good reference and explaining that information previously provided should be disregarded. The agency alleged that the employer agreed to disregard the unfavorable information. The Board denied the appellant's resulting wage claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The events in this case suggest that the appellant actually got less than he bargained for in the settlement agreement, in that the appellant's prospective employer failed to receive a positive recommendation from the agency. We must, then, conclude that the agency did not strictly adhere to its part of the agreement, and that it breached the agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has no authority to grant the appellant wages he would have received had he been offered a new job. Nor may the Board award the appellant the "just restitution" he has requested. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kopp v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 434, 437 (1988) (the Board lacks the authority to reimburse consequential expenses incurred as a result of an improper personnel action). The agency acted in good faith and did all that it could to remedy the problem. The appellant has not asked that the Board set aside the settlement agreement because of noncompliance and reinstate his merits appeal. Thus, there is no additional relief that the Board can grant to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not mentioned in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> was the Board's organic statute, 5 USC 1204(a), endowing the Board with broad authority to take final action and to issue appropriate orders to enforce compliance with its orders. A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Cardoza v. DOJ</span>, 53 MSPR 264, 267 (1992). On three occasions, the agency breached its settlement agreement by providing negative oral statements about his performance and tenure to prospective employers. The Board reiterated its policy against an award of damages for a breach of the agreement, noting that it would order the agency to comply in the future but the Board would decline an active role in future monitoring of references under the agreement, since nothing in the agreement called for monitoring of the agency's performance by the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 267-68. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vanover v. USDA,</span> DE-0752-09-0052-X-1 n.4 (NP 7/2/2012) ("The appellant seeks damages of $105,000 for the loss of his home, allegedly due to his inability to withdraw his TSP funds, $209,699.09 for medical expenses incurred, allegedly due to the agency's retroactive implementation of his resignation, and $300,000 for "other consequential and emotional damages for the stress that caused Appellant['] s wife's August 7, 2011 near fatal heart attack." However, the Board lacks the authority to order the agency to pay such costs or damages for a breach of a settlement agreement, in the absence of express language in the settlement agreement requiring it, or an express waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See Foreman v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although damages may be unavailable, one must be careful in classification of relief. A claim for lost wages resulting from a settlement breach could not be summarily be dismissed as damages. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bernard v.

United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2014), determining that the court had authority to consider a claim for loss of future earnings resulting from a violation of a confidentiality provision of a settlement agreement that was accepted by the Board for purposes of enforcement but outside the Board's authority (as defined by the Board) to award the damages claimed.

<p class="Body-Text">Speaking of <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-0752-10-0110-X-1 (NP 7/29/2014), involving the appellant's assertion that the agency violated a settlement by improper disclosures under a broad nondisclosure agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant seeks $75,000 in consequential or compensatory damages for the agency's breach of the settlement agreements. He contends that such damages should be available as in any other breach of contract case. The Board does not have jurisdiction to award damages for breach of contract, however. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1172, 1173 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("jurisdictional limits on the MSPB's remedial authority did not permit Mr. Cunningham to seek monetary damages for OPM's breach of contract"); <span class="Italic">Foreman v. Department of the Army</span>, 241 F.3d 1349, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Principe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 626, &#x00B6; 3 (2006). The Board's remedial jurisdiction in enforcement cases is limited to actual enforcement (which is not possible here, as explained above) or rescission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently held, in <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1172, that an appellant, who seeks monetary damages for an agency's breach of a settlement agreement entered into before the Board, may file a Tucker Act claim in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 748 F.3d at 1173, 1177; <span class="Italic">see</span> 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491. The court held that such a suit is not barred by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, or claim preclusion, because the plaintiff seeks relief in the Court of Federal Claims that he cannot obtain before the Board. 748 F.3d at 1180 (a plaintiff is "not barred from pursuing a second claim, against the same party based on the same set of transactional facts, in a court that has the authority to grant the relief that was unavailable to him in the first action"). Accordingly, although the appellant may seek monetary relief in the Court of Federal Claims, he may not do so before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, upon finding that the agency breached the settlement agreement and enforcement is not possible, we would rescind the agreement and reinstate the original appeal. The appellant insists that he does not want rescission, however; and considering the amount of time that has passed and the nature of his bargain (including a "clean" resignation and $10,000 paid in the previous compliance action), he may be correct that rescission would little benefit him. In addition, if we <span id="Page_5149"></span>rescinded the settlement agreements, the appellant presumably would not be able to seek relief in the Court of Federal Claims (assuming he wished to do so) because there would be no underlying agreements to enforce.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again referencing <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, the Federal Circuit declined to extend Tucker Act remedial authority to an alleged breach of the confidentiality provision of an alternate dispute resolution (mediation) agreement in a federal sector EEO case. The agreement, the court concluded, did not contemplate damages for breach and it did not take the form of a contract supporting a claim for damages, <span class="Italic">Higbie v. United States</span>, 778 F.3d 990, 994-95 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (dissent by Judge Taranto):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold issue, we must decide whether it was appropriate for the Court of Federal Claims to require Mr. Higbie to show that the agreement fairly contemplated monetary damages. While the agreement does not provide a monetary remedy, it does restrict the use of statements made during mediation to "settlement purposes <span class="Italic">only</span>." J.A. 27 (emphasis added). In other words, any statements made during the mediation must not be used for any purpose other than settlement. Thus, the agreement itself provides a remedy for the breach of the non-disclosure provision: exclusion of statements made during mediation from proceedings unrelated to the mediation. Per the terms of the agreement, the affidavits of Ms. Cotter and Mr. Thomas could be excluded from the EEO investigation. The appropriateness of this remedy is consistent with Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which excludes the content of parties' negotiations from other legal proceedings. This provision requiring the exclusion of statements made during the mediation proceeding from any other proceeding is a purely non-monetary remedy provided by the agreement. It follows that the Court of Federal Claims did not err in imposing the requirement to show that the agreement could be fairly interpreted as contemplating money damages. <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>, 657 F.3d at 1315.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, we consider whether Mr. Higbie has shown that the agreement can be fairly interpreted as contemplating money damages. On appeal, Mr. Higbie argues the terms of the agreement itself show that it contemplates money damages, but he does not point to a single provision in the agreement indicating money damages were contemplated. Having reviewed the agreement, we perceive no error in the Court of Federal Claims' finding that it does not expressly contemplate money damages. As such, the terms of the agreement itself do not support the assertion that the agreement can be fairly interpreted to contemplate money damages.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. United States</span>, 748 F.3d 1172 (Fed. Cir. 2014), a case neither party cited, this court considered breach of a confidentiality provision in a settlement agreement and found that the agreement was money-mandating. In <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> (as in <span class="Italic">Holmes</span>), the agreement in question was a settlement agreement that created specific duties owed by the Government to that particular plaintiff, unlike this case where the agreement employs boilerplate common to agreements associated with similar mediation proceedings. The agreement in this case served to guide the mediation process, which in the end was unsuccessful as the parties failed to reach settlement. Additionally, Mr. Higbie does not argue that the agreement creates any specific duty owed by the Government that applies particularly to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, Mr. Higbie relies on his negotiations with the Government, without pointing to any communication in which it is apparent that either party contemplated the availability of money damages for breach of the agreement. Thus, the confidentiality discussions also do not support the assertion that the agreement contemplated money damages.</p>
