<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-44_1"><span class="space">a.</span> Mask Requirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-21-0227-I-1 (NP 2/2/2023) (Member Leavitt dissenting without opinion), sustained an attendance-related removal of <span id="Page_3388"></span>a pharmacy technician. The employee's absence resulted from her religious objections to wearing a mask, as required by the agency, for the safety of personnel in an agency medical facility. The accommodations requested by the employee imposed an undue hardship on agency operations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove an affirmative defense of discrimination based on a failure to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs, an appellant must show that she holds a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicts with an employment requirement; has informed her employer of the conflict; and was discharged or disciplined for failing to comply with the conflicting requirement. <span class="Italic">See Reed v. Department of Transportation</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 126, 131 (1997); <span class="Italic">Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01930003, 1993 WL 1505208, at *3 (Sept. 23, 1993). If the appellant meets this burden, the Board will consider whether the agency has shown that it could not reasonably accommodate the appellant without undue hardship or that the appellant has been accommodated. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 1993 WL 1505208, at *3. The reasonableness of an employer's accommodation must be determined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the unique circumstances of each situation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accommodations for religious practices include, but are not limited to, voluntary substitutions or swaps, flexible scheduling, or lateral transfers and changes of job assignments. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(d)(1). Any reasonable accommodation proffered by the employer that removes the conflict between the employee's religious beliefs and the requirements of the workplace is sufficient to meet its accommodation obligation. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 1993 WL 1505208, at *4. To show undue hardship, an agency must demonstrate that an accommodation would require more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost. <span class="Italic">Trans World Airlines v. Hardison</span>, 432 U.S. 63, 74 (1977). Relevant factors may include the type of workplace, the nature of the employee's duties, the identifiable cost of the accommodation in relation to the size and operating costs of the employer, and the number of employees who will in fact need a particular accommodation. <span class="Italic">Frances A. v. Department of Justice</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 2019004187, 2020 WL 7241814, at * 4 (Nov. 30, 2020).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant proved her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. Specifically, she found that the appellant had a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> religious belief that conflicted with the agency's masking requirement, the appellant communicated this fact to the agency, and the appellant's removal was based on absences related to her religious objections to the mask mandate. However, she also found that the agency met its burden of showing that accommodating the appellant's beliefs would have caused an undue hardship. The administrative judge found that the appellant suggested and the agency considered various forms of accommodation, including spending the day in a closed office typing prescriptions and working alone at the pharmacy at night, but the agency reasonably rejected those proposals due to unfeasibility and safety and security concerns. As set forth below, we modify the initial decision to supplement these findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant argues that it would not have been an undue hardship for the agency to allow her to work from home. She argues that she previously worked at a Coumadin clinic, telephoned patients to schedule their appointments, and never had to go into the pharmacy to fill a prescription. However, during the time period at issue, the appellant was not working at the Coumadin clinic; she was working at a pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician, and filling prescriptions was a major part of her job. Moreover, the record shows that during the early stages of the pandemic, the pharmacy reduced staffing by having half of the staff work in the pharmacy and the other half "telework." However, even though these employees' hours were recorded as telework and they were technically in duty status, there is no work that a Pharmacy Technician can perform from home, so these "teleworking" employees were, in reality, not performing any duties whatsoever. If there was any arrangement at any cost that the agency could have made for the appellant to perform some sort of work from home, there is no evidence of it in the record. An accommodation that would have essentially required the agency to pay the appellant for not working would result in more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost, and therefore impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that she could have stayed behind closed doors and typed all day, and that there are already several Pharmacy Technicians who do that. However, there is no evidence in the record that this is the case. In any event, as the administrative judge correctly found, the appellant's proposal would essentially require that she remain in a closed office all day every day without leaving to use the restroom or for any other urgent reason that might come up, which is not realistic. Such an accommodation would thereby bring the appellant into contact with coworkers and/or patients when she would leave the closed office unmasked during the work day, thereby exposing those individuals to a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19. This would constitute an undue hardship to the agency. <span class="Italic">See Aukamp-Corcoran v. Lancaster General Hospital</span>, No. 19-5734, 2022 WL 507479, at *6-8 (E.D. Pa. 2022) (finding that granting a nurse's request for a religious exemption from an influenza vaccination requirement would result in an undue hardship due to the potential for increased hospitalization and death to patients); <span class="Italic">Barrington v. United Airlines, Inc</span>., 566 F. Supp. 3d 1102 (D. Colo. 2021) (holding that the increased risk of employees contracting COVID-19, if they were required to come into contact with unvaccinated coworkers, alone constituted an undue hardship).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of this determination, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Compliance Manual on Religious Discrimination, Section 12 (Jan. 15, 2021), <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-12-religiousdiscrimination#_ftnref256">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/section-12-religiousdiscrimination#_ftnref256</a>, describes what constitutes more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost for purposes of determining undue hardship:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Costs to be considered include not only direct monetary costs but also the burden on the conduct of the employer's business. For example, courts have found undue hardship where the accommodation diminishes efficiency in other jobs, infringes on other employees' job rights or benefits, impairs workplace safety, or causes coworkers to carry the accommodated employee's share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work. Whether the proposed accommodation conflicts with another law will also be considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Example 37 of the Compliance Manual explains that a steel mill laborer's requested religious accommodation, to be permitted to wear a skirt because her faith prohibited her from wearing pants, would pose an undue hardship because the evidence established that wearing pants was necessary for safety reasons around the machinery operated by the laborer. Similarly, we find that the appellant's requested accommodation would impose an undue hardship because it would impair workplace safety during the COVID-19 pandemic. <span class="Italic">See Barrington</span>, 566 F. Supp. 3d 1102; <span class="Italic">see also Bhatia v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc</span>., 734 F.2d 1382, 1383-84 (9th Cir. 1984) (holding that the employer did not have to accommodate the employee's request that he be permitted to maintain a beard when the company had a legitimate safety concern that the beard would prevent an airtight seal of a mask in the event of exposure to toxic gas and expose the company to liability); <span class="Italic">Draper v. U.S. Pipe &#x0026; Foundry Co</span>., 527 F.2d 515, 521 (6th Cir. 1976) ("safety considerations are highly relevant in determining whether a proposed [religious] accommodation would produce an undue hardship on an employer's business"). This is particularly so given the wide segment of the population at increased risk for getting severely ill from COVID-19, including those with a weakened immune system, <span class="Italic">see</span> Press Release, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), CDC updates, expands list of people at risk of severe COVID-19 illness (June 25, 2020), <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html">https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0625-update-expands-covid-19.html</a>, and the fact that the appellant worked in a medical setting, i.e., a pharmacy within the 300-400 employee MTC that also housed a family practice clinic, an optometry clinic, a flight medicine clinic, a physical therapy clinic, an x-ray area, a chiropractor, a pediatric clinic, and an OB/GYN clinic. The appellant agreed that her clinic sees patients with compromised immune systems. On July 14, 2020, before the events at issue in this appeal, the CDC indicated that it had "reviewed the latest science and affirms that cloth face coverings are a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19 that could reduce the spread of the disease," and that "[t]here is increasing evidence that cloth face coverings help prevent people who have COVID-19 from spreading the virus to others." Press Release, CDC, CDC calls on Americans to wear masks to prevent COVID-19 spread (July 14, 2020), <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html">https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2020/p0714-americans-to-wear-masks.html</a>. The press release quoted the CDC Director as saying that "[c]loth face coverings are one of the most powerful weapons we have to slow and stop the spread of the virus--particularly when used universally within a community setting." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Under the particular circumstances of this case, we find that accommodation of the appellant's religious beliefs would have required more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost, and thereby imposed an undue hardship upon the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that the agency should have allowed her to work in the pharmacy alone, at night, when no other employees were present. In her initial decision, the administrative judge found that the agency reasonably rejected this proposal "due to safety and security concerns, both because the appellant would be alone in the clinic after hours and because the pharmacy contains narcotics and other controlled drugs." The appellant disputes this finding, arguing that she would not have been in the building alone because housekeeping staff was nearby. In addition, there are cameras at the narcotics vaults, and she was the vault custodian for 2 years. We are not persuaded that the presence of housekeeping staff somewhere in the building provides adequate security for a pharmacy during hours that it would otherwise be shut down and secured. Nor do we find that the appellant's religious accommodation needs should require the agency to remove any layers of security from the measures that it takes to protect the controlled substances and other valuable property contained within the pharmacy. As with the accommodation addressed above, workplace safety concerns establish that this requested accommodation would involve more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> cost to the agency. For these reasons, we find that the appellant has not provided a sufficient basis for us to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the agency could not reasonably accommodate the appellant without undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3389"></span>Although we hold that the appellant in this case has not shown that the agency could accommodate her religious belief without undue hardship, our holding is limited to the facts of this particular case. This is especially so considering the unique time period at issue in this appeal, which was at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the widespread availability of vaccines. The Board will analyze a religious accommodation claim based on the facts in existence at the time in which the operative events occurred. <span class="Italic">See Prach v. Hollywood Supermarket, Inc</span>., No. 09-13756, 2010 WL 4608781, at *1 (E.D. Mich. 2010) (holding that the reasonableness of a religious accommodation is generally determined on a case-by-case basis according to the facts as they existed at the time of employment). We do not intend to foreclose the possibility that an employee's religious objection to masking could be accommodated in other situations, including situations in which telework is a viable option, the duty station and employment type lend themselves more readily to physical distancing, or there is another position in which the employee's beliefs can be accommodated and to which she could be reassigned or transferred in accordance with 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1605.2(d)(1)(iii). To the contrary, we take this occasion to remind agencies that religious liberty is integral to the Federal Merit System, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2301(b)(2), 2302(b)(1), and any denial of a request for religious accommodation will be closely scrutinized by the Board.</p>
