Dept. of State</span>, DC-0752-10-0305-I-1 (NP 2/25/2011) ("On petition for review, the appellant requests that the Board grant her the opportunity to elaborate on her March 8, 2010 response to the administrative judge's March 3, 2010 show-cause order on jurisdiction. She states that she submitted a 'very limited, unpolished, and unrevised draft-response' because she believed that her union representative would write a more detailed response on her behalf. However, the Board has long held that an appellant is responsible for the action or inaction of her representative. <span class="Italic">See Sparks v. Department of the Interior</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 369, 371 (1994); <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 404, 406 (1983)."): <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 115 MSPR 424, 428-29 &#x00B6; 11, 2010 MSPB 222 (2010) ("Thus, despite the fact that the appellant did not make this argument in her appeal below, but rather purposefully and specifically disavowed it, precluding the administrative judge's consideration of it, she now argues in her petition for review that the administrative judge erred in failing to address it. To the extent that the appellant now argues, based on evidence already in the record.... The Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that it is based on new and material evidence not previously available despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980)."); <span class="Italic">Gingery v.

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 80 MSPR 450, 455 &#x00B6; 6 (1998) ("[W]e will not consider the appellant's argument that the specification did not support the charge because the appellant raised this argument for the first time in her petition for review, and she has not demonstrated that it is based on new and material evidence that was unavailable despite the appellant's due diligence<span class="Italic">.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 77 MSPR 525, 528 (1998) ("Although it is well-established that the issue of jurisdiction is always before the Board...the Board generally will not consider arguments raised for the first time in a petition for review absent a showing that they are based on new and material facts not previously available despite the party's due diligence."); <span class="Italic">Payne v.

Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 476, 480 (1996) (Board reopened an appeal on its own motion to consider an issue of veterans preference of the appellant, but a general rule was stated that the Board would not consider the issue when the appellant "did not raise the issue of whether he should have been considered a preference eligible below, and he has not clearly established that his new argument is based on evidence that was previously unavailable despite the exercise of due diligence."); <span class="Italic">Lawson v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 672, 674 (1995) (on OPM's PFR: "We note that OPM did not raise the joint spousal consent and intervenor arguments below and has not shown, or even alleged, that, despite the exercise of due diligence, it could not have done so.

<p class="Body-Text">Summarized, the rule is that if an issue is not raised before the AJ in any fashion, unless there are unusual circumstances, the Board will not consider the newly asserted procedural or factual defenses. <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

An issue needs to be raised before the AJ; if it is raised, it may be argued more extensively in a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gaghan v.

<p class="Body-Text">In an extensive decision, partially reprinted here, <span class="Italic">McClenning v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2022 MSPB 2, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14, 22-24 (2022), determined that by not raising the issue with the AJ, the appellant waived a constitutional "Appointments Clause" challenge to the validity of the appointment of the AJ adjudicating the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the general standards for raising new arguments after the close of the record, the Board's regulations impose particular requirements on litigants who wish to challenge the qualifications of the individual assigned to hear their cases. Specifically, a party seeking to disqualify a judge must file a motion to disqualify as soon as the party has reason to believe there is a basis for disqualification and, if the administrative judge denies that motion, the party must request certification of an interlocutory appeal or the disqualification issue is considered waived. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42(b)-(c); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 350 F. App'x 448, 451 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (finding that the appellant had waived her request for recusal of the administrative judge by failing to comply with the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.42). In the absence of this requirement, a party before a Board administrative judge who believed there was a basis for disqualification could wait until after the initial decision was issued and then seek disqualification on petition for review if the initial decision was unfavorable. Allowing such gamesmanship by parties would waste the Board's resources to the extent that disqualification of an administrative judge after the initial decision would result in relitigation of the appeal. The same policy considerations that support the Board's regulation regarding the procedures for raising disqualification claims also support our decision here regarding the appellant's Appointments Clause claim. As recognized in <span class="Italic">Freytag v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 501 U.S. 868, 895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment), the trial phase of a case is when the litigants' arguments first must be raised and considered; permitting an Appointments Clause claim to be raised for the first time on appeal would encourage "sandbagging," i.e., for strategic reasons, allowing the trial court to pursue a certain course only to argue on appeal that it constituted reversible error if the outcome of the case was unfavorable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, consideration of constitutional claims, such as the Appointments Clause claim at issue here, is consistent with the Board's role in adjudicating appeals. The comprehensive system under the CSRA applies to constitutional claims, whether facial or as-applied. <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 567 U.S. at 12-23. Thus, parties are required to bring even their facial constitutional challenges to the Board, despite the fact that the Board "has repeatedly refused to pass upon the constitutionality of legislation." <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 16 (citing <span class="Italic">Malone v. Department of Justice</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 403 (1983)). A party's failure to raise a constitutional claim before the Board generally precludes the party from raising that claim for the first time when seeking judicial review of the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">See Hansen v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 911 F.3d 1362, 1369 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (declining to address a Fourth Amendment claim not raised before the Board). The requirement that a party exhaust his administrative remedies by first raising a constitutional claim during an administrative agency's proceeding before raising it in court has two main purposes: (1) to provide the administrative agency with the opportunity to correct its own errors regarding the programs it administers before being brought into Federal court, and thereby "discourage[ ] disregard of the agency's procedures"; and (2) to promote judicial efficiency because claims typically are resolved faster and more economically during administrative agency proceedings than they are in Federal court litigation. <span class="Italic">Woodford</span>, 548 U.S. at 89-90. Thus, the "unnecessary expenditure of the administrative resources of the original Board panel, the judicial resources of th[e] court, and the substantial delay and costs incurred" in the litigation may be avoided. <span class="Italic">In re DBC</span>, 545 F. 3d at 1378-79.[6] As explained previously, for similar reasons, the Board's regulations provide that all issues must first be raised before the administrative judge before the full Board will consider them. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.59(c), 1201.115(d); <span class="Italic">see Freytag</span>, 501 U.S. at 895 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Our reviewing court has recognized the value in having the Board address a constitutional claim before the court considers it. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Helman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 856 F.3d 920, 936 n.8 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (finding that whether the Board's administrative judges are inferior officers for purposes of the Appointments Clause is "more appropriately dealt with by the [Board] in the first instance").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, it would not have been futile for the appellant to timely raise an Appointments Clause claim before the administrative judge. Had the appellant raised the Appointments Clause issue to the administrative judge before the close of the record, the administrative judge could have certified the question for interlocutory appeal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.42(b)-(c), 1201.91. The interlocutory appeal process permits the Board members, who are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201, to address an issue while an appeal is still pending before an administrative judge. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.91. Thus, the interlocutory appeal process permits a party raising an Appointments Clause claim to present that claim to the Board's principal officers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, by the time the record closed before the administrative judge in this appeal, another litigant before the Board had raised an Appointments Clause claim before the administrative judge in his appeal. <span class="Italic">Flynn v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-1221-14-1124-M-1, Motion to Vacate (Feb. 14, 2018). After initially dismissing the appeal without prejudice, the administrative judge issued an order in April 2019, certifying the Appointments Clause issue for interlocutory appeal. <span class="Italic">Flynn v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-1221-14-1124-M-4, Order and Certification for Interlocutory Appeal (Apr. 23, 2019). Thus, there is reason to believe that, if the appellant here had timely raised her Appointments Clause claim before the close of the record before the administrative judge, the administrative judge issue would have certified the issue for interlocutory appeal and the Board would have had an opportunity to address the administrative judge's appointment before he issued an initial decision on the merits of the appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue raised for the first time in a PFR may be treated as a petition for reopening on the basis of new evidence, and it will not be considered unless the issue could not have been raised during the hearing before the AJ. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 15 MSPR 393, 395 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Epstein v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 235, 237, 6 MSPB 203 (1981) (rule applied to an argument of harmful error); <span class="Italic">Moses v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 19, 20, 2 MSPB 193 (1980) (application to new factual issues). Although the Board may decline to grant a PFR on the basis of an issue belatedly raised by a party, the Board may, on its own motion, reopen the case to correct reversible error committed by the AJ. The effect may then be that the Board reviews issues not properly preserved by a party filing a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lawson v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 672, 676 (1995). If a party is prevented from submitting issues or arguments to the AJ because the AJ fails properly to serve a show cause order, the Board will consider those issues or arguments when they are presented for the first time on PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wilber v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 444, 446-47 (1991). The Board entertained objections raised for the first time in a PFR of an enforcement decision when its prior order directing backpay was clearly erroneous (contrary to the Department of Transportation Appropriations Act of 1996) and "the procedural posture of the case precluded an opportunity to litigate" the backpay issue prior to the issuance of an earlier Board final decision ordering relief. <span class="Italic">Ivery v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 102 MSPR 356, 361 &#x00B6; 13, 2006 MSPB 174 (2006); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McFarland v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 107 MSPR 449, 452 &#x00B6; 5, 2007 MSPB 299 (2007) (same analysis as <span class="Italic">Ivery</span>). The Board considered rather than rejected what may have been a new issue in a performance case involving the legitimacy of performance standards in <span class="Italic">Brookins v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0432-18-0359-I-1, n.9 (NP 1/19/2023):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant appears to raise this argument for the first time on review. Nonetheless, we have considered it because it appears to pertain to the validity of his performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Neal v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 158, 161 (1996) (stating that the agency must prove its action was based on valid performance standards, and the Board is obliged to consider this issue, regardless of whether it has been raised by the parties).</p>
