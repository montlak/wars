<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-376"><span class="space">2.</span> Significance of Past Practice</h4>
<p class="noindent">"Where a past practice establishes a condition of employment, the condition of employment is incorporated into the parties' collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2128 and DOD DCMA</span>, 58 FLRA 519, 523 (2003). Concerning past practice governing an award by an arbitrator, the standard for determining the existence of a past practice is whether a practice was consistently exercised for an extended period of time with an agency's knowledge and express or implied consent. "[I]n general, a contention that an arbitrator erred in not finding a past practice provides no basis for finding an award deficient." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-77 and VAMC Grand Junction</span>, 40 FLRA 342, 347 (1991); <span class="Italic">cf. Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Pensacola and AFGE Local 1960</span>, 48 FLRA 731, 734 (1993) ("The standard for determining the existence of a past practice is whether a practice was consistently exercised for an extended period of time, with an agency's knowledge and express or implied consent.").</p>
<p class="noindent">The significance of past practice was noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2145 and VAMC Richmond</span>, 66 FLRA 760, 761 (2012), involving an overtime claim:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, an arbitrator may appropriately determine whether a past practice has modified the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 61 FLRA 684, 686 (2006) (<span class="Italic">DHS</span>). Such a determination is a matter of contract <span id="page_2403"></span>interpretation subject to the deferential essence standard of review.[3] <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 207</span>, 60 FLRA 731, 734 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span>, 630 (Alan Miles Ruben, ed., BNA Books 6th ed. 2003) ("an arbitrator's award that appears contrary to the express terms of the agreement may nevertheless be valid if it is premised upon reliable evidence of the parties' intent") (quoting <span class="Italic">Int'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local Union No. 199 v. United Tel. Co. of Fla</span>., 738 F.2d 1564, 1568 (11th Cir. 1984)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The Authority views an exception to an arbitrator's finding of whether a past practice exists as asserting a nonfact. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div. &#x0026; Seattle Dist</span>., 64 FLRA 405, 408 n.5 (2010). The Authority views an exception to an arbitrator's interpretation of a past practice as asserting that the award fails to draw its essence from an agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The existence of a past practice supplementing or modifying the collective bargaining agreement is, essentially, a matter of interpretation of facts. FLRA will not set aside an award of an arbitrator because the union argues that its facts established a past practice and the arbitrator found to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC and AFGE Local 1985</span>, 3 FLRA 560, 562 (1980). "[W]here a party argues that an award is deficient because the arbitrator failed to recognize a past practice, the Authority considers the party's assertion regarding past practice as a matter of contract interpretation." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Weapons Station Yorktown and NAGE Local R4-1</span>, 57 FLRA 917, 920 (2002); <span class="Italic">see Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 72</span>, 61 FLRA 304, 306 (2005) (past practice may be discontinued through subsequent bargaining; "it would be difficult to conclude that there was no intent to change a past practice where one party attempted, unsuccessfully, to incorporate the terms of the past practice into the parties' agreement, while at the same time agreeing to other new language addressing the matter").</p>

Furthermore, the Arbitrator held that, in any event, the Union failed to establish a binding past practice that would have required the Agency to have authorized rental cars for the unit employees.

<p class="noindent">Cited in <span class="Italic">Muller</span> was <span class="Italic">Cruz-Martinez v. DHS</span>, 410 F.3d 1366, 1367-72 (Fed. Cir. 2005), finding no difficulty crediting an arbitrator's determination that past practice barred a grievance that was not actively prosecuted and declining to credit the union's appellant's contention that the contract precluded consideration of extrinsic evidence,</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On September 29, 2000, the agency issued a proposal to remove Cruz-Martinez from his position as a Special Agent for the agency for conduct unbecoming an officer of the service, improper admission of aliens, failure to follow the instructions of a supervisor, and for improper release of sensitive information. Cruz-Martinez responded in a written reply on November 8, 2000, and in an oral reply on November 30, 2000. Thereafter, the agency advised Cruz-Martinez by letter that he was being removed and that his removal was effective upon receipt of the letter. The letter also explained Cruz-Martinez's right to contest his removal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On April 12, 2001, the union notified the agency by letter that it was invoking arbitration as to the removal. Subsequently, on May 14, 2001, the agency advised the union that it wished to schedule arbitration proceedings, but the union did not respond. Over thirteen months after the union's letter invoking arbitration, on May 29, 2002, the agency informed the union by letter that "[s]ince the Union is the moving party in this matter and has not acted on this case in over a year, the case is closed in accordance with past practice." The letter further informed the union that it should contact the agency "with any concerns." Almost fifteen months later, on August 15, 2003, the union responded for the first time, demanding that the agency schedule the grievance for arbitration. The agency agreed to schedule the grievance, but maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable based on an established past practice that barred arbitrations that were not advanced for over a year.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the arbitrator, the union maintained that the grievance was arbitrable because the union had fulfilled all of its obligations by invoking arbitration in conformance with relevant contractual provisions. The union further argued that there was no language in the collective bargaining agreement directing an arbitrator to dismiss the grievance under these circumstances, noting that the agency's "closeout" policy had been an issue in previous separate arbitrations. Additionally, the union argued that it had challenged this policy in unfair labor charges filed with the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") in 2000 and in 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The agency, on the other hand, maintained that the grievance was not arbitrable because the grievance case had been closed in accordance with the agency's long-standing past practice of closing out cases where the union has taken no action to advance the grievance to arbitration in over a year. Conceding that the parties' collective bargaining agreement was silent on any requirement regarding advancing grievances after arbitration has been invoked, the agency maintained the existence and consistent application of a long-standing practice beginning in the mid-1980s, supporting its position of a clear past practice with past arbitration awards, unrebutted testimony, and past close-out letters averaging twenty-five to thirty per year. Acknowledging that the union did challenge the policy in 2000 and 2001 in its filing of two unfair labor practice charges with the FLRA, the agency noted that the FLRA dismissed the charges on the basis that the practice of closing out cases existed well before the filing of the charges and thus those charges before the FLRA were themselves untimely. The agency further relied on the union's conduct with respect to this case, pointing out that it took the union almost fifteen months to object or respond to the agency's notification that it was closing this case after one year of inaction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After hearing the evidence and argument from both sides, the arbitrator held that the grievance was not arbitrable. First, the arbitrator found that the agency had clearly and consistently implemented a "closeout" policy since the mid-1980s, finding that the "[a]gency <span class="Italic">dismissed</span> such grievances for over <span class="Italic">17 years</span> while averaging between approximately 25 and 30 dismissals each year."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the arbitrator found that the union clearly had notice of the agency's close-out policy, noting that "[t]he evidence is also undisputed that the Agency regularly and routinely notified the local unions of its decisions dismissing these grievances under the closeout policy." Thus the arbitrator concluded that "there is no doubt that the union and its various local unions in the Eastern District were aware of this policy."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the arbitrator found that the union by its action or inaction over this period assented to the agency's close-out policy. Hence, the arbitrator rejected the union's argument that it objected to the agency's practice of dismissing cases that were abandoned for over a year, relying on the evidence regarding case processing since the mid-1980s, including this one. The arbitrator noted that "there was no evidence, in this record, other than counsel's statements that the union objected to the dismissal of this grievance until counsel's request/demand that the grievance be scheduled for arbitration--14 months after the case had been closed out." Additionally, the arbitrator relied on the fact that the union offered no evidence of "having successfully grieved <span class="Italic">this issue</span> to arbitration again <span class="Italic">weakened</span> the union's assertions that it has repeatedly objected to these dismissals." According to the arbitrator,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the union's consent is implied by the fact that essentially none of the local unions nor the union's Eastern Regional formally or successfully protested these actions through the grievance procedure; that the two protests to the FLRA were denied; and that, in this record, there was no demonstration that the union ever filed any other formal grievance specifically challenging the 'close-out' policy or that the policy was ever found to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, at least up until this grievance, some 17 years after the fact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 16; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 15 (finding that "the FLRA declined to issue complaint concluding that the close-out policy had been in existence for some time"). In sum, the arbitrator held that the weight of the evidence supported the agency's position regarding a binding past practice, and the union offered no substantial evidence to rebut it. This petition for review ensued.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have jurisdiction to review arbitration decisions regarding removal from federal service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Clear and long-standing practices of the parties--in other words, "past practices"--can establish terms of the agreement that are as binding as any specific written provision. As the Supreme Court has stated, "[t]he labor arbitrator's source of law is not confined to the express provisions of the contract, as the industrial common law--the practices of the industry and the shop--is equally a part of the collective bargaining agreement although not expressed in it." <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of Am. v. Warrior &#x0026; Gulf Navigation Co.,</span> 363 U.S. 574, 581-82, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 4 L. Ed.2d 1409 (1960). Generally, factors relevant to a finding of a binding past practice are the duration and consistency of its application and the parties' acquiescence in it. Therefore, as a preliminary matter, we note that the arbitrator evaluated the duration of the agency's close-out policy and the union's acquiescence in this policy, and conclude that the arbitrator considered the correct criteria in analyzing whether a binding past practice of closing out cases after one year existed. We further conclude that the arbitrator's finding that each of the factors had been met was supported by substantial evidence. The arbitrator's reliance on the sixteen years of the union's acquiescence in the past practice is substantial evidence <span id="page_2405"></span>supporting the arbitrator's decision. Moreover, we find that the union's filing of two unfair labor charges with the FLRA, where those charges were dismissed, is not sufficient to preclude the arbitrator's finding of a binding past practice here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Cruz-Martinez's related argument that the plain meaning of the agreement precludes the consideration of extrinsic evidence to show a contrary binding past practice has been rejected by the Uniform Commercial Code and the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. U.C.C. &#x00A7; 2-202 cmt. 1(b) (1998) (rejecting the premise that there is a plain meaning, or a "meaning attributable to such language by rules of construction existing in the law rather than the meaning which arises out of the commercial context in which it was used"); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 212, cmt. b (1981) (making admissible extrinsic evidence because "meaning can almost never be plain except in a context"); Carlton J. Snow, <span class="Italic">Contract Interpretation: The Plain Meaning Rule in Labor Arbitration,</span> 55 Fordham L.Rev. 681, 682 (1987). We find that the arbitrator was correct that, on the facts in this case, the collective bargaining agreement does not preclude the consideration of extrinsic evidence to show a binding past practice. This is particularly the case here where the past practice does not contradict any written provision in the collective bargaining agreement, but simply defines the course of dealing between the parties in an area where the contract is silent, i.e., the past practice fills a gap in the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we also reject Cruz-Martinez's argument, which he appears to raise for the first time on appeal, that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment is implicated by a binding past practice that bars a claim as not arbitrable for untimeliness. Under Cruz-Martinez's reasoning, nothing short of a constitutional amendment could bar cases from being heard on the merits for untimeliness. The Supreme Court has stated, however, that "[t]he State may erect reasonable procedural requirements for triggering the right to an adjudication, be they statutes of limitation, or, in an appropriate case, filing fees. And the State certainly accords <span class="Italic">due</span> process when it terminates a claim for failure to comply with a reasonable procedural or evidentiary rule." <span class="Italic">Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co.,</span> 455 U.S. 422, 437, 102 S. Ct. 1148, 71 L. Ed.2d 265 (1982) (citations omitted). We thus find that the arbitrator's decision that a binding past practice bars this action from being arbitrable on the merits does not implicate the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, less than three weeks before this case was scheduled to be heard on the briefs, Cruz-Martinez submitted a two-page "Supplement To Petitioner's Reply Brief." There, he argued for the first time that <span class="Italic">Gunn v. Veterans Administration Medical Center,</span> which held that abandonment requires a showing of (1) inexcusable delay on the part of the union and (2) prejudice to the union, applied to his case. 892 F.2d 1036, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Accordingly, that case and the principles enumerated therein were not considered or discussed by either the arbitrator in his opinion or the government in its brief on appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if this argument were properly before this court, we would reject it. In <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> the union timely invoked arbitration and a month later the parties met and selected an arbitrator for the grievance at hand. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1036. The arbitrator sent a letter to both parties, proposing several dates for a hearing. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1036-37. After not receiving any response from either party, the arbitrator contacted both parties six months later to determine the status of the case. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1037. Thereafter, the parties scheduled a hearing, but at the hearing the agency maintained for the first time that the grievance was not arbitrable for two reasons: (1) the union's delay in selecting an arbitrator was outside the time allowed by the collective bargaining agreement; and (2) the union's delay in scheduling a hearing date was sufficiently long to establish abandonment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The arbitrator agreed with the agency that the grievance was not arbitrable, but this court reversed and remanded the case. <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1040. As to the first ground, this court found that the agency did not make a "<span class="Italic">timely</span> objection" and "the Union was clearly prejudiced by a surprise defense." <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> 892 F.2d at 1039. This court held that "[o]n this record, we are compelled to conclude that, if the parties did not actually agree to the delay in selection, the government at least waived any objection." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As to the second ground for finding nonarbitrability, this court held that there was not sufficient evidence to support the arbitrator's finding of unreasonable delay and prejudice, which the government agreed were necessary to sustain a defense of abandonment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Gunn,</span> the agency does not argue abandonment here, but instead relies on a binding past practice which it argues, and the arbitrator agreed, allowed the agency to close this case after one year of inaction. Thus, <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> does not apply in this case. Whether abandonment, which requires a finding of unreasonable delay and prejudice, can be shown as a separate and independent theory for barring this action is not before us. Instead, a past practice, like a regulation, statute, or contractual provision, is the binding restriction which bars this action from being arbitrable in this instance. Hence, because we affirm the arbitrator's finding of a binding past practice, we need not address the question dealt with in <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> of whether the union also abandoned the grievance. We thus conclude that even if the argument based on <span class="Italic">Gunn</span> were properly before us, it does not apply in this case.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute)[42] provides for the submission of collective-bargaining agreements to the agency head for review.[43] But past practices are not subject to that review process.[44] Therefore, finding that an arbitrator may rely on a past practice to effectively create a new contract provision is in tension with &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With these considerations in mind, we now reconsider Authority precedent and find that arbitrators may not look beyond a collective-bargaining agreement--to extraneous considerations such as past practice--to modify an agreement's clear and unambiguous terms.[45] And we will no longer follow Authority precedent holding otherwise.[46]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the award is inconsistent with the plain terms of the parties' agreement. And, for the reasons set forth above, we find that the Arbitrator's alternative rationale--that the parties modified the clear and unambiguous terms of their agreement by past practice--cannot provide a basis for the award. Therefore, the award is deficient,[48] and we set it aside. Consequently, we find it unnecessary to resolve the Agency's remaining exceptions.</p>
