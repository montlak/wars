<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-36"><span class="space">1.</span> Direct Evidence; Evidence Considered as a Whole; Comparators; Taint of Agency Official; Cat's Paw</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">There are several means of establishing evidence of discrimination or reprisal. Direct evidence is one. According to <span class="Italic">Savage v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SAVAGE_TOMMIE_G_AT_0752_11_0634_I_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1217635.pdf">122 MSPR 612</a>, 635 &#x00B6; 42, 2015 MSPB 51 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Troupe v. May Department Stores Company</span>, 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994), a case involving a claim of pregnancy discrimination, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit provided a useful taxonomy of the "[d]ifferent kinds and combinations of evidence" that may support an inference that intentional discrimination or retaliation was a motivating factor in an employment action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 736. One kind is direct evidence, i.e., "evidence that can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent[.] " <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition to direct evidence, the court identified and distinguished three types of circumstantial evidence. The first kind "consists of suspicious timing, ambiguous statements oral or written, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Considered together, the court explained, such bits and pieces may compose "a convincing mosaic of discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 737. The second kind of circumstantial evidence is comparator evidence, consisting of "evidence, whether or not rigorously statistical, that employees similarly situated to the plaintiff other than in the characteristic...on which an employer is forbidden to base a difference in treatment received systematically better treatment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 736. The third kind consists of evidence that the agency's stated reason for its action is "unworthy of belief, a mere pretext for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court stressed that none of the aforementioned types of evidence, i.e., direct, "convincing mosaic," comparator, or pretext, will be needed in every case. "Each type of evidence," the court explained, "is sufficient by itself...to support a judgment for [the employee]; or they can be used together." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Savage</span> was interpreted by <span class="Italic">Ahuruonye v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DC-531D-14-0587-B-1 (NP 7/15/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In considering this claim, the administrative judge followed the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612 (2015), wherein the Board clarified the appropriate analysis for discrimination claims and refuted, as having no application to our proceedings, the traditional burden-shifting scheme of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 46-51. Rather, the Board found, the first inquiry is whether the appellant shows by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action and, in making that showing, the appellant may rely on direct evidence or any of three types of circumstantial evidence consisting of bits and pieces of evidence from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn, comparator evidence, and/or evidence that the agency's stated reason is a pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42, 51. If the appellant meets his burden, the Board will then inquire whether the agency has shown <span id="Page_3370"></span>by preponderant evidence that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory motive, and, if the agency makes that showing, then reversal of the action is not required. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gardner v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GARDNER_NIKKI_A_DC_0752_15_0466_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1344333.pdf">123 MSPR 647</a>, 657-58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-29, 2016 MSPB 36 (2016), elaborated on the <span class="Italic">Troupe</span> decision mentioned in <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, describing the evidence an AJ must consider as a "single pile" that must be "evaluated as a whole," rather than a convincing mosaic:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, we stated that, when an appellant asserts an affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the Board first will inquire whether the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. We further stated that, in making her initial showing, an appellant may rely on direct evidence or any of the three types of circumstantial evidence described in <span class="Italic">Troupe v. May Department Stores Co</span>., 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir. 1994), i.e., pretext, comparator or "convincing mosaic," either alone or in combination. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. <span class="Italic">Savage</span> overruled prior Board decisions, however, to the extent that they erroneously held that, to establish such a claim using circumstantial evidence, an appellant <span class="Italic">must</span> provide evidence showing a "convincing mosaic" of discrimination or retaliation against her. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 42-43, 51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit further clarified its explanation in <span class="Italic">Troupe</span> that the phrase "convincing mosaic" was not meant to impose a new, separate legal requirement or to serve as a legal test, but was instead "designed as a metaphor to illustrate why courts should not try to differentiate between direct and indirect evidence." <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Werner Enterprises, Inc</span>., No. 15-2574, 2016 WL 4411434, at *3 (7th Cir. Aug. 19, 2016). Noting that the phrase "convincing mosaic" continued to be misused as a governing legal standard in cases decided after <span class="Italic">Troupe</span>, <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span> again rejected the proposition that "evidence must be sorted into different piles, labeled 'direct' and 'indirect,' that are evaluated differently," instead holding that "all evidence belongs in a single pile and must be evaluated as a whole." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, <span class="Italic">Troupe</span>, and <span class="Italic">Savage</span> were summarized, <span class="Italic">Bailey v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-16-0463-I-1 (NP 5/25/2022), with commentary on age discrimination claims analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not inform the appellant of her burden on her affirmative defenses of race and sex discrimination or EEO reprisal in any of her orders or the initial decision. While the agency's closing argument included discussion of the appellant's burden, it relied on the incorrect standard, the burden-shifting analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973). The <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework has no application to Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 46 (2015), <span class="Italic">clarified by Gardner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 30 (2016). Rather, the Board relies on the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, and its progeny.[2] <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 51 (explaining the burdens of proof applied by the Board to title VII claims); <span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 30 (clarifying how to analyze relevant evidence in connection with such claims). Further, in denying the appellant's affirmative defenses, the administrative judge did not consider the appellant's arguments and evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Age Discrimination in Employment Act states that "personnel actions...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a). Similarly, title VII requires that such actions "shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 48-50, the Board adopted the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), for analyzing claims arising under title VII. The Board in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> held that it first inquires whether the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. Such a showing is sufficient to establish that the agency violated title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant meets her burden, the Board then inquires whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the agency makes that showing, its title VII violation will not require reversal of the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">After <span class="Italic">Savage</span> was decided, the Supreme Court interpreted the language in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) in <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie</span>, 589 U.S. __, 140 S. Ct. 1168 (2020). The Court held that to obtain "injunctive or other forward-looking relief," the plaintiff must show that age discrimination "play[ed] any part in the way a decision [was] made." <span class="Italic">Babb</span>, 140 S. Ct. at 1173-74, 1177-78. However, a plaintiff "must show that age discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome" to obtain "reinstatement, backpay,...or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1177-78. Thus, under both <span class="Italic">Savage</span> and <span class="Italic">Babb</span>, some relief is available if the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the challenged personnel action, but full relief is available only if the prohibited consideration was a but-for cause of the action. Although <span class="Italic">Savage</span> and <span class="Italic">Babb</span> appear to diverge on the question of which party has the burden to prove or disprove but-for causation, we need not decide at this time whether the analytical framework applied in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> must be revised in light of <span class="Italic">Babb</span>. Because the appellant has not yet proven her initial burden that a prohibited factor played any part in the agency's decision, we do not reach the question of whether race and sex discrimination or EEO reprisal was a but-for cause of that decision.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Direct evidence of disability discrimination was not established by action that the agency took, albeit incorrectly, to address what it perceived to be potentially disruptive conduct by an employee in <span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOE_JOHN_DC_0752_09_0881_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_704976.pdf">117 MSPR 579</a>, 595-97 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 40-46, 2012 MSPB 42 (2012) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, DC-0752-09-0881-B-2 (NP 7/28/2016), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find persuasive the appellant's argument that the agency's actions constituted direct evidence of discrimination. Direct evidence may be any statement made by an employer that: (1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude; and (2) bears directly on the contested employment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Arredondo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 113, &#x00B6; 13 (2000). However, such evidence is composed of "only the most blatant remarks, whose intent could be nothing other than to discriminate" on the basis of some impermissible factor. <span class="Italic">Schoenfeld v. Babbitt</span>, 168 F.3d 1257, 1266 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Carter v. City of Miami,</span> 870 F.2d 578, 582 (11th Cir. 1989)). If an alleged discriminatory statement merely suggests a discriminatory motive, then it is only circumstantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has addressed the question of direct evidence in certain disability discrimination cases, for example, where the agency clearly acknowledged that the appellant was disabled and the disability was the basis for its action. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 552, 559-60 (1997). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff,</span> the Board deemed the agency's charges of inability to work and AWOL to be direct evidence of discrimination because the charges were solely and explicitly based on the appellant's disability of depression and did not involve any independent acts of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 79. Furthermore, the Board specifically noted in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span> that the appellant had never received less than a "fully successful" performance rating and that, although she had been incapacitated for several months prior to her proposed removal, the medical evidence showed that she was not incapacitated when the agency proposed her removal for inability to work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 65, 69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, under longstanding Board precedent, an agency may bring a charge against an employee for physical inability to perform job duties. <span class="Italic">See Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 2, 14 (2011); <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Department of Transportation,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 15 (2008); <span class="Italic">Bullock v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 531, &#x00B6; 7 (2001), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 68-69; <span class="Italic">Sebald v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 164, 165 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Jones v. Department of Transportation</span>, 295 F.3d 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (affirming Board decision sustaining employee's removal for physical inability to perform functions of his position.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, the mere fact that an agency brings a charge based on an employee's troubling conduct--even where that conduct is ultimately found to be symptomatic of a disabling condition--is not direct evidence of discrimination. Here, the agency placed the appellant on enforced leave because she had exhibited unusual and inappropriate behavior in the workplace, and it apparently believed she posed a threat to workplace safety. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Ellshoff</span>, there is no evidence in the record before us to indicate that the agency's decision to take this action was motivated by an intent to discriminate against the appellant based on an <span id="Page_3371"></span>actual or perceived disability. Accordingly, we find that the record does not establish direct evidence of discrimination here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of direct evidence of discrimination, an employee may rely on the evidentiary framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), in order to prove a claim of unlawful disparate treatment. Under this framework, an employee must produce sufficient evidence to show that she (1) is a member of a protected group; (2) suffered an appealable adverse employment action; and (3) that the unfavorable action gives rise to the inference of discrimination. 411 U.S. at 802. As to the third element, an employee may rely on any evidence giving rise to an inference that the unfavorable treatment at issue was due to illegal discrimination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Chappell-Johnson v. Powell</span>, 440 F.3d 484, 488-89 (D.C. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Stella v. Mineta</span>, 284 F.3d 135, 145 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (no requirement in a failure to hire case that the plaintiff show that the employer filled the position with a person outside the protected class); <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (2010). This burden can be met by any proof of actions taken by the employer that shows a "discriminatory animus," where "in the absence of any other explanation it is more likely than not that those actions were bottomed on impermissible considerations." <span class="Italic">Schoenfeld</span>, 168 F.3d at 1268.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant makes the requisite <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing as set forth above, the burden of production shifts to the employer to "articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason" for its action. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802. If the employer does so, the appellant must then be given an opportunity to demonstrate that, based on all of the evidence, the stated reason is a pretext and that the action was taken for a discriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Holcomb v. Powell</span>, 433 F.3d 889, 897 (D.C. Cir. 2006). With regard to this ultimate burden, an appellant can rely on "any combination of (1) evidence establishing the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; (2) evidence the plaintiff presents to attack the employer's proffered explanation for its action; and (3) any further evidence of discrimination that may be available to the plaintiff, such as independent evidence of discriminatory statements or attitudes on the part of the employer." <span class="Italic">Holcomb</span>, 433 F.3d at 897 (citing <span class="Italic">Aka v. Washington Hospital Center,</span> 156 F.3d 1284, 1289 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). While such evidence may include proof that the employer treated similarly situated employees differently, an appellant may also prevail by introducing evidence (1) that the employer lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the employer's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of disabled employees or those who engage in protected activities; or (5) of incriminating statements by the employer. <span class="Italic">See Brady v. Office of the Sergeant at Arms, U.S. House of Representatives</span>, 520 F.3d 490, 495 (D.C. Cir. 2008). The focus of this inquiry is not "the correctness or desirability of [the] reasons offered...[but] whether the employer honestly believes in the reasons it offers." <span class="Italic">McCoy v. WGN Continental Broadcasting Co</span>., 957 F.2d 368, 373 (7th Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also Pignato v. American Trans Air, Inc</span>., 14 F.3d 342, 349 (7th Cir. 1994) ("It is not enough for the plaintiff to show that a reason given for a job action is not just, or fair, or sensible. He must show that the explanation given is a phony reason.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as with most appeals of adverse actions taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, the agency has already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its action. Accordingly, the inquiry proceeds directly to the ultimate question of whether, upon weighing all of the evidence, the appellant has met her burden of proving that the agency intentionally discriminated against her based on disability. <span class="Italic">See Marshall v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 16 (2008). Because the record in this case has not been sufficiently developed to determine whether the appellant has met this burden, it is appropriate to remand this appeal for further adjudication of the appellant's claims of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand, the Board again found no discrimination, <span class="Italic">Doe v. PBGC</span>, DC-0752-09-0881-B-2 (NP 7/28/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge explained, the Board in <span class="Italic">Doe</span> made several findings regarding the appellant's disability discrimination claim, <span class="Italic">see Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 35-46. The Board found that there was no direct evidence of discrimination and it noted that, absent such evidence, an employee may rely on the evidentiary framework set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973), to prove a claim of unlawful disparate treatment.[5] <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 35, 40, 43-44. The Board further found that the agency had already articulated a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions and that, therefore, the inquiry should proceed directly to the ultimate question of whether the appellant met her burden of proving that the agency discriminated against her based on her disability. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 43, 46. Finally, the Board found that the record had not been sufficiently developed to determine whether the appellant had met this burden and that it was therefore appropriate to remand the appeal for further adjudication of the appellant's disability discrimination claims. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Under that standard, to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, an appellant must prove that: (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action gives rise to an inference of discrimination. <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 802. If an appellant establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of prohibited employment discrimination, the burden then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 802-04.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with the Board's instructions, on remand, the administrative judge applied a disparate treatment analysis in addressing the appellant's disability discrimination claim, and he determined the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the agency's reasons for taking its actions were pretextual. In making this finding, the administrative judge also determined that the agency's order that the appellant undergo an FFD examination did not violate the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA) because the agency's order was job-related and consistent with business necessity.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, although 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.14(c) does not give an agency independent authority to order an FFD examination, it provides that an agency does not violate the ADAAA by requiring an employee to undergo such an examination if the examination is job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, to the extent that the appellant here is arguing that the agency discriminated against her based on her perceived disability by ordering her to submit to the FFD examinations, we find that a disparate treatment analysis of the appellant's discrimination claim is inappropriate in this case. Because restrictions on agencies regarding disability-related inquiries and medical examinations apply to all employees, the appropriate standard for analyzing that claim is whether the agency's orders directing the appellant to undergo the FFD examinations were job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Archerda</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 28. Accordingly, we review the remand initial decision to determine whether the administrative judge correctly found that the order directing the appellant to undergo the FFD examinations met this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be job-related and consistent with business necessity if an employer has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Rosario-Fabregas v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 14 (2015). A direct threat is a "significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency's order directing the appellant to undergo an FFD examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity, the administrative judge determined that the record shows that the appellant was unable to take direction from her supervisor, which is an essential function of every job. For example, as the administrative judge noted, the appellant refused to meet with V.L. due to what the appellant called V.L.'s "hidden agenda." The administrative judge therefore found that the agency's order that the appellant undergo an FFD examination did not violate the ADAAA.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The administrative judge further found, however, that the appellant did not pose a direct threat. As previously noted, the agency challenges this finding in its cross petition for review. Given our finding that the administrative judge correctly found that the agency established that the FFD examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity by showing that it reasonably believed that the appellant's ability to perform essential job functions would be impaired by a medical condition, we need not determine whether the agency also proved that the administrative judge erred by finding that the agency failed to show that it did not violate the Rehabilitation Act because it established that it reasonably believed that the appellant would pose a direct threat due to a medical condition. Accordingly, we deny the agency's cross petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges this finding on review, arguing that the agency failed to show that the FFD examinations were job-related and consistent with business necessity because the agency did not produce any evidence showing that her alleged medical conditions affected her performance, thereby impairing her ability to perform the essential functions of her position. She asserts that an employee's refusal to meet with a supervisor on a single occasion does not meet the limited circumstances in which a medical examination is permitted under the ADAAA, nor does it constitute objective evidence that an employee is unable to perform the essential functions of her position. The appellant contends that, in deciding to order her to undergo the FFD examinations, the agency improperly failed to consider her performance or the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3372"></span>We find these arguments unpersuasive. The agency's alleged failure to consider the specific functions of the appellant's position in deciding to order her to undergo the FFD examinations is of no consequence because, as the administrative judge noted, the ability to take direction from one's supervisor is an essential function of every job. Further, contrary to the appellant's apparent contention on review, the administrative judge did not find that the FFD examination was job-related and consistent with business necessity based solely on a single instance in which the appellant refused to meet with her supervisor. Rather, the administrative judge cited the appellant's refusal to meet with V.L. due to her alleged hidden agenda as one example of the appellant's "unusual and inappropriate behavior" that triggered the agency's decision to order her to undergo an FFD examination. The record shows that the appellant had engaged in other inappropriate behavior involving her supervisors during the months preceding the order directing her to undergo an FFD examination. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-5 (describing the behavior that prompted the agency to order the appellant to undergo an FFD examination). Thus, the appellant's refusal to meet with her supervisor was not an isolated incident, as the appellant suggests. Instead, it was part of a pattern of inappropriate behavior that the appellant had been exhibiting for months. Given these circumstances, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not violate the ADAAA by ordering the FFD examinations. Therefore, we find that the appellant failed to prove her disability discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arredondo v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 113, 119-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-16 (2000), provides an example of direct evidence of discrimination, coupled with analysis showing how the discriminatory animus of a lower-level official involved in the initial stages of an adverse action may be attributed to an agency decision by a deciding official otherwise uninvolved in prohibited conduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As evidence of discrimination, the appellant presented the testimony of co-worker Dwight Johnson who testified that other employees told him that Fisler referred to the appellant as "his Mexican" and that it was common knowledge that Fisler made racial slurs. The appellant also submitted a notarized statement from co-worker Liefe Anderson that he saw Fisler on the dock on June 12, 1998. When Anderson asked Fisler why he was at work, Fisler replied, "No, I'm not well, I'm still sick, I'm just here for [the appellant's] arbitration case. I'm here to testify and to make sure that [the appellant] stays fired. Teach that worthless Mexican to mess with me." According to Anderson, Fisler continued, "I'm not going to let that little Mexican get over on me, I'm going to do [whatever] it takes to ensure that he remains fired." The appellant himself also testified that Fisler called him a "wetback." The agency has not attempted to rebut either the hearsay statements of Johnson or Anderson or the hearing testimony of the appellant on this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found this evidence not significant, noting that Britton, not Fisler, was the deciding official. Britton testified without contradiction that she did not work in Fort Worth at the time of the 1997 incidents, she did not know the appellant before she received the notice of proposed removal, and she did not consider his national origin in making her decision. Nonetheless, under applicable case law, the administrative judge's finding in regard to Britton's role is insufficient refutation of the appellant's proof of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of the Army</span>, 75 MSPR 115, 120 (1997) (while the proposing official was not the decision-maker in the indefinite suspension, he was part of the decision-making process). The administrative judge further noted that Fisler ended his involvement with the removal some 6 months before he allegedly made the remark on June 12, 1998. The administrative judge was incorrect in this regard because the June 16, 1998 notice of proposed removal was issued in Fisler's name, only four days after the June 12 arbitration resulted in a settlement that restored the appellant to work. More importantly, Fisler made the racial remarks on June 12, only four days prior to his proposing appellant's removal for the second time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2m, "an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice." "Direct evidence" of discrimination may be any statement made by an employer that 1) reflects directly the alleged discriminatory attitude and 2) bears directly on the contested employment decision. <span class="Italic">See Dorsey v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 78 MSPR 439, 448 (1998) (supervisor's remarks about a performance appraisal were not direct evidence of discrimination because they did not bear directly on the removal action). An appellant with direct evidence of discrimination will prevail on his discrimination claim if he establishes that one of these improper motivating factors played a part in the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See Jones,</span> 75 MSPR at 118. However, even after a finding of unlawful discrimination based on direct evidence, the agency may limit relief (e.g. avoid an award of reinstatement or back pay) by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even in the absence of proven discrimination. <span class="Italic">Bibbs v. Block,</span> 778 F.2d 1318 (8th Cir. 1985). Where the appellant presents direct evidence of discrimination, use of the burden-shifting scheme for assessing "indirect" evidence under the analysis of <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973) (to establish a claim of prohibited employment discrimination, the employee first must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; the burden of going forward then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action; and, finally, the employee must show that the agency's stated reason is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination) is inappropriate. <span class="Italic">Trans World</span> <span class="Italic">Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston,</span> 469 U.S. 111, 121, 105 S. Ct. 613, 83 L. Ed.2d 523 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fisler's use of the terms "wetback," "his Mexican," worthless Mexican," and "little Mexican," as described in the appellant's testimony, Johnson's testimony, and Anderson's statement, which the agency did not refute, constitutes preponderant evidence of a discriminatory attitude, the first requirement for establishing direct evidence of illegal discrimination. These remarks were not general in nature nor merely "'stray remarks in the workplace."' <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 75 MSPR at 120-21 (quoting Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 1804, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the second requirement for establishing direct evidence, Anderson's statement indicates that these remarks were made in the context of the arbitration hearing based on the first removal action. Although the first removal is an action separate from the removal that is the basis for this appeal, it resulted from the same alleged misconduct. Fisler was the deciding official in the first removal and the proposing official in the second removal. The fact that Britton, and not Fisler, was the deciding official in the second removal action does not insulate that action from the taint of discrimination because Britton based her decision largely on the information that Fisler provided her. Fisler proposed the second removal only four days after he made the racial remarks and after the first removal was canceled by a settlement based on the agency's technical error. Given the significant involvement of Fisler in the removal action on appeal here, the context of his racial statements being made in relation to his testimony at the appellant's arbitration hearing, and the close proximity in time between the racial remarks and the initiation of the second removal, we find that the racial remarks bear directly on the contested removal action, thereby satisfying the second element of the direct evidence requirements. Therefore, we conclude that the appellant has established his affirmative defense by direct evidence that the unlawful motive of national origin discrimination played a part in the decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The mixed motives analysis of <span class="Italic">Bibbs, supra</span>, normally would require that we now assess any agency claim that, even in the absence of this proven discrimination, it would have removed the appellant for misconduct. However, given that we already have not sustained the charge, no further analysis is necessary to determine whether to limit the agency's liability for a reinstatement and back pay remedy.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. DLA</span>, 61 MSPR 601, 608-10 (1994), determined to be discriminatory a removal motivated by a biased proposing official and approved by a deciding official who should have known of the improper motivation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that Sheipe was not the deciding official in this appeal. However, as the appellant's first-line supervisor and the proposing official in this action, Sheipe's role in the agency's decision-making process cannot be ignored. <span class="Italic">See Price Waterhouse</span>, 490 U.S. at 257, 109 S. Ct. at 1794 (sexist remarks made by partners in an accounting firm who submitted comments recommending that a female candidate be denied partnership were properly deemed evidence of a sexually discriminatory motive in denying the candidate partnership; the firm's argument that the comments were irrelevant because the partners who made them were not the sole decision-makers "ignores the critical role" their comments played in the decision-making process); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Wynne v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 320, 324-25 (1990) (discriminatory remarks allegedly made by the proposing official were relevant to consideration of the appellant's allegation of racial discrimination), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 940 F.2d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). Nonetheless, our analysis is incomplete without an examination of the proceedings before the deciding official.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency makes much of the fact that the deciding official, Dorothea Brown, is of the same race as the appellant. The agency's argument appears to be that a black person, by virtue of her race alone, can never discriminate against another black person on the basis of race. While this type of discrimination may be rather uncommon, we are not persuaded that a person's race precludes the possibility of racial discrimination against a person of the same race. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fuentes v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 4, 11 (1992). Thus, we find that Brown's race is of little probative value in deciding whether the agency discriminated against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown testified that the appellant informed her that Sheipe did not like him for racial reasons, he considered the proposed removal action to be discriminatory, and he requested reassignment to another supervisor. She further testified that she "didn't hear anything" to confirm the appellant's contention that Sheipe was out to get him. However, she acknowledged that, with regard to a prior 30-day suspension the appellant received for <span id="Page_3373"></span>sleeping on duty, she had heard allegations that Sheipe had instructed employees not to wake him up at the end of his break so that Sheipe could catch him asleep. She admitted with regard to this incident that "it could have been considered that [the appellant] was being set up."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Brown further testified that, during her deliberations concerning the proposed removal action, she received a note, later discovered to be from Rathfon, about Sheipe's racially derogatory remarks, including his statement that he intended to "burn [the appellant's] black ass," and Sheipe's practice of holding the appellant to a much stricter standard of conduct than white employees. She testified that she questioned Sheipe about the allegations in the note, and that he admitted making comments to that effect, but that she credited his explanation that the remarks were taken out of context. Aside from discussing the note with Sheipe, Brown stated that she did not investigate the allegations in the note. Brown testified that this type of talk was common "warehouse language" and she disregarded the allegations in Rathfon's note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most telling testimony, however, is that Sheipe admitted to Brown that he made racially derogatory comments, but stated that they were taken out of context. The appellant has established, however, that the agency maintained a racially hostile atmosphere in his work place, which supports a finding that Sheipe's remarks are not being taken out of context. Moreover, we cannot conceive of a context in which such remarks would be appropriate. Furthermore, we do not accept Brown's contention that these comments constituted mere "warehouse language" and were not directed towards the appellant in a racially derogatory manner. In sum, we concur with the administrative judge's determination that Brown was on notice that there was a potential problem with racial discrimination in Sheipe's warehouse, but she ignored the appellant's allegations, despite the corroboration in Rathfon's note, and despite her knowledge that Sheipe disciplined the appellant for sleeping on duty under questionable circumstances in the past. We find that Brown's knowledge of the racially derogatory remarks Sheipe made to and about the appellant, and of Sheipe's role in sustaining a racially hostile and discriminatory working environment, establishes a direct connection between Sheipe's racial discrimination against the appellant and the agency's decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">See EEOC v. Alton Packaging Corp.</span>, 901 F.2d at 924. Therefore, we find that the appellant has demonstrated that his race was a substantial factor in the agency's decision to remove him.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rios v. Rossotti</span>, 252 F.3d 375, 381-82 (5th Cir. 2001), said of a "rubber stamp" theory--denoting the infection of the promotion and ranking process by discriminatory appraisals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the information presented to the ranking panel, their decision was clearly reasonable. Indeed, Plaintiff argues that the submitted evaluation scores and lack of awards, when plugged into the ranking panel's formula, virtually compelled them to leave Plaintiff off the Best Qualified List. Plaintiff argues that employees who file EEO complaints are consistently given lower evaluations by their supervisors, evaluations which, in the hands of the ultimate decision maker, can be used as an "objective" basis for denying them future promotions. We recognize the potential for abuse inherent in this situation both as to retaliation and discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under such circumstances, the Court has employed a "rubber stamp" analysis to prevent employers from insulating themselves from the acts of subordinates. Typically, "statements by non-decision makers, or statements by decision makers unrelated to the decisional process itself [do not] suffice to satisfy the Plaintiffs burden." <span class="Italic">Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,</span> 490 U.S. 228, 277, 109 S. Ct. 1775, 104 L. Ed.2d 268 (1989) (O'Connor, J., concurring). Statements of non-decision makers become relevant, however, when the ultimate decision maker's action is merely a "rubber stamp" for the subordinate's recommendation. <span class="Italic">Russell v. Mckinney Hosp. Venture,</span> 235 F.3d 219, 226-27 (5th Cir. 2001). Thus, "[i]f the employee can demonstrate that others had influence or leverage over the official decisionmaker...it is proper to impute their discriminatory attitudes to the formal decisionmaker." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 226; <span class="Italic">see also Willis v. Marion</span> <span class="Italic">County Auditor's Office,</span> 118 F.3d 542, 547 (7th Cir. 1997) ("[T]here can be situations in which the forbidden motive of a subordinate employee can be imputed to the employer because, under the circumstances of the case, the employer simply acted as the 'cat's paw' of the subordinate."). Where an evaluation is the sole basis or comprises a substantial basis on which the decision maker acts, the evaluation may often constitute sufficient influence to fall under the "rubber stamp" exception.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 153, 160 (1994), although no discrimination was found, a supervisory official was charged with constructive knowledge of racially tinged remarks because the supervisor "was a management official who should have been aware of the slurs." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gagnon v.
