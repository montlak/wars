<p class="Body-Text">If through mitigation of removal to demotion the issue is whether there was compliance with the demotion order, the agency need only establish that in good faith it placed the appellant in a position having substantially the same duties and responsibilities as the position he would have occupied had the agency initially demoted him to that grade and position instead of removing him. This does not preclude a geographical reassignment. <span class="Italic">Butler v. USDA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-784). Back pay is calculated at the pay grade for the demoted position from the effective date of the removal. <span class="Italic">Glover v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GLOVER_ARTHUR_A_BN07528310212COMP_OPINION_AND_ORDER_234229.pdf">23 MSPR 306</a>, 308-09 (1984). [Refer to Chapter 1, "<a href="0100-2023-08-208.html#sec1-206">Disciplinary Reassignment; Unified Penalties; Reassignment Leading to Reduction in Pay</a>," and refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-100.html#sec7-98">Ineffectiveness as Supervisor; Demotion</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A summary of the decisions concerning determination of positions for employees reinstated subject to a demotion was provided by <span class="Italic">Gutkowski v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GUTKOWSKI_DAVID_L_PH_0752_01_0218_X_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246854.pdf">101 MSPR 399</a>, 405-06 &#x00B6; 15, 2006 MSPB 68 (2006), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Gutkowski v. USPS</span>, 505 F.3d 1324, 1327-28 (Fed. Cir. 2007), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency has no continuing obligation to reassign an appellant to a higher-graded position following reinstatement, consistent with <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the agency does have a continuing obligation to provide <span class="Italic">notice</span> of and priority consideration for vacant higher-graded positions for which the employee is qualified and which the agency elects to fill in those instances where the position on reinstatement is less than the highest-graded position to which he would be entitled under the Board's final order.[3] <span class="Italic">Cuda v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 195, 202 (1998); <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 658, 662 (1997). Thus, the agency here must provide the appellant notice of and priority consideration for all vacant positions which it elects to fill and for which the appellant is qualified or could become qualified, until such time as he is placed in <span id="Page_5007"></span>the next lower-graded non-supervisory position below the level of his former Level 16 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The obligation to provide notice assumes that the agency had no positions available, during the relevant time period, at the highest grade to which the appellant was entitled under the Board's Order. Of course, if the agency has failed to reinstate the appellant to the highest-graded position under the terms of the Board's order, where such position was available between the date of the first Board decision ordering the demotion and the time of reinstatement, the agency will be ordered to retroactively reassign the appellant to such position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed in <span class="Italic">Gutkowski v. USPS</span>, 505 F.3d 1324, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2007), suggesting but not directly deciding that an MSPB remedial order could not require an agency to place an appellant in violation of a collective bargaining agreement so as to adversely affect other employees and expose the agency to contract grievances.

<p class="Body-Text">If the demotion is to a specified type of job, e.g., to the position of a teacher, the Board compares position descriptions of the employee's assigned position and the position desired by the employee to determine whether the agency complied with the penalty upheld by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Novinsky v. DOD</span>, 37 MSPR 272, 275-76 (1988), the Board ordered demotion to the position of teacher. Appellant's enforcement petition sought the position of education specialist. The Board compared descriptions of the positions, found them to be substantially different, and determined that the agency properly placed the appellant into a teacher's position. As to collateral effects of the demotion, involving geographical location and bargaining unit status, the Board found nothing amiss in the agency's actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant's request for a separate maintenance allowance for his dependents is essentially unrelated to the action appealed and to our compliance orders and, therefore, the agency's denial of such request cannot constitute noncompliance. As for his request for an assignment in Spain, we note that appellant properly was reemployed in the same geographic area, Naples, Italy, to which he was assigned prior to his removal. The fact that appellant may occupy a position in a Naples-area bargaining unit, the members of which he once supervised, does not constitute a conflict of interest as summarily alleged by appellant. Bargaining unit membership or lack thereof is not personal to a particular employee but rather is incidental to whether the particular position encumbered by the employee is located within the certified bargaining unit....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gomez v. USDA</span>, 68 MSPR 202, 205-06 (1995), described the agency's obligations when a penalty is mitigated to demotion from a nonsupervisory or nonmanagerial position:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden is on the agency to submit proof of compliance with the Board's order. <span class="Italic">McDonough v. US Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 125 (1993). In determining whether an agency has complied with a Board order, the Board must determine whether an agency has placed the employee as nearly as possible in the <span class="Italic">status quo ante. See Holtgrewe v. F.D.I.C.</span>, 57 MSPR 307, 309 (1993). This principle applies not only where an action has been ordered cancelled, but also where, as here, the penalty has been mitigated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the Board's mitigation order directs the agency to place the appellant in "the next lowest grade" from the appellant's former Smokejumper, GS-6, position. Accordingly, there is no merit to the appellant's contention that he should have been demoted merely in step, and not in grade. Similarly, we find that the language of the Board's order did not obligate the agency to search beyond the appellant's former work unit for a suitable position. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hurst v. Department of the Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 277, 281-82 (1994) (agency was not required to seek placement of disabled appellant beyond a single appointing authority); <span class="Italic">Novinsky v. Department of Defense</span>, 37 MSPR 272, 276 (1988) (in complying with the Board's demotion order, the agency properly reinstated the employee to a position in the same location to which he was assigned prior to his removal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency conceded, the "next lowest graded position" would be a GS-5 position. The agency also implicitly acknowledged that there were vacant GS-5 positions at the Missoula location at the time of the Board's order, but asserted that the appellant was not qualified for any of them. The agency further stated that the offered position of Laborer, WG-2, was in the appellant's former work unit, and had the same number of guaranteed full-time pay periods as the appellant's former GS-6 position. In a later submission, the agency noted that the salary rate for the WG-2 position is only 9 cents less than that of a GS-5, Step 1 position, and that therefore the two positions are "equivalent."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's order presupposes that the appellant must be qualified for any position to which he is demoted. <span class="Italic">Hey v. US Postal Service</span>, 57 MSPR 443, 450 (1993). However, where an issue of compliance involves reassignment to a lower-graded position for which the appellant is qualified, the agency must submit documentation that it evaluated all available vacancies in terms of the appellant's abilities and experience. <span class="Italic">McDonough</span>, 60 MSPR at 126. The agency here submitted no such documentation, but merely asserted that the appellant was not qualified for any but the WG-2 position. Such conclusory statements fail to satisfy the agency's burden of showing compliance with the Board's order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the agency must identify all GS-5 positions which were vacant at the Missoula location as of June 7, 1994. For every such position for which the agency finds the appellant unqualified, it must submit explanation and documentation in support of its determination. If the appellant was qualified for a vacant GS-5 position that is not presently vacant, the agency must place the appellant in any currently vacant GS-5 position, for which he qualifies, at the Missoula site. If there is no such position available at this time, the agency must place the appellant in the highest available position for which he is qualified until such time as a GS-5 or equivalent position becomes available which the agency elects to fill. <span class="Italic">See Hawkins v. US Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 633, 640-41 (1993). The agency must provide the appellant with timely notice of any such position vacancy which the agency elects to fill. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the administrative judge determines that the appellant should have been placed in a GS-5 position, effective June 7, 1994, the agency must make the appropriate adjustments to its back pay award and submit supporting documentation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assessing how properly to demote an employee, the agency considers the qualifications required for a position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hey v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 443, 450 (1993) ("[t]he agency fully supported its assertion that the appellant was not qualified for the Transportation Requirements Analyst position based on its point-by-point evaluation of his qualifications for the duties of the position[.]") (distinguishing <span class="Italic">Michael v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 4, 5-6 (1989) (agency was in noncompliance with a mitigation decision when the agency speculatively asserted that the appellant was insufficiently trustworthy for the positions identified by the appellant during compliance proceedings)). If a remedial order is cast in general terms, e.g., if the demotion is to a position with the minimum grade reduction possible, the order presupposes that the employee is qualified for the job claimed. The agency rebuts the employee's claimed qualifications for a higher-level job by a thorough analysis of the required qualifications and the employee's credentials. <span class="Italic">Hey v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 443, 450 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Fischer v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McDonough v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 127 (1993), added points concerning demotions to the next highest position within the appellant's qualifications. First, during compliance proceedings the agency must submit documentation that it evaluated all available vacancies in terms of the appellant's abilities and experience. Second, if the agency protests that a given position was unavailable because the appellant was not qualified or could not become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission, the agency must explain how much training the appellant needed to qualify for the position and whether that training would cause an undue interruption in its mission. <span class="Italic">McDonough</span> cited <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 135, 137 n.2 (1986), concluding that a training period of up to 90 days was not an undue disruption. <span class="Italic">Vitanza v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 385, 389 &#x00B6; 8 (2003), summarized the agency's compliance obligations when a supervisor is demoted to a nonsupervisory position and reiterated that an agency need not create a position for the purpose of accommodating a disciplinary demotion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A 90-day training period allowed for retraining for an employee affected by a demotion to qualify for the highest available job within his or her qualifications was described in <span class="Italic">Russo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant disputes the agency's characterization of his qualifications, and further asserts that the agency must also consider all positions for which he could become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission. CF2, Tab 9 at 5 (<span class="Italic">citing Lucas v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 172, 179 (1994); <span class="Italic">McDonough v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 122, 126-27 (1993)). We agree with the appellant that the agency has not shown that the appellant's qualifications are limited to the maintenance craft. The agency's obligation to place the employee in a position to which he is qualified with the least reduction in grade and pay includes the obligation to consider positions for which he could become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission, e.g., a training period of 90 days or less. <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. at 179.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that it placed the appellant in the proper position, the agency must submit documentation showing that it evaluated all available vacancies in terms of the appellant's abilities and experience. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 417, 422 (1995). The evaluation period for purposes of placement begins with the date of the initial decision, if that is the first Board decision mitigating the agency's removal action, and extends through the date of the employee's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 658, 662 (1997). Here, the evaluation period spanned from August 13, 2003, when the administrative judge's initial decision was issued, to March 8, 2004, when the appellant was reinstated to the Electronic Technician position.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_5008"></span>[6]&#x2003;The administrative judge directed the agency to submit a list of all vacant positions from the date of the initial decision through the date of the agency's written notification to the appellant that he was reinstated, i.e., October 25, 2003. However, consistent with <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 662, we find that the relevant period extends to the date of the employee's reinstatement, rather than the notification of reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's conclusory affidavits do not suffice as evidence that it evaluated all available vacancies in terms of the appellant's abilities and experience. In her recommendation, the administrative judge correctly stated that, in order to prove compliance, the agency must submit a list of all vacant positions during the relevant period. The agency now asserts that it cannot provide a list of the vacant positions during that time period because it did not retain a list of those vacancies. The agency states that it "only maintains vacancy information for current vacancies and perhaps for vacancies within the past year." The appellant responds that the agency had an obligation to retain records of available positions because it was aware that he was challenging his placement into the level 9 position. We agree. Moreover, the agency has not explained its efforts, if any, to search for the vacancy records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has failed to produce relevant, material, and credible evidence showing that the appellant has been demoted to the next lowergraded nonsupervisory position for which he is qualified with the least reduction in grade and pay in compliance with the Board's final order. The agency must submit documentation showing that it evaluated all available vacancies for which the employee was qualified from August 13, 2003 to March 8, 2004. If the agency fails to do so, the administrative judge shall conduct a hearing on this issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A body of decisional law concerns mitigation of adverse actions against supervisors and managers to demotions to nonsupervisory and nonmanagerial positions. "Generally, when the Board mitigated the penalty imposed on a supervisor to a demotion, it ordered placement in a nonsupervisory position with the <span class="Italic">least</span> reduction in grade and pay." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Altieri v. DLA</span>, 50 MSPR 82, 85 (1991). In 2004 the Board altered the law, overruling some decisions, when it decided<span class="Italic"> Fischer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/KENNETH_J_FISCHER_V_DEPARTMENT_OF_THE_TREASURY_DA_0752_95_0316_X_1_248910.pdf">97 MSPR 546</a> (2004), 549-53 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-16 (2004), permitting agencies to set, with deferential Board review, the level of demotions that agencies may impose. Fischer was removed from the position of GS-11 Senior Customs Inspector based on several charges of misconduct. The AJ mitigated the removal to demotion to a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and a 90-day suspension. Additional litigation resulted in an order setting the appellant's pay at a GS-9, step 4, rate. The agency petitioned the Board for reconsideration, and on reconsideration the Board revised its policy concerning agency discretion in setting pay levels in cases involving demotions imposed through Board mitigation orders. The Board decided that agencies should be given discretion, as in other matters involving choice of penalties, when setting levels of demotions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of the pay-setting dispute before us must take into account three related principles. First, selection of the penalty for employee misconduct is "committed primarily and largely to the discretion of the agency" except where the agency's determination "appears totally unwarranted." <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 757 F.2d 1281, 1284 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Second, the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within the "tolerable limits of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). Third, when the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency's charges, the Board may mitigate the penalty to the "maximum" reasonable penalty if it finds the original penalty "too severe," so long as the agency has not indicated that it desires that a lesser penalty be imposed on fewer charges. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The Board has not always followed these fundamental principles when considering a petition for enforcement of a Board order that mitigates a penalty to a demotion. Today we correct matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's first decision on the appellant's petition for enforcement, 90 M.S.P.R. 73, relied on <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 253 (2000), for its holding that the appellant's demotion to a lower-graded position had to be accomplished with the least reduction in pay. In <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, the Board acknowledged that there were inconsistent decisions on this subject. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 6. For example, in <span class="Italic">Kopec v. Department of the Army</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 576, 579 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 349, 352 (1993), the Board held that, when complying with an order mitigating a removal to a demotion, an agency has the "discretion" to set the appellant's pay at Step 1 of the grade to which he had been demoted in the absence of any indication that this was improper under regulation or other authority. (Although <span class="Italic">Kopec</span> and <span class="Italic">Slaughter</span> involved compliance with an initial decision on an interim basis pending the outcome of an agency petition for review, for purposes of setting pay there is no difference between an agency's interim and final compliance obligations. <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 165, 169 (1994).)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, in <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 417, 422 (1995), <span class="Italic">overruled on other gds.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 662, the Board held that, to comply with an order mitigating a removal to a demotion, an agency "may not simply impose a demotion that it believes is within the bounds of reasonableness," but instead must ensure that the demotion results in the "least reduction in grade and pay." As support for this approach, the Board cited<span class="Italic"> Lucas v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 172, 178-79 &#x0026; n.5 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled by</span> <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 658 (1997), which rejected the agency's argument that the magnitude of the reduction in grade and pay should be judged by a reasonableness standard; according to <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, the more-deferential reasonableness standard applies when the Board reviews a demotion that was originally effected by the agency, but it does not apply when pay is set pursuant to a Board order mitigating a penalty to a demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 253 &#x00B6; 7, the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Kopec</span> and <span class="Italic">Slaughter</span>, under which the agency had been given discretion to set the pay in the lower-graded position as low as Step 1. Relying on <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, the Board held that, when it mitigates a penalty to a demotion "without further limitation as to pay level within a grade," the agency must set the appellant's pay at the step of the lower-graded position that results in the least reduction in pay consistent with the agency's pay-setting regulations regarding demotions for cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9. This rule, however, takes away agency discretion and contradicts <span class="Italic">Hagmeyer</span> and <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. It also verges on independent setting of the penalty at the Board level, a notion that the court expressly rejected in <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1259.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no support in law, policy, or logic for the distinction drawn in <span class="Italic">Lucas</span> between the standard for reviewing a penalty originally imposed by the agency and the standard for reviewing a pay-setting determination made pursuant to a Board-ordered demotion. The ultimate criterion for evaluating the penalty in either situation is whether the penalty exceeds the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. In mitigating an agency-imposed penalty to a demotion, the Board is concluding that the penalty originally selected by the agency is unreasonable. It does not necessarily follow, however, that, in implementing the Board-ordered demotion, anything more than the smallest-possible reduction in pay would also be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again, where, as here, the Board sustains fewer than all the charges, it may mitigate to the "maximum" reasonable penalty if it finds that the penalty originally imposed by the agency was too severe. <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260. But, the Board has no business imposing a one-size-fits-all rule that, unless the agency's pay-setting regulations require a different result, a Board-ordered demotion must always result in the smallest-possible reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">Cf. Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 303 (penalty selection should be based on "specific, individualized considerations, rather than...generalizations unrelated to the individual situation") (citations omitted). Ordering a demotion with the smallest-possible reduction in pay when not all the charges are sustained would be consistent with binding precedent in <span class="Italic">Devall</span> only if such a penalty would be the "maximum" reasonable one; if a greater reduction in pay does not exceed the maximum reasonable penalty, then the Board should not modify it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above, we hold that an agency has the discretion to choose the step of the grade to which an employee is demoted pursuant to a Board order. The Board will modify the agency's pay-setting determination only if it amounts to a penalty that exceeds the tolerable limits of reasonableness. The agency's pay-setting regulations regarding demotions for cause, if any, are but one factor to consider in this reasonableness inquiry. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 253, <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 417, <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 172, and any other decisions hold otherwise, they are hereby OVERRULED. Likewise, the Board's prior decisions in this compliance matter, 93 M.S.P.R. 505; 90 M.S.P.R. 73, are VACATED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the above-stated principles to the present case, we find the agency in compliance with the final Board order on the merits. The appellant, a law-enforcement officer stationed at the United States-Mexico border, allowed his girlfriend, a Mexican national, to enter the United States with six passengers in her automobile without passing through the designated point of entry for inspection, and later left them unattended in a cargo area. He also entered Mexico without declaring his firearm. Additionally, while in uniform and on duty, the appellant left his post to accompany his girlfriend to a meeting with the Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service (INS) Port Director to complain about the INS's having impounded her car. The appellant also used an INS computer without authorization to investigate the impoundment on his girlfriend's behalf. <span class="Italic">See</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 616-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the appellant's approximately 11 years of satisfactory, discipline-free service with the agency at the time of his removal, his misconduct "severely diminished the agency's trust in him by his use of his position to interfere with the operational decisions of another agency [the INS] as well as his own agency. [He] intentionally violated agency policy on more <span id="Page_5009"></span>than one occasion." (undisturbed factual findings of the administrative judge). The appellant's actions negatively affected the "cooperative" relationship required between the agency and the INS. Heightening the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct is his status as a law enforcement officer. <span class="Italic">See Crawford v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 234, 237 (1990) (a law enforcement officer is held to a higher standard of conduct than other employees). What the appellant did was serious, and it warrants a severe penalty.[2] <span class="Italic">Cf. Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 50 (1998) (the Board has the discretion to modify a final merits decision on a petition for enforcement).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the characterization of the appellant's misconduct in the final Board decision on the merits as "relatively minor and technical in nature" is inaccurate and inconsistent with the Board's decision to apply the severe sanction of a demotion and a 90-day suspension, incongruously implying that the appellant's actions were, indeed, serious. <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 618.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The record supports the agency's assertion in its motion that, contrary to the final Board decision on the merits, the appellant was not a supervisor, although he may have had some informal supervisory duties. In any event, if as the agency contends the appellant should not be treated as a supervisor for penalty purposes, the effect would be that an aggravating factor is absent. <span class="Italic">Cisneros v. Department of Defense</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 390, 398 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 243 F.3d 562 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's rate of basic pay when he was removed was $35,865. His rate of basic pay upon his reinstatement effective in early 1995 at the GS-9, Step 1 level was $28,345. This was a 20% reduction in pay. This reduction does not seem excessive or beyond the tolerable limits of reasonableness, even considered alongside the 90-day suspension that the Board also ordered, given the misconduct described above, and given that it would appear that, after just 3 years of satisfactory performance, the appellant was earning almost what he was earning at the time of his removal. (Our analysis is based on the 1998 General Schedule and assumes that the appellant timely received within-grade increases. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5335(a)(1). If he did not earn within-grade increases after he was reinstated, that would have been because of poor performance, not the Board's mitigation order.) Nothing in the agency's pay-setting regulations regarding demotions for cause suggests that setting the pay as low as Step 1 of the lower-graded position is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our prior decision holding that the agency should have set the appellant's pay at Step 4 amounted to fine-tuning and an inappropriate incursion into a matter committed to agency discretion. We do not find that setting the appellant's pay at GS-9, Step 1 upon reinstatement exceeded the maximum reasonable penalty for his misconduct, and the agency has not indicated that it would impose a lesser penalty for fewer than all of the charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1260. Accordingly, we find the agency in compliance with the Board's final order on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fischer</span> overruled earlier decisions. Among the decisions overruled was the lead pay-setting case involving penalties mitigated to demotions, <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 MSPR 658 (1997), itself overruling earlier law. Mr. Stabile was removed on March 11, 1995, from his position of New York commissary grocery manager, but the Board mitigated the removal to a suspension and a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position. The initial decision became final on October 24, 1995.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 76 MSPR 658, 662-65 &#x0026; n.2, involved a complex analysis that appeared to involve the following steps: (1) "the agency must submit documentation showing that it evaluated all available vacancies for which the employee was qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption to the agency's mission"; (2) "the evaluation period for purposes of position placement begins with the date of the initial decision, if that is the first Board decision mitigating the agency's removal action, and extends through the date of the employee's reinstatement"; the appellant does not have an indefinite entitlement to reassignment to a higher-graded position until he is placed in the position with the least reduction in pay under the Board's final decision; (3) the agency has "a continuing obligation to provide notice of vacant higher-graded positions for which the employee is qualified and which the agency elects to fill in those instances where the position on reinstatement is less than the highest-graded position to which he would be entitled under the Board's final order"; (4) the agency must provide the appellant priority consideration for those positions, and priority consideration "requires that the agency consider the appellant before any other candidate for a position and do so in good faith"; (5) "only if the administrative judge determines that the appellant was entitled to a higher-graded position that was not available between the date of the initial decision (or the first Board decision ordering a demotion) and the date of reinstatement [does] the agency have a continuing obligation to notify the appellant of vacancies for higher-graded positions and provide him priority consideration for those positions"; (6) "the employee [is to] be placed as nearly as possible in his previous situation, including his former facility, within the terms of the Board's order," although reassignment to a position outside the appellant's former facility is possible if the agency demonstrates that "overriding circumstances precluded assignment to a position at the employee's former facility."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To demonstrate compliance under <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, the agency was required to perform the following steps: (1) submit a list of all vacant positions at the former facility "for which the appellant qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption within the pay level of the next lowest nonmanagerial position and the position assigned to the appellant"; (2) "for those positions for which the agency found the appellant unqualified, it must submit a detailed explanation as to why the appellant was unqualified"; (3) as to the agency's claim that the wage grade positions at the former facility "were unsuitable because they were hourly wage positions and not the equivalent of a salaried position, the agency must submit supporting documentation, including a salary chart."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to relief, the Board added the following requirements in <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>. If the AJ determines that the appellant should have been placed in a higher-level position, the agency must: (1) retroactively place the appellant in such higher level position; (2) make the appropriate adjustments to its back pay award; and (3) submit supporting documentation"; and "if a higher-graded position than the one to which the employee was reinstated was available between the time of removal and the date of the Board's final decision, and the employee was qualified for the positions, back pay must be computed at the higher level." In its full glory, <span class="Italic">Stabile</span> stated, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 662-65:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the agency's burden to establish compliance with a final Board order. <span class="Italic">Gomez v. Dept. of Agriculture</span>, 68 MSPR 202, 205 (1995). Where, as here, the final Board order mitigates the removal action to a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position, the agency may not simply impose a demotion that it believes is within the bounds of reasonableness; it must place the employee in a nonmanagerial position with the least reduction in grade and pay<span class="Italic">. Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 417, 422 (1995). To show that it placed the employee in the proper position, the agency must submit documentation showing that it evaluated all available vacancies for which the employee was qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption to the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The evaluation period for purposes of position placement begins with the date of the initial decision, if that is the first Board decision mitigating the agency's removal action, and extends through the date of the employee's reinstatement. <span class="Italic">See McDonough v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 122, 126 (1993).[4] To the extent that <span class="Italic">Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR at 424, and <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 MSPR 172, 179-80 (1994), suggest an entitlement to vacancies occurring after this period, they are overruled. Accordingly, we reject the appellant's argument that he has an indefinite entitlement to reassignment to a higher-graded position until such time as he is placed in the position with the least reduction in pay under the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The period of vacancy consideration for the purposes of entitlement to immediate placement is distinct from the period of vacancy consideration for purposes of back pay. The back pay consideration period extends from the date of the agency's action through the date of the final Board decision. <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 MSPR 25, 30 (1997). Thus, if a higher-graded position than the one to which the employee was reinstated was available between the time removal and the date of the Board's final decision and the employee was qualified for the positions back pay must be computed at the higher level<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency has no continuing obligation to reassign an appellant to a higher-graded position following reinstatement, consistent with <span class="Italic">Davis</span>, the agency does have a continuing obligation to provide notice of vacant higher-graded positions for which the employee is qualified and which the agency elects to fill in those instances where the position on reinstatement is less than the highest-graded position to which he would be entitled under the Board's final order.[5] Thus, the agency here must continue to provide the appellant notice of all vacant positions which it elects to fill and for which the appellant is qualified or could become qualified, until such time as he is placed in the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position below the level of his former GS-9 position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The obligation to provide notice assumes that the agency had no positions available, during the relevant time period, at the highest grade to which the appellant was entitled under the Board's Order. Of course, if the agency has failed to reinstate the appellant to the highest-graded position under the terms of the Board's order, where such position was available between the date of the first Board decision ordering the demotion and the time of reinstatement, the agency will be ordered to retroactively reassign the appellant to such position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, to ensure that the notice is meaningful and adequately protects the appellant's rights, we hold that the agency must provide the appellant priority consideration for such positions. <span class="Italic">Cf. Jackson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration</span>, 31 MSPR 135, 136 (1986) (where there is an <span id="Page_5010"></span>absence of vacancies at the equivalent of the grade next lower to appellant's WS-2 the appellant's rights are adequately protected by affording him an opportunity for placement in the first non-supervisory vacancy, at the equivalent of WS-1 which the agency elects to fill and for which the appellant is qualified or could become qualified without undue interruption). Priority consideration, as described in <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dep. of the Interior</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0351-96-0126-X-1, slip op. 7 (Aug. 25, 1997), and <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of the Army</span>, 69 MSPR 268, 271-72 (1996), requires that the agency consider the appellant before any other candidate for a position and do so in good faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the concept of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> requires that the employee be placed as nearly as possible in his previous situation, including his former facility, within the terms of the Board's order<span class="Italic">. See Davis</span>, 67 MSPR at 422 n.* and <span class="Italic">Holtgrewe v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 57 MSPR 307, 311-13 (1993). Only if the agency demonstrates that overriding circumstances precluded assignment to a position at the employee's former facility is reassignment permissible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge correctly applied this rule. Contrary to the agency's argument that the administrative judge modified the initial decision to limit placement of the appellant to the Fort Hamilton Commissary, the administrative judge simply found that the agency failed to make the showing required to permit deviation from the general rule of placement at the employee's former facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">McDonough</span>, 60 MSPR 122, to demonstrate compliance, the agency must submit a list of all vacant positions at the Fort Hamilton commissary for which the appellant qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption, between the level of GS-8 and that of the WG-5 position to which he was assigned. For those positions for which the agency found the appellant unqualified, it must submit a detailed explanation as to why the appellant was unqualified. With respect to the agency's claim that the wage grade positions at the Fort Hamilton commissary were unsuitable because they were hourly wage positions and not the equivalent of a salaried position, the agency must submit supporting documentation, including a salary chart. Further, the relevant time period for consideration extends from the date of the initial decision through the date of reinstatement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the evidence shows that there were no vacant full-time positions at the Fort Hamilton commissary during the relevant time period for which the appellant was qualified, the agency must provide evidence of such vacancies within the commuting area of Fort Hamilton or establish that overriding circumstances support the reassignment of the appellant to the Fort Myer, Virginia commissary.[6] In reviewing the propriety of the Fort Myer reassignment, the administrative judge should consider the appellant's argument that one WL-4 position at Fort Myer, that was not on the agency's list of recruitment actions completed during the period September 19 through October 27, 1995, may have been vacant at the time of his reassignment, as well as the appellant's arguments that he may have been eligible for six positions that were on the agency's recruitment list. The agency must submit a detailed explanation as to why the appellant was unqualified for each of the positions cited by the appellant<span class="Italic">. McDonough v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR at 126-27. If the administrative judge determines that the appellant should have been placed in a higher-level position, the agency must: 1) retroactively place the appellant in such higher level position; 2) make the appropriate adjustments to its back pay award; and 3) submit supporting documentation. Only if the administrative judge determines that the appellant was entitled to a higher-graded position that was not available between the date of the initial decision (or the first Board decision ordering a demotion) and the date of reinstatement will the agency have a continuing obligation to notify the appellant of vacancies for higher-graded positions and provide him priority consideration for those positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;For example, the small size of a facility may preclude placement of an employee in his former facility. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 417, 422 n.*.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A second compliance decision in <span class="Italic">Stabile</span> emphasized the importance of strong agency justification for the geographical reassignment outside the original commuting area of a manager whose removal has been mitigated to a demotion, <span class="Italic">Stabile v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 253, 258-59 &#x00B6; 14 (2000):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency suggests, however, that it has discretion to place the appellant in other than his former facility where, in the agency's view, geographic reassignment is more beneficial to the employee. While the parties may agree to a reassignment in a particular case, the Board will only enforce actions consistent with its final decision. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 54 MSPR 566, 571 (1992). Here the Board ordered a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position. Such an order obligates the agency to place the appellant in a position at the appellant's former facility. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text">The continuing compliance proceedings in <span class="Italic">Stabile v. DOD</span>, 85 MSPR 253, 256-57 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2000), established rules concerning determination of wage rates in managerial demotions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that where the Board mitigates the removal of a supervisor to a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position, the agency must place the employee in the nonmanagerial position with the least reduction in grade and pay<span class="Italic">. Davis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 417, 422 (1995), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Stabile,</span> 76 MSPR at 662. Where the Board's order of demotion only referred to placement in a lower-graded position and did not specifically require that the demotion be accomplished with the least reduction in pay, the Board has found, in at least two cases, that the agency met its compliance obligation by placing the employee in the lowest step of the appropriate grade.[1] <span class="Italic">Kopec v. Department of the Army,</span> 63 MSPR 576, 579 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 56 MSPR 349, 352 (1993); <span class="Italic">but see Fletcher v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 63 MSPR at 168-69 (no material difference between an order to demote the employee to "the next lower-grade level nonsupervisory position," and an order to "place the appellant in a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;While both <span class="Italic">Kopec and Slaughter</span> pertained to compliance with an interim relief order rather than compliance with a final Board order, the Board in <span class="Italic">Fletcher v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture,</span> 63 MSPR 165, 168-69 (1994), indicated that the compliance obligation for placement would be the same under either type of order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon further consideration of the issue, as well as prior case law, we hold that where, as here, the Board orders the agency to demote a managerial employee to a lower-graded nonmanagerial position, without specifying that the demotion should be accomplished with the least reduction in pay, the agency must set the employee's pay at the step of the lower-graded position that results in the least reduction in pay <span class="Italic">consistent with the agency's pay-setting regulations regarding demotions for cause.</span> If the agency has no pay-setting regulations pertaining to demotions for cause, it must place the employee in the step of the lower-graded position that results in the least reduction in pay. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Kopec and Slaughter</span> suggest that the agency has discretion, apart from its own pay-setting regulations, to set the employee's pay within the appropriate grade, they are overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Giving cognizance to an agency's pay-setting regulation is consistent with the principle that the Board, in mitigating a removal to a demotion, without specifying the pay level of the demotion, is finding that if the agency had effected a proper penalty in the first instance, it would have demoted the employee rather than terminating him. Presumably, in such a case, the agency would have applied its internal regulations, if any, pertaining to pay-setting in a demotion for cause situation and therefore it is appropriate to use the agency's pay-setting regulations as a measure of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This rule is consistent with the Board's holding that an agency may not impose its own standard of reasonableness once the Board has determined that the agency's original action exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Department of Defense,</span> 64 MSPR 172, 179 n.5 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Stabile,</span> 76 MSPR at 662. The agency must still comply with the Board's standard of reasonableness. That standard, in a case in which the Board simply orders a demotion without further limitation as to pay level within a grade, is determined by reference to the agency's paysetting regulations and its compliance with those regulations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stabile</span> was extended to demotions from nonmanagement positions in <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 90 MSPR 73, 75-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4, 8 (2001), <span class="Italic">overruled on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Fischer v.

In <span class="Italic">Fischer</span>, the agency was required to provide additional information to the Board to justify the level of pay grade that the agency selected under its policy. On further consideration, the Board determined in <span class="Italic">Fischer v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 93 MSPR 505, 507 &#x00B6; 5 (2003), that an agency could not take into account, as a factor in the exercise of discretion relative to setting a pay level based on a particular pay step, charges against the appellant that the Board did not sustain in its underlying decision on the merits of the case. But then, in its 2004 reconsideration decision, in <span class="Italic">Fischer</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board offered a different approach.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Foreman v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 332, 336 (1999), qualified the <span class="Italic">Stabile</span> calculus. <span class="Italic">Status quo</span> restoration required equivalence of work status. "[i]f an employee was in full-time pay status prior to the adverse action at issue, the employee should be returned to that status." The agency was required to place the appellant into a position "for which she is qualified, or could become qualified, without undue disruption to the agency's mission." A training period of up to 90 days would not be considered an undue disruption.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 82 MSPR 332, 335 (1998). Where, as here, the Board mitigates the penalty imposed on a supervisor to a demotion to a nonsupervisory position, the agency must place the employee in a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To show that it placed the employee in the proper position, the agency must submit documentation showing that it evaluated all available vacancies for which the employee was qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption to the agency's mission; a training period of up to 90 days would not be considered an undue interruption of the agency's mission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, if the position determined by the agency to be the appropriate placement is less than the highest-graded position to which the appellant would be entitled under the Board's order, we note that the agency has a continuing obligation to provide the appellant with notice of all vacant higher-graded positions in the commuting area which it elects to fill and for which he is or could become qualified. <span class="Italic">Cuda</span>, 80 MSPR at 202., The agency must provide the appellant notice and priority consideration for such vacancies until the appellant is placed in the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position below the level of his former EAS 16 grade. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we ORDER the agency to submit to the Clerk of the Board within 20 days of the date of this order satisfactory evidence of compliance with this decision.

The agency must also make a determination of the highest-graded position among them for which the appellant qualified, or could have become qualified without undue interruption, together with evidence that the appellant has been placed in that position and, if there were any higher-graded positions vacant during the stated evaluation period, a detailed explanation as to why the appellant was unqualified for them.

Langham v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0752-01-0201-C-1 (Dec. 9, 2003). In the recommendation, the administrative judge found, as required in <span class="Italic">Davis v.

The agency explained that the list revealed no vacancies above the level of EAS-17 within the commuting distance of the appellant<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. On January 6, 2004, the appellant submitted a response stating that the agency remains in noncompliance, arguing that the agency failed to submit any explanation, much less the ordered "detailed explanation" of why "appellant is unqualified for any vacant position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's argument is unsupported. We read that requirement as applying only to higher level positions in the appellant's commuting area, and the agency has stated that the list revealed no such vacancies. Appellant has not challenged the list as being incomplete. Therefore, we accept the agency's submissions as satisfactory evidence of compliance with the Board's order <span class="Italic">to date</span>. However, to remain in compliance, the agency has "a continuing obligation to provide notice of vacant higher-graded positions for which the employee is qualified and which the agency elects to fill" and to give the appellant priority consideration<span class="Italic">. Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 658, 662 (1997). Priority consideration "requires that the agency consider the appellant before any other candidate for a position and do so in good faith." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">When the agency was directed to demote an employee to the next lowest vacant nonsupervisory position, the agency was not required to create a job to accommodate the demotion at the next lower grade level. <span class="Italic">Cisneros v.

Before <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, when agencies were directed to demote an employee to the next lower supervisory grade level, agencies were required to allow an appellant to fill a later-established position that permitted the appellant the minimum possible demotion while, during the interim, the agency was apparently required to pay the appellant at the rate he would have received had the higher-level position then been available.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...While the agency is correct that the Board will not interfere with an agency's decision to fill or vacate particular positions in a RIF, after the agency has established the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF action, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Holmes v. Department of the Army</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 612, 614-15 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 914 F.2d 271 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table), that does not resolve the issue here. Assuming without deciding that the agency was engaged in a proper reorganization, the agency has not shown that it could not place the appellant in the EAS-16 Safety Specialist position due to the RIF or that the RIF provides a basis to avoid compliance with a Board order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the agency admitted, an EAS-16 Safety Specialist position was available during the evaluation period. While the agency states that it was filled shortly thereafter, the agency does not indicate that it was the only position available for the individual who was placed in it after the evaluation period or that the individual who was placed in the position would have had priority over the appellant pursuant to a RIF retention register. Further, the agency's claim of possible liability due to a RIF challenge filed by one or more of the employees who would have been bumped by the appellant's placement, is speculative. Thus, the situation is distinguishable from that in <span class="Italic">Lester v. Department of Education</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 63 (1983), cited by the agency, where the Board found that the record demonstrated that an individual displaced by a RIF had mandatory assignment rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, we reject the agency's argument that an agency undergoing a RIF may ignore a Board order to assign an employee to a lower-graded position until after it has completed the RIF because otherwise the agency would have to give an employee who was demoted for misconduct priority over individuals about to lose their jobs through no fault of their own. The agency's argument suggests that the appellant should be subject to an additional penalty beyond that found reasonable by the Board. The Board's decision, however, requires that the appellant be treated as if he was demoted to the next available lower-graded nonsupervisory position in the first instance. No other penalty, such as the delayed placement suggested by the agency here, is appropriate. Indeed an additional penalty would be inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, which requires priority consideration for future vacancies until such time as the employee is placed in the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position below the level of his pre-removal position. <span class="Italic">Stabile</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 662-63. Thus, we find that even if the agency is conducting a RIF at the time of the Board order to demote an employee, the agency must consider the available vacancies and place the appellant in the most appropriate <span id="Page_5012"></span>vacant position. This is not to suggest that the agency may never consider the ramification of a RIF when placing an employee subject to a Board order of demotion.[5] Here, however, the agency has not established that the RIF constitutes a proper basis for delayed placement of the appellant in the vacant EAS-16 position. Accordingly, we find that the appellant should have been placed in the EAS-16 Safety Specialist position effective March 18, 2006, rather than the part-time flexible carrier position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;For example, in making its placement decision, the agency might consider that a vacant position, which would otherwise meet the requirement of next lower-graded nonsupervisory position, was slated for elimination pursuant to the RIF.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;As stated above, because the New Market, Alabama Post Office where the appellant was employed had so few employees, the administrative judge ordered the agency to consider placing the appellant in nonsupervisory positions within the general commuting area of Huntsville, Alabama. The appellant apparently does not challenge the agency's placement of her in its Huntsville, Alabama General Mail Facility, and we perceive no error under these circumstances in the administrative judge's determination of the geographic scope of the agency's compliance obligation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Smith v. US Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 566, 571 (1992).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, that the administrative judge in this case ordered the agency to "cancel the removal and substitute in its place a demotion to a non-supervisory position for which the appellant is qualified," without further specifying that the appellant must be placed in a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay, does not affect the agency's compliance responsibility as set forth above or distinguish this case from <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>. In <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, the administrative judge mitigated the employee's removal from his GS-12 supervisory position to "a demotion to a position that d[id] not have supervisory responsibilities," without further specifying that the employee must be placed in a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Lucas v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision in <span class="Italic">Sparrow</span>, 48 MSPR 246, is inconsistent with the above analysis. In <span class="Italic">Sparrow</span>, the agency removed the employee from his EAS-15 Supervisor of Mails position based on a charge of committing a dishonest act by executing a false document. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 248. The administrative judge mitigated the penalty to a 60-day suspension and a "demotion to a non-supervisory position," without further specifying the nature of the required corrective action, and the Board denied the employee's petition for review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The employee petitioned for enforcement, contending that his placement in a PS-5 Distribution Clerk position rather than an EAS position constituted noncompliance with the Board's final order. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 249. The administrative judge found that the agency had complied with the Board's final order because the serious nature of the employee's misconduct had made it a close question as to whether removal was appropriate and <span class="Italic">"the initial decision properly had allowed the agency to exercise its discretion to determine the appropriate penalty</span> and did not limit the extent of the demotion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis supplied). On the employee's petition for review, the Board affirmed the compliance initial decision as modified. The Board found that the initial decision and the Board's final order expressly provided only that the agency demote the employee to a nonsupervisory position for which he qualified, that "<span class="Italic">no specific limitation was placed on the agency's discretion in this case</span>," and that the employee's demotion to a position outside the EAS schedule, even if it reflected a substantial reduction in salary, did not constitute noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 250 (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's ultimate factual determination in <span class="Italic">Sparrow</span>, i.e., that the employee's demotion to a position outside the EAS schedule did not constitute noncompliance with the Board's order under the particular circumstances of that case, is final and is not subject to our further review. However, we find that the legal analysis in <span class="Italic">Sparrow</span> is inconsistent with our decisions discussed above that, when the Board's final order mitigates the penalty imposed on a supervisor to a demotion to a nonsupervisory position, the agency lacks the discretion to simply impose a demotion that it believes is within the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, 64 MSPR at 179 n.5; <span class="Italic">see Michael</span>, 41 MSPR at 6. Rather, as previously stated, in such a case the agency is required to place the employee in a nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, 64 MSPR at 179; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McDonough</span>, 60 MSPR at 126; <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 31 MSPR at 136-37. Thus, to the extent that the holding of <span class="Italic">Sparrow</span> is inconsistent with the holding of <span class="Italic">Lucas</span>, we overrule it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the above analysis and to avoid confusion by the parties regarding the agency's compliance obligations, an initial decision that mitigates the removal of a managerial or supervisory employee to a demotion should specify the particular nature of the position to which the employee is demoted, i.e., whether to a lower-grade managerial or supervisory position, or to a lower-grade nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory position. Absent such a specific identification in the initial decision of the particular nature of the position to which the managerial or supervisory employee is demoted, the holding of <span class="Italic">Lucas</span> applies to require the agency to place the employee in a nonmanagerial or nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay for which the employee could become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, in order to prove compliance here (i.e., that the agency placed the appellant in the nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay), the agency must submit a list of all vacant positions at the EAS-17 level and below, from the August 31, 1994 date of the initial decision through October 20, 1994, the date of the agency's PS-50 notification of personnel action documenting appellant's placement in the PS-4 position of Mail Processor. <span class="Italic">See Lucas</span>, 64 MSPR at 179; <span class="Italic">McDonough</span>, 60 MSPR at 126-27. In addition, the agency must submit a list of all vacant positions at the EAS-17 level and below for which the appellant is qualified or could become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission, from August 31, 1994, until the present. Moreover, for every vacant position for which the agency finds the appellant unqualified, it must submit an explanation of its determination. <span class="Italic">See Lucas</span>, 64 MSPR at 179-80; <span class="Italic">McDonough</span>, 60 MSPR at 126-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conclusion, the agency must show why the PS-4 position of Mail Processor in which the agency placed the appellant was the nonsupervisory position with the least reduction in grade and pay for which she could become qualified without undue interruption of the agency's mission. In the event that no vacant higher-graded position presently exists for which the appellant is qualified or could become qualified through education and training without undue interruption of the agency's mission, the agency must place her in the highest available nonsupervisory position for which she is presently qualified until such time as a higher-graded position becomes vacant that the agency elects to fill. The agency must provide the appellant timely notice of a vacancy in any such higher-graded position that the agency elects to fill....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To show that it has placed the appellant in a nonmanagerial position with the least reduction in grade and pay, the agency must submit evidence that it has evaluated all available vacancies in such positions in the commuting area during the relevant period to determine those for which the appellant was qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption, that it has placed the appellant in the highest-graded of these positions, and, as to any other higher-graded vacancy among these positions, it must provide a detailed explanation for its determination that the appellant was not qualified for, or could not become qualified for, that position. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 MSPR 417, 422, 424-25 (1995); <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 MSPR 25, 29-30 (1997). As the administrative judge noted, the relevant evaluation period for purposes of position placement runs from September 27, 1996, the date of the initial decision, to March 10, 1997, the date of the appellant's reinstatement<span class="Italic">. See Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 MSPR 658, 662 (1997). In addition, if the position determined by the agency to be the appropriate placement is less than the highest-graded position to which the appellant would be entitled under the Board's order, we note that the agency has a continuing obligation to provide the appellant with notice of all vacant higher-graded positions in the commuting area which it elects to fill and for which he is or could become qualified. The agency must provide the appellant notice and priority consideration for such vacancies until the appellant is placed in the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position below the level of his former retained grade of EAS-15<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 662-63.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant mistakenly contends, that he should be paid at the next lower nonmanagerial grade from his EAS-15 position, whatever the grade of the position that he is actually placed in, citing <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 633, 640-41 (1993)<span class="Italic">. Hawkins</span> does not support such an entitlement, as the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 MSPR at 30. However, <span class="Italic">Vaughn</span> does not address the issue of what effect, if any, the appellant's retained rate and pay in his former EAS-15 position has upon the pay he is entitled to receive, in whatever position into which he is reinstated upon his return to duty following the demotion. The U.S.P.S. Pay Manual. Consistent with this provision and pursuant to <span class="Italic">Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 76 MSPR 658, 662 (1997), an appellant whose removal is mitigated to a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position must be paid at a rate within his assigned grade representing the least reduction in pay. Thus, the appellant will be entitled to be paid at a rate which is the least reduction, calculated from his retained rate, in pay available within the grade to which he is assigned. This is so even if the actual assigned grade is lower than the one grade demotion ordered, so long as the assigned grade otherwise complies with <span class="Italic">Stabile</span> and with the Board's previous order.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a ruling subsequently reversed on appeal on a procedural point, the Board determined that the agency's implementation of a Board mitigation order directing demotion of a supervisor to "the next highest nonsupervisory craft position" may take into account the agency's obligations under a collective bargaining agreement precluding the agency from reassigning supervisory employees to the bargaining unit as full-time employees, <span class="Italic">Harvey v. USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 43, 45-47 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-8 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency reinstated the appellant to the position of Part-Time Flexible Distribution/Window Clerk, PS-05. The appellant filed a petition for enforcement in which she alleged that she should have been appointed to a full-time PS-06 position as the next highest nonsupervisory craft position for which she was qualified. In response, the agency asserted that reassigning the appellant to a full-time bargaining unit position would violate the 1994-98 collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the agency and the American Postal Workers Union and a 1990 national arbitration decision by Professor Carlton J. Snow (Snow Award). The agency contended that the Snow Award prohibited it from reassigning supervisory employees to the bargaining unit as full-time employees because doing so would deny bargaining unit employees with more seniority the opportunity to bid on the position and could deny part-time flexible employees the opportunity to be converted to full-time status. The administrative judge accepted the agency's argument that the arbitration decision prevented the appellant from being assigned to a full-time position....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the agency's burden to establish compliance with a final Board order<span class="Italic">. Stabile v. Defense Commissary Agency,</span> 76 MSPR 658, 662 (1997). Where, as here, the final Board order mitigates the removal action to a demotion to the next highest nonsupervisory craft position for which the appellant is qualified, the agency may not simply a demotion that it believes is within the bounds of reasonableness; it must place the employee in a nonsupervisory craft position with the least reduction in grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Davis v. United States Postal Service,</span> 67 MSPR 417, 422 (1995), <span class="Italic">overruled in part on other grounds, Stabile</span>, 76 MSPR at 662....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the evaluation period spanned from August 21, 1998, when the initial decision was issued, to September 21, 1998, when the appellant was reinstated. According to the agency, the following full-time vacancies were available during that period: Distribution/Window Clerk-General Expediter; Mail Processor Distribution Clerk; Flat Sorter Machine Operator; and Parcel Post Distributor, Machine. The agency states that all of these positions were at PS Level 5. The agency contends that the appellant could not be placed into any of these full-time positions without impairing the seniority rights of other clerk craft employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board treats the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement as having the weight of regulations and requires agencies to comply with them. <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States Postal Service,</span> 55 MSPR 348, 356 (1992); <span class="Italic">Hicks v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 52 MSPR 561, 564 (1992). Under Article 37.2.D.6 of the CBA, a Postal Service employee begins a new period of seniority when reinstated into the clerk craft. According to the declarations submitted by the agency, the appellant could not be assigned to any of the full-time vacancies without impairing the rights of the more senior full-time regular employees bidding on those vacancies. We find that the agency has provided sufficient evidence that it has evaluated all available vacancies for which the appellant is qualified, or could become qualified without undue interruption to the agency's mission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Over the dissent of Judge Schall, who opined that the Snow Award made good sense, since it avoided violation of the contractual seniority rights of third parties, the Federal Circuit reversed the Board in <span class="Italic">Harvey</span> because the Postal Service had not raised the matter of the Snow Award by filing an appeal from or objecting to the Board's decision directing mitigation. It was too late for the employer to raise the problem of the arbitration award in response to compliance proceedings. "The mitigation Order of the MSPB was a final action, was not appealed, and must be complied with." <span class="Italic">Harvey v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3191).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of demotions ordered by the Board in lieu of removal and agency interests in geographically reassigning the appellant, <span class="Italic">Holtgrewe v. FDIC</span>, 57 MSPR 307, 310-13 (1993), suggested that the agency may need to go beyond arguments of "work imbalances" to justify the reassignment. Chairman Levinson offered a concurring opinion that would have vested greater deference in the agency reassignment decision. Under the majority opinion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 31 MSPR 135, 136 (1986), a case where the agency was ordered "to cancel appellant's removal [and] to substitute in its place a demotion to a non-supervisory position at the next lowest grade," the Board held that "the agency should not be burdened by having to create a job for which no need exists for the purpose of accommodating a disciplinary demotion." The Board reiterated its ordered relief and added, alternatively:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In the event an equivalent position does not presently exist for which appellant is qualified or could become qualified through education and training without undue interruption of the agency's mission, the agency is ORDERED to place appellant in the highest available non-supervisory position for which he is presently qualified until such time as an equivalent position becomes vacant and which the agency elects to fill.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 137. The Board further stated in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> that "[t]he particular position to which appellant is to be assigned shall be at the considered discretion of the agency to the extent consistent with this Order." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that, where an agency is ordered to restore an employee to the position from which he was removed, it must provide the Board with a strong overriding interest for its failure to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 29 MSPR at 274. In the event of a removal mitigated to a demotion to another position, however, <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> indicates that more deference is given to the agency's discretion to determine the needs of its mission when complying with the Board's order. Nevertheless, the concept of <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> still requires that the employee be restored as nearly as possible to his previous situation, within the terms of the Board's order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 733. For this reason, the Board in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 31 MSPR at 137, while recognizing that an agency should not be burdened with creating a position for which no need exists, also protected the appellant's rights <span id="Page_5014"></span>by ordering his placement into the highest available nonsupervisory position for which he qualified until such time as a position called for by the Board's order became available. In addition, in <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, 29 MSPR at 275, the Board examined the legitimacy of the agency's reasons for reassigning the appellant rather than reassigning her replacement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon balancing the competing interests of the agency and the appellant in this case in light of the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Jackson</span> and <span class="Italic">Mann</span>, we note, initially, that the agency has not stated at what point the Nebraska office became overstaffed. Its claim that there were no vacancies for bank examiners of any grade level is not persuasive, since the appellant occupied the position of a grade 9 bank examiner until he was removed and would have been entitled to return to that position in Nebraska had he received all the relief he sought in his appeal. Moreover, the appellant performed successfully as a grade 7 employee, and it is not apparent why he would need a "clean slate" in order to do so again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note the argument in the concurring opinion, that the Board's demotion orders should not be construed to give an appellant a superior claim to any job unless the person holding it can be considered his "replacement." As a practical matter, however, distinguishing "replacement" employees from other employees could be difficult or impossible. For example, if an agency fills an appellant's former position at the same time that it fills a position identical to it, the incumbent of either position could be considered a "replacement." In addition, if the agency hires an entry level employee after removing an appellant from a higher level position, and if it later promotes another employee to the appellant's grade level, either employee could be considered a "replacement." Moreover, the fairness of a test that would, in effect, treat "replacement" employees differently than others is doubtful, particularly inasmuch as an employee may not even be aware, when he is hired, promoted, or reassigned, that he is considered a "replacement" employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that an agency can virtually always move work into an office that is overstaffed. Although such an action could result in an inefficient or otherwise undesirable arrangement, so that requiring an agency to take the action could therefore be deemed unreasonable, the agency's authority to move the work would, nevertheless, seem to preclude a finding that the agency "could not have [returned the appellant to his former location] without either creating an unnecessary job or transferring another employee who could not be considered a replacement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency has proffered a lack of grade 7 vacancies, and its desire to have the appellant return to work with a "clean slate," as the reasons for its decision to solve its asserted overstaffing problems by reassigning the appellant rather than another employee. Implicit in the initial decision mitigating the agency's action, however, is the finding that the appellant was a previously-satisfactory employee who was promoted to duties that were beyond his current capabilities, but who should have been allowed to return to duty at his previous level where he had exhibited satisfactory performance. We find that the agency has not met its burden of proving that overriding circumstances require the appellant's reassignment in order to bring about this result. <span class="Italic">See Mann</span>, 29 MSPR at 274-75.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If, in an appeal mitigating a penalty to demotion to a nonsupervisory position, there is a question as to the supervisory status of a position (desired by the appellant) that the agency classifies as supervisory but the appellant contends is nonsupervisory, position titles will not control disposition of the dispute.
