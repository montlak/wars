<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-15"><span class="space">a.</span> Deference to Agency Management</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency exercises its managerial discretion in establishing performance standards. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 95 MSPR 123, 125-26 &#x00B6; 6 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOD</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 722 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP). Under <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board defers to the agency's reasonable judgment concerning performance deadlines and numerical measurements for a professional employee. Under <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span>, the test is "whether the agency has abused its discretion in establishing the standards at issue so as to cause harm to the employee to whom the standards were applied," 14 MSPR at 330-31:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends, in addition, that the critical elements and performance standards applied by the agency failed to meet the requirements of 5 USC 4302(b)(1) by not clearly apprising her of the minimum standard of performance required. Section 4302(b)(1) requires agencies to establish performance standards "which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria related to the job in question...." When Congress adopted this requirement to remedy deficiencies in the previous system for rating employee performance, it recognized that it would benefit employees by protecting them from arbitrary labelling of their work as unacceptable.[4] In requiring the use of objective criteria in performance standards and communication of the standards to employees, Congress also intended to ensure that employees were made aware in advance of what was expected of their performance.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> discussion of the legislative history in <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPB 199, 221-225 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 4302(b)(2) and <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 244.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, appellant is entitled to challenge her performance standards as failing to meet the requirements of Section 4302(b)(1).[6] We recognize, however, that Congress intended the agency to have considerable flexibility in devising methods for assessing performance.[7] For this reason, we conclude that the scope of our review should be limited to determining whether the agency has abused its discretion in establishing the standards at issue so as to cause harm to the employee to whom the standards were applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Unacceptable performance means performance which fails to meet established performance standards in one or more critical elements. 5 USC 4301(3). Although the standards at issue here were established under a performance appraisal system approved by the Office of Personnel Management, such approval does not involve OPM review of the performance elements and standards established for each position. An approved system may have defects in its operation which result in injury to the employee<span class="Italic">. Alford v. Department of HEW</span>, 1 MSPB 305, 306 note (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong. 2d Sess. 41-42 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant contends that her performance standards violate the statute because they fail to establish specific time targets for completion of her work or numeric measures for assessing the quality of her products or the extent of her untimeliness. The language of Section 4302(b)(1) (mandating the use of objective criteria "to the maximum extent feasible") and the legislative history (<span class="Italic">see</span> note 7, <span class="Italic">supra</span>) indicate that the Board should give some deference to the agency's judgment as to whether performance standards for a GS-14 professional can feasibly incorporate specific deadlines and numeric measures. We cannot find the agency unreasonable in determining that work at appellant's level is not susceptible to the kind of mechanical, judgment-free rating which she argues is required.[8] Moreover, the record shows that appellant was not harmed by the defects she alleges since she was repeatedly informed of her specific work deficiencies which required improvement. Indeed, the timeliness of her work was evaluated under a work schedule which she herself proposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;We note that appellant participated in the development of her performance standards, but made no objection at the time that they were inadequate to inform her of what would be considered acceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The reference in <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span> to the legislative history quoted in <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPR 208, 235-36, 1 MSPB 199 (1979), justifying "some deference" to agency determinations concerning the content of measurements of performance contained in standards is interesting because the operative quotations from statements made in legislative markup sessions appear to emphasize congressional concern that standards be objective. <span class="Italic">Wells</span> explained as to the legislative history:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second pertinent Stevens amendment added to 4302(b)(1) the requirement that performance standards "permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of (objective) criteria...." Senator Stevens explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to submit an amendment to establish objective criteria in the development of performance appraisal systems. Senate Bill 2640 requires agencies to develop new appraisal systems to evaluate the performance of all employees affected by the legislation. These systems for employee evaluation will be even more significant than current applications. Personnel actions including removal have been strengthened by a streamlining of the appeals process. The basis for adverse action will be even more clearly centered on the employees' performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appraisal systems currently used in civil service have been widely criticized. The fact that practically all evaluations result in a satisfactory rating is a symptom of the problem. The current system lacks some specific standards to meet the goals of personnel evaluation required in the civil service reform bill.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The reform bill requires agencies to develop new performance appraisal systems consistent with criteria to be established by the Office of Personnel Management. Yet the bill is silent on establishing one criterion of the greatest importance. Critical elements of the position must be clearly stated as basis for performance evaluation. Critical elements should be defined as those specific skill levels, responsibilities, or individual actions which will be evaluated in performance appraisal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">My amendment requires performance appraisal systems to identify the critical elements of a position. The employee must know the specific criteria which will be used in his evaluation. This amendment clearly states that intention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A similar provision calling for performance standards that permit accurate evaluation on the basis of objective criteria had already been adopted by the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service. That provision was offered during the Committee markup of H.R. 11280 and agreed to with this explanation by Representative Clay:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. Chairman, <span class="Italic">this amendment insures that, to the extent possible, employees' performance appraisals shall be based upon objective criteria</span>. Experience with equal employment opportunity cases has demonstrated that the use of subjective criteria in promotions has been challenged in the courts on the grounds that women and minorities have been treated less fairly than white males.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In sum, <span class="Italic">the use of objective criteria in performance appraisals, consistently applied, will benefit Federal employees by providing them with protection against arbitrariness and discrimination</span>. It will also benefit management by removing a potential basis for legal attacks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Stevens and Clay amendments demonstrate the intention of Congress that employees not be subject to the streamlined procedures of 4303 on the basis of subjective performance standards established at the unreviewed discretion of agencies. The method chosen to avoid such potential for inconsistency, arbitrariness or discrimination was to require OPM review of each appraisal system for compliance with requirements of 4302, including accuracy and objective criteria requirements for performance standards. An interpretation of 4303 that allowed agencies to bypass such review, on the theory that performance standards and elements need not be established as part of a 4302 appraisal system, would seem plainly contrary to that legislative intent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Since OPM usually does not review agencies' specific performance standards (as opposed to their appraisal systems), unless the standards are challenged through contract grievance procedures, the Board is the only reviewer around to determine whether standards meet the statutory objective criteria. Notwithstanding varying interpretations of the significance of the legislators' comments in <span class="Italic">Wells</span> on Board review responsibilities, the Board implied in footnote 8 of <span class="Italic">Siegelman</span> that it will be less likely to disturb performance standards developed with the assistance of an employee who makes no objection to them at the time they are developed. As to professional employees, refer to <span class="Italic">Stubblefield v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 572, 576 (1985), and to <span class="Italic">Benavides v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 43 MSPR 468, 471-72 (1990) (both cases suggesting considerable latitude in defining standards and measurement techniques for professional employees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 296-97 (1985), summarized the scope of Board review:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee is entitled to challenge the performance standards applied to him, and the Board has authority to review those standards, though its scope of review is limited. <span class="Italic">Siegelman v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 13 MSPB 27, 14 MSPR 326 (1983). When such a challenge is made, the Board will determine whether the agency has met its burden of proving that it did not abuse its discretion in establishing the standard as it did. <span class="Italic">Callaway v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 MSPR 592 (1984). The Board has held, in this regard, that the requirement of objectivity may be met by an agency with varying degrees of specificity and objectivity in its standards, depending on the complexity, significance, and innate subjectivity of the duties measured. <span class="Italic">See Shuman v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 23 MSPR 620, 626 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of performance standards employed in a Chapter 75 case, <span class="Italic">Winlock v. DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 521, 529 &#x00B6; 20, 2009 MSPB 23 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The managers of federal agencies, not the members of the Board, have the authority to decide what agency employees must do in order to perform acceptably in their particular positions. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 13, &#x00B6; 14 (2004). Further, agencies are entitled to use their managerial discretion in establishing the performance standards by which an employee's performance is to be measured. <span class="Italic">See Thompson,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="italic">Brookins v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0432-18-0359-I-1 (NP 1/19/2023): "so long as performance standards are objective and meet the other statutory requirements, the Board will defer to the agency's managerial discretion to determine what the appellant must do to perform acceptably in his position. <span class="italic">See Lee</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 29."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Still, there must be some substantive standard, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Army,</span> 122 MSPR 372, 381-82 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-19, 2015 MSPB 31 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the errors that the agency proved, we find that the agency failed to show by substantial evidence that they rendered inadequate the appellant's contributions in the Communication and Resource Management areas. There is no evidence of how these errors figure into the appellant's contribution scores or how many and what types of errors can normally be expected of an adequately-contributing employee in the appellant's position. This is not to say that the agency was required to establish a precise numerical limit on the number of errors that the appellant was allowed to commit or reduce its contribution assessment to a mathematical formula. <span class="Italic">See Siegelman v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 326, 330-31 (1983). Nevertheless, the Board requires some sort of objective criteria by which to gauge the appellant's contribution, and the agency has presented none--either by way of specific requirements in its contribution standards or by way of comparison to other NH-0343-03 Program Analysts' contributions in these areas. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) (performance standards must, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate appraisal of performance based on objective criteria); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (comparing the appellant's performance to that of other employees in the same position). To be clear, we are not finding that the contribution standards under the CCAS are invalid. In fact, the administrative judge found that the CCAS demonstration project waives the requirement that the agency establish a performance system meeting the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302. Still, the Board requires some evidence of what the CCAS specifically requires of the appellant in order to judge her contribution. In this case, we have none. <span class="Italic">See</span> I-1, IAF, Tab 8, Subtab 4e at 1-2 (providing the appellant's goals for the CIP without indicating the specific targets for accuracy that might enable her <span id="Page_2887"></span>to achieve the stated goal of a contribution score of 61 or higher), Subtab 4g at 1 (containing the appellant's April 2013 mid-year review, which lists her contribution standards in general terms).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's having committed four errors of unexplained import during the CIP, on its face, does not support a finding that her contribution was inadequate during that period. There is no evidence that these four errors were of such gravity that a reasonable person might conclude that the appellant's contribution during the CIP was inadequate solely based on their nature. <span class="Italic">Cf. Thompson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6, 9 (the three-error limit during the appellant's 92-day performance improvement plan was reasonable because the limit concerned relatively significant errors that could have serious effects on the value of the appellant's work). For these reasons, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency failed to show by substantial evidence that the appellant's contribution during the CIP was inadequate.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0432-15-1013-I-1 (NP 2/14/2023) ("The Board will defer to managerial discretion in determining what agency employees must do to perform acceptably in their positions when, as here, the agency has shown that the performance standards, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria related to the job in question and are reasonable, realistic, attainable, and clearly stated in writing. <span class="italic">Lee v.
