<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-17"><span class="space">10.</span> Midterm Bargaining Obligation and the "Covered By" Doctrine: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">SSA</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">There has been a lot of litigation before FLRA and in the courts concerning the effect of substantive provisions of a contract on the ability to bargain midterm changes in employment conditions initiated by the agency or on the ability of a union to request midterm bargaining without a proposed or actual modification in employment conditions by the agency. The litigation arises when the union desires to negotiate a matter that the agency maintains was already negotiated and should not be addressed during the remainder of the contract term. The problem for FLRA and the courts is how to determine when a contract actually settled a matter so as to preclude negotiations. The search for a test that would impose repose without impairing necessary negotiations has been a long one. The result is the "covered-by" doctrine--a variant on the law, earlier discussed, that precludes an unfair labor practice finding (e.g., failure to bargain in good faith) when a contract authorizes the action taken by management and charged as a ULP. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 66 FLRA 186, 189 (2011) ("The 'covered by' doctrine is a defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C.</span>, 56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000). The doctrine excuses parties from bargaining on the ground that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1015 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>)."). "[T]he "covered by" doctrine is a defense that relieves a party of an obligation to bargain--the doctrine does not operate to require a party to bargain." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees, Branch 11 and USDA, APHIS, Philadelphia</span>, 57 FLRA 424, 427 (2001). Unless the case involves an issue of the alleged failure to bargain, the doctrine does not apply to an arbitrator's interpretation of a contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MCC New York and AFGE Local 3148</span>, 67 FLRA 442, 449 (2014). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-003.html#sec8-4">Defense to Statutory Violation; The Contract Permits the Agency to Act: IRS</a>" and <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU,</span> 47 FLRA 1091 (1993); refer later in this chapter to "Recent Application of the Doctrine"; refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-14-718.html#sec6-719">Reopener, Zipper Clauses</a>" and <span class="Italic">General Statement of Policy or Guidance, OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-191.html">71 FLRA 977</a> (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting) (contract provisions concerning midterm bargaining, i.e., reopener <span id="Page_1217"></span>and zipper clauses, are within the ambit of mandatory negotiations, meaning that the parties may bargain to impasse over those terms), <span class="Italic">vacated, AFGE v. FLRA</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20220128086">24 F.4th 666</a> (D.C. Cir. 2022).]</p>
<p class="noindent">A straightforward definition of the "covered by" doctrine is in a decision on exceptions to an arbitration award, <span class="Italic">HUD and AFGE Local 3956</span>, 66 FLRA 106, 107 n.4 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Authority's "covered by" doctrine, a party is not required to bargain over terms and conditions of employment that already have been resolved by bargaining. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1017-18 (1993). In particular, the doctrine is "available to a party claiming that it is not obligated to bargain because it has already bargained over the subject at issue." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Golden, Colo.</span>, 56 FLRA 9, 12 (2000). The doctrine has two prongs. <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000). Under the first prong, the Authority assesses whether the matter over which bargaining is sought is expressly contained in the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If it is not, then under the second prong, the Authority assesses whether the matter is inseparably bound up with, and thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The background and application of the doctrine is now traced.</p>
<p class="noindent">Our discussion begins by recalling the basic obligations of bargaining. The obligation to bargain over changes in working conditions was summarized, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot Jacksonville and IFPTE Local 22</span>, 63 FLRA 365, 369-70 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to implementing a change in conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees, an agency is required to provide the exclusive representative with notice of the change and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Bastrop, Tex.,</span> 55 FLRA 848, 852 (1999) (<span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop</span>). When, as here, an agency exercises a reserved management right and the substance of the decision is not itself subject to negotiation, the agency has an obligation to bargain over the procedures to implement that decision and appropriate arrangements for unit employees adversely affected by that decision, if the resulting change has more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> effect on conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 24 FLRA 403, 405-06 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an agency has an obligation to bargain, then it can satisfy that obligation by reaching agreement with the union, or by bargaining in good faith to impasse over negotiable proposals submitted by the union. <span class="Italic">Pension Benefit Guar. Corp.,</span> 59 FLRA 48, 50 (2003) (<span class="Italic">PBGC</span>) (Member Pope dissenting, in part, as to another matter) (citation omitted). This obligation to bargain is predicated on the union's submission of negotiable proposals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> An agency may refuse to bargain where it contends that the proposals submitted by the union are nonnegotiable. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of HUD</span>, 58 FLRA 33 (2002)). However, the agency acts at its peril if it then implements the proposed change in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., PBGC,</span> 59 FLRA at 50; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of HHS, S</span>SA,<span class="Italic"> Balt., Md,</span> 39 FLRA 258, 262-63 (1991). If all pending union proposals are found to be nonnegotiable, then the agency will not be found to have violated the Statute by implementing the change without bargaining over it. <span class="Italic">PBGC,</span> 59 FLRA at 50. If any pending union proposals are found to be negotiable, then the agency will be found to have violated the Statute by implementing the change without satisfying its obligation to bargain over the negotiable proposals and either reaching agreement or declaring impasse. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">FCI, Bastrop,</span> 55 FLRA at 852).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, to determine whether the agency committed a ULP by failing to bargain prior to making a change in conditions of employment, the first inquiry is whether the agency had an obligation to bargain at all under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 50-51. If it did, then the next inquiry--whether the agency satisfied its bargaining obligation--may focus on the negotiability of the union's proposals and the agency's response to those proposals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 51; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of HHS, SSA, Balt., Md,</span> 36 FLRA 655, 669 (1990) (where respondent's defense to a ULP complaint rests on its contention that a particular proposal is nonnegotiable, resolution of the negotiability dispute is necessary to determine whether a ULP has been committed).</p>
<p class="noindent">The preclusion of continued bargaining, as for example, in response to the exercise of management rights during the term of a contract, through existing contractual coverage is referred to as the "covered by" doctrine. That doctrine assumes the existence of an agreement to cover the disputed proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 57 FLRA 185, 193 (2001). It is a defense raised in a ULP case involving the failure to bargain or it occasionally arises in a negotiability case, with or without a <span class="Italic">bona fide </span>challenge to the negotiability of a proposal. The doctrine is inapplicable to interpretation of a contract by an arbitrator; the doctrine is at play when an arbitrator resolves a grievance stating a ULP violation arising from a bargaining demand. <span class="Italic">See DOD, Am. Forces Radio &#x0026; Television Broadcast Ctr. and AFGE Local 2776</span>, 59 FLRA 759, 761 (2004).</p> 
<p class="noindent">The doctrine is inapplicable if the contract contemplates further bargaining on the employment condition, AALJS, IFPTE and SSA, OHO, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-58.html">72 FLRA 302</a>, 303 (2021) (Member Abbott concurring):<a href="0100-2023-16-018.html#sec8-19"></a></p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that before changing conditions of employment, an agency must provide the union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over those aspects of the change that are within the duty to bargain.[12] The “covered by” doctrine excuses parties from an obligation to bargain on the basis that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning a disputed matter.[13] However, the Authority has declined to find a matter covered by a collective-bargaining agreement where the agreement specifically contemplates bargaining to resolve the matter.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine was summarized in an arbitration case involving a grievance protesting the agency's failure to bargain impact of a change in correctional services roster, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council of Prison Locals</span>, 64 FLRA 559, 560-61 (2010) (vacated, <span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 654 F.3d 91 (D.C. Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine is a defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Denver, Colo</span>., 60 FLRA 572, 573 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C., </span>56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000)). This doctrine excuses parties from bargaining on the ground that they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Health and Human Servs., SSA, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1015 (1993). The doctrine has two prongs. Under the first prong, if a party seeks to bargain over a matter that is expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, then the other party may properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv., Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 809, 814 (2000). The second prong states that, if a matter is not expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, but is nonetheless inseparably bound up with and, thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement, then the other party also may properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 813-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the Agency's assertion that Article 18 encompasses all aspects of the roster program, including mission critical rosters, the Arbitrator found that the mission critical roster program addresses the impact of a nationwide change in staffing patterns launched to save costs while Article 18 deals with procedures negotiated to address correctional officer vacancies that management wants to fill. The Arbitrator's findings are reasonable and supported by the record. We therefore defer to the Arbitrator's factual findings and conclude that the critical roster program is not covered by Article 18 of the parties' agreement because he correctly identified and applied the Authority's principles.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Fed. Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span>, 654 F.3d 91, 92-98 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (on remand, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council 33</span>, 67 FLRA 69 (2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), vacated <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons</span>, applying an approach to the "covered by" doctrine that emphasizes the overall purpose of a contract article rather than an attempt to distinguish procedural components of a broad substantive contract article involving the right of management to assign work. The court determined that "An agreement prescribing such 'arrangements' and 'procedures,' that is, the 'impact and implementation' of an agency's management right, therefore covers the content of the agency's decisions made under that rubric." The result was that a contract article that established procedures for scheduling and assignment of work of correctional officers could legitimately be invoked by management when it had to change staffing patterns as a result of decreased appropriations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The terms and conditions of employment for federal correctional officers are prescribed in a nationwide collective bargaining agreement (the Master Agreement), executed in 1998 by the Bureau and the American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals No. 33 (the Union). Article 18 of the Master Agreement, entitled "Hours of Work," establishes procedures for the scheduling and assignment of work for officers at each of the Bureau's facilities. Section (d) of Article 18 provides work assignments are to be determined on a quarterly basis through a bidding system. Seven weeks before the end of the quarter, each correctional institution must publish a roster listing the positions that will be available to officers in the next quarter. The officers bid for posts and shifts, and assignments are made according to seniority. The list of assignments is then sent to the warden of the institution for approval.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 18(g) provides for the assignment of "relief" officers to serve for the quarter, covering for officers who are on sick or annual leave. A relief officer might be assigned to several different posts over the course of the quarter, although "reasonable efforts will be made to keep sick and annual relief officers assigned within [the same] shift." All officers must cycle through the relief assignment before any officer is required to serve in that role again.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1218"></span>When senior managers at the Bureau learned late in 2004 the agency would not be receiving all the funding they had expected for 2005, they took steps to reduce overtime expenses, which in their view had become excessive. Wardens were relying upon regular staff to work overtime (at a higher wage) to cover absences that might have been filled by a relief officer paid his regular wage. In order to avoid this waste of newly scarce funds, the Bureau needed wardens to assign more officers to relief duty each quarter and correspondingly reduce the number of officers assigned in advance to other posts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To explain the need for this change, the Bureau's Assistant Director, John Vanyur, issued a memorandum stating the quarterly roster for each institution should include only those posts deemed "critical" to the mission of that institution. Although under the Master Agreement the warden retained the right of final approval, Vanyur cautioned that under the "mission critical" standard certain posts--such as "Medical Escort," "Front Gate Officer," and "Chapel Officer"--should not "typically" or "ordinarily" be deemed "critical." The work associated with these non-critical posts would be assigned instead as a "task" to be performed by officers serving as relief, and only as needed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One week after Vanyur sent this memorandum, the Union demanded the Bureau negotiate over how the mission critical standard would be implemented. The Bureau refused to bargain because, in its view, it had already bargained with the Union over the procedures for assigning work and the result of that bargaining, Article 18, "covered" and therefore preempted any further duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 53 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The Union then filed a formal grievance claiming the Bureau's refusal to bargain was an unfair labor practice, in violation of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7154; <span class="Italic">see </span>&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5) (the Statute). When the Bureau denied the grievance, the Union invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator concluded the mission critical standard was not covered by Article 18 because that provision "deals with procedures only" and not with the content of the rosters. In his view, Article 18(d), which prescribes the bidding system, could not possibly cover "a nationwide change in staffing patterns that affected...virtually every bargaining-unit employee." He characterized the Bureau's argument otherwise as "specious" and in bad faith. Then, after concluding the "impact" of mission critical staffing upon employees was both "reasonably foreseeable" and "greater than <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>," the arbitrator ordered the Bureau to "enter forthwith into good faith...negotiations with the Union."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau filed an exception to this award with the Authority, which held the arbitrator had correctly stated the law and correctly ruled for the Union. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons v. Council of Prison Locals, Council 33</span>, 64 F.L.R.A. 559, 560-62 (2010). That "Article 18 and the critical roster program both deal with rosters," the Authority said, is not enough to show the Article "covers" that program. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 561. Rather, it agreed with the arbitrator's understanding that Article 18 merely "lays out the procedures for filling specific positions," and does not "address[&#8197;] the impact...of eliminating certain positions." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Bureau had a duty to bargain with the Union over the implementation of the mission critical standard, the Authority said, because the rosters issued pursuant to that standard were not "the type of rosters addressed in Article 18." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Deeming the arbitrator's findings "reasonable and supported by the record," <span class="Italic">id.</span>, the Authority denied the Bureau's exception, <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 562.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also identified a "separate and independent" ground for affirming the award: To wit, the arbitrator had based his decision not only upon the Statute but also upon Article 3(d) of the Master Agreement, which the Authority said imposed upon the Bureau "an independent bargaining obligation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Because the Bureau had objected solely to the arbitrator's statutory ruling, the award could stand upon the contractual basis alone, the Authority held, even if the Bureau was correct that under the Statute the mission critical staffing standard was "covered by" Article 18. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Analysis</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau petitions for review of the Authority's decision, which "[w]e will not set aside...unless it is 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, 452 F.3d 793, 796 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (hereinafter <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A)); <span class="Italic">see </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). The Bureau argues the Authority misapplied the law when it held the Bureau's instructions on staffing were not "covered by" the Master Agreement. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 452 F.3d at 796-98.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If a collective bargaining agreement "covers" a particular subject, then the parties to that agreement "are absolved of any further duty to bargain about that matter during the term of the agreement." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 53<span class="Italic">.</span> For a subject to be deemed covered, there need not be an "exact congruence" between the matter in dispute and a provision of the agreement, so long as the agreement expressly or implicitly indicates the parties reached a negotiated agreement on the subject. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 452 F.3d at 796 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agreement between an agency and its employees' designated representative must be construed "in view of the policies embodied in the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 797. When the question is whether an agreement "covers" a matter, we must answer bearing in mind the importance of finality to collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 59 (the "covered by" doctrine ensures the parties' "stability and repose" during the term of their agreement). We will therefore reject any construction of a collective bargaining agreement that treats it as but "a starting point for constant negotiation over every agency action." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Bureau argues Article 18 covers and preempts all disputes about particular rosters issued pursuant to and in compliance with the procedures in Article 18(d). The Authority responds that a "narrow procedural provision" such as Article 18(d) cannot reflect bargaining over a "broader subject" such as, here, the "reorganization of posts." Stated differently, both parties understand Article 18 to be a procedural provision; what they disagree about is the scope of the agreement it reflects.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We believe the Bureau's position is the correct one: The procedures prescribed in Article 18 cover the substance of all decisions reached by following those procedures. Section 7106(a) gives an agency an exclusive, non-negotiable right to assign work but, under &#x00A7; 7106(b), it may bargain with the representative of its employees over the "procedures" it will use when it exercises that authority and the "appropriate arrangements" it will make for any employee "adversely affected" by a particular action. An agreement prescribing such "arrangements" and "procedures," that is, the "impact and implementation" of an agency's management right, therefore covers the content of the agency's decisions made under that rubric. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 50 ("Although an agency is not required to bargain with respect to its management rights <span class="Italic">per se</span>, it is required to bargain about the impact and implementation of those rights"). Article 18, specifically in sections (d) and (g), reflects the parties' earlier bargaining over the impact and implementation of the Bureau's statutory right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See </span>&#x00A7; 7106(b) (permitting bargaining over the "numbers, types,...or positions assigned to any...work project[&#8197;] or tour of duty"). Specifically, these provisions represent the agreement of the parties about the procedures by which a warden formulates a roster, assigns officers to posts, and designates officers for the relief shift.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority, however, held the Bureau had a mandatory duty to engage anew in impact and implementation bargaining over the mission critical standard on the ground that a roster implementing that standard is not the "type of roster[&#8197;]" covered by Article 18. 64 F.L.R.A. at 561. In support of that reading, the Authority said only that the mission critical initiative "addresses the impact of a nationwide change in staffing patterns," and does not "deal[&#8197;] with procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority has never explained why a roster drafted and issued in accordance with the procedures prescribed by Article 18 is not an Article 18 roster, nor has it responded to the Bureau's unquestionably correct observation that Article 18 itself is the product of impact and implementation bargaining under &#x00A7; 7106(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Perhaps the best evidence Article 18 covers the mission critical standard comes from the testimony of Philip Glover, the Union's lead negotiator of the Master Agreement, who described the purpose of that provision. Before the Master Agreement was executed in 1998, Glover said, "there wasn't a clear roster procedure" at federal prisons. At the prison where he had worked, for example, "six lieutenants [would] get into a room and divvy up the staff similar to a softball team being picked," and there was no "set procedure" for challenging an assignment once made. In negotiation of the Master Agreement, the Union secured from the Bureau a "complete rewrite" of Article 18 to place procedural checks upon the Bureau's authority to assign work, including the advance publication of available posts, the solicitation of bids, and a limited right to appeal an assignment. Article 18, as Glover's testimony confirms, is a compromise--"[not] exactly what [the Union] devised, but...what we ended up with in negotiations." Because the parties reached an agreement about how and when management would exercise its right to assign work, the implementation of those procedures, and the resulting impact, do not give rise to a further duty to bargain. Article 18 therefore covers and preempts challenges to all specific outcomes of the assignment process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority erred insofar as it held negotiated procedures such as those in Article 18 cannot cover decisions about substance.&#x2003;In fact that is exactly what &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute contemplates. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 50; <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>. at 61-62 (agreement permitting Marine Corps to set performance criteria barred challenge to specific criteria; agreement establishing procedures for seconding employees to other facilities barred challenge to specific transfers); <span class="Italic">see also NTEU</span>, 452 F.3d at 796-98 (agreement detailing how IRS employees accrue leave covered Union's proposed "leave-swapping" program). Here, as in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, the Authority mistakenly imposed upon the employing agency a duty to negotiate over the impact and implementation of a procedure that is itself the outcome of impact and implementation bargaining. <span class="Italic">See </span>962 F.2d<span class="Italic">. </span>at 61-62. Because that approach makes a collectively bargained agreement no more than a "starting point for constant negotiation" <span id="Page_1219"></span>rather than a guarantor of "stability and repose," <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 59, we must reject it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator caught the scent of just this problem while in pursuit of an appropriate remedy.&#x2003;Although, when considering the merits, he had found the mission critical standard had catalyzed a "nationwide change in staffing patterns," he realized that imposing "pre-mission critical" standards--the very <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy the Union had requested--"would accomplish nothing": The Bureau would retain "its Article 18(d) prerogatives" and "[l]ocal wardens would simply repost the kind of mission critical rosters they [had] been posting" since receiving the Vanyur memorandum because it was within their discretion under Article 18(d) to do so. Instead of restoring the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, the arbitrator directed the Bureau to engage in impact and implementation negotiation with the Union over "Mission Critical Posts."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The circularity of the arbitrator's reasoning about the remedy reflected the flaw underlying the rest of the award, as the Bureau argued to the Authority. With respect to the merits, the arbitrator had found the Vanyur memorandum effected a significant change in the procedures for developing rosters under Article 18(d). With respect to the remedy, however, the arbitrator concluded the mission critical standard did not change anything of substance because it did not ultimately alter the warden's ability to control the assignment of work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority, if not the arbitrator, should have seen, the Union's grievance is at bottom a complaint about the discretion Article 18 itself affords to the wardens. According to witnesses on both sides, Article 18 was negotiated in a period of better funding and more liberal hiring. Wardens had been exercising their approval authority favorably to the officers, by staffing more full-time posts than were needed and then paying overtime wages to meet the need for relief officers. Deteriorating economic conditions made these practices unsustainable, but that change does not justify disregarding an agreement made when times were better.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ignoring this inconvenient history (as had the arbitrator), the Authority simply deferred to the findings in the award and concluded the Master Agreement did not cover the mission critical standard. 64 F.L.R.A<span class="Italic">. </span>at 561. Neither in its decision nor in its brief on appeal has the Authority addressed Glover's testimony about the origins of Article 18. It has also ignored the arbitrator's belated realization that Article 18, even without the mission critical standard, permitted wardens to adopt the very rosters about which the Union had grieved. The Authority abused its discretion by approving an award so patently at odds with itself.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both the arbitrator's difficulty with the question of remedy and the Authority's silence on the subject likely stem from a glaring ambiguity in the record about the legal force of the Vanyur memorandum. The record before the Authority included the arbitrator's second-hand quotation of the Vanyur memorandum, but not the memorandum itself; it included testimony about Vanyur's subsequent letter clarifying the memorandum, but not the letter itself. Nor had any party provided an account of how the mission critical standard was implemented. The record reflected at most an effort by the Bureau's management to persuade or perhaps even to pressure wardens to adopt a particular approach for managing their budgets, not a binding policy. Because the Authority made no attempt to determine the force, if any, of the Vanyur memorandum, or to consider the intended scope of Article 18, its conclusion the Master Agreement does not cover the standard described in that document is all the more difficult to credit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Authority's contention Article 3(d) of the Master Agreement provides a "separate and independent" basis for the arbitral award. As the Authority reads it, Article 3(d) requires the Bureau to negotiate over any "national policy issuance" that affects the officers' conditions of employment. Although we doubt a contractual provision covering a management decision would not also cover a policy issuance to the same effect, we need not decide the matter here; because the arbitral award makes no distinction between the purportedly "separate" statutory and contractual grounds for the award, the Bureau correctly maintains it was not required to file a separate exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority endorsed an incoherent arbitral award and embraced an unreasonably narrow view of what the Master Agreement "covers." Because its decision is thus "incompatible with...the terms [and] the purpose" of the Statute, "we are obliged to intervene." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 53. Accordingly, we grant the petition for review, vacate the decision of the Authority, and remand this matter for the Authority to set aside the arbitral award.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA then granted the agency's exceptions and adopted as the law of the case the court's conclusion that the parties' agreement covered the critical-roster program in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council 33</span>, 67 FLRA 69 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent">Another case involving Bureau of Prisons work rosters led the D.C. Circuit to again emphasize that the covered by doctrine is considered from the perspective of the subject of a contract article, not from exact correspondence of the language of the article with a matter leading to a bargaining demand or the specific intent of parties during negotiations, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 875 F.3d 667, 669-71, 673-77 (D.C. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves the "covered-by" doctrine, which embraces a well-established principle in labor law: If a union and an employer in a collective-bargaining relationship reach an agreement on a subject during contract negotiations, neither side has a duty to bargain any further over that subject once the parties execute a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed. Bureau of Prisons v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">BOP I</span>), 654 F.3d 91, 94 (D.C. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Enloe Med. Ctr. v. NLRB</span>, 433 F.3d 834, 838-39 (D.C. Cir. 2005). "For a subject to be deemed covered, there need not be an 'exact congruence' between the matter in dispute and a provision of the agreement, so long as the agreement expressly or implicitly indicates the parties reached a negotiated agreement on the subject." <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 654 F.3d at 94-95 (citation omitted). It does not matter whether a subject was specifically discussed or contemplated during the negotiations leading to the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48, 58-59 (D.C. Cir. 1992). What matters is whether a subject is within the compass of the provisions in the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 654 F.3d at 94-95. The covered-by doctrine is analytically distinct from waiver. A waiver occurs when a party knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes its right to bargain over a subject; when a disputed subject is covered by the parties' agreement, however, the parties have exercised their rights to bargain over that subject. <span class="Italic">Enloe Med. Ctr</span>., 433 F.3d at 837-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue in this case is whether the provisions in the Master Agreement between the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman, Florida ("Agency") and the American Federation of Government Employees ("Union") cover a matter with respect to which the parties had a dispute after the Master Agreement was signed. After the parties' collective bargaining contract took effect, the Agency notified the Union that it intended to consolidate the relief rosters at the four institutions in the prison complex and assign employees from one institution to relieve employees at the other institutions. The parties bargained intermittently over the matter until the Agency finally ended bargaining. Local 506 of the Union filed a charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "Authority") claiming that the Agency had committed an unfair labor practice, in violation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ("Statute"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135 (2012), when it refused to bargain with the Union over an alleged mid-contract change to the Master Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's position before the Authority was that it had no duty to bargain because consolidated relief rosters were covered by Article 18 of the parties' Master Agreement, which established procedures for assigning employees to the sick and annual relief rosters. The Authority rejected the Agency's position, holding instead that the Master Agreement gave no indication that the parties meant to foreclose bargaining over inter-institutional assignments. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., Local 506</span>, 69 F.L.R.A. 447, 449 (2016). The agency now petitions this court for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its petition to this court, the Agency argues that the court's decision in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 654 F.3d 91 (D.C. Cir. 2011), is controlling. In <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, we held that "Article 18 covers and preempts challenges to all specific outcomes of the assignment process." 654 F.3d at 96. This holding is directly contrary to the Authority's position in this case. The Authority argues that <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> can be distinguished because, in this case, the parties' bargaining history indicates that they did not contemplate consolidated relief rosters when they negotiated the Master Agreement and, in addition, they negotiated over the issue pursuant to a Settlement Agreement executed in 2010. The Authority's arguments are unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> makes clear:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Because the parties reached an agreement about how and when management would exercise its right to assign work, the implementation of those procedures, and the resulting impact, do not give rise to a further duty to bargain. Article 18 therefore covers and preempts challenges to all specific outcomes of the assignment process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">654 F.3d at 96. The Authority's decision in this case cannot be squared with this holding. It does not matter that the parties did not specifically contemplate consolidated relief rosters when they negotiated the Master Agreement. What matters is that consolidated relief rosters are clearly within the compass of Article 18. And it does not matter that the parties negotiated for a time over the issue after the Master Agreement was executed. Nor does it matter that the Agency agreed to additional negotiations pursuant to the Settlement Agreement. The Agency entered into the Settlement Agreement voluntarily, and made no concession that Article 18 does not cover the subjects about which it agreed to negotiate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We hold, in accord with <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, that the subject of consolidated relief rosters is covered by Article 18 of the Master Agreement. We therefore grant the petition for review and reverse the decision of the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1220"></span>C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The "Covered-By" Doctrine</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue on the merits is whether the Authority misapplied the law in concluding that the subject of consolidated relief rosters was not covered by the Master Agreement and, therefore, that the Agency was obliged to bargain in good faith with the Union before implementing a new policy covering inter-institutional assignments. We reverse the decision of the Authority because it is directly at odds with this court's decision in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> and, thus, not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority concluded that the Master Agreement did not cover consolidated relief rosters for two reasons: (1) the Agency and Union did not "contemplate" such rosters when bargaining over the Master Agreement and did not "intend[&#8197;] to foreclose bargaining over inter-institutional assignments," and (2) the Settlement Agreement between the Agency and Union specifically provided for bargaining over such rosters. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 69 F.L.R.A. at 449-50. We find no merit in these conclusions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Relevance of What the Agency and Union Contemplated When They Executed Their Master Agreement </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has acknowledged that "[a]pplication of the 'covered by' doctrine is an exercise in construction; it requires the adjudicator of a dispute over the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement to determine how broadly or narrowly the agreement should be read in view of the policies embodied in the [S]tatute." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 452 F.3d at 797. It is therefore</p>
<p class="noindent-2">analogous to the inquiry we make in order to determine whether a federal statute impliedly preempts related state law; rather than focusing only upon the meaning of a particular word or words in search of congressional intent, as we might in a case of statutory interpretation, "the entire scheme of the statute must...be considered."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (alteration in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <span class="Italic">Crosby v. Nat'l Foreign Trade Council</span>, 530 U.S. 363, 373 (2000)) (contrasting "construction" and "interpretation").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Application of the covered-by doctrine does not rise or fall with reference to precise scenarios that the parties may or may not have envisioned when they executed their Master Agreement. Such an approach would rest on a simplistic and na&#x00EF;ve view of collective bargaining and of the purposes of the Statute. The Statute not only fosters good-faith bargaining between parties, it also seeks to ensure repose and stability in bargaining relationships. <span class="Italic">See IRS v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429, 440 (D.C. Cir. 1992). If the obligation to bargain could be imposed whenever a party insisted upon reopening bargaining because it did not understand the full reach of the parties' agreement when it was executed, this would wreak havoc in bargaining relationships. "The [complaining party] would almost invariably prevail in duty to bargain cases, because it almost always could find some ambiguity in the relevant contractual language. The result would be an endless duty to bargain on the part of the [parties], with a resultant evisceration of the [Statute's] policies of contractual stability and repose." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision says that "the [Agency] has failed to establish that the parties, at either the national or local level, intended to foreclose bargaining over inter-institutional assignments." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 69 F.L.R.A. at 449. This seems to suggest that the crucial question is whether a party contemplated every scenario that might arise under the terms of the Master Agreement. This makes no sense because it would effectively eviscerate the covered-by doctrine. What matters is whether a reasonable construction of the agreement indicates that the disputed subject is within the compass of the agreement. "For a subject to be deemed covered, there need not be an 'exact congruence' between the matter in dispute and a provision of the agreement, so long as the agreement expressly or implicitly indicates the parties reached a negotiated agreement on the subject." <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 654 F.3d at 94-95.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' intent may be relevant as an indicator of the scope of an agreement. This is very different, however, from determining whether the parties intended particular outcomes in the application and enforcement of their agreement. The Authority's position confuses issues of contract "interpretation" with issues of contract "construction." "Application of the 'covered by' doctrine is an exercise in construction." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 452 F.3d at 797. "'[C]onstruction' 'determines [the] legal operation' of agreement; 'interpretation' of agreement resolves any ambiguity in terms used." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (alteration in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Garden State Tanning, Inc. v. Mitchell Mfg. Group, Inc</span>., 273 F.3d 332, 335 (3d Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, construing collective bargaining agreements as covering only those outcomes the parties concretely foresaw would make extensive future bargaining inevitable, removing the parties' incentive to try to comprehensively bargain in the first place. Promotion of contractual repose is needed to avoid "discourag[ing] [parties] from engaging in the effort, as part of negotiation of their basic collective bargaining agreement, to foresee potential labor-management relations issues, and resolve those issues in as comprehensive a manner as practicable." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 59 (alterations in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">IRS and Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, 17 F.L.R.A. 731, 736 (1985)). We have therefore consistently held that whether the parties intended a particular outcome does not resolve the "covered-by" analysis. Instead, what matters is whether the policy falls within the scope of the collective bargaining agreement in light of the Statute's policy of encouraging such agreements by fostering their stability and repose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To that end, the scope of what is covered must be construed to give the parties the benefit of their bargain. And if the parties' bargain encompasses the implementation of a new policy, then the new policy is deemed covered by the agreement. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, BOP I, and National Treasury Employees Union</span> all illustrate this principle. In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, a dispute arose over whether the Marine Corps' temporary assignment ("detailing") of four employees was covered by a Master Labor Agreement ("MLA") that set forth procedures for detailing employees. 962 F.2d at 51. The Authority held that the particular detailing of those employees was not covered because the MLA "did not contain the <span class="Italic">whole 'universe' of possible conditions</span> that might pertain to the impact and implementation of employee details" and "did not 'even attempt to deal with the impact and implementation of <span class="Italic">specific individual details</span>.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 58 (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base and Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps</span>., 39 F.L.R.A. 1060, 1069 (1991)); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 52 ("[T]he Authority held that the MLA did not 'specifically address' the 'particular subject matter' of the union's bargaining request--<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the impact of the 'detail' on the four affected employees--because the Agreement did not contain provisions regarding the 'implementation of <span class="Italic">individual details</span> on the local level.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1067)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the agency's petition for review, we rejected the Authority's use of a "covered-by" standard that compelled bargaining "unless the collective bargaining agreement <span class="Italic">specifically addresses the precise matter at issue</span>," 962 F.2d at 57, because "it would have required near-supernatural prescience for the parties to have foreseen, at the time of drafting the MLA, what implementation issues would arise with respect to 'specific individual details' that had not even been conceived, much less implemented, at the time," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 59. Such an approach would undermine the Statute's goal of "promot[ing] collective bargaining and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements," as collective bargaining is encouraged if and only if the parties to such agreements can rely on "stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the parties cannot rely on those agreements applying to prospective matters not specifically foreseen but falling within the agreement's scope, they will get mired in "essentially endless bargaining" as each new specific outcome arises. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. ("[T]he Authority's counsel candidly admitted that he could think of no circumstance in which the Marine Corps could 'detail' an employee without being required to bargain."). The Authority's approach deprived the agency of "the benefit of its bargain" with the union by forcing it to "bargain anew regarding the same matters already addressed in the agreement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 60.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">BOP I</span> applied the principles enunciated in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span> to the same article of the Master Agreement that is at issue here. There, the Authority concluded that, although the Agency had not been accused of violating the Article 18(d) procedures for formulating the rosters that implemented the "mission critical standard," the standard was not covered by Article 18(d) because the article addressed only procedure, and did not "address[&#8197;] the impact...of eliminating certain positions." <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, 654 F.3d at 94 (alterations in original). We rejected that conclusion, noting that "[t]he Authority erred insofar as it held negotiated procedures such as those in Article 18 cannot cover decisions about substance. In fact that is exactly what &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute contemplates." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 96 (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 50, 61-62). Indeed, "[b]ecause the parties reached an agreement about how and when management would exercise its right to assign work, the implementation of those procedures, and the resulting impact, do not give rise to a further duty to bargain. Article 18 therefore covers and preempts challenges to all specific outcomes of the assignment process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We observed in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> that "[p]erhaps the best evidence Article 18 covers the mission critical standard" was the testimony of the union's lead negotiator that Article 18 "place[d] procedural checks upon the Bureau's authority to assign work, including the advance publication of available posts, the solicitation of bids, and a limited right to appeal an assignment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This confirmed that the argument over "how and when management would exercise its right to assign work"--which the parties resolved through the compromise language of Article 18--was the impact and implementation bargaining the union was owed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The same is true here: The Union could have negotiated for an Article 18 provision that contained a caveat that assignments changing an officer's duty station to a different institution in FCC Coleman would not comply with the article; it did not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, the collective bargaining <span id="Page_1221"></span>agreement at issue provided that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") would resolve conflicts over requests to schedule annual leave based on employee seniority. 452 F.3d at 794-95. The union proposed a new policy permitting employees to "swap" leave, but the IRS refused, contending that the existing collective bargaining agreement covered the matter. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 795. An arbitrator concluded that the bargaining agreement did not cover leave-swapping because it "only govern[ed] how the agency will initially assign annual leave" and did not "speak to the situation in which an employee chooses not to use approved leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation marks omitted). The IRS appealed to the Authority, which held that the arbitrator erred. Under the union's approach, "an employee with leave approved on the basis of his seniority could trade that leave to an employee other than the next most senior employee who had requested, but was denied, leave for that same period," which the Authority realized would circumvent the seniority system. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 797. Because the collective bargaining agreement "had established seniority as the sole criterion upon which employees would qualify for leave," the Authority deemed the proposed leave-swapping policy covered by that agreement, a conclusion this court called "eminently reasonable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 798.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the detail assignments in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span>, and the rosters formulated using the "mission critical" standard in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, the consolidated relief rosters in this case are outcomes not necessarily intended at the time when the parties negotiated their Master Agreement. Nevertheless, consolidated relief rosters are clearly within the scope of the assignment procedures covered by Article 18. Like the leave provision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, Article 18(g) is the last word on the subject it addresses (relief rosters), and cannot be circumvented merely because one of the bargaining parties did not anticipate a policy it might produce. Where the Authority erred in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, and here, was in concluding that negotiation of the procedures for assigning work does not cover all assignments devised in compliance with those procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Settlement Agreement </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's decision also relied on the 2010 Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which the parties held multiple negotiation sessions between February 3 and June 17, 2011, meeting again on December 1, 2011 and May 29, 2012, finally ending in August 2012, over a year after <span class="Italic">BOP I</span> issued. The Authority's decision states that it had previously "declined to find a matter covered by a collective-bargaining agreement where the agreement specifically contemplates bargaining to resolve the matter." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 69 F.L.R.A. at 450. The Authority erroneously relied on cases in which collective bargaining agreements required bargaining under certain circumstances, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 450 n.43 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice</span>, 68 F.L.R.A. 580, 582 (2015), to conclude that "the plain language of the parties' <span class="Italic">settlement agreement</span> satisfies this requirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). In other words, the Master Agreement covers consolidated rosters, says the Authority, because the parties agreed to negotiate further in the Settlement Agreement. This is a specious line of reasoning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's reasoning makes no sense because the Settlement Agreement did not amend the Master Agreement. Indeed, neither party even suggests this. And the Master Agreement surely did not "contemplate bargaining" over consolidated relief rosters. Therefore, the "covered-by" issue cannot be resolved by reference to the Settlement Agreement. The construction of the Master Agreement is what is at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the Authority's view of what the Settlement Agreement says is simply wrong. The Agency entered the Settlement Agreement in response to the unfair labor practice charge that had been filed by the Union. The Settlement Agreement called for further negotiations over consolidated rosters, but contained no concessions as to the scope of Article 18. Indeed, the sole remedy for the Agency's failure to pursue negotiations under the Settlement Agreement was reinstatement of the unfair labor practice complaint. That is what happened when the Agency discontinued bargaining with the Union. As a result, the "covered-by" issue still had to be resolved by reference to the Master Agreement, not the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is of little moment that the parties attempted to negotiate over the new consolidated relief rosters. As noted at the outset of this opinion, the Agency's willingness to discuss a matter with respect to which it had no duty to bargain did not negate its right to raise the covered-by doctrine in the unfair labor practice proceedings before the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine was summarized in the context of a decision reviewing exceptions to an arbitration award involving a failure to bargain allegation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 63 FLRA 616, 617-18 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "covered by" doctrine is a defense to a claim that an agency failed to provide a union with notice and an opportunity to bargain over changes in conditions of employment.[2] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Interior, Wash., D.C.,</span> 56 FLRA 45, 53 (2000). In this regard, the "covered by" doctrine excuses parties from bargaining when they have already bargained and reached agreement concerning the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md,</span> 47 FLRA 1004, 1015 (1993). The doctrine has two prongs. Under the first prong, if a party seeks to bargain over a matter that is expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, then the other party may properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Customs Service, Customs Mgmt. Ctr., Miami, Fla.,</span> 56 FLRA 809, 813-14 (2000). Under the second prong, if a matter is not expressly addressed by the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, but is nonetheless inseparably bound up with and, thus, an aspect of a subject covered by the terms of the agreement, then the other party may also properly refuse to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span> If a contract provision does not expressly encompass the subject matter sought to be bargained, the Authority will, in conjunction with prong 2, examine the parties' bargaining history and intent to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already bargained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that the arbitration involved an allegation that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) of the Statute, the burdens of proof that apply to litigation of ULPs under &#x00A7; 7118 attached. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local</span> <span class="Italic">940</span>, 52 FLRA 1429, 1438-39 (1997). In ULP litigation, "covered by" is an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin.,</span> 55 FLRA 374, 377 (1999). Under &#x00A7; 2423.32 of the Authority's Regulations, the respondent bears the burden of proving affirmative defenses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing here, the Arbitrator found, and there is no dispute, that Article 50 does not contain a commuting mileage limitation on the designation of flexiplace locations. Additionally, the Arbitrator found the bargaining history of that Article demonstrated that the Agency recognized a need for a modification of the agreement to establish such a limitation. The Arbitrator found that although the Agency proposed such modification, it later abandoned its efforts. Based on the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement and its bargaining history, we find that the matter of a commuting mileage limitation on flexiplace locations is neither expressly addressed by nor inseparably bound up with the parties' agreement. Accordingly, the Arbitrator did not err in finding that the disputed matter is not covered by the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "covered by" doctrine was stated, restated, or clarified by FLRA, depending on how and when one considers the development of the decisions, in 1993, when FLRA decided <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Office Locals, Council 220</span>, 47 FLRA 1004, 1016-19 (1993), announcing a new road for those searching for waivers of bargaining rights in response to midterm demands. Under the analysis, FLRA determines whether the matter is expressly contained in the collective bargaining agreement. FLRA will not require an exact congruence of language, but it will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute. If the provision does not expressly encompass the matter, FLRA will then determine whether the subject is inseparably bound up with and plainly an aspect of subject expressly covered by the contract. FLRA may consider the course of dealings between the parties, including bargaining history:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, a bargaining relationship involves ongoing communication between the parties, unbroken by the existence of a collective bargaining agreement. It has long been acknowledged in the private sector that a contract does not create a static period in the relationship between the employer and the employees for the term of that agreement<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Jacobs Mfg. Co.</span>, 196 F.2d 680, 684 (2d Cir. 1952) (<span class="Italic">Jacobs Mfg.</span>). As the court stated in <span class="Italic">Jacobs Mfg.</span>, the existence of a contract does not relieve an employer "of the duty to bargain as to subjects which were neither discussed nor embodied in any of the terms and conditions of the contract." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the Federal sector, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has examined the "broad and unqualified" language of section 7114 of the Statute in light of the private sector law and has determined that the "duty to bargain extends also to mid-term proposals initiated by either management or labor, provided the proposals do not conflict with the existing agreement." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295, 299 (D.C. Cir. 1987). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA</span>[, 956 F.2d 1280 (4th Cir. 1992)] (agencies have no statutory obligation to bargain over union-initiated mid-term proposals). The overriding concern of these cases is that although bargaining agreements are intended to promote stability in the bargaining relationship, employers and unions in both the private and Federal sectors should be relatively unrestricted in their ability to resolve their disputes through collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> <span class="Italic">Mfg.</span>, 196 F.2d at 684; <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d at 300-01.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, we strongly agree with the court in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span> [<span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 39 FLRA 1060 (1991), <span class="Italic">remanded</span> 962 F.2d 48 (D.C. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">on</span> <span class="Italic">remand</span>, 45 FLRA 502 (1991)] that "[i]mplicit in [the] statutory purpose is the need to provide the parties to such an agreement with stability and repose with respect to matters reduced to writing in the agreement." 962 F.2d at 59. We also agree that to require an exact congruence between a provision of a contract and a proposal offered by a union in order for an agency to have no duty to engage in mid-term bargaining on the matter, would, in many cases, effectively nullify the terms of the parties' existing agreement. Accordingly, to the <span id="Page_1222"></span>extent that any of our decisions require such congruence, they will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Engineers</span> (contract provisions involving procedures to be used in rating employees, including postponement when supervisor had less than 120 days to observe employee's performance against current requirements, did not cover proposal involving procedures to be used in rating employees who had not performed duties for 120 days due to extensive amounts of official time).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, in examining whether a matter is contained in or covered by an agreement, we must be sensitive both to the policies embodied in the Statute favoring the resolution of disputes through bargaining and to the disruption that can result from endless negotiations over the same general subject matter. Thus, the stability and repose that we seek must provide a respite from unwanted change to both parties: upon execution of an agreement, an agency should be free from a requirement to continue negotiations over terms and conditions of employment already resolved by the previous bargaining; similarly, a union should be secure in the knowledge that the agency may not rely on that agreement to unilaterally change terms and conditions that were in no manner the subject of bargaining....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With these principles in mind, we will set forth a framework for determining whether a contract provision covers a matter in dispute. Initially, we will determine whether the matter is expressly contained in the collective bargaining agreement. In this examination, we will not require an exact congruence of language, but will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Honolulu Star-Bulletin, Inc.</span>, 372 F.2d 691 (9th Cir. 1967).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the provision does not expressly encompass the matter, we will next determine whether the subject is "inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries, Inc.</span>, 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966), cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, 962 F.2d at 60. In this regard, we will determine whether the subject matter of the proposal is so commonly considered to be an aspect of the matter set forth in the provision that the negotiations are presumed to have foreclosed further bargaining over the matter, regardless of whether it is expressly articulated in the provision. If so, we will conclude that the subject matter is covered by the contract provision. For example, under this test, and on further reflection, we agree with the court in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span> that the issues raised by the unions in that case involving the reassignment of four employees and the implementation of new performance standards were inseparably bound up with provisions of the extant contracts dealing with procedures and appropriate arrangements for, respectively, the detailing of employees and the establishment of performance appraisal systems.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that in some cases it will be difficult to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is, in fact, an aspect of matters already negotiated. For example, if the parties have negotiated procedures and appropriate arrangements to be operative when management decides to detail employees, as was the case in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, it may not be self-evident that the contract provisions were intended to apply if management institutes a wholly new detail program, or decides during the term of the contract to detail employees who previously had never been subject to being detailed. To determine whether such matters are covered by an agreement, we will examine whether, based on the circumstances of the case, the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances. In this examination, we will, where possible or pertinent, examine all record evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Triangle PWC, Inc.</span>, 231 NLRB 492 (1977) (based on evidence of prior agreement and bargaining history, the Board determined that the subject of pension benefit levels was covered by the agreement). If the subject matter in dispute is only tangentially related to the provisions of the agreement and, on examination, we conclude that it was not a subject that should have been contemplated as within the intended scope of the provision, we will not find that it is covered by that provision. In such circumstances, there will be an obligation to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">A succinct statement of the analysis is in <span class="Italic">Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 47 FLRA 1249, 1252 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n making such a determination we will first look to whether the express language of the agreement provision reasonably encompasses the subject matter of the proposals. In this examination, we will not require "an exact congruence of [the] language, but will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute."...&#8197;Second, if the agreement provision does not expressly encompass the matter, we will determine whether the matter proposed for negotiations is so commonly considered an aspect of the subject matter set forth in the agreement that the subject is "'inseparably bound up with and...plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract.'"...</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Charging Party excepts to the restatement of the Authority's "covered by" test set forth in <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service El Paso. </span>Specifically, the Charging Party objects to the use of the third prong of the three-pronged test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's current "covered by" doctrine was promulgated in <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>47 FLRA at 1018-19. In <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>the Authority stated that it would resolve claims that a contract provision covers a matter in dispute by determining whether the matter is "expressly contained" in the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>47 FLRA at 1018. If the provision does not expressly encompass the matter, the Authority stated that it would next determine whether the subject is "'inseparably bound up with...a subject expressly covered by the contract.'" <span class="Italic">Id. (citing C</span> <span class="Italic">&#x0026; S Industries, Inc., </span>158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966)). The Authority further stated that it would examine all record evidence to determine whether the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances. The Authority based its doctrine on precedent developed by the National Labor Relations Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Triangle PWC, Inc</span>., 231 NLRB 492, 493 (1977) (union demand to bargain on pension levels constituted a "mid" or "in" term attempt to negotiate on a matter covered by the contract, where "[t]he subject was broached but...the [u]nion did not pursue the matter, choosing instead to pursue other contract terms"). In subsequent decisions the doctrine was described as a three-pronged test. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Denver, Colorado and Veterans Canteen Service, Denver, Colorado</span>, 52 FLRA 16, 23 (1996) <span class="Italic">(VAMC, Denver); U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 51 FLRA 1274, 1277 (1996) <span class="Italic">(Justice, INS). </span>The statement of the <span class="Italic">SSA </span>doctrine in <span class="Italic">Customs Service El Paso </span>was based on the three-pronged description and, contrary to the Charging Party's contention, was not a new test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take this opportunity to clarify that, to the extent that the <span class="Italic">SSA </span>doctrine as set forth in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, <span class="Italic">Denver, Justice, INS, and Customs Service El Paso </span>suggests that the "third" or "intent" part of the doctrine is a separate, independent element of the <span class="Italic">SSA </span>doctrine, it is not. If the agreement provision does not expressly encompass the matter, the Authority moves to the next part of the analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated. That analysis, of whether the matter sought to be bargained is in fact an aspect of matters already negotiated, will as deemed necessary consider the parties' bargaining history or intent as a requisite component of the examination of all the record evidence.[6] <span class="Italic">See SSA,</span> 47 FLRA at 1019. As examination of bargaining history and intent is clearly an aspect of the "covered by" doctrine established by private sector and Authority precedent, we reject the Charging Party's argument that such evidence cannot be considered. However, this part of the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> doctrine, the "intent" portion of the examination of the record evidence is not a separate, independent criterion. Rather, it is an integral component of that part of the "covered by" analysis to determine whether the matter sought to be bargained is inseparably bound up with and thus is plainly an aspect of a subject covered by the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Authority's consideration of the parties' bargaining history may include but not be limited to relevant evidence regarding matters discussed during negotiations, including any give-and-take and compromises reached by the parties.</p>

<p class="noindent">Despite the protection provided to the employing agency by <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the employer could waive that protection and agree with the union that it will bargain over a subject that has arguably been encompassed in an existing contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 55 FLRA 374, 377 (1999) (enforcing, through ULP litigation, letter of agreement between parties providing that matter is appropriate for midterm bargaining "unless it is clear that the matter is set forth explicitly and comprehensively in the national agreement"); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a respondent has an obligation to provide notice and bargain over the impact and implementation of a change in conditions of employment, the Authority ordinarily considers first whether the Respondent changed conditions of employment, and if so, whether those changes had more than a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> impact on employees' conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, Washington, D.C. and Michigan Airway Facilities Sector, Belleville, Michigan</span>, 44 FLRA 482, 492-93 (1992). However, we need not pursue this inquiry here because the Respondent was under no obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of any changes in conditions of employment as they are covered by Article 28 of the parties' agreement<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 493. Accordingly, we dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), the Authority established a three-pronged approach for determining whether it should sustain a respondent's assertion that it has no duty to bargain based on the terms of the existing negotiated agreement. First, the Authority looks to the express language of the provision of the agreement to determine whether it reasonably encompasses the subject in dispute, which, in this case, is the reduction of holiday and Sunday work hours<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 1018. In this connection, an exact congruence of the language is not required<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Thus, the requisite similarity will be found if a "reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the [subject] in dispute<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. If the provision does not expressly encompass the subject in dispute, the second prong will be applied. In this regard, the Authority determines whether the subject in dispute is "'inseparably bound up with and...thus [is] plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; S Industries</span>, 158 NLRB 454, 459 (1966). In other words, the Authority determines if the subject in dispute is "so commonly considered to be an aspect of" a subject set forth in a provision of a contract that negotiations over that subject are presumed foreclosed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Third, in cases where it is difficult to determine whether the subject matter sought to be bargained is an aspect of matters already negotiated, the Authority will examine all of the record evidence, including the parties' bargaining history, and decide whether the parties reasonably should have contemplated that the agreement would foreclose further bargaining in such instances<span class="Italic">. SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analytical approach in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, we conclude that the Respondent had no obligation to provide notice to, or engage in impact and implementation bargaining with, the Charging Party before implementing the directive contained in January 19, 1993 memorandum. In this connection, we find that the disputed subject of the memorandum--reducing holiday and Sunday Border Patrol work hours--is inseparably bound up with the provisions of Article 28 of the parties' agreement, which concern Border Patrol employees' tours of duty. We note that the parties' agreement does not define "tours of duty." However, our examination of Article 28 persuades us that the parties intended the phrase to encompass the days and hours of employees' scheduled workweeks. For example, section A, which permits the Respondent to vary tours of duty, also provides that changes in employees' "scheduled hours of duty" should be kept to a minimum; this section appears to view "tour of duty" and "scheduled hours of duty" synonymously. In addition, section C provides for a minimum of 8 hours between changes in shifts; section E addresses consecutive days off; section F defines for certain purposes "the administrative workweek"; section G addresses the scheduling of breaks during workdays; and sections H and I establish procedures for notice of and trading of shifts. All of these sections evidence the parties' attention to daily and weekly work schedules. Further, the conclusion that Article 28 encompasses the days and hours of an employee's work schedule is consistent with the meaning of the phrase "tour of duty" set forth in Government-wide regulations<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 610.102(h) ("Tour of duty means the hours of a day (a daily tour of duty) and the days of an administrative workweek (a weekly tour of duty) that constitute an employee's regularly scheduled administrative workweek.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Changes in holiday and Sunday work hours are plainly subsumed in, and therefore are an aspect of, the daily and weekly work schedule provisions in Article 28. Accordingly, under the second prong of the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> test, the subject of the Respondent's memorandum is covered by Article 28. Therefore, because the parties have already bargained with respect to impact and implementation matters, the Respondent did not incur any additional bargaining obligation when it issued the January 19, 1993 memorandum. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Sacramento</span> <span class="Italic">Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, California</span>, 47 FLRA 1161, 1165 (1993); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 48 FLRA 102, 106-07 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Respondent's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Navy Resale</span> and the Charging Party's reliance on the dissent in <span class="Italic">Navy Resale</span>. However, because <span class="Italic">Navy Resale</span> is distinguishable from the instant case for two reasons, both parties' reliance is misplaced. First, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Navy Resale</span> was based on an application of the third prong of the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> test because the Authority was not able to determine whether the subject sought to be bargained was an aspect of a subject already negotiated without looking to record evidence of the parties' bargaining history. <span class="Italic">Navy</span> <span class="Italic">Resale</span>, 49 FLRA at 1002, 1015-18. By contrast, we do not examine the parties' bargaining history here because, under the second prong, we have found that the disputed subject--the reduction of Sunday and holiday work hours--is an aspect of a subject already negotiated in Article 28. Second, the central issue in <span class="Italic">Navy Resale</span> concerned a reduction in the total number of weekly work hours, and the majority and dissent disagreed over whether the reduction in work hours concerned employees' tours of duty. This case, on the other hand, concerns the scheduling of weekly work hours, a subject that plainly is an aspect of employees' tours of duty.</p>
