<p class="Body-Text">The counterpart of the remedy ordered or promised is the enforcement petition seeking what was owed but not delivered. A party files an enforcement petition to secure compliance with a Board order or a settlement that has been accepted into the record for purposes of enforcement. The Board is specifically granted the authority to order any federal agency to comply with any decision or order within its jurisdiction, and it may enforce compliance with any order. 5 USC 1204(a)(2). <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 593, 594 (1985) (citing to Reform Act legislative history: S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 29, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723,2751); <span class="Italic">see Ziegler v. MSPB</span>, 296 Fed. Appx. 930, 932-33 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (Board's enforcement authority under 5 USC 1204(a)(2) is limited to orders in matters within the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Hunt v. OPM</span>, 114 MSPR 590, 592-93 &#x00B6; 6, 2010 MSPB 173 (2010) (OPM reconsideration decision rescinded: "The Board derives its enforcement authority from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2), which authorizes the Board to order any federal agency or employee to comply with the Board's decisions and orders issued under its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.181(a). The Board has no authority to order enforcement if it lacks jurisdiction over the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">See Haskins v. Department of the Navy</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2007)."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, DC-3443-13-0093-I-1 (NP 8/6/2013) ("However, she does not explain how the administrative judge erred with regard to finding that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the enforcement of EEO decisions or provide any evidence or argument showing that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal."); <span class="Italic">Metcalf v. OPM</span>, 73 MSPR 215, 220 (1997) ("Where the Board is without jurisdiction over the merits of an appeal, it has no authority to adjudicate a petition for enforcement."). Although the Board's enforcement authority is broad, the Board must first have jurisdiction over the employee and the appeal. Jurisdictional issues may be raised at any time, including during enforcement proceedings, <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 74 MSPR 244, 249 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that the Board's March 25, 1996 Opinion and Order that mitigated the appellant's removal to a 45-day suspension is a final decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701(e), 1204(a); <span class="Italic">Welber v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 98, 101 (1994). It is also true, however, that the Board only has that jurisdiction specifically prescribed by statute or regulation<span class="Italic">. See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Sobol v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 68 MSPR 611, 613 (1995). Further, the Board is only authorized to order and enforce compliance of orders or decisions that were issued under its jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1204(a)(2); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181(a). "Board jurisdiction is always at issue and may be raised by either party or <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by an administrative judge or the Board any time during a Board proceeding." <span class="Italic">Gussie v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 69 MSPR 654, 658-59 (1996). We <span id="Page_4967"></span>therefore find that the administrative judge properly raised the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over the appellant's petition for enforcement <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> during the compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Body-Text">Previously, only parties could petition for enforcement or compliance. 5 USC 1204(e)(2)(B), a provision of the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act, directs the Board to establish regulations allowing any employee aggrieved by the failure of any other employee to comply with a Board order to petition the Board for enforcement. This statute has been implemented at 5 CFR 1201.182(c) (2022). Throughout this section the terms "compliance" and "enforcement" are used interchangeably. [The Board's regulations on enforcement are reprinted later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-136.html#sec16-134">Enforcement Procedure</a>"; refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-077.html#sec5-77">Interim Relief</a>" for its relation to the PFR process; refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-065.html#sec10-66">Impact of Error</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-17-103.html#sec10-104">Substantive Rights, Harmful Error</a>" for complications in RIF appeals resulting from attempts to reconstruct RIFs during the underlying appeals or during enforcement proceedings.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">"The Board's jurisdiction in seeking enforcement of its orders is broad and not limited to its statutory jurisdiction governing appeals." <span class="Italic">Souders v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 353, 355 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Kerr v. Nat'l Endowment for Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). The enforcement authority of the Board is broadly stated: the Board will enforce employee rights derived from agency rules, regulations, procedures, and negotiated collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">Kellus v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 269, 270 n.3 (1985); <span class="Italic">Frazier v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 584, 585 (1985) (noting also the authority of the Board to adjudicate petitions for enforcement filed by preference eligible USPS employees whose appeals are within the Board's jurisdiction; to the extent that Postal Service employees are not covered by the Back Pay Act, compliance with an MSPB back pay award may be obtained pursuant to a Board order directly or indirectly incorporating a grievance settlement relying on a provision of the USPS negotiated agreement and internal regulations directing back pay in successful challenges to personnel actions); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 79 MSPR 364, 367 (1998) (enforcement responsibilities extend to actions involving mitigated penalties); <span class="Italic">Sink v.

FDIC</span>, 62 MSPR 14, 17 (1994) ("The Board will use its far-reaching enforcement power to ensure that employees are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> upon the reversal of agency actions."). Enforcement authority extends to retirement adjudications involving OPM. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Watson v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 308, 313 &#x00B6; 10 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement authority derives from the Board's own decisional processes. <span class="Italic">Guy v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 37 MSPR 230, 233 (1988), explained the fundamental principle that the Board orders compliance with its final decisions; if there is no final decision (on the merits or accepting a settlement), there is no enforcement authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's authority to issue enforcement orders is derived from 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a)(1) and (a)(2) [now 5 USC 1204], which authorize the Board to order an agency to comply with a Board decision. The Board may not, however, enforce a compliance order against a party in a matter that has not been heard on the merits....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fletcher v. OPM</span>, 41 MSPR 445, 447 n.2 (1989) (addressing reopened decision: "OPM need only comply with a final order of the Board"); <span class="Italic">Yuni v. SBA</span>, 38 MSPR 574, 576 (1988) (unless there is a recorded settlement, the Board may not enforce a compliance order in a matter that it has not heard on the merits).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The authority to order compliance is limited to the actions directed by the Board's order. A matter, e.g., retirement contributions adjustments, unrelated to the relief directed by the Board, is not within the Board's authority through an enforcement petition, <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Army,</span> DE-0752-09-0415-C-1 (NP 1/30/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts on review that after the administrative judge verified that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had received the appellant's check to cover his post-1956 military service, and issued the Compliance Initial Decision, OPM again notified him that its records did not include proof of his full deposit for his post-1956 military service and that his retirement would be reduced accordingly unless he provided documentation showing proof of payment. The appellant is frustrated that, based on OPM's letter to him, OPM apparently lost his proof of payment for a second time. The appellant also asserts that the interest penalty on his delayed military deposit is due to government error as a result of being incorrectly told that his post-1956 military deposit had been paid in full. He also asserts that he has not been able to pay the interest because three separate agencies have not been able to agree on how much interest he owes for the delayed deposit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, however, compliance issues before the Board are limited to the following specific language as set forth in the Board order. <span class="Italic">See Heath v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2009). In this case, the Board's order states the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We ORDER the agency to cancel the appellant's retirement and to reinstate him to the GS-13 grade level, Supervisory Security Specialist position at the United States Army Intelligence Center, Fort Huachuca, Arizona, effective January 31, 2009....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We also ORDER the agency to pay the appellant the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits under the Office of Personnel Management's regulations, no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Salazar v. Department of the Army</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 296, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14 (2010). Thus, the only issues the appellant can properly raise in a petition for enforcement are whether he was reinstated to his former GS-13 Supervisory Security Specialist position and whether the agency paid him the correct amount of back pay with interest and other benefits he is entitled to under OPM regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The way OPM and the appellant's former employing agencies have all handled the process of calculating the interest on the payment of his post-1956 military service deposit and their inability to notify him of the correct amount of interest owed is delaying the appellant from paying the amount so that he can retire. However, the Board's prior decision did not order the Department of the Army to calculate the remaining amount due and to notify the appellant of the correct amount because the only issue before the Board in the underlying appeal was his claim of an involuntary retirement. The Board resolved that allegation by finding that his retirement was involuntary based on misinformation and ordering the agency to reinstate him with back pay. Because the appellant's claims concerning the funds he must repay in order to retire involve a new retirement application process with his agency and OPM, such claims are not properly before the Board in this compliance proceeding. Thus, the administrative judge correctly found that the compliance concerns the appellant has raised are not within the scope of the Board's order. <span class="Italic">See Heath</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. Accordingly, the appellant has shown no error in the administrative judge's denial of his petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not ordinarily have jurisdiction to require a federal agency to comply with a court order issued independent of a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dept. of State</span>, 12 MSPR 555, 559 (1982). Although, under <span class="Italic">Crippen v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 522, 524 (1987), the Board has described its enforcement authority as far-reaching, with the purpose of ensuring the return of an employee to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, enforcement authority in one action, demotion, may not be used to secure relief for a constructive suspension that was not appealed. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1256700.html">458 F.3d 1359</a> (Fed. Cir. 2006) (requiring the Board to award back pay to an employee when the effects of a discriminatory constructive suspension extended through a removal that was not separately appealed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board cannot award compensatory damages in enforcement proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-10-1011-X-1 (NP 5/20/2013) ("On March 29, 2013, the appellant requested $10,000 in compensatory and punitive damages to compensate for the agency's delay in fully complying with the Initial Decision. The Board does not have authority to award punitive damages. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 523, &#x00B6; 3 (2002). Nor does the Board have authority to award compensatory damages in compliance cases. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Woodson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 289, &#x00B6; 8 (2003). Accordingly, we deny the appellant's request."); <span class="Italic">Woodson v. USDA</span>, 94 MSPR 289, 292-93 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (Board cannot order payment by agency of a particular sum, in the form of liquidated damages, unrelated to calculation of the amounts due in compliance proceedings; nor may Board award interim counsel fees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement proceedings are usually initiated by appellants who feel that they have not received their due. The Board suggested, in a cryptic passage in <span class="Italic">Samuel v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 561, 563 (1991), that an enforcement proceeding is the proper forum for agencies needing a determination about their remedial obligations to an appellant. In <span class="Italic">Samuel</span>, the agency contended through a PFR that its back pay obligation to an appellant was less than eight hours per day because of the appellant's medical condition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arguments set forth by the agency are not properly brought before the Board in a petition for review of the initial decision. Rather, issues as to the precise nature of the relief to be accorded to the appellant are appropriate for disposition upon the filing of a petition for enforcement with the regional office pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.182. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ciulla v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 111, 114 (1989); <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Department of Interior</span>, 26 MSPR 250, 253 (1985)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The enforcement process is not designed for relitigation of the Board's original remedial order, <span class="Italic">Ellis v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-13-0283-C-1 (NP 8/10/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's claim that the agency improperly reassigned him, the Board's final decision in the underlying appeal explicitly authorized the agency to impose a geographic reassignment within the local commuting area. <span class="Italic">Ellis</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 17 n.6; <span class="Italic">see id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 16. The appellant did not seek judicial review of that decision, and he is precluded from challenging the correctness of the Board's final order in the context of this compliance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Ferry v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 63, 65 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 846 F.2d 78 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4968"></span>Enforcement proceedings are initiated as a result of allegations of noncompliance by agencies with two types of final Board decisions: first, the decision that results from adjudication of an appeal on the merits (or collateral aspects of that case, e.g., counsel fees or awards of damages or other relief); second, the decision that results from a settlement agreement that has been accepted by a Board decision for purposes of enforcement. For the purposes of analysis, this chapter treats separately enforcement proceedings involving final Board decisions resolving appeals on the merits and final Board decisions accepting settlement agreements. But in the discussion of each segment of the process, references are made to cases that evolved from both types of Board decisions.</p>
