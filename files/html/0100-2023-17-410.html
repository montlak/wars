<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-408"><span class="space">a.</span> Substantial Innocence</h5>
<p class="noindent">The "substantially innocent" fee category was developed in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188 and Dept. of Air Force, Seymour Johnson AFB</span>, 54 FLRA 1401, 1406-10 (1998), involving an award that resolved all disciplinary charges in the grievant's favor but denied fees to the union. The case was remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">An Award of Attorney Fees is Warranted Under the Back Pay Act</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Legal Framework for Attorney Fees Cases</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, an award of attorney fees by an arbitrator must be in accordance with the standards established under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g). Section 7701(g)(1), which applies in this case, requires, among other things, that an award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When exceptions concern standards established under section 7701(g), the Authority looks to the decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for guidance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland, Pennsylvania and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 160 n.5 (1995) (<span class="Italic">DDRE</span>). In <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 MSPR 420 (1980) (<span class="Italic">Allen</span>), the MSPB listed five broad categories of cases in which an award of fees would be warranted in the interest of justice: (1) involving prohibited personnel practices; (2) where agency actions are clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or where the employee is substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) when agency actions are taken in bad faith to harass or exert improper pressure on an employee; (4) when gross procedural error by an agency prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; or (5) where the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. The Authority applies the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria in resolving exceptions to an arbitrator's determination under the interest-of-justice standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12 and U.S. Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1250-51 (1990). An award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria are met. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 162.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Circuit has relied on the legislative history to section 7701 to inform its judgments on when fees are warranted in the interest of justice.&#x2003;The "substantial innocence" criteria of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> refers to the "result of the case" in the MSPB or in an arbitration award, while the "knew or should have known" criterion of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 refers to the evidence and information available to the Agency prior to the MSPB or arbitration hearing. <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Boese</span>); <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457. In <span class="Italic">Wise v. MSPB</span>, 780 F.2d 997, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Wise</span>), the court found that the legislative history of the interest-of-justice standard indicated that "Congress was troubled with the inherent injustice of dragging an innocent individual through expensive and time-consuming legal proceedings." Thus, the purpose of the substantially-innocent criterion is not to punish agency misconduct, but to minimize the burden an unsubstantiated accusation places upon innocent employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Federal Circuit applies substantial innocence as a distinct criterion separate and independent from clearly without merit and wholly unfounded.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, 788 F.2d at 749. In its decisions on this criterion, the Federal Circuit has defined the meaning of substantial innocence and objectively evaluated the case before it on the merits in order to assess whether the substantial innocence criterion has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391, the court described substantial innocence as innocence of the more important and greater part of the original charges when that innocence is not based on some technical defect. In <span class="Italic">Massa v. Department of Defense</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the court further described substantial innocence to mean that "an employee is essentially without fault for the charges alleged, and was needlessly subjected to attorney fees in order to vindicate himself." In <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, the court advised that "the extent of a party's victory is clearly relevant generally to the justice of his cause[.]" 788 F.2d at 751 n.7. In contrast, in <span class="Italic">Wise</span>, the court ruled that an employee "who (1) knows that he is substantially innocent of the charges brought against him, (2) can prove his substantial innocence, and (3) deliberately does not communicate all the facts to the deciding official which would lead the deciding official to rule against the removal action" is not substantially innocent within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion 2. <span class="Italic">Wise</span>, 780 F.2d at 1000.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determinative principle of these holdings is that substantial innocence is an objective assessment of the merits of the employee's challenge to the agency's disciplinary action. These cases demonstrate <span id="page_2456"></span>that an employee who has prevailed on substantive rather than technical grounds on the major charges is substantially innocent as a matter of law, unless the employee deliberately withheld exculpating information from the agency during its investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Attorney Fee Award Is Deficient under the Substantially Innocent Criterion of Allen</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, establish that the grievant was substantially innocent within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion 2 and, therefore, that an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice within the meaning of section 7701(g)(1). The Arbitrator's factual findings confirm that the grievant was innocent of the sole charge on which the discipline was based--that she gave an "inflammatory" statement about an Agency doctor to a patient. In his award, the Arbitrator explained that "significantly different" facts would have led to a different result. In particular, the Arbitrator stated that "had there been any evidence that the grievant initiated the communication with [the patient], that she urged him to pursue a complaint..., or that she otherwise volunteered unsolicited information that was derogatory toward [the Agency or its staff], disciplinary action would have been appropriate." This is not what happened, however, and the Arbitrator's conjecture about what might have happened, but did not, does not alter the facts that the Arbitrator found were established in arbitration. Based on his finding that these facts did not support the Agency's charge against the grievant, the Arbitrator sustained the Union's claim that the discipline was improper and directed withdrawal of the suspension and backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the Union's second claim--that the Agency's disciplinary action was motivated by retaliation--the Arbitrator relied on the grievant's behavior that led to the 3-day suspension. Because he saw a "resembl[ance]" between the grievant's providing the statement to the patient and some of the grievant's prior behavior, the Arbitrator explained that "[t]he Agency officials deciding the matter had a reasonable, yet ultimately mistaken belief that the grievant had repeated her earlier behavior of instigating inflammatory communication...and that more serious disciplinary action was warranted."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, the Arbitrator resolved two distinct claims asserted against the Agency, one (the discipline claim) involving the grievant's actions and whether they merited discipline, and one (the retaliation claim) involving the Agency's actions and whether they constituted retaliation. The Arbitrator concluded that the Union prevailed on the former but not on the latter. Although the attorney fees sought by the Union pertain to the former, a careful reading of the Arbitrator's Merits and Fee awards makes it evident that he denied the Union attorney fees based on facts he found relevant in resolving the latter claim. That is, the Arbitrator denied fees requested for the claim the Union <span class="Italic">won</span> based on his findings concerning the claim the Union <span class="Italic">lost</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator made distinct findings about the discipline claim the Union won, concluding that the grievant was innocent of the charge against her without any caveat that the evidence on this point was "close." [5] In his Fee award, the Arbitrator rejected the Union's claim that attorney fees were warranted for the discipline claim based on the grievant's substantial innocence, because..."in effect, the grievant was dangerously close to facing serious discipline." However, the Arbitrator's finding that the evidence was close was made only in connection with the retaliation claim. This finding does not, in our view, support the legal conclusion that the grievant was not substantially innocent of the charges for which she was disciplined. The facts found by the Arbitrator concerning the action for which discipline was imposed establish that, like the employee in <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, the grievant prevailed on all the charges <span class="Italic">against her</span>. <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457. As such, we conclude that she is entitled to attorney fees even though the grievant did not prevail on her charge--retaliation--<span class="Italic">against the Agency</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that, although the Federal Circuit has acknowledged that closeness of the facts and evidence is a factor to consider in determining whether an employee is substantially innocent, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Massa</span>, 833 F.2d at 993 (citing <span class="Italic">Thomson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1985)), the principle has never been applied to reject the substantial innocence of an employee who has had discipline completely vacated on substantive grounds. Moreover, the court's only specific reference to closeness of evidence has been limited to credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391 n.3; <span class="Italic">Thomson</span>, 772 F.2d at 881. Credibility was not the type of closeness on which the Arbitrator in this case relied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's denial of the Union's request for attorney fees is deficient, and we set it aside.[7] As an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice, we remand the issue of what amount of fees would be reasonable to the parties for further proceedings.[8] Absent settlement, the parties are directed to resubmit this issue to the Arbitrator.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;According to Authority precedent, <span class="Italic">DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 162, an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criteria are met. Therefore, we need not address the Union's other exceptions, i.e., that the Agency knew or should have known it would not prevail or that the Agency's action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We reject the Union's request that we award the Union the requested fees. As the Authority has consistently held, the arbitrator, not the Authority, is the "appropriate authority" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a) for resolving a union request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Alabama Association of Civilian Technicians and U.S. Department of Defense, Alabama State Military Department, Alabama National Guard</span>, 54 FLRA 229 (1998). Moreover, the reasonableness of the requested amount cannot be derived from the record in this case. There are no findings by the Arbitrator on the reasonableness of the requested amount, and the record does not contain the Agency's position on the amount requested by the Union. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;This decision is consistent with the decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 50 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Carolina District, Charlotte, North Carolina</span>, 54 FLRA 250 (1998) (<span class="Italic">IRS, Charlotte</span>). In <span class="Italic">IRS, Charlotte</span>, the Authority found that the arbitrator's factual findings supported his legal conclusion. Here, we find that the Arbitrator's factual findings do not support his legal conclusions. To the extent that prior decisions, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, North Chicago, Illinois and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2107</span>, 52 FLRA 387, 398 (1996) and <span class="Italic">DDRE</span>, 51 FLRA at 161-62, suggest that we defer to any articulated statement of reasons, and/or defer not only to the facts but to legal conclusions drawn from those facts, that was not our intent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188 </span>was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3105 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 63 FLRA 128, 130-31 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union relies on <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188</span>, in contending that the award is contrary to law to the extent that the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant is not substantially innocent. In that case, the arbitrator denied an award of attorney fees on the ground that the grievant was not substantially innocent even though, in the prior merits award, the arbitrator had found that the 13-day suspension of the grievant was not for such cause as would promote the efficiency of the service. In concluding that the grievant was not substantially innocent, the arbitrator explained that the grievant had been "dangerously close to facing serious discipline." 54 FLRA at 1404 (quoting Merits Award at 19).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Reviewing exceptions to the fee award, the Authority found that the substantially innocent criterion of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> refers to the result on the merits at MSPB or arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1406. In addition, the Authority cited Federal Circuit precedent describing "substantially innocent" as "innocence of the more important and greater part of the original charges when that innocence is not based on some technical defect." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1407 (citing <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Boese</span>)). The Authority held that "an employee who has prevailed on substantive rather than technical grounds on the major charges is substantially innocent as a matter of law, unless the employee deliberately withheld exculpat[ory] information from the agency during its investigation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Applying this standard, the Authority concluded that the grievant was substantially innocent because the arbitrator found that the grievant was innocent of the sole charge on which discipline was based. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1407-08.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188, </span>the Arbitrator here specifically found that there was no just cause for discipline on the charge for which the Agency suspended the grievant. Merits Award at 12. That is, on the basis of the Arbitrator's factual findings, the grievant prevailed on the sole charge against him. Also, the grievant prevailed on the ground that he was denied "due process." Fee Award at 7. This is not a technical ground. <span class="Italic">See Hanley v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 90 MSPR 43, 50 (2001) (a failure of due process because of a lack of clear notice of the grounds on which discipline was based does not constitute a technical defect). As such, and as there is no contention that the grievant withheld information, precedent supports a conclusion that the grievant is substantially innocent within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See NAGE Local R5-188, </span>54 FLRA at 1407-09.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Also as in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-188</span>, the Arbitrator's fee award does not support a contrary conclusion. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was not substantially innocent because of uncharged misconduct and because his order that the grievant communicate in a letter that he would not conduct unapproved firearms training inured to the benefit of the Agency. Fee Award at 7-8. However, under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), uncharged misconduct is immaterial to a determination of substantial innocence.<span class="Italic"> E.g., Siedle v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 211, 215-16 (1990) (in determining substantial innocence, the MSPB relies only on the charge against the employee as the agency framed it in its notice of discipline). Likewise, the ordered letter does not alter the facts that the award vacated the suspension, provided backpay, and required the Agency to purge the grievant's record of references to the suspension. <span class="Italic">See Boese</span>, <span id="page_2457"></span>784 F.2d 388 (employee was substantially innocent even though removal was only mitigated to a 90-day suspension).</p>
<p class="noindent">The substantial innocence test does not apply if the case does not involve discipline, <span class="Italic">NAIL, Local 5 and DOD, DLA Texarkana</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-83.html">69 FLRA 573</a>, 575 (2016) (an overtime case):</p>

<p class="noindent">FLRA denied exceptions to an award that denied fees when the employee was determined not to be substantially innocent of the charged misconduct. The "Arbitrator dismissed the charges of misconduct for a technical reason...the Arbitrator did not find the grievant himself to be without fault."
