<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-24"><span class="space">7.</span> MSPB Remand; EEOC Remand</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under EEOC regulations, the employing agency has the responsibility for investigating an employee's EEO complaint. After the investigation concludes, unless the parties settle, the employee with a mixed case is notified of the right to an MSPB hearing. To take advantage of the EEO procedure and the opportunities it provides for the development of evidence and settlement, an appellant may file an EEO case and wait for the completion of the investigation before filing the Board appeal. The system does not work in reverse. If the Board appeal is initiated, the appellant has elected her remedy and the Board does not remand the case to be developed through the EEO process. Years ago a regulation, 5 CFR 1201.155, permitted an AJ, by agreement of the parties, to remand a discrimination issue to the agency for consideration, but that regulation is history. Cases applying the regulation noted that the regulation was consistent with the past practice that the Board would not surrender jurisdiction to the agency because the appellant filed an EEO complaint with the agency after the Board appeal was filed. <span class="Italic">Allen v. USDA</span>, 29 MSPR 115, 117 (1985). Remand was not required. It would have to be in the interests of justice. <span class="Italic">Dugger v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 78, 80 (1980); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPR 538, 540, 3 MSPB 59 (1980); <span class="Italic">Cardenas v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 578, 579, 1 MSPB 560 (1980). Once remand occurred, if there were errors in the EEO process, it was up to the appellant to pursue those errors to EEOC unless the appellant had the right to refile his case with the MSPB. The Board did not have the authority to direct the EEO complaint process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gaines v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 594, 598 n.5 (1990) (Board technically had no jurisdiction over an appeal initially, yet the AJ remanded it to the EEO process; the remedy for the appellant was to pursue the case with EEOC rather than with the Board).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under more recent law, the Board will not, for the convenience of appellant, transfer to EEOC a case within its appellate or compliance jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wright v. VA</span>, 85 MSPR 358, 369 &#x00B6; 31 (2000); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McCall v. USDA</span>, 92 MSPR 518, 520 &#x00B6; 5 (2002) (Board lacks authority to transfer cases to the EEOC). Nor has the Board been inclined to permit appellants to switch adjudication systems by vacating unfavorable initial decisions to permit immediate filing of EEO complaints, <span class="Italic">Whitehurst v. TVA</span>, 43 MSPR 486, 493-94 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, finally, requests that the Board vacate the initial decision's findings on the issue of age discrimination because he wishes to file an age discrimination and reprisal complaint with the EEOC, which he asserts the EEOC has agreed to accept. He contends that he has been informed by former co-workers that the agency's RIF notice was erroneous in informing him that he could either appeal the RIF action to the Board or file an EEO complaint if he believed that the action was based on discrimination, but not both. The agency responds in opposition that its specific RIF notice notified the appellant of the mixed appeal rights and properly informed him that he could pursue his case through an appeal to the Board or an EEO complaint with the agency, but not both.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, contrary to the appellant's contention, that the agency's specific RIF notice correctly informed him (A) of the right to file a mixed case appeal with the Board or a mixed case complaint with the agency concerning the RIF action, but not both, and (B) that whichever was first filed would be considered an election to proceed in that forum. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.403; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(c). Since the appellant filed his mixed case appeal with the Board first, the Board has the authority to adjudicate the appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nichols v. Department of the Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 41, 42-43 (1988); 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.403.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge has heard and adjudicated the appellant's age discrimination claim in the initial decision. The agency has indicated its opposition to the appellant's request to withdraw the adjudicated claim on petition for review. The Board has held that, in a case where the appellant was aware of the alleged discrimination, yet initially chose to bring his action before the Board, the Board need not delay its jurisdiction based on the appellant's subsequent filing of an EEO complaint with the agency unless the parties agree and the administrative judge finds that to do so would be in the interests of justice. <span class="Italic">See Dugger v. Department of Justice,</span> 3 MSPB 194, 3 MSPR 78, 80 (1980); <span class="Italic">Cardenas v. United States Postal Service</span>, 1 MSPB 560, 1 MSPR 578, 579-80 (1980). Further, the appellant may request the EEOC to review the Board's final decision on his age discrimination claim. The Board finds under the circumstances of this case that a delay of the Board's jurisdiction over this case would not be in the interests of justice. Therefore, we deny the appellant's request to withdraw his age discrimination claim and to vacate the initial decision's findings concerning the issue of age discrimination.</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, DA-0752-11-0696-P-1, n.3 (NP 1/31/2023) ("Further, the appellant provides no authority that would empower the Board to order the agency to investigate and adjudicate her discrimination claims, and we are aware of none."); <span class="Italic">Gilliam v. VA</span>, SF-0752-16-0705-I-1 (NP 1/25/2023) ("However, to the extent that the appellant may be asking the Board to order the agency or the EEOC to process his discrimination complaint, the Board lacks the authority to do so.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC may determine that the record is insufficient to decide an issue of discrimination raised first with the Board and then with EEOC. The EEOC may then remand the case to the Board to take additional evidence. The Board sends the case back to the region for development of the evidence on identified issues. The region submits the evidence developed, without findings, to the Board, and the Board forwards the case back to EEOC. <span class="Italic">Rivas v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 497, 498 (1988). The authority of the EEOC to require the Board to develop additional evidence was reviewed in <span class="Italic">Crawford v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 416, 420, 425-26 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7702(b)(4), 5 USC, provides that in reviewing a Board decision in a mixed case, the EEOC "may refer the case to the Board, or provide on its own, for the taking (within such period as permits the Commission to make a decision within the 60-day period prescribed under this subsection) of additional evidence to the extent it considers necessary to supplement the record." Thus, the EEOC has the authority and the discretion to refer a case to the Board for the taking of additional evidence under 5 USC 7702(b)(4), and the Board generally will accept such a referral without specifically discussing its propriety. <span class="Italic">See generally, e.g., McLaughlin v. Dept. of the Interior</span>, 16 MSPR 152 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has not hesitated to disagree with and decline such an EEOC referral, however, when it exceeded the scope of the EEOC's authority. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of the Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 120, 121-22 (1988) (in referring the case back to the Board under 5 USC 7702(b)(4), the EEOC "exceeded the scope of its authority")....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the EEOC...that the AJ erred by refusing to accept the EEO investigative report. The report was proffered by the appellant's attorney for the first time at the hearing. The AJ's reason for refusing to accept it was that the appellant failed to show why he was submitting it "at this late stage when we've completed presentation of evidence at the hearing...." The report was issued on November 28, 1994, shortly before the December 7, 1994 hearing, and the AJ had previously ruled that the record would close "[A]t the end of the hearing on" December 7, 1994. Moreover, it appears that the report contained information relevant to the appellant's discrimination claim. Under these circumstances, we find that the AJ was not justified in refusing to accept the report into the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the AJ did not deny the appellant his right to a hearing on his discrimination claim, and only precluded him from presenting a particular piece of evidence related to the claim, the appropriate inquiry is whether the AJ's error prejudiced the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Roth v. United States Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 290, 296 (1992); <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 MSPB 114, 6 MSPR 124, 127 (1981). We did not have an opportunity to address this question previously, because the appellant did not file a petition for review before the Board, and we lack the authority to consider it now in the current posture. <span class="Italic">See Rivas v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 497, 498 (1988) (the Board lacks the authority to consider additional evidence upon referral of a case from the EEOC pursuant to 5 USC 7702(b)(4)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under all of the circumstances here, we cannot find that the EEOC's referral of the case to the Board for the taking of further evidence was beyond the scope of its authority under 5 USC 7702(b)(4). We find it unnecessary, however, to remand this case to the regional office for the AJ "to convene a supplemental hearing" and "allow into the record any and all evidence, both testamentary and documentary, relating to [the appellant's] allegation of race discrimination..." <span class="Italic">Crawford</span>, slip op. at 4. As discussed above, the only evidence the appellant was precluded from introducing at the hearing was the EEO investigative report. In fact, the EEOC file including its referral decision appears to confirm that the appellant's only specific assertion before the EEOC was that "the AJ did not receive the EEO investigative report into the record."...&#8197;Since appellant has submitted to the Board, after the EEOC's referral, a copy of the EEO investigative report, the report will be made a part of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hereby remand the case to the Board's San Francisco Regional Office for the purpose of providing the appellant an opportunity to supplement the EEO investigative report. The AJ is instructed to permit the appellant to submit additional evidence <span class="Italic">concerning this</span> <span class="Italic">report.</span> The AJ is further instructed to permit the agency to file any responsive submission. Although it appears from the record that additional evidence need only take the form of documentary or sworn written testimonial evidence, it is within the AJ's discretion to take testimonial evidence <span class="Italic">concerning the EEO investigative report</span>, if the AJ deems it necessary. The additional evidence shall be transmitted, within 45 days, to the Clerk of the Board, who will, in turn, transmit the evidence to the EEOC so that it may decide whether to concur with the Board's decision in this matter.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, 103 MSPR 118, 126-27 &#x00B6; 18, 2006 MSPB 243 (2006), the Board noted that EEOC cannot vest jurisdiction in the Board or require the Board to adjudicate a case unless the case has traveled through the Board in the ordinary course of an appeal with subsequent EEOC review under mixed-case statutes and regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Just as the Board lacks the authority to order the EEOC or an employing agency to reinstate a discrimination complaint, the EEOC has no authority to reinstate a Board appeal for adjudication. Moreover, although the EEOC has authority to review the Board's adjudicatory actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b), none of the EEOC decisions mentioned above was issued under that authority; and nothing in those decisions indicates an intent to have the appellant's 1992 appeal reinstated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant raises no issue of discrimination in his appeal to the Board and then loses on the merits, it lacks jurisdiction to consider any remand from EEOC should the appellant appeal his initial decision to EEOC and should the Commission then make a substantive determination on the discrimination issue. EEOC may acquire jurisdiction over a mixed case only if the discrimination issue is initially presented to the Board and litigated before the Board. <span class="Italic">Gubisch v.

MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3386) (Board lacked jurisdiction from a decision of an EEOC administrative judge recommending dismissal of the appellant's discrimination complaint). <span class="Italic">Gubisch</span> was extended to preclude the Board from accepting a remand of a mixed case (race and age discrimination) from the EEOC for the purpose of developing additional evidence concerning an allegation of disability discrimination raised for the first time with EEOC. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 120, 124 (1988) ("By addressing the issue of handicap discrimination, the EEOC exceeded the scope of its statutory authority under the mixed case procedure and, therefore, cannot require the Board to receive additional evidence on an issue that was never raised before the Board."). The Board construed <span class="Italic">Gubisch</span> to require dismissal of an appeal remanded from the EEOC if the Board should never have initially accepted jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 125 (1988), resulted in dismissal of an appeal after the Board concluded that the appeal should have originally been dismissed by the AJ because appellant's disability retirement precluded his adverse action appeal. The Board reasoned in <span class="Italic">O'Neal</span> that it did not have jurisdiction at the onset of the case, so EEOC could not later acquire jurisdiction of the mixed case and then remand the case to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was the practice that if the appellant filed his Board appeal and then filed an EEO complaint, he would get a hearing from the Board and, eventually, from EEOC. The duplication created by the process was considerable, both for the employer and the adjudicators. EEOC revised its regulations to avoid this complication. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.302 (2022), <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> EEOC delegated to MSPB the authority to hold hearings in mixed case appeals that are initiated through EEO procedures. EEOC divested itself of the business of providing a hearing if a complaint concerns an action within the Board's jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the employee may select the EEO process to secure an agency investigation, and the employee is now told in the adverse (or performance) action decision letter that he may file with MSPB or with EEOC, but not with both agencies. The first filing (a complaint with the agency, or an appeal with the Board) determines how the case will be processed, i.e., under EEOC or under MSPB regulations. If, after filing a Board appeal, the employee files a discrimination complaint, the employer will reject the employee's EEO complaint and inform the employee that the discrimination allegations must be raised in the Board appeal. If, after accepting an EEO complaint, the agency learns that the employee filed a prior Board appeal raising the same issues presented in the complaint, the agency cancels the EEO complaint and informs the employee that he may raise the EEO issues in the Board appeal. The Board's jurisdiction is not defeated by an EEO complaint filed after the adverse action appeal. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 412, 415 n.1 (1991). If the employee's complaint is filed before the Board appeal, the agency is supposed to inform the Board of the complaint, request the Board to dismiss the appeal without prejudice, and then follow the procedures of 29 CFR 1614.302(d) (2022) concerning continued processing of the complaint. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cavanagh v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 485 (1990); <span class="Italic">compare</span> <span class="Italic">Haney v. DHEW</span>, 1 MSPR 763, 763 (1980) ("[T]he field offices must retain jurisdiction of cases initially appealed to the Board despite the subsequent filing of a complaint of discrimination with the agency."), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Dugger v.

<p class="Body-Text">Cases arose where an appellant filed a Board appeal, raised no issue of discrimination, and then appealed to EEOC from an adverse Board decision. EEOC in turn remanded the case to the employing agency for a final decision. The EEOC notice stated that any appeal could then be taken to the Board under a regulation formerly in effect (29 CFR 1613.404). The Board again received the case. The Board rejected those appeals, however, concluding that it lacks jurisdiction over discrimination issues that were not raised in the original proceedings before it. <span class="Italic">Bartlett v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 317, 318-19 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Spears v. MSPB</span>, 766 F.2d 520 (Fed.

That is the appropriate administrative review procedure. No useful purpose is served by an interim regulation, such as 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.404, which directs that employees, like petitioner, be advised that they must exhaust a procedure, which is not authorized by law, at the Board before they can seek review from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ryburn v. USPS,</span> DA-0353-11-0174-I-1 (NP 8/25/2011), if the Board dismisses a case for lack of jurisdiction following adjudication of a PFR, the final Board order will not direct the agency to reinitiate the process of an EEO complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that should the Board deny her petition and thus affirm the dismissal of her appeal for lack of jurisdiction, the Board also should remand her case for issuance of an order to the agency to reinitiate processing of her EEO complaint. She cites to Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) mixed-case regulations at 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(b), which state that if the Board dismisses an appeal of a mixed-case complaint for jurisdictional reasons, the agency must give the appellant notice of her right to a hearing before an EEOC administrative judge or a final agency decision. However, the Board's mixed-case regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 1201 Subpart E do not provide for issuance of an order to the agency to recommence EEO processing. Further, it has not been Board practice to do so. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 357, &#x00B6; 7 (2003) (separate opinion of Member Slavet) (stating that EEOC regulations impose the notice duty upon the agency and, as long as the regulations are followed, they should insure appellants are aware of their rights). We see no reason to change our practice and therefore decline to issue the requested order or remand the case to the administrative judge for issuance of one.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ball v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 482, 483-85 (1995), attempted to straighten out the problem of how to handle an allegation of discrimination in a constructive adverse action that is first raised before an administrative judge of EEOC when it becomes apparent that the appellant desires a hearing on that action before the MSPB. The Board essentially decided that the employing agency should advise the employee of her right to elect remedies, and that the agency should notify the employee of the time for filing a mixed case complaint or for filing an appeal directly with MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant retired from her GS-5 Health Technician position on disability, effective October 21, 1990. She had previously filed a formal discrimination complaint with the agency alleging that her nonselection for an Ultrasound Technician position was based, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, on race, sex and age discrimination. At the prehearing conference before an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) administrative judge, the appellant asserted that the discriminatory circumstances surrounding her nonselection also led to her poor medical condition and, hence, forced her to accept disability retirement. The appellant sought back pay that she lost as the result of her allegedly forced retirement, as well as front pay and any other equitable or compensatory relief available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC administrative judge determined that the appellant's involuntary retirement claim should be presented to the Board and remanded the matter to the agency "for forwarding to MSPB for a ruling on whether they have jurisdiction over the issue of forced retirement." The appellant subsequently filed a petition for appeal requesting a hearing before the Board. According to her petition, the agency informed her that she, rather than the agency, would have to request the MSPB hearing to which the EEOC administrative judge referred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A coerced resignation or retirement is tantamount to a removal and is therefore within the Board's jurisdiction....&#8197;An allegation that the agency's coercion was based on discrimination thus makes the coerced retirement claim a mixed case subject to 29 CFR 1614.302. Under section 1614.302(b), an aggrieved person is entitled initially to file either a mixed case complaint with the agency or an appeal of the same matter with the Board. The regulation states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency shall inform every employee who is the subject of an <span id="Page_3342"></span>action that is appealable to the MSPB and who has either orally or in writing raised the issue of discrimination during the processing of the action of the right to file either a mixed case complaint with the agency or to file a mixed case appeal with the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no evidence in the record that the agency informed the appellant of her right to make an election. While the appellant did not raise allegations of discrimination at the time that her retirement was processed, she did attempt later to raise this claim in the EEO process on her nonselection claim. Under the circumstances, we find that it was error for the EEOC administrative judge and the agency to direct the appellant to file an appeal concerning the matter with the Board rather than to inform her of her right to make an election under section 1614.302(b). By indicating that the appellant was in effect required to file with the Board, they denied the appellant her right to elect under the regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we REMAND this case to the agency with directions to inform the appellant of her right under section 1614.302(b) to make an election concerning the initial processing of her mixed case involving an allegedly forced retirement based on discrimination. The agency shall set a reasonable time limit for the appellant to exercise her right to file a mixed case complaint and shall inform her that an appeal to the Board must be filed within 30 days of the agency's notice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Harty</span>, 96 MSPR 65, 72 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2004) (appeal from constructive action against an ALJ: "where an appellant files a constructive adverse action appeal in which he raises discrimination claims, he may file a mixed-case complaint with the agency or a Board constructive action appeal, and whichever is filed first is considered an election to proceed in that forum"; the appellant cannot appeal to the Board from the agency's dismissal of an EEO complaint that was filed after the Board appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC may not expand on Board jurisdiction by essentially referring to the Board EEO issues that are a prelude to an adverse action through an EEOC conclusion that the issues referred are intertwined with an appealable action and should be referred to the Board for resolution along with the appealable action. <span class="Italic">Lethridge v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 675, 679-681 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (2005), deciding an interlocutory appeal, essentially rejected the EEOC referral:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512 and 7513(d), the Board has jurisdiction over, among other actions, "a removal." Further, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1), in the case of any employee who has been affected by an action which the employee may appeal to the Board, and who alleges that a basis "for the [appealable] action" was prohibited discrimination, the Board shall decide "both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action." Here, despite the Commission's finding that the discrimination claims raised in complaints 1 and 2 must be brought to the attention of the Board, those complaints involve actions, essentially denials of reasonable accommodation at certain times before the agency effected the appellant's removal, that are not appealable to the Board. The Board has long held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), which prohibits discrimination based on, among other things, disability, is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">E.g., Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871&#8209;73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). We therefore agree with our AJ's ruling on these complaints. <span class="Italic">See King v. Reid</span>, 59 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (section 7702(a)(1) allows the Board to decide an issue of discrimination only when it is a basis for an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Board).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find nothing in the plain language of sections 7512, 7513(d), and 7702(a)(1), that suggests that the Board has jurisdiction over otherwise non-appealable actions, such as those at issue here, when those actions are allegedly "inextricably intertwined," or "cannot sensibly be bifurcated," with otherwise appealable actions. As set forth above, section 7702(a)(1) provides that the Board shall decide the issue of discrimination "and the appealable action," not issues of discrimination in connection with non-appealable actions. In fact, our determination is consistent with excerpts from the Senate Report accompanying the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95&#8209;454, 92 Stat. 1111, which provide that, "[I]n the case of discrimination complaints involving personnel actions not otherwise appealable to the Board, the Commission [EEOC] will have full responsibility for deciding the matter," and that "[t]he jurisdiction of the Board is determined entirely by the nature of the personnel action taken, not by the kind of legal or factual arguments raised or the procedures used to raise the discrimination issue." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 53, 56 (1978), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2775, 2778. Both the Board's regulations and those of the EEOC are consistent with the statutes and legislative history, and provide that mixed-case appeals involve actions that are appealable to the Board and allegations by employees that those appealable actions are based on prohibited discrimination. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.151(a)(1); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, even assuming that there are valid policy reasons for the Board to consider non-appealable actions with appealable actions, such as the avoidance of allegedly inconsistent results, the Board cannot expand its limited jurisdiction to address those policy concerns. In any event, we find that there are distinct actions at issue in the appellant's EEO complaints and his Board appeal that, if adjudicated, would not necessarily produce inconsistent results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that the EEOC issued a Management Bulletin (EEO-MB 100-1), dated October 24, 2003, that deleted from an EEOC Management Directive language that advised agency representatives to file a motion with Board AJs to accept jurisdiction over non-mixed matters with other matters properly within the jurisdiction of the Board, "[w]here a complainant has pending a non-mixed case complaint or a series of non-mixed case complaints and the claims raised in those complaints are inextricably intertwined with an appeal on a claim that is appealable to the MSPB." The Management Directive provision had been "specifically meant to address those situations where a series of events, connected in time or type, culminate in an appealable action against a person with standing to appeal to the MSPB." The Management Bulletin indicates that the OFO had been notified by the Board that the Management Directive improperly advised parties with respect to Board procedures and jurisdiction, and was "improper procedurally, in that it constitutes a request for an MSPB Judge to hear matters which may not be within the jurisdiction of the MSPB."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case relied upon by the Commission in its decision at issue here, <span class="Italic">Goins v. Crowell</span>, EEOC Request No. 05931007 (June 30, 1994), does not warrant a different result. Even assuming that the Commission in <span class="Italic">Goins</span> properly held that an appellant should raise with the Board not only his separation by reduction in force (RIF), but his claim that the agency "surplused" his position based on disability discrimination before it effected his separation by RIF, the Commission noted that, although it "recommend[ed] " that the allegations be processed together, the Board "has the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to accept jurisdiction over allegation (4)," which was the "surplus" action. Moreover, a more recent Commission decision reaches a different result altogether, recognizing that the Board does not accept cases where mixed and non-mixed issues are "inextricably intertwined." <span class="Italic">Capitulo v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A43252 (Jan. 14, 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although the AJ in this case found that the appellant's third EEO complaint can be heard by the Board as a mixed-case issue because it was intertwined with the agency's ultimate removal action over which the Board has jurisdiction, we disagree. As set forth above, the applicable statutes limit the Board's jurisdiction to removals, not proposed removals. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (the Board's jurisdiction does not extend to proposed removals); <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Department of the Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("[b]ecause mere proposals to remove are not listed in &#x00A7; 7512, they are not appealable adverse actions in themselves and the Board has no jurisdiction over them"); <span class="Italic">Weber v. Department of the Army</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 406, 409 (1990) (a removal must have been effected before the Board has jurisdiction over that action). Thus, the Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's claim that his proposed removal, which was issued over one year before the agency effected his appealable removal, was based on discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Lockridge v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 613, 617 n.2 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 121 F.3d 727 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table).</p>
