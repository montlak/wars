<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-34"><span class="space">4.</span> Involuntary Resignation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">We are told Benjamin Franklin once said, "I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office." Ben would have been astonished at the number of civil servants who ignore his example and advice. Given the volume of litigation over resignations tendered and then regretted and appealed, attention should be paid to the cautionary words of Judge Nichols in <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States</span>, 417 F.2d 1345, 1346 (Ct. Cl. 1969) (concurring opinion):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an employee's continued presence in an agency is regarded as undesirable, and if he tenders any piece of paper purporting to be a resignation, the temptation is to snatch at it, thus avoiding the complex ritual and uncertain outcome of an adverse action. It is, I believe, the duty of the personnel officer nevertheless to scrutinize the paper with care, and to reject it as a resignation if it states, clearly or ambiguously, that the resignation is coerced....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims as to constructively adverse resignations were reviewed in several other Claims Court cases. <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584, 587-89 (Ct. Cl. 1975), declared as to a resignation and discontinued service retirement allegedly coerced by events starting with a proposed removal for misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review of the facts as they appear in the record before the CSC, it is clear that plaintiff has failed to show that her resignation was obtained by external coercion or duress. Duress is not measured by the employee's subjective evaluation of a situation. Rather, the test is an objective one. <span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States</span>, 187 Ct. Cl. 284, 289, 407 F. 2d 1349, 1351<span class="Italic">,</span> <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 396 U.S. 894 (1969)<span class="Italic">;</span> <span class="Italic">Pitt v. United States,</span> 190 Ct. Cl. 506, 513, 420 F. 2d 1028, 1032 (1970). While it is possible plaintiff, herself, perceived no viable alternative but to tender her resignation, the record evidence supports CSC's finding that plaintiff chose to resign and accept discontinued service retirement rather than challenge the validity of her proposed discharge for cause. The fact remains, plaintiff <span class="Italic">had a choice</span>. She could stand pat and fight. She chose not to. Merely because plaintiff was faced with an inherently unpleasant situation in that her choice was arguably limited to two unpleasant alternatives does not obviate the voluntariness of her resignation. Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2a(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has repeatedly upheld the voluntariness of resignations where they were submitted to avoid threatened termination for cause. <span class="Italic">Pitt v. United States, supra</span> (termination resulting from possible criminal prosecution); <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States,</span> 189 Ct. Cl. 528, 417 F. 2d 1345 (1969) (termination for gross insubordination); <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States</span>, 182 Ct. Cl. 495, 389 F. 2d 815 (1968) (termination for incompetence). Of course, the threatened termination must be for good cause in order to precipitate a binding, voluntary resignation. <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States, supra</span> at 499, 389 F. 2d at 817<span class="Italic">.</span> But this "good cause" requirement is met as long as plaintiff fails to show that the agency knew or believed that the proposed termination could not be substantiated. <span class="Italic">Leone v. United States, supra</span> at 340<span class="Italic">.</span> Although plaintiff has attempted to impugn the agency's motivation for proceeding with her proposed termination, plaintiff does not deny that the incident which formed the basis of the charge against her had taken place (although she does assert the so-called assault was nothing more than an "inadvertent touching"). This admission is fatal to plaintiff's attempt to impeach the agency's decision to terminate her for cause. Whether this charge could have been sustained had plaintiff chosen to appeal her discharge for cause is irrelevant. What is relevant is that the admission of this incident is <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> evidence that an arguable basis for discharge existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's suggestion that her resignation was obtained as a result of agency deception is completely unsupported by the record. It is true that CSC regulations recognize that a normally voluntary action is transformed into an involuntary one if obtained by agency misrepresentation. Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2a(1). But reliance on the misrepresentation is an essential element. Here, plaintiff not only fails to show such reliance, her own words completely repudiate it. In her request for consideration to the CSC AEO, dated March 25, 1972, plaintiff did allege that the agency misrepresented the consequences of a dismissal for cause regarding retirement/annuity rights. But in the same sentence, plaintiff concedes that the alleged misrepresentations were corrected "in later explorations of alternatives" before she submitted her disputed resignation. This concession clearly negates any suggestion that plaintiff relied on any purported agency misrepresentations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff's argument that her separation should be voided because she was not permitted to set the effective date of her resignation has no merit. When plaintiff signed the necessary forms requesting her separation from the rolls and her request for discontinued service retirement, she adopted the date contained therein as her own. This ratification, signified by her signature, clearly satisfies the requirements that plaintiff set her own effective date of resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since plaintiff has failed to present an adequate claim of coerced resignation, CSC properly declined to accept her appeal. Voluntary separations are not adverse actions and are thus not appealable to the CSC. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752-201(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel raised the issue of whether CSC's denial of a requested hearing compels reinstatement. Our answer is that it does not.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It would be folly to suggest that any time a hearing is requested, an agency must grant it. Yet, in effect, that is what plaintiff seems to imply. What plaintiff overlooks is that the legal classification of her separation is determinative of her entitlement to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has recognized that non-probationary Federal employees have a property interest in their jobs. <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy,</span> 416 U.S. 13 (1974)<span class="Italic">.</span> As such, employees are entitled to a due process hearing if the Government initiates an adverse action to remove them. However, when an employee voluntarily relinquishes her property interest, her separation cannot be considered an adverse action. Since there was no adverse action in this case, a hearing is not required. <span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States, supra</span> at 289, 407 F. 2d at 1352. The underlying rationale is that a Government-initiated removal (adverse action) is analogous to a "taking" of a property interest; an employee-initiated separation is not. <span class="Italic">Compare Board of Regents v. Roth,</span> 408 U.S. 564 (1972<span class="Italic">)</span> <span class="Italic">with Perry v. Sindermann</span>, 408 U.S. 593 (1972<span class="Italic">).</span> Since plaintiff voluntarily relinquished her property interest, the CSC correctly denied her hearing request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, we hold the CSC properly declined to accept plaintiff's appeal because, as a matter of law, her resignation was voluntary. We further conclude CSC's denial of plaintiff's hearing request was proper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Leone v. United States</span>, 204 Ct. Cl. 334, 338-39 (1974), cited in <span class="Italic">Christie,</span> emphasized the element of an improper and unsupported agency threat of adverse action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case law reveals that the element of voluntariness is vitiated only when resignation is submitted under duress brought on by government action. The tripart test for such duress is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. *** <span class="Italic">Fruhauf Southwest Garment Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because coercion is a necessary component of this formula, a former employee's burden of establishing that his resignation was involuntarily extracted is a heavy one. As stated in CSC regulation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The fact that the employee may be faced with an inherently unpleasant situation or that his choice may be limited to two unpleasant alternatives, does not make the resulting action an involuntary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1937"></span>Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 752-1, subchapter S1-2a(3). The test thus laid down is one of external coercion or duress, not of internal, subjective perceptions thereof. <span class="Italic">McGucken v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Leading instances in which courts have found resignation to be involuntary and, hence, without legal effect are those involving the employee's mental incompetence, <span class="Italic">Manzi v. United States</span>, 198 Ct. Cl. 489 (1972)<span class="Italic">;</span> time pressure, <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States</span>, 203 Ct.

Cl. 471, 423 F. 2d 1379 (1970)<span class="Italic">.</span> None of these special circumstances is asserted in the single item of evidence for plaintiff's count II claim, Mr. Leone's affidavit of May 21, 1973.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, resignation submitted (even "under protest") to avoid threatened termination for unsatisfactory performance has been repeatedly found voluntary and binding. <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States,</span> 189 Ct. Cl. 528, 417 F. 2d 1345 (1969); <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States</span>, 182 Ct. Cl. 495, 389 F. 2d 815 (1968); <span class="Italic">Popham v. United States, supra.</span> Such was the situation at hand. Although plaintiff does invoke the requirement that a threatened termination must be for good cause in order to precipitate a binding, voluntary resignation, <span class="Italic">Autera v. United States, supra</span> at 499, 389 F. 2d at 817, in no pleading or affidavit does he make the necessary averment that Captain Axell knew or believed that the proposed termination could not be substantiated. Indeed, in his responsive affidavit of June 18, 1973, Captain Axell points out that his unsatisfactory rating of plaintiff was upheld by the Performance Rating Review Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, plaintiff's suggestion that his departure from employment by means of the "resignation requested" procedure constitutes evidence that his resignation was submitted under duress is without legal basis. It is established that standards governing involuntary resignation for retirement purposes differ from those used to determine when wrongful termination has occurred. Federal Personnel Manual Supp. 831-1, subchapter S11-2. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. United States,</span> 193 Ct. Cl. 750, 436 F. 2d 438 (1971)<span class="Italic">.</span> Indeed, Captain Axell was required by the terms of the Federal Personnel Manual to notify plaintiff and all other eligible Lakehurst employees of the resignation-requested option when a RIF at the establishment became imminent. Supp. 831, subchapter S11-2 (d)(2)(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, plaintiff's count II allegations fail to present an adequate claim of coerced resignation. Because his resignation must, consequently, be considered voluntary, his claim of wrongful termination is without administrative or judicial recourse. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752-201(b); <span class="Italic">Dabney v. Freeman,</span> 358 F. 2d 533, 535 (D.C<span class="Italic">.</span> Cir. 1965); <span class="Italic">Cosby v. United States, supra</span> at 530, 417 F. 2d at 1346<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGucken v. United States</span>, 407 F.2d 1349, 1350-52 (Ct. Cl. 1969), also relied on in <span class="Italic">Christie,</span> considered the mental status of the employee at the time of his resignation to determine whether there was a legitimate claim of involuntariness:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the root of plaintiff's claim is that at the time of his resignation, he was "nervous, sick, mentally ill and upset"; that his resignation was not of his free will, but was to avoid a physical attack upon his person, and that, therefore, his resignation was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Paroczay v. Hodges,</span> 297 F. 2d 439 (D.C. Cir. 1961)<span class="Italic">,</span> the court stated that the papers before the District Court created a genuine issue of material fact as to the voluntariness of the resignation, and that summary judgment was therefore not proper. In footnote 4, the court also stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The issue of coercion is not solved by accepting the contention of defendants that there was no obligation to give the employee an option to resign; for this does not answer the question whether the resignation which was given was coerced. <span class="Italic">If it was the separation constituted a discharge</span>, and Paroczay had certain rights under the Veterans' Preference Act. * * * [Emphasis supplied]. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 441.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of voluntariness in <span class="Italic">Paroczay, supra,</span> arose because appellant was told that he would be charged with serious misconduct unless he resigned then and there. Given such a situation, the court concluded that the resignation may not have been voluntary. It then distinguished the case of <span class="Italic">Rich v. Mitchell,</span> 273 F. 2d 78 (D.C. Cir. 1959)<span class="Italic">,</span> <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 368 U.S. 854 (1961)<span class="Italic">,</span> where there was no demand for an immediate resignation under threat of immediate charges, and where the employee in fact was given three days to consider his course of action. Nor was the employee denied the right to consult his family and friends, a right which appellant in <span class="Italic">Paroczay</span> claims was denied him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the facts in this case indicated that the resignation was not voluntary, then plaintiff should have been afforded a hearing under the Veterans' Preference Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 863 (1964). This is so because, as was stated in <span class="Italic">Paroczay, supra,</span> an involuntary resignation is a discharge, and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 863 states in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No permanent or indefinite preference eligible, * * * shall be discharged, * * * except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing, * * *; such preference eligible * * * shall have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission from an adverse decision of the administrative officer so acting, * * *: <span class="Italic">Provided</span>, That such preference eligible shall have the right to make a personal appearance, or an appearance through a designated representative, in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be issued by the Civil Service Commission; * * *.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the court in <span class="Italic">Paroczay, supra,</span> indicated, the voluntary nature of a resignation is an issue of fact. Viewing the facts in this case against the standards which have been established to determine voluntariness, we conclude that the Civil Service Commission had substantial evidence upon which to conclude that plaintiff's resignation was voluntary. We need only look at this court's standard to see that plaintiff has failed to prove his case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * three elements are common to all situations where duress has been found to exist. These are: (1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. * * * <span class="Italic">Fruhauf Southwest Garment Company v. United States,</span> 126 Ct. Cl. 51, 62, 111 F. Supp. 945, 951 (1953)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of these situations, in our opinion, existed here. Plaintiff was "unwilling" to accept a reassignment, which indicates both his freedom of choice and the fact that he was not coerced. In addition, he had three days to decide whether to accept the reassignment or not. By later claiming that he was mentally ill and nervous at the time of his resignation does not mean that he was forced into resigning. The involuntary nature of a resignation arises from external coercion and duress, and not from internal misconceptions or unsubstantiated threats of physical attack. Plaintiff may have believed that he was coerced, but he has adduced no persuasive evidence to show coercion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff now says, in addition, that he was mentally ill at the time of his resignation, but he does not present us with any facts (as distinguished from mere conclusory assertions) which would warrant a trial or further consideration of that issue. Without a more substantial showing, he cannot attack the Commission's finding on the ground of mental illness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Civil Service Commission's determination was based on substantial evidence, the lack of an involuntary resignation negates the assertion that there was an adverse action. Since there was no adverse action, a hearing was not required.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Federal Circuit decision, <span class="Italic">Steele v. MSPB</span>, 549 Fed. Appx. 944, 945-46 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP), summarized the law applicable to allegedly coerced resignations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly concluded that the Board was without jurisdiction over Mr. Steele's appeal. "The board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). "[T]he Board lacks jurisdiction over an employee's voluntary decision to resign or retire." <span class="Italic">Conforto v. Merit Sys. Prot.

An employee's resignation or retirement is presumed voluntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1121. "The two principal grounds on which employees have sought to show that their resignations or retirements were involuntary are (1) that the resignation or retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency, and (2) that the resignation or retirement was the product of coercion by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1114 (citation omitted). Mr. Steele argues that the demotion and reassignment he was given forced him into resigning; accordingly, we analyze whether his resignation was the product of the SCS's coercion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have held, "[t]he doctrine of coercive involuntariness 'is a narrow one,' requiring that the employee 'satisfy a demanding legal standard.'" <span class="Italic">Conforto</span>, 713 F.3d at 1121. To invoke this doctrine to overcome the presumption of a voluntary resignation, Mr. Steele must show that, as "'[a] result of improper acts by the agency,'" he was subjected to such circumstances that an objective, reasonable employee "'...confronted with the same [ ] would feel coerced into resigning' or retiring." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1121, 1122 (citing <span class="Italic">Garcia v.

In this analysis, "[a]n employee's dissatisfaction with the options that an agency has made available to him is not sufficient to render his decision to resign or retire involuntary." <span class="Italic">Conforto</span>, 713 F.3d at 1121. "[T]he doctrine of coerced involuntariness does not apply if the employee resigns or retires because he does not like agency decisions such as 'a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is <span id="Page_1938"></span>authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant...that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1121-22.

<p class="Body-Text">In an involuntary resignation appeal, the merits of the claim and the Board's jurisdiction are intimately linked; if it is established that a resignation is involuntary, the Board has jurisdiction and the employee wins on the merits, with entitlement to reinstatement.

<p class="Body-Text">When a hostile environment is alleged as the cause of a resignation, the bottom line is that the Board is to consider the totality of the circumstances, <span class="Italic">Lentz v. MSPB</span>, 876 F.3d 1380, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 2017):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appropriate standard is whether the totality of events, on all of the evidence, produced a working environment sufficiently hostile as to lead to involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">See Kline v.

<p class="Body-Text">Establishing a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is tricky. Under its traditional approach, if the Board truly has jurisdiction over a resignation--a finding, for example, that a resignation was coerced and is therefore a disguised and noticeless adverse action--the appellant wins; disposition of jurisdiction equates to disposition on the merits. To get to the point of a hearing the Board insists on an initial, somewhat less complete, factual demonstration that, if unrebutted, would appear to carry the day for the appellant. The purpose of the hearing is then to allow more complete evidentiary submissions and credibility determinations to be made on disputed factual issues. The Board has difficulty explaining the concept, and its AJs issue circuitous acknowledgment orders that do not clearly distinguish between the need to demonstrate, through preliminary factual allegations, the existence of a jurisdictional issue, and the need later to demonstrate, through preponderant evidence at a hearing, the facts demonstrating the invalidity of the resignation. Consider <span class="Italic">Willey v. GSA</span>, 40 MSPR 616, 617-19 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued an Acknowledgement Order in which he informed the appellant that if her appeal was timely and within the Board's jurisdiction, she was entitled to a hearing on the merits of her case and provided her an opportunity to request one.... [H]e also stated that if there was a question as to whether her appeal was within the Board's jurisdiction, she was provided, through the order, with an opportunity to submit evidence to establish jurisdiction. He further stated that if she established that there was a dispute as to facts which would affect his decision on the issue of jurisdiction, she was entitled to a hearing if she had requested one.... He ordered her to "file evidence and argument to prove that this action...[was] within the Board's jurisdiction."... He also stated that if she was contending that her resignation was involuntary, she should so state specifically in her response to the order and give specific reasons for this claim.... Finally, the administrative judge informed the appellant that the record on the issue of jurisdiction would close within 25 days of the date of the order unless the administrative judge determined that a requested hearing should be held....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the administrative judge's order contained explicit information apprising the appellant of what was necessary to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue, and that the production of factual evidence and argument would be necessary to show that the Board had jurisdiction and to obtain a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Bibby v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly informed the appellant in the Acknowledgement Order of what was required to establish jurisdiction, and that the production of evidence would be necessary to show that the Board had jurisdiction and should grant a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 758 F.2d at <span id="Page_1939"></span>643. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">McGarigle v.

<p class="Body-Text">The muddle apparent in <span class="Italic">Willey</span> is caused by the Board's continuing confusion of a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction with the requirement of factual evidence demonstrating jurisdiction. Only the nonfrivolous allegation is required, according to <span class="Italic">Dumas v. MSPB</span>, 789 F.2d 892 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sanchez-Roig v. DHS</span>, AT-0752-13-0504-I-1 (NP 7/17/2014), provides a better description of the jurisdictional analysis in a coerced resignation appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Employee resignations are generally not adverse agency actions appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1123-24 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 9, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Nevertheless, in certain circumstances, an employee can establish that her resignation was tantamount to a forced or constructive removal that is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">E.g., Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 1328 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 9. All such constructive adverse action claims within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction have two things in common: (1) the employee lacked a meaningful choice in the matter; and (2) it was the agency's wrongful actions that deprived the employee of that choice. <span class="Italic">Bean v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). When the other jurisdictional requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 are met, proof of these two things is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board, the doctrine of coercive resignations applies only in "narrow" circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124; <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10. The issue is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, the employee's working conditions were made so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10 (citing <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). In making this determination, the Board will consider allegations of discrimination and reprisal only insofar as those allegations relate to the jurisdictional issue of whether an appellant has suffered an appealable adverse action, and not necessarily whether the allegations would establish discrimination or reprisal as an affirmative defense. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1341.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing in a constructive adverse action appeal based upon intolerable working conditions only after she sets forth allegations of fact that, if true, could show that her working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in her position would have been compelled to absent herself from the workplace. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 84, &#x00B6; 11 (2011). Additionally, the appellant must allege facts that, if proven, could demonstrate both that she put the agency on notice of the existence of the objectionable working conditions and that she requested assistance or remediation from the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "A denial of a request for a hearing would be proper where the claimant has failed to make allegations that, if proven, could satisfy one or more of the elements necessary to establish Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1344. As the Federal Circuit has stated, "[a]n allegation standing alone...is not sufficient. Although an appellant need not prove her entire case before she is entitled to a hearing, the [B]oard may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations." <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "Nonfrivolous" allegations warranting a hearing are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue; <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> allegations are insufficient to satisfy the nonfrivolous standard. <span class="Italic">E.g., Walker v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 391, &#x00B6; 6 &#x0026; n.2 (2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues in particular that the administrative judge failed to give due consideration to her allegations that her supervisors "singled her out, regularly denied her special assignments or promotions, required her to justify her time, and told others at the Agency that they could 'end up like Rebeca.'" The appellant's allegations, however, do not warrant a hearing. Even if she proved her factual allegations by preponderant evidence, and proved that the agency acted improperly in taking these actions, her allegations could not, under the totality of the circumstances as she alleged, establish that the agency deprived her of a meaningful choice as to whether to resign.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record suggests that the agency was forcing the appellant to make any type of decision in April 2013, and her decision to retire at that time appears to have been entirely self-initiated. <span class="Italic">See also Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15. We accept for purposes of this decision that she felt singled-out and mistreated for the reasons she cites. However, an employee is not guaranteed a stress-free working environment. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000). Dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions are generally not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">accord Searcy v. Department of Commerce</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 13 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 (generally, the Board will not have jurisdiction merely because "an employee decides to resign or retire because he does not want to accept a new assignment, a transfer, or other measures that the agency is authorized to adopt, even if those measures make continuation in the job so unpleasant for the employee that he feels that he has no realistic option but to leave"). The appellant's factual allegations do not describe circumstances that, if proven, could establish conditions so intolerable as would compel a reasonable person to resign. Even assuming some or all of the agency's alleged actions were wrong, unfair, or unlawful, as the appellant claims, she has not alleged circumstances that could have effectively denied her a meaningful choice to resign, which is a requisite element of a forced resignation within the Board's adverse action jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Bean</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 397, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further claims that the administrative judge improperly weighed the evidence regarding whether the appellant was demoted rather than reassigned. We assume, for purposes of our decision, that the appellant was demoted rather than merely reassigned, as she alleges. The appellant, however, has not alleged facts that could support a finding that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign following such a demotion under the circumstances. The appellant had recourse available to her regarding such a demotion, and the appellant has not alleged facts that could support a finding that her pursuit of a remedy through these available processes would have been a pointless exercise. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15 (instead of retiring based on her speculation that an adverse action might occur in the future, the appellant clearly had an option of contesting an action she thought was invalid if and when it did occur.); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (a resignation is not involuntary if the employee had a choice of whether to resign or contest the validity of the agency action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant claims that the administrative judge "altogether ignored how the Agency's discriminatory acts may have impacted [the appellant's] decision to involuntarily resign." We disagree. The initial decision reflects that the administrative judge appropriately considered the appellant's allegations of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984) (an administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that she did not consider it in reaching her decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table). In any event, we have considered the appellant's allegations of discrimination and retaliation, and we conclude that, even assuming that the appellant justifiably believed the agency's actions were discriminatory or retaliatory, she has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that she was compelled to resign under the totality of the circumstances. The record reflects that the appellant, who is an attorney, was pursuing her complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and there is no allegation that her complaints were not being properly considered there. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 15 (finding that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation of a coerced retirement, in part because, when she retired, she was pursuing her discrimination complaints through the EEO process, and the record did not reflect that her complaints were not being properly considered in that context).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nonfrivolous allegations sufficient to warrant a hearing on a claim of coerced resignation include allegations that the appellant hastily scribbled his resignation on a piece of paper while he was under the influence of alcohol, mentally impaired and emotionally upset following an argument with a manager. The employee's mental state and the time allowed to make a decision are material factors in determining the ability of an employee to exercise free choice and, if disputed, must be resolved at a hearing. <span class="Italic">Michaels v. USPS</span>, 44 MSPR 205, 207 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 37 MSPR 92, 94 (1988) (appellant was hospitalized when he accepted the agency's suggestion of resignation; there was some evidence of an agency offer of reemployment following his recovery). Another example of a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary resignation warranting a hearing is <span class="Italic">Cahill v. USDA</span>, 3 MSPR 505, 507, 4 MSPB 26 (1980) ("Appellant had alleged that he was placed on LWOP while on official travel status and that such action was taken without any notice to him. He maintains that he was forced to resign 'since he couldn't report at Martin and he was not allowed to report to Sturgis.'").
