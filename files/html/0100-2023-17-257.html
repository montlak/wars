<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW Local 80</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-141.html">55 FLRA 816</a>, 822 (1999), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 55 FLRA 1107 (1999), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW Local 80</span>, <span class="blue">57 FLRA 559</span> (2001), described the availability of liquidated damages in FLSA grievance cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[U]nder the FLSA, liquidated damages may be awarded in addition to monies owed employees for unpaid overtime compensation<span class="Italic">. See </span>29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b). An employee is not required to plead or specifically request liquidated damages when seeking relief under the FLSA. However, although liquidated damages are presumed, they may be reduced or eliminated if an employer shows that it acted in good faith and reasonableness when it nevertheless violated the FLSA<span class="Italic">. See Reich v. Tiller Helicopter Services, Inc., </span>8 F.3d 1018, 1030-31 (5th Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., </span>567 F.2d 429, 463-65 (D.C. Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="noindent">Entitlement to liquidated damages for failure to pay, or late payment of, required overtime was reiterated, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCI Englewood and AFGE Local 709</span>, 71 FLRA 8, 8-11 (2019) (Chairman Kiko and Member Abbott concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrator Kathy L.&#x2003;Eisenmenger determined that "the weight of...authority establishes that failure to pay overtime on the regular payday for the pay period in which it was worked is a violation of the FLSA." Supporting this finding, the Arbitrator cited the Department of Labor's implementing regulation, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 778.106, which requires "that overtime compensation earned in a particular workweek must be paid on the regular payday for the period in which such workweek ends." The Arbitrator also cited <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Complex, Florence, Colorado</span> (<span class="Italic">FCC Florence</span>), where the Authority applied &#x00A7; 778.106 to find that paying overtime to an employee on a payday later than the regular pay day for the pay period in which the employee actually worked the overtime hours, violates the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on this authority, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's untimely overtime payments violated the FLSA. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that, "in multiple instances," the Agency "failed to compensate employees who had worked overtime...within the same pay period for the work week of their regular hours" and thus violated &#x00A7; 778.106. Similarly, the Arbitrator found that the Agency "violated the FLSA, specifically...&#x00A7; 778.106, each instance when [it] delayed" overtime payments by one or more paydays.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finding an FLSA violation, the Arbitrator awarded liquidated damages. The Arbitrator found that liquidated damages are "mandatory and absolute for violations of [the] FLSA...unless an employer establishes its good faith and reasonable grounds for non-compliance under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260." She concluded that the Agency failed to establish grounds that would relieve it from paying liquidated damages. Accordingly, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to pay liquidated damages under the FLSA for "each...of the untimely overtime payments." In doing so, the Arbitrator noted that "[b]ecause the Union seeks liquidated damages, interest...is not available."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's claim, the FLSA does not distinguish between a violation where an agency never paid overtime due, and a violation where an agency failed to timely pay overtime due.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator specifically stated that she was not awarding interest. Moreover, the Arbitrator awarded liquidated damages as a consequence of the FLSA, rather than as a means of compensating employees for a delay in the payment of backpay.

<p class="noindent-1">Chairman Kiko notes that, even under the more specific Department of Labor overtime regulations, an employer may delay payment "[w]hen the correct amount of overtime compensation <span class="Italic">cannot</span> be determined until some time after the regular pay period," but the employer must pay any delayed compensation "as soon after the regular pay period as is <span class="Italic">practicable</span>."[1] However, the Arbitrator found that this exception did not apply here, and the Agency does not provide a basis for reversing that determination.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Member Abbott agrees with Chairman Kiko's comments concerning the intent and scope of 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 778.106. Member Abbott also notes that, in this case, the Agency concedes that it committed a technical violation of the FLSA. In the August 28, 2015 memorandum, the Agency admits that the FLSA requires employees to be compensated in a <span class="Italic">timely</span> manner and sets out the mechanism to be used to ensure that overtime is authorized and paid timely. Member Abbott does not believe that where, as here, the parties have a longstanding practice--whereby employees are consistently not paid for overtime worked until the next pay period following when they are paid for regular hours--that a violation of the FLSA has occurred. Under this scenario, the "as soon...as is practicable" language of &#x00A7; 778.106 seems to indicate that only payments made <span class="Italic">after</span> the <span class="Italic">next</span> pay period would constitute a violation.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's failure to award liquidated damages is contrary to law. Under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b), an employer who violates the FLSA is liable to affected employees for both unpaid overtime and liquidated damages unless the employer can establish an affirmative defense under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. Under &#x00A7; 260, liquidated damages are "mandatory" unless the employer can demonstrate that: (1) the act or omission giving rise to the employee's FLSA action was in good faith; and (2) the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that its act or omission was not a violation of the FLSA.[70] Because an employer bears the "substantial burden" of establishing the affirmative defense under &#x00A7; 260,[71] "the award of liquidated damages is the norm, and the denial of liquidated damages is the exception."[72]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency argues that the award is contrary to the FLSA because the Arbitrator wrongfully awarded liquidated damages to the Union.

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has explained that, to meet its burden, an employer must "affirmatively establish" that it attempted to discern the FLSA's requirements for the specific circumstances involved and comply with those requirements.[40] Further, the Authority has found that the good-faith requirement is not satisfied simply because the employer "did not purposefully violate the provisions of the FLSA."[41] In this regard, the Authority has held that liquidated damages were appropriate when an agency failed to take "active steps" to ascertain the FLSA's requirements, even if the agency had "legitimate reasons to question" the employees' entitlement to overtime pay.[42]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it acted in good faith because it "had established a lunch relief schedule for a number of years and had paid overtime to numerous employees over the years when they did not get their lunch relief." According to the Agency, this practice meant that the Agency did not need to consider the evidence provided by the Union that purportedly showed examples of unpaid overtime, because it had reason to believe "that employees were either being relieved for lunch or being compensated if they had not been relieved for lunch."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Arbitrator found that, early in the grievance process, the Agency had the information contained in the daily assignment rosters and "was in a position to object" if the Union's claims of uncompensated overtime were inaccurate, but failed to do so. The Arbitrator also found that an Agency witness conceded at arbitration that the Agency "could have taken a closer look" at the evidence submitted by the Union, but did <span id="page_2177"></span>not do so because it believed the process to be too time-consuming. The Arbitrator further found that "[a]ny records that could impeach the claims [of the Union were] in control of the Agency but the Agency refused to present the evidence claiming that the Union had failed to prove its case."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given these findings, the Arbitrator did not err in concluding that liquidated damages were appropriate under the FLSA. As the Arbitrator found that the Agency was presented with an opportunity to take "active steps"[48] to ascertain whether it had violated the FLSA--namely, by scrutinizing the daily assignment rosters provided by the Union--but neglected to do so, the Agency did not satisfy its "substantial burden"[49] of proving that it acted in good faith.</p>

<p class="noindent">On the subject of FLSA liquidated damages, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 46 FLRA 1063, 1072-74 (1992), sustained an arbitrator's award of those damages despite arguments that the FLSA only permitted courts, rather than arbitrators, to award liquidated damages. FLRA did not disturb the arbitrator's judgment that the failure of the agency to obtain guidance from OPM concerning the employees' exemption status demonstrated the "bad faith" necessary to sustain a liquidated damages award. An award of liquidated damages was also sustained in <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 49 FLRA 483, 489-90 (1994). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Academy and AFGE Local 896</span>, 63 FLRA 100 (2009), also reflects an award of FLSA liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Indian Head and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 280, 287 (2001), recapitulated the standards governing FLSA liquidated damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the award is contrary to law. In <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>the Authority delineated the standards for imposing liquidated damages under the FLSA. The Authority stated that the FLSA in effect establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime shall be awarded liquidated damages, unless the employer shows that the 'act or omission giving rise [to the violation of the FLSA] was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]. <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1481, citing 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. In this regard, an employer in violation of the FLSA has a 'substantial burden' of proving that he acted in good faith and on a reasonable belief [that] he was in compliance [,] and thus double damages are the norm, single damages are the exception. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Authority noted that at least one reviewing court has ruled that an employer's failure to take affirmative steps to ascertain its employees' exemption status, particularly where there have been changes in regulation or the employer has information calling into question its employees' status, demonstrates that the employer lacked good faith in complying with the responsibilities imposed by the FLSA. <span class="Italic">FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1483, citing <span class="Italic">Bankston v. State of Illinois</span>, 60 F.3d 1249, 1255 (7th Cir. 1995). Here, the Agency has offered no evidence that it took affirmative steps that would meet the substantial burden necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of liquidated damages. Thus, we affirm the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the Agency did not act in good faith with reasonable grounds that its determination was lawful....</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award's denial of liquidated damages is contrary to law</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that &#x00A7; 216(b) required the Arbitrator to award liquidated damages in this case. As mentioned <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 3, &#x00A7; 216(b) states that, in addition to an employer's liability for unpaid overtime compensation, the employer is liable for liquidated damages in an amount equal to the unpaid overtime, unless the employer qualifies for the goodfaith, reasonable-basis defense under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA 143, 146 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 987</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1482 (1998)). In other words, where an employer is liable for unpaid overtime under the FLSA, and the employer does not establish an affirmative defense, liquidated damages are <span class="Italic">mandatory</span>. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 14647; <span class="Italic">accord Brock v.

<p class="noindent-1">In order establish a goodfaith, reasonable-basis defense under &#x00A7; 260, the employer must demonstrate that: (1) the act or omission giving rise to the employee's FLSA action was in good faith (the good-faith requirement); and (2) the employer had reasonable grounds for believing that its act or omission was not a violation of the FLSA (the reasonable-basis requirement). 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260; <span class="Italic">Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA at 146. The "substantial burden" of satisfying these two requirements, "in effect, establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime [compensation] shall be awarded liquidated damages." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1481 (internal quotation marks omitted). As relevant here, to satisfy the good-faith requirement, an employer must "show[ ] that [it] subjectively acted with an honest intention to ascertain what the [FLSA] requires and to act in accordance with it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (and sources cited therein). Thus, an employer does not demonstrate good faith merely by showing that its violation of the FLSA was unintentional. <span class="Italic">Reich v. S. New England Telecomm. Corp.</span>, 121 F.3d 58, 71-72 (2d Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Reich</span>). <span class="Italic">Cf. Elwell v. Univ. Hosp.

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator refused to award liquidated damages because, unlike a trial judge, he made his "decision...pursuant to arbitration under the [Agreement]." However, as stated earlier, &#x00A7; 216(b) not only provides arbitrators the same authority as judges to award liquidated damages, <span class="Italic">see Local 446</span>, 58 FLRA at 362, but in the absence of a &#x00A7; 260 affirmative defense, it mandates awarding such damages to a grievant prevailing on a FLSA claim, <span class="Italic">see Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA at 146-47; <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 46 FLRA at 107273. Thus, we find that the Arbitrator's grounds for refusing to award liquidated damages are contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for whether the Agency established a &#x00A7; 260 good-faith, reasonable-basis defense against liquidated damages, the Agency identifies three arbitral findings to demonstrate that it did. First, the Agency notes that the former supervisor did not act with ill will. Yet the absence of intent to violate the FLSA does not satisfy the good-faith requirement. <span class="Italic">Reich</span>, 121 F.3d at 7172 ("ignorance of...prevailing law" insufficient to demonstrate good faith). Second, the Agency argues that the current supervisor "merely unwittingly allowed" a violation of the FLSA. But because the current supervisor "was aware of the early start[ ]time practice" and did not act to terminate it, the Agency has not established that the current supervisor demonstrated "an honest intention to ascertain what the [FLSA] requires and to act in accordance with it." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1481; <span class="Italic">accord Barfield v. N.Y.C. Health &#x0026; Hosps. Corp.</span>, 537 F.3d 132, 15051 (2d Cir. 2008) (finding of good faith precluded where employer did not take "active steps" to ascertain FLSA requirements and act affirmatively to comply). Third, the Agency cites the Arbitrator's finding that the official above the current supervisor immediately stopped the early start-time practice once he learned of it. Nevertheless, that does not establish good faith with respect to the Agency's FLSA noncompliance <span class="Italic">prior to</span> that official's action. Thus, we find that the Agency failed to satisfy the goodfaith requirement of &#x00A7; 260,[6] and that, as a result, it has not established an affirmative defense against liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;An employer must satisfy both of the requirements of &#x00A7; 260 to establish a defense against liquidated damages, and as we have found that the Agency has not demonstrated that it satisfied the good-faith requirement, it is unnecessary to address whether the Agency satisfied the reasonable-basis requirement. <span class="Italic">See Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA at 147 n.8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under these circumstances, the FLSA mandates an award of liquidated damages to the grievant. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) (FLSA violator "<span class="Italic">shall be liable</span>...in the amount of...unpaid overtime compensation...and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages" (emphasis added)). The Union requests that the Authority modify the award to include liquidated damages, and its request is consistent with Authority precedent, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 148184 (after reviewing bases on which agency alleged good faith and reasonable basis, Authority set aside arbitrator's determination that agency established &#x00A7; 260 defense and modified award to include liquidated damages). Therefore, we modify the award to include such damages in an amount equal to the overtime compensation due the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and FDIC</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1481-84 (1998), set aside a portion of an award denying liquidated damages for overtime. FLRA, reviewing the record <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, considered the extent of the employer's inquiries concerning the employees' exemption status and discounted evidence of industry practice:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress provided in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) that an employer who violates the FLSA's overtime provisions "shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of...their overtime compensation...and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages...." The standard for when an award of liquidated damages is appropriate is set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. That standard, in effect, establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime shall be awarded liquidated damages, unless the employer shows that "the act or omission giving rise [to the violation of the FLSA] was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260.

<p class="noindent-1">Upon review, the determination whether liquidated damages have been properly denied or awarded under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260, requires a legal conclusion based on factual findings regarding whether conduct constitutes either "good faith" or "reasonableness." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bankston v. State of Illinois</span>, 60 F.3d 1249, 1254 (7th Cir. 1995) (the district court's application of law to the facts is reviewed <span class="Italic">de novo</span>) (<span class="Italic">Bankston</span>); <span class="Italic">Dybach v. State of Florida Department of Corrections</span>, 942 F.2d 1562, 1566-67 (11th Cir. 1991) (questions involving the application of legal principles to established facts are legal; "as a matter of law" the evidence did not establish "good faith" under section 260) (<span class="Italic">Dybach</span>); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 940 F.2d at 908 (the district court's finding that the employer acted "reasonably" was a legal conclusion; the "court erred as a matter of law" by making that conclusion). Thus, an arbitrator's conclusion that his or her factual findings establish "good faith" or "reasonableness" under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 is a legal conclusion that the Authority reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span> under section 7122(a)(1) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 50 FLRA at 332. If the factual findings do not constitute "good faith" or "reasonableness," a denial of liquidated damages is inconsistent with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator's specific factual findings, as relevant here, are that: (1) the Agency only made two informal inquiries into its compliance with the FLSA; (2) it took no affirmative steps to ascertain its employees' exemption status in the face of court decisions and regulatory changes to the FLSA; and (3) other agencies continued the same exemption status as the FDIC. We conclude, for the reasons explained below, that these findings do not support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency met its burden of showing good faith and reasonableness.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first factual finding, the inquiries made by an employer concerning compliance with the FLSA are clearly relevant to determining whether the employer acted in good faith and reasonably. <span class="Italic">See Martin</span>, 940 F.2d at 909. In <span class="Italic">Renfro v. City of Emporia, Kansas</span>, 948 F.2d 1529, 1541 (10th Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">Renfro</span>), the court ruled that the employer did not meet its burden of proof under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 because the only inquiry made by the employer was a phone call to an individual at DOL whose position was unknown. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Mireles</span>, 899 F.2d at 1415 (discussions with those not involved with enforcing the FLSA fails to demonstrate good faith). The <span class="Italic">Renfro</span> court found it significant that the employer never requested a written opinion from DOL. 948 F.2d at 1541. Even where opinion letters are sought by an employer, reliance on those letters does not satisfy the good faith and reasonableness standard unless there is a "showing that the employer received advice on the specific compliance issue in question, not just that he sought advice about the statute." <span class="Italic">Kinney</span>, 994 F.2d at 12. Thus, the failure to request "any specific advice" is evidence that the employer did not act in good faith<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the only attempts made by the Agency to ascertain its employees' exemption status were two informal telephone inquiries to OPM in 1993. These inquiries concerned general application of exemption criteria, not the specific exemption status of examiners and liquidators. In addition, the individual at the Agency who made the calls was not responsible for making determinations about employees' exemption status. Moreover, the Arbitrator specifically found that the inquiries were directed to someone "whose status to speak for OPM was not certified--formally or informally[,]" and that the individual making the inquiries failed to inquire into the title, grade or status of the person contacted at OPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Arbitrator's second factual finding, at least one reviewing court has ruled that an employer's failure to take affirmative steps to ascertain its employees' exemption status, particularly where there have been changes in regulation or the employer has information calling into question its employees' status, demonstrates that the employer lacked good faith in complying with the responsibilities imposed by the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bankston</span>, 60 F.3d at 1255. The Arbitrator here found that the Agency maintained the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> despite court decisions that "rais[ed] substantial doubt about [the appropriate] standards on exemption." In particular, the 1993 inquiries occurred 6 years after the D.C. Circuit's decision vacating OPM's FLSA exemption regulations, and 5 years after OPM made regulatory changes to its exemption provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, as to the Arbitrator's third factual finding, following industry practice does not support a conclusion that an employer acted appropriately in exempting its employees from the FLSA. Specifically, "[i]n lieu of any affirmative attempt by an employer to determine the legality of its wage payment practices, the employer's adherence to customary and widespread practices that violate the Act's over-time pay provisions is not evidence of an objectively reasonable good faith violation." <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 940 F.2d at 910. Therefore, "reasonableness" is not supported by the Arbitrator's finding that "other federal agencies, with similar responsibilities for financial examination, continued the same exemption status as the FDIC, in about the same grade levels...." Contrary to the Arbitrator's finding that this fact supported a conclusion that the Agency acted in good faith, industry practice in determining status under the FLSA is not persuasive. <span class="Italic">See Brock</span>, 833 F.2d at 19-20. Thus, the Arbitrator's conclusion that this finding established good faith is erroneous.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Arbitrator's factual findings do not support his legal conclusion that the Agency met its substantial burden to establish that liquidated damages were not warranted. <span class="Italic">See Bankston</span>, 60 F.3d at 1255; <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 940 F.2d at 909; <span class="Italic">Brock</span>, 833 F.2d at 19-20. Accordingly, we conclude that the award denying liquidated damages is deficient as contrary to 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260, and modify the award to include the payment of liquidated damages to those examiners and liquidators who were wrongfully classified as exempt under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent">As to liquidated damages for an FLSA violation involving time that is not overtime, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Park Police and FOP</span>, 73 FLRA 276, 278-29 (2022), determined that the rate of pay in damages is calculated at the FLSA minimum wage:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the remedial award is contrary to law because it requires the Agency to pay liquidated damages for non-overtime wages that are above the federal minimum wage. Specifically, the Agency notes that the FLSA only protects the nonpayment of the federal minimum wage and overtime. Because liquidated damages merely double the amount of damages that are required by the FLSA, the Agency notes that "courts have dismissed claims" where "a plaintiff sought liquidated damages for the failure to timely pay contractual wages that were higher than the minimum wage." When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding liquidated damages, &#x00A7; 216 of the FLSA states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[a]ny employer who violates the provisions of [&#x00A7;] 206 or [&#x00A7;] 207 of this title shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages, or their unpaid overtime compensation, as the case may be, and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the Union argues that the FLSA's reference to "their unpaid minimum wages" means each claimant's regular wage, this argument is inconsistent with the FLSA's plain wording. Rather, &#x00A7; 216 states that a claimant is owed damages only if their employer violates the FLSA by not paying them either the requisite statutory minimum wage, or overtime at the claimant's regular rate of pay. As a result, courts have noted that the FLSA's "statutory language simply does not contemplate a claim for wages other than minimum or overtime wages."[29] Furthermore, the Union does not cite any cases where a court applied the FLSA to justify awarding liquidated damages for non-overtime wages at a rate above the federal minimum wage under the circumstances presented by this case.[30] Therefore, the cases that the Union cites do not support its arguments.</p>

Thus, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">Barwinczak</span> does not support its arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because the FLSA implicitly states that it does not provide for a claim of non-overtime wages that are above the statutory minimum wage, it follows that a claimant also cannot recover non-overtime wages at their regular rate of pay as liquidated damages.[31] Moreover, the Agency correctly notes that the Arbitrator failed to cite to any legal authority which states that non-overtime wages above the statutory minimum wage are available as liquidated damages. Rather, the DOL guidance cited by the Arbitrator only states that <span class="Italic">overtime hours</span> "must be paid at a rate of at least one and one-half times the employee's regular rate of pay."[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We grant the Agency's remaining contrary-to-law exception and find that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the grievants are owed liquidated damages for non-overtime hours worked at a rate of pay above the FLSA's minimum wage. Consequently, we modify the remedial award to state that the grievants are owed liquidated damages for non-overtime work <span class="Italic">only</span> in the amount of any wages recovered at the FLSA's relevant statutory minimum-wage rate.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the FLSA by not paying officers for the travel time, and we have either dismissed or denied each of the Agency's exceptions to that finding. Therefore, the Agency is liable for liquidated damages unless it proved the good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260.[54] Here, the Arbitrator found that, "[f]or the same reasons" that the Union did not establish that the Agency acted willfully, "the Union has failed to establish that it is entitled to liquid[ated] damages." But, as discussed above, the Union does not bear the burden to establish that it is entitled to liquidated damages.[56] Rather, the Agency must prove that the Union is not entitled to liquidated damages.[57]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As part of its argument that the Agency failed to meet this burden, the Union argues that the Arbitrator incorrectly equated her finding that the Agency's FLSA violation was not willful with a demonstration of good faith. In this regard, it is well established that a finding that an agency did not willfully violate the FLSA does not prove that the agency established the good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense.[59] Therefore, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA does not demonstrate that the Agency established the affirmative defense to liquidated damages under &#x00A7; 260.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 2571</span>, 67 FLRA at 594; <span class="Italic">see also Adams v. United States</span>, 46 Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Agency failed to meet its burden because the Agency did not present any evidence that it attempted to ascertain and comply with the FLSA's requirements. As discussed above, to avoid liquidated damages, an employer must "affirmatively establish" that it attempted to discern the FLSA's requirements for the specific circumstances involved[61] and comply with those requirements.[62] Here, the Agency did not argue to the Arbitrator that it took steps to ascertain whether the travel time was compensable when it began the challenged pay practice. Rather, the Agency argued that it was "clearly acting in good faith and had reasonable grounds to believe" that its practice complied with the FLSA because the Union had not advanced any complaint or request for overtime that would have "trigger[ed] a review" of the practice. But, as discussed above, the Agency's longstanding failure to pay for travel time does not provide a sufficient basis for finding that the Agency proved the good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense.[64]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency did not demonstrate to the Arbitrator that it acted both with good faith and with a reasonable basis to believe that it complied with the FLSA, we find that the Agency did not satisfy its burden to establish the affirmative defense to liquidated damages under &#x00A7; 260.

In this regard, the Arbitrator credited the testimony of an Agency FLSA classification specialist who stated that the original exemption designations were not erroneous, but that she had made the changes based on guidance from the Agency to "look at these [positions] differently" and to "err on the side of the employee."[24] Furthermore, in accordance with the FLSA, the Agency paid the grievants for any unpaid overtime, plus interest, prior to arbitration.[25]</p>

<p class="noindent">A case was remanded for assessment by an arbitrator of entitlement to FLSA liquidated damages, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW, Local 80</span>, 57 FLRA 430, 435 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 216(b) of title 29 of the United States Code provides that an employer who violates the provisions of section 206 of the FLSA shall be liable to the employee or employees affected in the amount of...their overtime compensation...and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages.... The standard for when an award of liquidated damages is appropriate is set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">if the employer shows...that the act or omission giving rise to such action was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that is his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA]...the court may, in its sound discretion, award no liquidated damages or award any amount thereof not to exceed the amount specified in section 216 of this title.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that Section 260, in effect, "establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime...be awarded liquidated damages, unless the employer shows that 'the act or omission giving rise [to the violation of the FLSA] was in good faith and that he had reasonable grounds for believing that his act or omission was not a violation of the [FLSA].' <span class="Italic">FDIC, </span>53 FLRA at 1481 (citations omitted). An employer who has violated the FLSA bears 'a substantial burden of proving that he acted in good faith and on a reasonable belief he was in compliance.' ["] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the FLSA by failing to pay the grievant the proper overtime based on his performance of nonexempt work. Although the Arbitrator determined that the Agency's action was not willful as it concerned the appropriate statute of limitation for the recovery of back pay, as the Agency acknowledges, he did not address the issue of liquidated damages. Rather, the Arbitrator related the Union's request for liquidated damages in this case to the issue concerning standby duty involved in <span class="Italic">NOAA </span>and determined that as the standby issue was not before him, he would take no action...with regard to liquidated damages. This view of the circumstances under which liquidated damages might be awarded, however, was too limited.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 260 establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime is entitled to liquidated damages, unless the employer rebuts the presumption as discussed above. Therefore, the Arbitrator erred by concluding that he could not take any action with respect to liquidated damages in this case. Because the Arbitrator did not address liquidated damages for the period covered by his award as to the first grievance, he did not make any findings as to whether the Agency's actions were in good faith and whether the Agency had reasonable grounds for believing that its actions did not violate the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FDIC,</span> 53 FLRA at 1481-82. Consequently, we remand the issue of liquidated damages to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to determine whether such liquidated damages should be awarded to the grievant for the period at issue in the first grievance, and whether such liquidated damages, if any, should be limited or reduced based on the Agency's conduct.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously held that the "willfulness" standard set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 255(a) is legally distinct from the "good-faith" affirmative defense contained in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260.[20] Therefore, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency did not act in good faith under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 does not resolve whether the Agency acted willfully, and the Union is incorrect in asserting that the Arbitrator made such a finding. Rather, the Arbitrator made no finding as to whether the Agency's violations of the FLSA were committed willfully.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987 and Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB</span>, 66 FLRA 143, 145-47 (2011), determined that an arbitrator improperly denied liquidated damages when the agency's defense to the failure to pay FLSA overtime (converted from compensatory time) was the agency's reliance on DFAS to maintain proper payroll accounting and payments:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is deficient because it does not hold the Agency liable for underpayments to the grievant. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that, because the Agency was not "at fault" and had "no control" over DFAS, the Agency complied with its FLSA obligations, notwithstanding the underpayments to the grievant. Under the FLSA, an employer is liable for "any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of [the] employer in relation to an employee." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203(d). Thus, "[f]or purposes of the FLSA, [a payroll processor] is an 'extension' of the employer[ ]." <span class="Italic">Chao</span>, 547 F.3d at 943 (quoting &#x00A7; 203(d)'s definition of "employer"). In addition, in cases involving arbitral awards of backpay with interest under the Back Pay Act (BPA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, the Authority has rejected the assertion that a DoD component bears no responsibility or liability for untimely payments to an employee, where such delays allegedly resulted from the actions of payroll-processor DFAS. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 880, 885-86 (2000) (<span class="Italic">DODEA I</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 873, 878 (2000) (<span class="Italic">DODEA II</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, in both <span class="Italic">DODEA I </span>and <span class="Italic">DODEA II</span>, the DoD employing subcomponent argued that it had "no control over" DFAS and that the employing subcomponent could not "determine...the actions of a separately regulated entity...merely because [that entity, DFAS,] is an agent of the employing" subcomponent. 56 FLRA at 885 (internal quotation marks omitted); 56 FLRA at 878 (same). The Authority rejected those arguments in <span class="Italic">DODEA I </span>and <span class="Italic">DODEA II </span>because they "seem[ed] to imply that DFAS, as opposed to the [a]gency, somehow [was] liable to the grievant," when, in fact, the employing subcomponent bore the responsibility and liability for ensuring proper payment of its employees. 56 FLRA at 886; 56 FLRA at 878. <span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Capitol Police Bd.</span>, Case No. 01-ARB-01(CP), 2002 WL 34461687 (Bd. of Dirs. of Office of Compliance) (Feb. 25, 2002) (upholding arbitrator's liquidated damages award under FLSA because of payment delays to grievant, despite employing office's allegation that payroll processor, National Finance Center, bore responsibility).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Arbitrator found that private-sector precedent holding an employer liable for its payroll processor did not apply to these circumstances, neither the definition of "employer" in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 203(d), nor the Authority's analysis in <span class="Italic">DODEA I </span>and <span class="Italic">DODEA II</span>, recognizes a distinction between an employing agency and its payroll processing agent for backpay liability purposes. <span class="Italic">Cf. Phila. Naval Base, Phila. Naval Station &#x0026; Phila. Naval Shipyard</span>, 37 FLRA 79, 87-88 (1990) (finding it an unfair labor practice for an agency's subsidiary to refuse to bargain over its employees' working conditions, despite that subsidiary's claim that a different subsidiary of the agency exercised discretion over those conditions). Further, the Agency does not argue, and we discern no basis for finding, that the Authority's analysis in <span class="Italic">DODEA I </span>and <span class="Italic">DODEA II </span>should be limited to cases under the BPA. We note, in this regard, that the relevant analysis in <span class="Italic">DODEA I </span>and <span class="Italic">DODEA II </span>did not depend on the particular statutory wording of the BPA, but rather concerned an employing agency's general liability to its employees for any failures to properly compensate them as required by law or contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law by relying on the Agency's alleged lack of control over DFAS as the basis for relieving the Agency of its liability as an employer under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is deficient to the extent that it found that the Agency established a good-faith defense against all FLSA liability under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As previously mentioned, <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 5, and as relevant here, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259 excuses an employer from all FLSA liability when the employer establishes that it acted in good-faith reliance on a written administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, or interpretation of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor (Administrator) concerning the employer's obligations under FLSA. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 259(a)-(b)(1). The Authority has previously found this defense applicable only to parties establishing good-faith reliance on materials issued by the Administrator in particular. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin, Balt., Md.</span>, 47 FLRA 819, 832 (1993) (good-faith reliance on OPM regulations does not satisfy &#x00A7; 259). Although the Agency contends that it qualifies for a &#x00A7; 259 good-faith defense, the Agency does not allege that it acted in good-faith reliance on materials issued by the Administrator. Thus, we find that the Agency has not satisfied the requirements for a good-faith defense under &#x00A7; 259.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have found that the Agency is not entitled to a &#x00A7; 259 defense, and as the Agency admits the underpayment of overtime to the grievant, we find further that the Agency violated 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a)(1) because it employed the grievant for more than forty hours in a workweek but did not pay him the legally required minimum rate of compensation for his overtime work. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 551.531(g) (agencies must liquidate comp time at overtime rate applicable when comp time earned). In addition, because 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) states that an employer that violates &#x00A7; 207 "shall be liable" for the unpaid overtime compensation, we find that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law by failing to direct the Agency to pay the grievant the difference in the amount he received for his liquidated aged comp time and the amount to which he was entitled, and we modify the award to direct the Agency to compensate the grievant in the amount of that underpayment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award is deficient for finding that the Agency satisfied the two requirements of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 to establish a good-faith, reasonable-basis defense against liability for FLSA liquidated damages. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to an employer's liability for past due overtime wages, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) states that an employer is liable to affected employees for liquidated damages in an amount equal to the unpaid wages, unless the employer qualifies for the good-faith, reasonable-basis defense under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA 1469, 1482 (1998). As previously mentioned, <span class="Italic">supra </span>note 5, and as relevant here, in order establish a good-faith, reasonable-basis defense against liquidated damages under 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260, the employer must demonstrate: (1) "that <span class="Italic">the act or omission giving </span>rise to [the employee's FLSA] action <span class="Italic">was in good faith </span>and [(2)] that [the employer] <span class="Italic">had reasonable grounds for believing that [its]</span><span class="Italic"></span><span class="Italic"> act or omission was not a violation</span>" of the FLSA (emphases added). If the employer satisfies those two requirements, then 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260 further provides that the adjudicator may "award no liquidated damages or award any amount [of liquidated damages that does not] exceed the amount" of unpaid overtime wages due to the employee. The "substantial burden" of satisfying the two requirements for the &#x00A7; 260 defense, <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1481 (internal quotation marks omitted), "in effect, establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime [compensation] shall be awarded liquidated damages," <span class="Italic">id. </span>Consequently, the award of liquidated damages is the norm, and the denial of liquidated damages is the exception. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Kinney v.

<p class="noindent-1">When applying &#x00A7; 260, a finding of "[g]ood faith" requires "a showing that the employer subjectively acted with an honest intention to ascertain what the [FLSA] requires and to act in accordance with it[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1481 (and sources cited therein).

Cooper Elec. Supply Co.</span>, 940 F.2d 896, 907 (3d Cir. 1991)). Thus, the failure to request "any specific advice" about the compliance issue in question is evidence that the employer did not act in good faith. <span class="Italic">Kinney</span>, 994 F.2d at 12.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not contend that it requested "any specific advice" regarding whether the repeated underpayments to the grievant satisfied the Agency's obligations under the FLSA. The Agency's contention that it filed "remedy tickets" with DFAS <span class="Italic">after </span>the grievant notified it of the problem, also does not establish good faith because "lack of knowledge" does not excuse the underpayments that occurred up to that point. <span class="Italic">See Chao</span>, 547 F.3d at 942. In this regard, the "fact that an employer has broken the law for a long time without complaints from <span id="page_2182"></span>employees does not demonstrate the requisite good faith required by the [FLSA]." <span class="Italic">Williams v. Tri-County Growers, Inc.</span>, 747 F.2d 121, 129 (3d Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">Williams</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Reich v. S. New England Telecomm. Corp.</span>, 121 F.3d 58, 71 (2d Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">Reich</span>). Moreover, with regard to the Agency's argument that it "never refused to correct the problem" of underpaying the grievant, the fact that an employer "did not purposefully violate the provisions of the FLSA is not sufficient to establish that it acted in good faith." <span class="Italic">Reich</span>, 121 F.3d at 71; <span class="Italic">accord Williams</span>, 747 F.2d at 129. <span class="Italic">Cf. NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1481-84 (after reviewing bases on which agency alleged good faith and reasonable basis, Authority set aside arbitrator's determination that agency established &#x00A7; 260 defense and modified award to include liquidated damages). Consequently, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that it satisfied the first requirement for an affirmative defense against liquidated damages under &#x00A7; 260,[8] and, as such, we set aside the Arbitrator's contrary finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Because an employer must satisfy both of the requirements in &#x00A7; 260 to establish a defense against liquidated damages, and we have found that the Agency has not demonstrated that it satisfied the first requirement, it is unnecessary to address whether the Agency satisfied the second requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) requires that an employer that violates the FLSA "<span class="Italic">shall be liable</span>...in the amount of...unpaid overtime compensation...<span class="Italic">and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages</span>." (emphases added). As we have found that the Agency does not qualify for an affirmative defense against liquidated damages, we find further that the award is inconsistent with 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) because it does not award liquidated damages. Accordingly, we modify the award to direct the Agency to pay the grievant liquidated damages in an amount equal to that which he was underpaid for his liquidated aged comp time, as discussed in Section IV.B. above.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator based his denial of liquidated damages on his finding that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA.&#x2003;However, finding that an agency did not act willfully does not establish that it acted in good faith. The willfulness standard pertains to determinations concerning the FLSA's statute of limitations,[20] an issue not involved in this case. By contrast, the good-faith, reasonable-basis standard pertains to determinations concerning whether an agency has established an affirmative defense to avoid payment of liquidated damages under the FLSA.[21] The burden of proof to establish willfulness falls on the employee; but the burden of proof to establish a good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense falls on the employer.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency did not willfully violate the FLSA does not provide a basis for concluding that the Agency established a good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense to avoid liquidated damages under the FLSA.[23]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">We modify the award to include liquidated damages</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency fails to establish a good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense under &#x00A7; 260, the FLSA mandates an award of liquidated damages to a grievant who prevails on an FLSA claim.[24] The Agency argues that the Authority must deny the Union's request that the Authority modify the award to include liquidated damages. The Agency gives two reasons: (1) the Authority should defer to the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency's actions were not willful; and (2) the Agency had no knowledge that its employees were working overtime. However, the Agency does not claim that the Arbitrator found the required good-faith, reasonable-basis affirmative defense necessary for the Agency to avoid liquidated damages under the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 216(b) (FLSA violator "shall be liable...in the amount of...unpaid overtime compensation...and in an additional equal amount as liquidated damages").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's arguments do not support denying the Union's request that the award be modified to include liquidated damages. First, as stated above, the willfulness standard does not pertain to determinations concerning liquidated damages.[27]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[27]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Herman</span>, 183 F.3d at 474.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Agency's claim that it had no knowledge that its employees were working overtime fails to demonstrate that the Agency acted in good faith.[28] The Arbitrator found that the Agency's failure to ascertain the hours worked by its employees was negligent. But the Agency did not file exceptions and, thus, has not effectively disputed the Arbitrator's negligence finding.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[28]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Local 1662</span>, 66 FLRA at 927.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This undisputed finding, that the Agency was "negligent," precludes finding that the Agency acted in good faith.[31] "An employer who acted negligently...in violating the FLSA would not be able to satisfy the objective standard of reasonableness required to demonstrate good faith."[32] Accordingly, because the Arbitrator's finding of negligence precludes the Agency from establishing a good-faith, reasonable-basis defense, we modify the award to include liquidated damages in an amount equal to the overtime compensation due the grievants.</p>

<p class="noindent">The failure of an agency to obtain advice or guidance on a complex issue of FLSA overtime entitlement led FLRA to sustain an award of liquidated damages, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 838, 842-43 (2012) (recon. den., 67 FLRA 251 (2014)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the awards are contrary to law because the Arbitrator improperly awarded liquidated damages.&#x2003;The standard for when an award of liquidated damages is appropriate is set forth in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260. "That standard, in effect, establishes a presumption that an employee who is improperly denied overtime shall be awarded liquidated damages." NTEU, 53 FLRA 1469, 1481 (1998). To avoid an award of liquidated damages, an employer bears the substantial burden of establishing a good-faith, reasonable-basis defense. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(quoting <span class="Italic">Kinney v. District of Columbia</span>, 994 F.2d 6, 12 (D.C. Cir. 1993)). To satisfy these two requirements, the employer must show: (1) that its act or omission giving rise to the violation of the FLSA was in good faith, and (2) that it had reasonable grounds for believing that it was in compliance with the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. To meet this burden, the employer must establish that it attempted to ascertain the FLSA's requirements. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has failed to demonstrate that it acted in good faith.<span class="Italic"> </span>Here, we defer to the Arbitrator's factual findings because the Agency does not allege that those findings are nonfacts. His findings demonstrate that the Agency presented no evidence establishing that it took any action to ascertain its obligations, such as consulting with OPM's legal counsel or attending seminars, concerning the FLSA. Moreover, the Agency does not contend that it requested "any specific advice" from OPM about its compliance with the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See </span>Exceptions at 32 n.21 (arguing only that "OPM did not take a contrary position or otherwise correct [the Agency's] view of FLSA['s] non-applicability"). Rather, the Agency merely asserts that, because the law concerning COPRA is complex, it demonstrated that it acted in good faith when it determined that COPRA precludes officers from receiving compensation under the FLSA. However, "ignorance of the prevailing law or uncertainty about its development" does not demonstrate that an employer acted in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Reich v. S. New England Telecomm. Corp.</span>, 121 F.3d 58, 71 (2d Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">cf. Bull v. United States</span>, 68 Fed. Cl. 212, 275 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Bull I</span>) (finding that "[p]roof that the law is uncertain, ambiguous or complex" may provide a basis for finding that the second requirement of &#x00A7; 260 is met) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Agency claims that it demonstrated good faith because its unwavering position was that COPRA was the exclusive pay regime for officers and it consistently informed managers and employees of this position. The Authority has found, however, that "the fact that an employer has broken the law for a long time without complaints from employees does not demonstrate the requisite good faith required by the FLSA." <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA 143, 147 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 987</span>) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that it acted in good faith because COPRA's legislative history supports its conclusion that COPRA was intended to be the exclusive pay regime for officers. The court in <span class="Italic">Bull II </span>clearly found, however, that "[n]othing in [COPRA's] legislative history suggests that FLSA overtime compensation, as historically available to Customs workers, was being abolished by COPRA." <span class="Italic">See Bull II</span>,479 F.3d at 1377, 1380. Accordingly, this argument also provides no support for its contention. <span class="Italic">See Bull I</span>, 68 Fed. Cl. at 275-76 (rejecting defendant's claim that "its reliance upon its interpretation of COPRA...constitute[d] a good faith basis for not compensating...officers pursuant to the FLSA" and awarding liquidated damages) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency contends that the Union, by agreeing to a provision in the parties' agreement that limited the rights of bargaining unit employees to receive overtime compensation, acquiesced in the Agency's position concerning COPRA's exclusivity. This contention, however, is irrelevant to whether the Agency acted in good faith. <span class="Italic">See Local 987</span>, 66 FLRA at 147 (finding that, to establish that it acted in good faith, an employer's contentions must demonstrate that it honestly intended to ascertain the FLSA's requirements and then acted in accordance with those requirements); <span class="Italic">see also Bull I</span>, 68 Fed. Cl. at 275 (concluding that, although the defendant claimed that its reliance on its interpretation of the parties' agreement "constitute[d] a good faith basis for not compensating canine...officers pursuant to the FLSA[,]" it failed to demonstrate that it acted in good faith by attempting to determine the FLSA's requirements) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The determination of whether the Arbitrator properly awarded liquidated damages under the FLSA, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 260, requires a legal conclusion of whether the Agency's conduct was in "good faith" or "reasonable[ ]." <span class="Italic">See NTEU, </span>53 FLRA 1469, 1482 (1998).

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator expressly concluded that the Agency had failed to show that its imposition of the compressed work schedule without the payment of overtime premium pay was reasonable or in good faith.&#x2003;In claiming that the award is deficient, the Agency asserts that it acted in good faith because it attempted to negotiate the compressed work schedule and that liquidated damages are unwarranted because no employees opted out of the compressed work schedule. These assertions provide no basis for finding the award of liquidated damages deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's actions in imposing the compressed work schedule on unit employees under the Work Schedules Act without the express authorization of a collective bargaining agreement directly violated &#x00A7; 6130(a)(2). The Agency's actions were also contrary to the <span class="Italic">Handbook</span>, which the Agency, itself, cited to the Arbitrator to support its actions. OPM specifically advises agencies that nothing in the Work Schedules Act authorizes the unilateral imposition by an agency of a compressed work schedule on unit employees. Moreover, the Agency fails to establish that despite these provisions, it attempted to ascertain whether the Work Schedules Act otherwise authorized its unilateral imposition of 10-hour workdays without the payment of overtime premium pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In these circumstances, the Agency fails to show good faith and reasonableness and fails to meet the substantial burden necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of liquidated damages.

<p class="noindent-1">In one respect, the Arbitrator's award is, on its face, contrary to the Back Pay Act and its implementing regulations. The Arbitrator awarded overtime pay plus interest under the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">and </span>overtime pay under the FLSA, <span class="Italic">and </span>liquidated damages. This is clearly inconsistent with basic entitlement rules under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.101(c) (employees entitled to overtime pay under the FLSA are not also entitled to overtime pay under title 5). <span class="Italic">See also Lanehart v.

Because we find below that the Arbitrator's award of FLSA damages is deficient, it is not necessary for the Authority to address this issue.</p>
<p class="noindent">Interest on an FLSA back pay award is mandatory. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and VAMC Asheville</span>, 58 FLRA 361, 361-62 (2003); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 405 and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Butner</span>, 67 FLRA 395, 398 (2014) (interest under the Back Pay Act was required for a contract overtime award). "Prejudgment" interest is not awardable in federal employees' FLSA awards, although it is available in the private sector. Interest was awarded, apart from the FLSA, under the Back Pay Act as a remedy in a ULP proceeding brought to cure an agency's delay in paying FLSA overtime ordered by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 55 FLRA 246, 250-51 (1999) (reviewing federal and private sector cases), but the remedy was not enforced as to interest on liquidated damages, <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore v. FLRA</span>, 201 F.3d 465, 468-72 (D.C. Cir. 2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue before us is the same as that presented to the FLRA: whether the Back Pay Act requires interest on liquidated damages. Historically, sovereign immunity has shielded agencies of the federal government from interest claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Library of Congress v. Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. 310, 314-17 (1986); <span class="Italic">Amax Land Co. v. Quarterman</span>, 181 F.3d 1356, 1359-60 <span id="page_2184"></span>(D.C. Cir. 1999). Even where Congress has waived immunity to suit, a litigant against the government cannot recover interest unless Congress affirmatively, separately, and unambiguously contemplated an award of interest. <span class="Italic">See Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. at 315. Congress has enacted various statutes waiving the government's immunity from interest claims, however. <span class="Italic">See Shaw</span>, 478 U.S. at 318 n.6 (listing several examples of congressional waivers of sovereign immunity from interest claims). We construe the scope of any statute waiving sovereign immunity strictly in the government's favor. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 318; <span class="Italic">Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 78 F.3d 645, 649 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The FLRA maintains that, even under this high standard, the Back Pay Act authorizes it to require interest in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have recognized the Back Pay Act as a congressional waiver of sovereign immunity from interest claims on awards arising under other statutes, such as the FLSA. <span class="Italic">See Brown v. Secretary of the Army</span>, 918 F.2d 214, 216-18 (D.C. Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">Accord Edwards v. Lujan</span>, 40 F.3d 1152, 1154 (10th Cir. 1994) (adopting <span class="Italic">Brown</span>); <span class="Italic">Woolf v. Bowles</span>, 57 F.3d 407, 410 (4th Cir. 1995) (same). Like any other waiver of sovereign immunity, however, the Back Pay Act's allowance of interest against the government is effective only as to awards that come within the scope of the statute. The Act provides recovery to any government employee who</p>
<p class="noindent-2">ha[s] been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the <span class="Italic">withdrawal or reduction</span> of all or part of the <span class="Italic">pay, allowances, or differentials</span> of the employee...is entitled...to receive...an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) (emphasis added). Amounts awarded under this provision "shall be payable with interest." 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(2)(A). Thus, the Act does include a waiver of sovereign immunity as to interest on awards under the Act. But to meet the standard under the Act for an award to bear interest: 1) the employee must have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; 2) the employee must have suffered a withdrawal or reduction of all or part of his pay, allowances, or differentials; and 3) but for the action, the employee would not have experienced the withdrawal or reduction. The parties before us disagree as to whether the SSA's failure to pay the <span class="Italic">Vaughn</span> award timely represents "a withdrawal or reduction of pay, allowances, or differentials" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1), as defined by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.803 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Pay, Allowances, or Differentials</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Social Security Administration contends, and we agree, that liquidated damages do not constitute "pay, allowances, or differentials." The Back Pay Act does not define the term pay, allowances, or differentials, although its use in the same provision as the phrase "which the employee normally would have earned or received" offers some guidance. Since 1981, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations have defined pay, allowances, or differentials collectively as "monetary and employment benefits to which an employee is entitled by statute or regulation by virtue of the performance of a Federal function" rather than as separate terms. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.803. The SSA argues that we should interpret pay, allowances, or differentials narrowly as encompassing only payments or benefits in the nature of compensation which an employee would normally receive for performing his federal job. The FLRA maintains that the OPM's regulation adopts a much broader reading of pay, allowances, or differentials which includes anything to which an employee is entitled that is in any way connected with his federal employment, including the liquidated damages award before us, which arose out of a dispute originally connected with the claimants' employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While there is no case directly on point, existing precedent supports the SSA's position. The Tenth Circuit and the Court of Claims have both interpreted pay, allowances, or differentials consistent with its statutory context as including only those amounts and benefits that the employee normally would have earned as part of his regular compensation during the period in question if the adverse personnel action had not occurred. <span class="Italic">See Hurley v. United States</span>, 624 F.2d 93, 94-95 (10th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Morris v. United States</span>, 595 F.2d 591, 594 (Ct. Cl. 1979). <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span> involved claims for reimbursement of per diem and commuting expenditures incurred as a result of improper reassignments of military personnel to different geographical locations. Since the employees would not have incurred the expenses in the first place had the erroneous reassignments never occurred, the reimbursements would not have been part of the claimants' compensation absent that unwarranted personnel action. Therefore, the courts held that such reimbursements were not within the scope of pay, allowances, or differentials under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award at issue before us involves not salary, allowances, or employment benefits but liquidated damages. Again, there is no controlling authority directly on point, but the Supreme Court has considered the nature of liquidated damages in an interest award controversy, though not under the Back Pay Act. In <span class="Italic">Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O'Neil</span>, 324 U.S. 697 (1945), the Supreme Court considered the claim of an employee in the private sector who had obtained a recovery under the FLSA. The FLSA specifically provided that in addition to a recovery of unpaid minimum wages or overtime compensation, a prevailing employee-claimant was entitled to "an additional equal amount as liquidated damages." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 699 (quoting Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060, at 1069). The Supreme Court held that an employee could not recover interest on liquidated damages awarded under that statute. The Court noted that, in the FLSA, Congress provided for liquidated damages because it recognized that the employer's failure to pay the full compensation owed without delay deprives the aggrieved employee of the use of those funds and may impair his ability to support himself. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 707. By authorizing liquidated damages, Congress sought to compensate the aggrieved employee for the employer's delay and to restore him to a position as if the employer had not failed in its obligation to pay in a timely manner that compensation to which he was entitled. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The Court also recognized that interest likewise represents compensation for damages resulting from a delay in payment, and that permitting an employee to recover interest on liquidated damages would "produce the undesirable result of allowing interest on interest." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 715.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us the liquidated damages clearly represent an alternative to interest as compensation for the government's delay in paying overtime, as opposed to some sort of remuneration for work performed, given that the Vaughn arbitrator ordered the greater of accrued interest or liquidated damages to be added to each employee's individual overtime back pay award. The SSA employees covered by the Vaughn award certainly would not have been entitled to either interest or liquidated damages as part of their regular compensation. Following the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, and the implication of <span class="Italic">Brooklyn Savings</span>, liquidated damages are not pay, allowances, or differentials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA challenges the continued validity of <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, as they predate the OPM's present regulatory definition. But the <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span> courts based their conclusions on the plain meaning of the statute, not the then existing OPM regulation. Further, the OPM in promulgating the current regulatory definition did not purport to alter the results of those decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 46 Fed. Reg. 58,271, 58,272-73 (1981). In the commentary accompanying the regulation's publication, the OPM recognized as examples of employment benefits "coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System and benefits received under the Federal employee health benefits and group life insurance programs prior to retirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 58,272. The OPM also stated that benefits received after retirement were not encompassed by its definition of pay, allowances, or differentials, despite the connection of such benefits to federal employment. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In short, the OPM's comments support a narrower construction of its regulation that is more consistent with the analysis of <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span> and the SSA's interpretation than with the FLRA's approach.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, despite its position here, the FLRA itself has cited <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, even after the OPM promulgated its current regulation, for the continuing proposition that per diem and commuting expenses are not reimbursable under the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See Department of Defense Dependents Sch. and Overseas Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 54 FLRA 259, 266-67 (1998). Also, in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Health and Human Services and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 54 FLRA 1210 (1998), the FLRA applied the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span> in concluding that transit subsidies fell within the scope of pay, allowances, or differentials as "normal legitimate employee benefits in the nature of employment compensation or emoluments," rather than nonreimbursable per diem. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1221-23 (citing <span class="Italic">Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>). In both of these proceedings, the FLRA quoted the current definition of pay, allowances, or differentials from 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.803, then endeavored at length to demonstrate why the payments in question were in the nature of the employees' regular compensation as opposed to amounts that the employees would not have received had the erroneous personnel action not occurred. Thus, the FLRA's own precedents support the reading of pay, allowances, or differentials advanced by the SSA, not the expansive interpretation adopted by the FLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, before us the FLRA characterizes the OPM's regulation as adopting a broad reading of the Back Pay Act, covering anything to which an employee is entitled in connection with his federal employment. Relying heavily on the word "received" from 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i), together with the word "entitled" and the phrase "by virtue of the performance of a Federal function" from the OPM's regulation, the FLRA maintains that because the employees were entitled to receive the liquidated damages for reasons related to the performance of their jobs with the federal government, the plain meaning of the Back Pay Act and the regulation supports the imposition of interest on those liquidated damages. The FLRA's construction takes these words and phrases out of context, however, as if they have significance independent of the full sentences of which they are part.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is a "fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined <span id="page_2185"></span>in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used." <span class="Italic">Deal v. United States</span>, 508 U.S. 129, 132 (1993) (citations omitted). The Back Pay Act authorizes interest only on amounts representing "the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee[s] normally would have earned or received...." 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) (emphasis added). Contrary to the FLRA's rather circular construction, these words do not authorize interest for all amounts that employees are entitled to receive, nor does the statute's use of the word "received" purport to define what constitutes pay, allowances, or differentials. The adverb "normally" modifying "received" further restricts the pay, allowances, or differentials to which interest may be applied. Likewise, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 550.803 does not define pay, allowances, or differentials as including any amounts to which an employee is entitled, but limits the term to "monetary and employment benefits," then employs the phrase "by virtue of the performance of a Federal function." In short, in construing both the statute and the regulation, the FLRA disregards the subject, the dominant element, of the clause or sentence and relies on limiting words and phrases that broaden the scope of the statute only when taken completely out of context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not defer to the FLRA's interpretation of the Back Pay Act, a general statute not committed to the Authority's administration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Professional Airways Sys. Specialists v. FLRA</span>, 809 F.2d 855, 857 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Nor do we defer to the FLRA's interpretation of a regulation promulgated by another agency, <span class="Italic">see United States Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 446, 450 (D.C. Cir. 1991), even if the OPM's regulation itself is entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. NRDC</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). We review this purely legal question <span class="Italic">de novo</span> and conclude that, whether or not the OPM intended a broad reading of the statute, the FLRA's interpretation of the regulation stretches the OPM's arguably less restrictive phraseology to the broadest possible reading. So far does the FLRA distort it that the regulation no longer comports with the statute it interprets. "A regulation which...operates to create a rule out of harmony with the statute, is a mere nullity." <span class="Italic">Manhattan Gen. Equip. Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue</span>, 297 U.S. 129, 134 (1936). In contrast, interpreting the regulatory definition as including only payments in the nature of compensation, such as literal "back pay" or regular employment benefits, is not only consistent with the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Hurley</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, and with the OPM's own commentary, but also with the plain meaning of the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, the phrase "pay, allowances, or differentials" includes only payments and benefits of the sort that an employee normally earns or receives as part the regular compensation for performing his job. The statutory language, the OPM regulation, and judicial and administrative precedent, as well as the command that we construe waivers of sovereign immunity narrowly, all mandate this measured interpretation of pay, allowances, and differentials. Liquidated damages are not within the scope of this construction. Accordingly, we hold that liquidated damages are not pay, allowances, or differentials within the context of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Withdrawal or Reduction</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our decision that the failure to pay timely the award of liquidated damages does not give rise to recoverable interest against a government agency rests not only on our conclusion that liquidated damages do not constitute "pay, allowances, or differentials" within the meaning of the statutory waiver of sovereign immunity, but also that the failure timely to pay those damages does not constitute a "withdrawal or reduction" of compensation as contemplated in the statute. As the Supreme Court recognized in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392 (1976), not every failure to deliver to an individual employed by the government a sum of money to which he is entitled constitutes a withdrawal or reduction of such pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">Testan</span> addressed a claim for back pay by two government employees who sued successfully for reclassification to a higher grade. The Court rejected a broadening interpretation of withdrawal or reduction in the Back Pay Act, holding:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The statute's language was intended to provide a monetary remedy for wrongful reductions in grade, removals, suspensions, and other unwarranted or unjustified actions affecting pay or allowances [that] could occur in the course of reassignments and change from fulltime to part-time work....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...[T]he Back Pay Act, as its words so clearly indicate, was intended to grant a monetary cause of action <span class="Italic">only to those who were subjected to a reduction in their duly appointed emoluments or position</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 405-07 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, because the employees in <span class="Italic">Testan</span> had been paid the appropriate amount for the grade to which they were appointed, and had not experienced a reduction in pay or a decrease in grade, the Court held that they had not suffered a withdrawal or reduction of their pay, allowances, or differentials as required for recovery under the Back Pay Act, even though they rightly should have been classified at the higher grade from the beginning. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 407; <span class="Italic">see also Brown</span>, 918 F.2d at 218 (recognizing as the holding in <span class="Italic">Testan</span> "that Back Pay Act relief is available only to compensate for a reduction in pay or a decrease in grade").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a general matter, the SSA's failure to pay this onetime equitable remedy as quickly as it might hardly deprived the recipient employees of any identifiable benefit. Under the Vaughn remedy for the SSA's misclassification, interest continued to accrue through the final date of payment. The only employees receiving liquidated damages were those for whom the amount of such damages continued to exceed the interest to which the employees otherwise would have been entitled after that accrual. Thus, the liquidated damages accomplished the job for which they were intended--to compensate for the delay in payment. At a minimum, however, the SSA's failure to pay the Vaughn award in a timely manner clearly did not reduce the regular pay or benefits the employees were receiving in relation to their ongoing employment, nor did it reduce their grade, as <span class="Italic">Testan</span> requires. Therefore, regardless of whether liquidated damages fall within the scope of pay, allowances, and differentials, according to the Supreme Court's instruction in <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, the SSA's inaction in this case does not represent a withdrawal or reduction under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA erroneously suggests that <span class="Italic">Testan</span> is inapplicable since the present case involves an unfair labor practice as opposed to a reclassification action. Nothing in the <span class="Italic">Testan</span> opinion or the relevant Back Pay Act provisions suggests that classification errors and unfair labor practices should be treated differently. In fact, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1) expressly includes unfair labor practices but does not distinguish them from other unjustified or unwarranted personnel actions. The fact upon which the FLRA seeks to distinguish <span class="Italic">Testan</span> is not determinative of the present inquiry. Thus, <span class="Italic">Testan</span> controls, and we conclude that the FLRA's conceded failure to comply with the Vaughn award does not constitute a withdrawal or reduction within the context of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent">Attempting to strike a balance between the approach of the D.C. Circuit and its own views concerning the scope of the Back Pay Act, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, NOAA and IBEW, Local 80</span>, 57 FLRA 430, 435-36 (2001), upheld an award of interest on an FLSA recovery but conditioned the award on a determination that the grievant receiving the interest would not also obtain liquidated damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Union, even if liquidated damages are not appropriate, the grievant is entitled to interest under the Back Pay Act. The Agency argues that the FLSA, under which the Arbitrator ordered payment of overtime to the grievant, does not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity for awards of interest against the government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator did not provide any reasons for not awarding interest.&#x2003;The Arbitrator simply stated, I accept the Agency['s] argument with regard to interest, and no interest is awarded. In the Agency's posthearing brief, the Agency argued to the Arbitrator that interest was not appropriate because the FLSA does not contain a waiver of sovereign immunity for awards of pre-judgment or post-judgment interest against the United States. In support, the Agency cited <span class="Italic">Zumerling v. Marsh, </span>783 F.2d 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Based on the Arbitrator's statement, we view the Agency's argument as the basis for the Arbitrator's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a previous case which involved an interest claim and the FLSA, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">As correctly argued by the [agency], an allowance of interest on a claim against the United States requires an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity by Congress. <span class="Italic">See Zumerling v. Marsh, </span>783 F.2d 1032, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Zumerling</span>). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Library of Congress v. Shaw. </span>The court in <span class="Italic">Zumerling </span>held that the FLSA contained no such explicit waiver, and found no other federal statute that would permit the payment of post-judgment interest in that case<span class="Italic">....</span><span class="Italic"> </span><span class="Italic">Zumerling </span>[did not] consider[ ] whether the Back Pay Act, which was amended in 1987, provides a waiver of sovereign immunity. It is well established that the requisite express waiver of sovereign immunity not contained in a given statute can be supplied by a separate statute. <span class="Italic">Brown v.

Cir. 2000) (an unfair labor practice case involving compliance with arbitration awards finding violations of the FLSA, wherein the Authority considered whether interest was payable under the Back Pay Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the court in <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA, </span>like the Authority, recognized the Back Pay Act as a congressional waiver of sovereign immunity from interest claims on awards arising under other statutes, including the FLSA. <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA, </span>201 F.3d at 468 (citations omitted). However, the court found, contrary to the Authority, that the Back Pay Act does not authorize the FLRA to require an agency to pay interest on liquidated damages awarded under the [FLSA] because liquidated damages do not constitute 'pay, allowances, or differentials.' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 473. The court found that the Back Pay Act's allowance of interest against the government is effective only <span id="page_2186"></span>as to awards that come within the scope of the statute, that is, meet the requirements of the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on <span class="Italic">SSA v. FLRA, </span>we find that the Back Pay Act operates as a waiver of sovereign immunity permitting interest on awards arising under the FLSA, if the award satisfies the requirements of the Back Pay Act. However, because an award of both liquidated damages and prejudgment interest...would amount to compensating an employee twice for a delay, in payment of monies due under the FLSA, an employee may not recover the full amount of both liquidated damages and interest. <span class="Italic">Parker v. Burnley, </span>703 F. Supp. 925 (N.D. Ga. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">Spagnuolo v.

Accordingly, an employee may not recover both liquidated damages and interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the instant case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency improperly determined that the grievant's work was exempt rather than nonexempt under the FLSA and awarded the grievant overtime pay. Based on the Arbitrator's award, the Agency's action constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials within the meaning of the Back Pay Act because overtime pay is pay, allowances, or differentials and the failure of the Agency to timely pay such overtime constituted a withdrawal or reduction of compensation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Coatesville, Pa.,</span> 56 FLRA 829, 834 (2000). Consequently, interest could, and should, be awarded if the Arbitrator denies liquidated damages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Allenwood and AFGE Local 4047</span>, 65 FLRA 996, 1001 (2011) (Member DuBester dissenting on another point), determined that an award of FLSA liquidated damages could not be accompanied by an award of interest on those damages:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator directed the Agency to pay liquidated damages plus interest on the total amount of the award in accordance with the Back Pay Act if it failed to pay the Union in full by November 15, 2010. In <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland v. FLRA</span>, 201 F.3d 465, 473 (D.C. Cir. 2000), a decision concerning post-judgment interest, the court held that "liquidated damages are not pay, allowances, or differentials[,]" and that because of this, "the Back Pay Act does not authorize the [Authority] to require an agency to pay interest on liquidated damages awarded under the FLSA." Moreover, the Authority has held that "an employee may not recover the full amount of both liquidated damages and interest" under the FLSA<span class="Italic">.

Accordingly, we find that the supplemental award is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">FAA and PASS</span>, 66 FLRA 441, 447 (2012), noted that FLSA liquidated damages precludes a Back Pay Award of interest:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FLSA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and independently provides a statutory right to money damages, the Authority has held that FLSA violations are remedied under the FLSA, not the BPA. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 53 FLRA at 1485-86. Moreover, the Authority has held that an employee may not recover <span class="Italic">both </span>liquidated damages under the FLSA <span class="Italic">and </span>interest under the BPA. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with these principles, because the Arbitrator awarded liquidated damages under the FLSA, we find that the Arbitrator's award of interest under the BPA is contrary to law, and set aside the award of interest <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DOJ</span>, 65 FLRA at 1001.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The United States, as sovereign, is immune from suit except as it consents to be sued.[51] As such, an arbitrator's direction that an agency provide monetary damages to an employee must be supported by a statutory authority to impose such a remedy.[52] An allowance of interest on a claim against the United States requires an explicit waiver of sovereign immunity.[53] Absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, an arbitrator's monetary remedy is contrary to law.[54]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Both the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the D.C.

<p class="noindent-1">In the backpay award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's failure to pay the grievants violated the FLSA. Further, the Arbitrator did not award liquidated damages under the FLSA. For these reasons, the BPA and the above-cited standards support an award of interest on the backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Angelo</span>,[62] that decision pertinently stated that if</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the BPA separately serves as a waiver of sovereign immunity for a recovery of interest under FLSA, given that such an interest award is <span class="Italic">mandatory</span> under the BPA and that interest and liquidated damages cannot both be awarded, then liquidated damages would never be available in a FLSA action against the United States. "In essence, liquidated damages would be read out of the FLSA. This result is so at odds with the FLSA remedy Congress created that we could not adopt it unless the waiver were plain."[63]</p>

The Agency further claims that the Arbitrator "cannot allow the Union to raise a BPA claim on the underlying FLSA overtime issue several years <span class="Italic">after</span> that issue was already decided."

<p class="noindent-1">As for <span class="Italic">FAA Nashua</span>, the Authority noted that the BPA did not apply to the agency at issue,[86] and then stated: "Moreover, the [a]rbitrator did not award backpay under the BPA. Thus,...even if the BPA were applicable to the [a]gency, and the [a]gency's sovereign immunity to monetary damages under the BPA had been waived, the [a]rbitrator could not award interest under the BPA without first awarding backpay under the BPA."[87] <span class="Italic">FAA Nashua</span> is distinguishable from this case because there, the arbitrator had not relied on any statute allowing the award of backpay;[88] thus, the Authority did not address whether an arbitrator may rely on the BPA to award interest on backpay that previously was awarded under another statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator erred by relying on <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span> because that decision did not involve the FLSA and did not make a "sweeping statement" that there are "no exceptions" to the BPA's requirement of interest. The Agency also argues that, to the extent the Arbitrator relied on <span class="Italic">Marine Corps'</span> "progeny," that reliance also is misplaced because those decisions similarly did not involve the FLSA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the Arbitrator did not state that there are "no exceptions" to the BPA's requirement of interest. Further, although <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Barstow</span> and its "progeny" did not involve the FLSA, the Arbitrator's reliance on those decisions does not render the award contrary to law. In this regard, the Arbitrator also relied on decisions that involved the FLSA. In addition, as discussed above, we find that relevant precedent supports the Arbitrator's conclusion that interest was warranted, and in conducting <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses the arbitrator's legal conclusion, not his or her underlying reasoning.[94] Therefore, these Agency arguments provide no basis for finding the award contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[94]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wash., D.C.,</span> 64 FLRA 426, 432-33 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is contrary to law. We note that the Agency does not separately discuss pre- and post-judgment interest, or provide a basis for treating those types of interest differently. Accordingly, we do not address those types of interest separately.</p>
