<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-157"><span id="Page_262"></span><span class="space">d.</span> Postal Service Employees Who Lack Preference Eligibility, Have No Negotiated Grievance Procedures, and Who Are Neither Managers Nor Personnelists</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The statutory scheme creates Board appeal rights for preference eligibles, for supervisors and managers, and for personnelists. The rest of the postal establishment appears to be, by default if not design, relegated to internal postal appeals procedures if contract grievance and arbitration procedures are unavailable. The discussion in <span class="Italic">McCandless v. MSPB</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1198-1202 (Fed. Cir. 1993), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, concerning the necessity for the MSPB to consider, as to its jurisdiction, whether a person claiming to be a confidential employee is excluded from a collective bargaining unit, led to further discussion of whether exclusion from a collective bargaining unit itself establishes MSPB jurisdiction as to individuals other than managers, supervisors, and confidential employees. The few resulting decisions focus on whether the employee could establish "as a matter of law" that a position would be excluded from a collective bargaining unit--whether or not that unit was in existence as of the time of the appealed personnel action. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-242.html#sec1-238">Postal Service Employees</a>," concerning preference eligibles who may appeal to both the Board and grieve a matter under a negotiated agreement.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carrier v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3531) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Carrier v. MSPB</span>, 183 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir.1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>), stressed the significance of careful analysis to determine how a postal employee, an Operations Performance Analyst (EAS-25), should be classified:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in this court establishes that Carrier made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that the position he holds is a "nonbargaining" position. The AJ, however, made no factual determination on whether Carrier might nonetheless be eligible to join a collective bargaining unit. If so, he would not be in a collective bargaining unit as a matter of choice. On the other hand, Carrier may be ineligible as a matter of law for membership in a collective bargaining unit. In that case, the Board would be obligated to follow our holding in <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> and assume jurisdiction over Carrier's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, we remanded that case to the Board for further proceedings with the express caution to be mindful of our decision in <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> when determining whether the Board had jurisdiction over Waldau's appeal. 19 F.3d at 1404-05. This case requires us to repeat our reminder that <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> cannot be overlooked by the Board. A decision of the Board which fails to resolve an issue properly before it is arbitrary and capricious, and we must vacate that decision. 5 USC 7703(c) (1994). The case is remanded for adjudication of the <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For <span class="Italic">Carrier</span> on remand, refer to <span class="Italic">Carrier v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 401, 404 (1998) (determining that the employee had no Board appeal rights).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the <span class="Italic">Carrier</span> remand, but before the further development of <span class="Italic">Carrier</span> in the Federal Circuit, discussed <span class="Italic">post</span>, the Federal Circuit considered <span class="Italic">Bolton v. MSPB</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1320-21 (Fed. Cir. 1998). [<span class="Italic">Bolton</span> is discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-156.html#sec1-155">Postal Supervisors, Managers</a>."] The court again determined that an individual's nonmembership in a postal bargaining unit does not alone establish Board appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bolton finally contends that the AJ's decision here violated our holding in <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 996 F.2d 1193 (Fed. Cir. 1993), because the AJ has unlawfully placed him in a "third group" of postal service employees who neither have appeals rights to the Board nor may benefit from membership in a collective bargaining unit. In <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, we specifically held that a postal service employee must either fall within the Board's jurisdiction or the NLRB's jurisdiction, and the statutory definitions of supervisor and judicial definitions of manager may not be used to create a "third group" of postal service workers who do not fall within the scope of either agency's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1201-02. Thus, the boundary between NLRB and Board jurisdiction divides the class of all postal service employees into two distinct and mutually exclusive subgroups, and there may not be a gap in between.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no indication, however, that the AJ here concluded, explicitly or implicitly, that Bolton would fall beyond <span class="Italic">both</span> the NLRB's and the Board's jurisdictional reach. As discussed above, it is clearly the case that Bolton was neither a supervisor nor a manager. Bolton, however, submitted a letter from the Chief Shop Steward of the local collective bargaining unit, which states that Bolton would "not be permitted to become an active member of the National Association of Letter Carriers," in support of his assertion that he also falls outside the scope of the NLRB's jurisdiction. There is no indication, however, that Bolton ever applied to the National Association of Letter Carriers for membership, or that he was denied membership. The letter on which Bolton relies is merely advisory, and does not represent the final say on Bolton's legal status with respect to the collective bargaining unit. Nor has Bolton shown any legal authority suggesting he is ineligible for union membership as a matter of law. Thus, the AJ's refusal to grant Board jurisdiction over Bolton's appeal does not create the conflict with <span class="Italic">McCandless</span> that Bolton suggests.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Returning to <span class="Italic">Carrier</span>, the employee pursued his case <span class="Italic">pro se</span> back to the Federal Circuit. Affirming the Board over the dissent of Judge Newman, the Federal Circuit confirmed that lack of membership in a bargaining unit does not establish Board appellate jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Carrier v. MSPB</span>, 183 F.3d 1376, 1378-80 (Fed. Cir. 1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand from <span class="Italic">Carrier V</span>, the administrative judge found that Carrier had not alleged that he was a supervisory or confidential personnel employee, and found that Carrier had failed to prove that he was managerial employee. The AJ further held that Carrier had not proved that he was barred as a matter of law from membership in a collective bargaining unit--while a notation in Carrier's position description indicated that it was a nonbargaining position, the administrative judge found that Carrier had not made any factual showing that he was precluded from membership in a collective bargaining unit. The administrative judge noted favorably the agency's argument that unrepresented employees who are not ineligible as a matter of law may seek union representation. Once again, Carrier's appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Carrier v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> Docket No. DC-0752-93-0121-M-1 (Aug. 13, 1996) (<span class="Italic">Carrier VI</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board granted Carrier's petition for review of the AJ's decision in <span class="Italic">Carrier VI</span>. With regard to whether Carrier had proven that he was not entitled as a matter of law to membership in a collective bargaining unit, the Board affirmed the decision in <span class="Italic">Carrier VI</span>. As to whether Carrier had proven that he is a management employee, the Board affirmed the decision in <span class="Italic">Carrier VI</span> that Carrier had not made such a showing. Also, the Board, noting that Carrier had alleged supervisory status, held that Carrier failed to prove that he fit in the category of supervisors. The Board, finally, held that Carrier had waived an opportunity to prove that he was a confidential-personnel employee, and Carrier now agrees that he has waived that point. Consequently, the dismissal of Carrier's appeal for want of jurisdiction became the final decision of the Board. <span class="Italic">Carrier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 MSPR 404 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Carrier VII</span>). Carrier petitioned this court for review, and we have jurisdiction under 28 USC &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his opening and reply briefs to this court, Carrier devotes his fullest efforts to rearguing the facts, in hopes that we might disagree with the Board and conclude that he indeed has proven that in fact his work in the postal service qualifies for definition as either managerial or supervisory. Our standard of review precludes us from making an independent review of the evidence. On the basis of the evidence adduced in <span class="Italic">Carrier I</span> through <span class="Italic">Carrier VII,</span> we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Carrier is neither a management nor a supervisory employee. <span class="Italic">See Bolton,</span> 154 F.3d at 1316, 1319 (reviewing the Board's findings as to whether employee was manager or supervisor for substantial evidence).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reach the same conclusion when considering the matter from the perspective of section 1202, which was the Board's task on remand from <span class="Italic">Carrier V</span>. In this regard the Board found that Carrier had failed to establish that he was a manager, supervisor, or confidential-personnel employee under section 1202, and accordingly held that he failed to prove that he was barred <span class="Italic">as a matter of law</span> from membership in a collective bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the suggestions of the dissent, we may not reach the opposite conclusion based on the facts that the postal service described Carrier's position as nonbargaining and that there may presently be no bargaining unit in existence for Carrier to join. The Board's jurisdiction is prescribed by statute, and section 1005 restricts the Board's jurisdiction to those nonpreference eligible employees who are either a manager, supervisor, or confidential-personnel employee. Our precedent makes clear that whether Carrier was one of these types of employees must be established based on his actual job duties, not simply by the description of his position as nonbargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys.</span> <span class="Italic">Protection Bd.,</span> 19 F.3d 1395, 1399 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("Whether particular employees are 'managerial' is not controlled by the specific job title of the position held by the employee. Rather, the question must be answered 'in terms of the employee's actual job responsibilities, authority, and relationship to management. Furthermore, this question must be resolved on a case-by-case basis"' (citations omitted).).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The jurisdiction of the Board over appeals from postal service employees is prescribed, and constrained, by statute, and is defined in terms of job status, a matter of fact proven on a case-by-case basis. If a person is not a manager, supervisor or confidential-personnel employee, that person as a matter of law has no Board appeal rights. Congress contemplated that such a person as a matter of law could qualify for membership in a collective bargaining unit, and thereby gain access to a process for pursuit of job-related grievances. Congress did not assure that a union would be up and running for every postal operation, ready to receive membership applications from nonmanager, nonsupervisor, or nonconfidential-personnel employees of the postal service. We must attend to the jurisdiction of the Board, from which our jurisdiction depends. Nothing in the statutes or our precedent, including <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, suggests that a <span id="Page_263"></span>person who is found, by substantial evidence, to fail the jurisdictional tests of section 1005 nevertheless may appeal to the Board on a showing that, in fact, such person had no readily available collective bargaining unit to which a grievance could be taken. Thus, the issue is not, as the dissent argues, whether Carrier had an opportunity to join a bargaining unit, or even whether such a unit existed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Carrier has not established that, as a matter of law, his work assignment precluded him from membership in a bargaining unit. Nor has Carrier responded to the agency's assertion that persons who have held similar positions to Carrier have nonetheless been deemed eligible for membership in a collective bargaining unit<span class="Italic">. See United States Postal Serv.,</span> 232 NLRB 556, 97 LRRM (BNA) 1062 (1978). In fact, Carrier does not assert that he has been told that he could not join a collective bargaining unit. To the contrary, Carrier's brief suggests that a collective bargaining unit may be "in the making" for employees such as himself. Carrier sees that possibility as a disservice to the efficiency of the postal service, arguing that persons with as much management and supervisory involvement as himself, were they union members, would be unable to manage and supervise effectively. Those concerns, however real, are not for us to consider. We are called on to decide only if the Board erred when it concluded that Carrier has not proven that he was a manager, supervisor, or confidential-personnel employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since we hold that the Board did not err in its conclusion that it was without jurisdiction over Carrier's appeal, we must affirm the Board's decision dismissing Carrier's appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Coursen v. USPS</span>, 256 F.3d 1353, 1354-57 (Fed. Cir. 2001), determined, again over the dissent of Judge Newman, that nonmembership in a unit represented by a union did not establish Board jurisdiction over a nonpreference employee who was neither a supervisor nor a manager:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Coursen was employed as an "Account Representative" with the United States Postal Service ("the agency" or "the Postal Service") in Kansas City, Missouri. His position description indicated that his duties included working independently to develop relationships with commercial business customers in order to sell postal products and services to the customers within a district. In December 1995, Coursen received a notice of proposed removal for submitting false sales and daily activity reports, and for misusing Postal Service equipment by downloading pornography onto an agency computer while on duty. On January 3, 1996, the agency issued Coursen a letter of decision stating that his removal would be effective January 26, 1996.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After his removal, Coursen filed an appeal to the Board, asserting jurisdiction under the Postal Employees Appeal Rights Act ("PEARA"), 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4). In an initial decision, the administrative judge ("AJ") dismissed Coursen's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, concluding that Coursen lacked standing to appeal his removal to the Board because he had failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that he was employed as a "supervisor or management employee" within the meaning of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Coursen argues that the Board erred in dismissing his appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Coursen contends that he was entitled to appeal to the Board because he was ineligible to join a collective bargaining unit ("CBU") and because he performed the job functions of a managerial and supervisory employee. The agency responds that the Board did not err in dismissing Coursen's appeal because Coursen was not a "supervisor or management employee" under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). The agency also argues that Coursen failed to show that, as a matter of law, he was ineligible for membership in a CBU.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that Coursen was not entitled to appeal to the Board. Under PEARA, a Postal Service employee has the right to appeal an adverse personnel decision to the Board if he has completed at least one year of continuous service and is in the position of a "supervisor or a management employee," or is engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii) (1994). Thus, status as a supervisor or a management employee entitles a Postal Service employee to appeal to the Board. In addition, the law provides that a Postal Service employee is precluded from joining a CBU if that employee is a "management official or supervisor," or is engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity. 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202 (1994). Accordingly, if a Postal Service employee is barred as a matter of law from joining a CBU because he is a supervisor or manager under &#x00A7; 1202, that employee "by statutory definition has appeal rights to the Board under [&#x00A7;] 1005(4)(A)(ii)." <span class="Italic">Carrier v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 183 F.3d 1376, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing <span class="Italic">McCandless v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 996 F.2d 1193, 1201 (1993)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that Coursen failed to demonstrate that he was a supervisor or management employee within the definition of &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). While Coursen argues that he was previously a Postal Service superintendent, occasionally performed as an acting manager and supervisor, took management training courses, and joined an association for supervisors, such activity does not demonstrate that he was a supervisor or management employee for the purposes of 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). The AJ specifically found that Coursen's position description did not reflect that he "supervised" other employees. Moreover, Coursen failed to show that he had the authority to discharge or discipline others, or that his own evaluation was based on the performance of his subordinates. <span class="Italic">See Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 154 F.3d 1313, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (explaining that the authority to discharge or discipline others and accountability for the performance of subordinates are generally critical components of supervisory status).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ also determined that Coursen's position was not "managerial" in nature. Although Coursen's position description indicated that he worked independently to develop relationships with commercial business customers, the AJ found that the evidence did not reflect that Coursen assisted in the formulation of management policies. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Bolton</span>, 154 F.3d at 1318. ("[M]anagerial employees are those who 'formulate and effectuate management policies by expressing and making operative decisions of their employer.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Waldau v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 19 F.3d 1395, 1398 (Fed. Cir. 1994))). Accordingly, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Coursen was neither a supervisor nor a management employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency that Coursen failed to demonstrate that he was barred as a matter of law from joining a CBU. Although Coursen was not a member of a CBU, and therefore was a "nonbargaining" employee, there is no indication that Coursen ever attempted to join a CBU and was denied membership. Nor has Coursen shown any legal authority suggesting he was ineligible for such membership as a matter of law. Based on these facts, we conclude that Coursen failed to demonstrate that he was precluded as a matter of law from joining a CBU. <span class="Italic">See Bolton</span>, 154 F.3d at 1321 (concluding that a Postal Service employee failed to show that he was ineligible for CBU membership, where such employee did not show that he applied to a CBU and was denied membership, or show any legal authority suggesting that he was ineligible for CBU membership as a matter of law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, neither the agency's description of Coursen's position as a "nonbargaining" position, nor the absence of an existing CBU for Coursen to join, leads to a contrary conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Carrier</span>, 183 F.3d at 1379 ("Contrary to the suggestions of the dissent, we may not reach the opposite conclusion based on the facts that the postal service described Carrier's position as nonbargaining and that there may presently be no bargaining unit in existence for Carrier to join."). In <span class="Italic">Carrier</span>, we explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Congress did not assure that a union would be up and running for every postal operation.... We must attend to the jurisdiction of the Board, from which our jurisdiction depends. Nothing in the statutes or our precedent, including <span class="Italic">McCandless</span>, suggests that a person who is found, by substantial evidence, to fail the jurisdictional tests of section 1005 nevertheless may appeal to the Board on a showing that, in fact, such person had no readily available collective bargaining unit to which a grievance could be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1380.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent notably fails to cite or distinguish either <span class="Italic">Bolton</span> or <span class="Italic">Carrier</span>, and instead, mistakenly relies on <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc.</span>, 121 S. Ct. 1861 (2001), for the proposition that the burden of proving that an employee was misclassified is "on the party presenting the challenge." The dissent erroneously suggests that, under <span class="Italic">Kentucky River</span>, the agency bore the burden of showing that it had misclassified Coursen as a "nonbargaining" employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party challenges Coursen's designated status as a "nonbargaining" employee and the agency readily acknowledges that Coursen was not a member of a CBU. Moreover, the issue is not whether the agency had correctly classified his position as "nonbargaining." Rather, it is whether he was precluded as a matter of law from joining a CBU and thus was a supervisor or management employee for the purposes of &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). As the party asserting supervisory status, the burden of proof was on Coursen, not the agency. <span class="Italic">Kentucky River</span>, 121 S. Ct. at 1866. In <span class="Italic">Kentucky River</span>, the Supreme Court expressly deferred to the Board's rule that the burden of proving an employee's supervisory status under the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 152(11), is "borne by the party claiming that the employee is a supervisor." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court further explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is easier to prove an employee's authority to exercise...supervisory functions than to disprove an employee's authority to exercise any of those functions, and practicality therefore favors placing the burden on the party asserting supervisory status. We find that the Board's rule for allocating the burden of proof is reasonable and consistent with the Act, and we therefore defer to it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the burden of proof was clearly on Coursen.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because substantial evidence supports the Board's findings that Coursen failed to demonstrate that he was a supervisor or management employee under 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), or that he was precluded as matter of law from joining a CBU, we must affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_264"></span>Demonstrating "as a matter of law" that a position is excluded from a collective bargaining unit may be asking too much of an employee. To conclusively demonstrate that a position is excluded from a unit, one would need to gather all the Postal Service contracts, or unit certifications from the NLRB, and show that the employee's position was not included, or, alternatively, that it was excluded. It might also be possible to secure a unit certification from the NLRB to show that a particular position was excluded from the unit. That assumes the existence of a bargaining unit, the existence of a unit certification and, possibly, the existence of a collective bargaining contract with a recognition clause. If there is no collective bargaining unit, one would have to show that no unit would be appropriate, a task that would be quite difficult unless the employee was in a particular position that, according to law developed by the NLRB, could not be included in a unit (in addition to the statutory exclusion of supervisors under 29 USC 152(3)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board responded to an argument concerning the unavailability of a bargaining unit, <span class="Italic">Candelario v. USPS,</span> NY-0752-11-0068-I-1 (NP 11/16/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant also argues that she was prohibited from belonging to a collective bargaining unit for various reasons, and she defies the agency to identify a collective bargaining unit for which she was eligible. It may well be true that there was no collective bargaining unit available for the appellant to join, and it may even be true that her membership in a bargaining unit was prohibited for one reason or another. However, the Board's jurisdiction is limited to those Postal Service employees who are excluded from bargaining unit membership by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202(1)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8); 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">Benifield v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 50, 52-54 (1989). The mere fact that there was no collective bargaining unit for the appellant to join or that the appellant was ineligible for bargaining unit membership for reasons unrelated to 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1202(1)-(2) is insufficient to bring the appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Coursen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 256 F.3d 1353, 1355-75 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Carrier</span>, 183 F.3d at 1378-80; <span class="Italic">Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 10 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A Postal Service employee who otherwise lacks Board appeal rights may file a restoration claim with the Board, <span class="Italic">Rumph v. USPS</span>, 101 MSPR 243, 247 &#x00B6; 9, 2006 MSPB 40 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note the AJ's finding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the instant appeal because the appellant, a Postal Service employee in a non-managerial position, did not establish that he is a preference eligible. This reasoning is correct to the extent the appellant was appealing a removal. However, while only particular groups of Postal Service employees have the right to appeal an adverse action to the Board, the Board may exercise jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's claim that the agency violated his restoration rights under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, regardless of whether the employee is a preference eligible or a supervisory or managerial employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.102-.103; <span class="Italic">Chen v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12 (2004).
