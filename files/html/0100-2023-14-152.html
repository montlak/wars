<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-153"><span class="space">1.</span> Temporary Shutdown of Facility</h4>
<p class="noindent">Nothing barred a proposal obligating management to use its discretion in granting administrative leave. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2879 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, San Diego</span>, 49 FLRA 1074, 1079 (1994) (Provision 1). FLRA permitted negotiation of the use of administrative leave during plant shutdowns, although initially the proposals were considered nonnegotiable. The topic of administrative leave was addressed as to a proposal that required it to be granted in the event of a partial (temporary) closure of the facility in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-62 and Army Dugway Proving Ground</span>, 18 FLRA 307, 310 (1985). FLRA concluded that the decision to shut down or curtail agency operations is an aspect of management's right to lay off employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). Although the proposal would not prevent the agency from shutting its facility down, it conflicted with agency regulations implementing that decision in a manner critical to achieving the goal of saving funds. The agency regulations prohibiting administrative leave during the partial closing were justified by a compelling need to achieve the objective of saving money through curtailment of operations. The regulations were essential to the goal, rather than helpful or desirable. The goal could not be achieved if additional labor costs were incurred through administrative leave.</p>
<p class="noindent">In the context of the impact on the use of employees' use of annual leave rather than the grant of administrative leave during the partial or temporary shutdown of a facility, FLRA decided in <span class="Italic">Lexington-Blue Grass Army Depot and AFGE Local 894</span>, 24 FLRA 50, 53 (1986), to overrule <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-62 and Army Dugway Proving Ground</span>, 18 FLRA 307 (1985), <span class="Italic">supra</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 894</span> was in turn reversed after remand in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-62 and Army Dugway Proving Ground</span>, 26 FLRA 59 (1987). In its 1987 decision, FLRA departed from the notion that a demonstration of monetary savings alone is sufficient to establish that a regulation is essential, as distinguished from helpful or desirable, to the accomplishment of the mission or the execution of the functions of an agency, 26 FLRA at 60:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not believe that effectiveness and efficiency are to be measured solely in monetary terms.&#x2003;Financial considerations, of course, can be relevant to a determination whether an agency regulation satisfies the compelling need criterion set forth in section 2424.11(a) of the Authority's regulations.... However, in determining whether an agency's regulation is essential, as distinguished from helpful or desirable to effective and efficient agency operations, other considerations are also pertinent....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language and legislative history of the Statute supports our conclusion that a broad balancing of factors is appropriate in evaluating compelling need assertions such as the Agency makes here.... [W]ith respect to compelling need, it is clear from the legislative history of the Statute that Congress intended a regulation to bar negotiations only on narrow grounds....</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that the agency grant administrative leave rather than require that employees use annual leave for four or five workdays at the end of the year when shipyard operations would be curtailed. No statute precluded the exercise of discretion in granting administrative leave. Provisions of the then-applicable FPM permitted the practice of granting administrative leave for the temporary closing of an activity for periods not generally exceeding three workdays; the FPM did not bar a longer period. <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach and IFPTE, Local 174</span>, 7 FLRA 362, 366-67 (1981). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-166.html#sec6-167">Directed or Enforced Leave Usage</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Another shutdown proposal was negotiable, and received more extensive analysis, in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2119 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 42 FLRA 993, 996-1001 (1991). The proposal stated that "[a]ffected employees shall be placed on administrative leave without charge to annual leave for the periods of shutdown":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The duty to bargain under section 7117 of the Statute extends to any matter that is not inconsistent with law, rule or regulation. We find that the Agency has not established that the proposal is outside the duty to bargain. Rather, we find that the proposal, which authorizes the use of administrative leave during the period of a holiday shutdown, is negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently has addressed the availability of administrative leave for various activities.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022 and U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, Kentucky</span>, 40 FLRA 371, 380 (1991), we noted that FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11-1, defines administrative leave as "'an absence from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay and without charge to leave.'" We then found that a proposal requiring the agency to grant employees 40 hours of administrative leave to attend scout functions was nonnegotiable because it directly interfered with the agency's right to assign work. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</span>, 41 FLRA 1106 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>),...we found that a proposal authorizing the use of administrative leave for employees who participate in counseling and/or treatment sessions constituted a negotiable appropriate arrangement. In the latter case, we addressed more specifically the requirements of the FPM pertaining to administrative leave<span class="Italic">. Department of the Treasury</span> at 1126. We found that the head of an agency has discretion, which is subject to negotiations, to grant administrative leave to employees of the agency in certain situations for brief periods of time. We also noted the Authority's previous determination in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees and U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Eastern Mapping Agency</span>, 21 FLRA 1105, 1114 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span>), finding negotiable a provision that provided administrative leave or excused absence for short periods of agency closure due to circumstances beyond the agency's control.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to <span class="Italic">Eastern Mapping Agency</span>, the Authority previously has addressed and found negotiable proposals concerning the use of administrative leave or excused absence for periods of temporary curtailment of agency operations. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association and Department of Defense Dependents Schools</span>, 29 FLRA 485, 494-95 (1987) (no reduction in employees' pay where operations curtailed because of adverse weather conditions or other situations barring the conduct of regular classroom activities); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-62 and U.S. Army Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah</span>, 26 FLRA 59 (1987) (employees affected by holiday closure placed on administrative leave without charge to annual leave).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal here would require the Agency to place employees affected by the holiday shutdown on administrative leave, without charge to annual leave. As noted, agencies have discretion, subject to negotiations, to grant employees administrative leave for brief periods of time. In this case, the amount of time for which administrative leave would be authorized consists of 40 hours and would include the day after Thanksgiving and December 23, 24, 26 and 27. In our view, the use of administrative leave for this brief period of time is within the Agency's <span id="page_723"></span>discretion and, therefore, negotiable under the requirements of the FPM. We note, in this regard, the absence of any contention by the Agency that such negotiations are precluded by the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the proposal does not directly interfere with the management rights alleged by the Agency.&#x2003;However, even if there was a direct interference, we would find the proposal negotiable as an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we reject the contention that the proposal interferes with the right to assign work by removing the discretion to determine whether to grant leave and the appropriate leave to grant. We agree with the Union that the proposal concerns the status of employees whom the Agency has determined to place on leave. Thus, the Agency has already decided that employees will be on leave by virtue of its decision to temporarily curtail operations. As to a determination concerning the type of leave that will be authorized, we have found that the use of administrative leave is a matter that is subject to negotiations. The Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force</span> is inapposite. In that case, the proposal would have required the agency to grant annual leave as long as the employee's need was clearly documented. The Authority found that the proposal interfered with section 7106(a)(2)(B) by removing management's discretion to deny leave. In this case, the Agency has already decided to place employees on leave. There is nothing in the proposal that would prevent the Agency from placing employees on leave for the period of the holiday shutdown.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's contentions that the proposal interferes with the rights to direct, assign and lay off employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A). Again, nothing in the proposal would interfere with the Agency's decision to have a holiday shutdown or prevent the Agency from closing its operations. In this manner, the proposal is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span> in which the application of the proposal was such that an employee or a group of employees could thwart the agency's decision to curtail its operations by refusing to take annual leave. There is nothing in either the proposal itself or the Union's explanation as to the manner in which the proposal is intended to operate that would indicate such a result. Moreover, unlike the proposal in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing</span>, which was silent concerning the availability of administrative leave, the proposal here is designed to permit the use of administrative rather than annual leave for the period of the temporary shutdown. Additionally, as the proposal here would not require the Agency to assign work to employees during the period of the shutdown, the proposal is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Charleston Naval Shipyard</span>, 33 FLRA 618-19, which required management to "attempt to provide available work first to employees not having annual leave to their credit[,]" during periods of shutdown or reduced operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy</span> is misplaced. Unlike the agency in that case, there is every indication that the Agency intended to maintain employees in a paid leave status, as evidenced by the Agency's statement that it "proposed that employees would take annual leave during the period of the shutdown." The Union's proposal merely requires that administrative leave be negotiated as an alternative to annual leave for the period of the holiday shutdown.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further conclude, however, that even if the proposal were found to directly interfere with the exercise of management's rights, the proposal would constitute a negotiable appropriate arrangement. In determining whether a proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, it is first necessary to determine whether the proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. If the proposal is intended to be an arrangement, the Authority next examines whether the arrangement is appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of the management right<span class="Italic">. National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army National Guard</span>, 21 FLRA 24, 31-33 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disputing the Agency's reasons for the holiday shutdown, the Union explains that requiring employees to take annual leave or be placed in a leave without pay status causes employees to use their leave in a manner that is not compatible with their needs. As such, we view the Union's proposal as an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the Agency's decision to conduct a holiday shutdown.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we find that the proposal does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's rights. We find that the benefits accruing to employees under the proposal outweigh the minimal burden imposed on the Agency. As noted by the Union, the Agency's plan to require employees to take annual leave or to place them in a leave without pay status may be incompatible with the needs of employees. Under the proposal, employees would be able to preserve their annual leave and use that leave, subject to applicable legal and regulatory requirements, when the leave is most appropriate and beneficial to them. While the use of administrative leave by employees during the period of the shutdown would enable those employees to preserve their annual leave for use at some future date, the Agency has not argued that such a result would impair the Agency's operations in any way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In terms of the effect of the proposal on the exercise of management's rights, we note that the Agency has already decided that it is beneficial to temporarily curtail its operations. The Agency has not argued that the cost of placing employees on administrative leave as opposed to annual leave would impose a significant burden. We note that the amount of administrative leave that would be taken is not without limits but, instead, is limited to the brief period of 5 days per employee. Although this use of administrative leave essentially would represent a savings to employees of an equivalent number of days of annual leave, which is then available for employees' use, the Agency has not established that the proposal would result in a substantial number of workdays lost or the manner in which it would presently impair the Agency's operations. Additionally, even though employees would preserve several days of annual leave, management would still retain the right to grant or deny leave requests based on workload requirements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency has suggested that there is a concern for long-term job preservation. While it is entirely appropriate for the Agency to take such matters into consideration, such a long-term effect, when faced with the application of the Union's proposal to the Agency's proposed 1991 holiday shutdown, is purely speculative. Moreover, in finding that the proposal is within the duty to bargain, we are not passing on the relative merits of the proposal but are simply directing the parties to negotiate. The parties are free, of course, to bargain to impasse. Any arguments concerning the relative merits of the proposal are more appropriately made in a proceeding before the Federal Service Impasses Panel....</p>
<p class="noindent">Yet another decision approving negotiability of a proposal for administrative leave during a plant shutdown was <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-72 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 42 FLRA 1019, 1020 (1991), declaring negotiable Proposal 1:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the event that the employer shuts down or cuts back operations due to lack of production or to promote production efficiency, the employer shall grant employees the option of using annual leave or other paid leave in lieu of leave without pay during the period of the shut down. The employer further agrees to grant employees one day of administrative leave for each day the employee takes leave without pay, annual leave or other leave during the shut down. If the shut down lasts an odd number of days the employees will be required to take annual leave, other leave, or leave without pay for the extra day of the shut down.</p>
<p class="noindent">Following the <span class="Italic">Rock Island</span> series, <span class="Italic">NAGE and VA</span>, 43 FLRA 414, 429 (1991), affirmed negotiability of Proposal 4:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an employee reports for duty in accordance with the regular work schedule, and it is determined by the Employer that the employee's services are not required that day, the employee may request annual leave. In the absence of a request, the employee will remain on duty or will be administratively excused.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1993, OPM abolished ("sunsetted") some portions of the FPM, including FPM Chapter 610. The impact of the regulatory changes was explored in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2119 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 49 FLRA 151, 159-61 (1994). In contention was a proposal that followed an agency's decision to dismiss nonessential employees early, with pay, on December 24 and December 31, 1991. The proposal sought conversion to administrative leave for employees who were on sick or annual leave on those days. The proposal also sought future grants of administrative leave for the employees who worked for the full two days. The first provision was negotiable, the second was not:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained by the Union, the proposal is designed to provide equal treatment for bargaining unit employees who were not released early on December 24 and 31, 1991, and to provide them with a personal benefit. Thus, the proposal would provide administrative leave to employees who were required to work on the dates in question. We see nothing in FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11 that suggests that administrative leave is appropriate in such a situation. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 3 and U.S. Department of Transportation, United States Coast Guard, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</span>, 45 FLRA 805 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Coast Guard</span>) (proposals requiring agency to grant administrative leave to bargaining unit employees whenever nonessential military personnel were granted such leave found to directly and excessively interfere with the right to assign work; additionally, the proposals were unlike proposals where administrative leave was sought for periods of agency shutdowns). Additionally, while the Union notes that FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11-4 is designed to promote equity and consistency in the granting of excused absences, that goal is predicated on the appropriate use of excused absences. To the extent the proposal seeks administrative leave for employees in the Arsenal and the Commissary and the essential employees in AMCCOM and ISC who were required to work on December 24 and 31, 1991, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Union's assertion that the proposal is negotiable because it permits the Agency to approve the use of administrative leave <span id="page_724"></span>consistent with the Agency's needs. As we stated above, in ascertaining the appropriateness of administrative leave, we must determine whether that leave is consistent with FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11. Having found that the proposal granting the right to the administrative leave is inconsistent with that subchapter, we need not address whether the proposal is consistent with the Agency's right to approve the use of such leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the provisions contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 610.301-610.306 do not alter our conclusion that the proposal is nonnegotiable with respect to the above-noted employees. Those provisions govern administrative dismissals of daily, hourly, and piecework employees for situations such as the interruption of normal operations by events beyond the control of management or employees, the closing of an establishment for short periods of time for managerial reasons, or where the public interest allows employees to participate in civil activities. Additionally, agencies may, by regulation, authorize dismissals under other circumstances. Assuming that the employees in this case are covered by these provisions, we do not see how the provisions would operate to authorize a dismissal where, in fact, the employees in the Arsenal and the Commissary and the essential employees in AMCCOM and ISC were required to work on December 24 and 31, 1991. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California and International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Planners, Estimators, Progressmen &#x0026; Schedulers Association, Local 5</span>, 48 FLRA 1372 (1994) (arbitration award found not to conflict with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.302 where the arbitrator directed the agency to grant employees administrative leave during a 4-day shutdown).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we address the proposal insofar as it seeks administrative leave for employees in AMCCOM and ISC who were on annual or sick leave on December 24 and 31, 1991. For the following reasons, we find that the proposal is negotiable as to these employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we find no merit to the Agency's claim that the proposal conflicts with 5 U.S.C. chapter 63 because it would allow for the accumulation of annual and sick leave in amounts greater than authorized by law. There is nothing in the language of the proposal or the Union's explanation as to the manner in which it will operate that supports the Agency's contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that the proposal is nonnegotiable under FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11. As we noted previously, the Agency dismissed non-essential employees in AMCCOM and ISC from work early on December 24 and 31, 1991, pursuant to FPM chapter 610, which governed group dismissals. By its terms, subchapter 11 "do[es] not apply to group dismissals or closures of activities." FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11-6. Because the employees at issue were in the Agency components that were part of a group dismissal, we find that FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11 does not apply. Therefore, unlike our discussion with respect to the employees who were not released early on December 24 and 31, 1991, we need not determine whether the purpose for which the administrative leave is sought is appropriate. Accordingly, contrary to the Agency, we find that subchapter 11 does not bar negotiations over the proposal with respect to the employees in AMCCOM and ISC who were on annual or sick leave on December 24 and 31, 1991.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we find no merit to the Agency's assertion that the proposal is inconsistent with regulations governing the administration of annual and sick leave because those regulations do not contemplate the use of administrative leave where annual or sick leave would be appropriate. The Agency did not cite the particular regulations on which its argument is premised, other than FPM chapter 630. However, the Agency relied on <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> in support of its position and, in that case, the Authority discussed the requirements of FPM chapter 630, subchapter 3-4.a(2). Therefore, it is logical to presume that the Agency's argument is based on that regulatory provision. However, as we stated earlier, FPM chapter 630, subchapter 3 has been abolished. Thus, reliance on that regulatory provision cannot serve as a bar to negotiations over the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find no merit to the Agency's contention that the proposal is inconsistent with the right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. It is well established that proposals that require management to grant leave prevent management from requiring employees to remain on duty to perform work and, thus, directly interfere with that management right. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Coast Guard</span>, 45 FLRA at 809. In this case, the proposal explicitly states that the use of administrative leave will be subject to the approval of the appropriate supervisor and that such approval will be based on the same criteria as the approval of annual leave. Because the proposal preserves the Agency's right to approve the use of administrative leave, we find that there is no direct interference with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022 and</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Headquarters, 101st Airborne</span> <span class="Italic">Division, Fort Campbell, Kentucky</span>, 40 FLRA 371, 378-81 (1991) (proposal that did not preserve the agency's right to decide whether or not to grant requests for administrative leave held to directly interfere with the right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union proposal requiring the agency to grant employees who suffered a loss of pay through furlough administrative leave equal to the lost time, if a supplemental appropriation was enacted. The (late) FPM provided discretion to the agency concerning administrative leave. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals and Dept. of Labor</span>, 17 FLRA 122, 122 (1985).</p>
