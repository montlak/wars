<p class="Body-Text">A personnel action may include a decision concerning benefits. To be covered as a personnel action, a decision concerning a benefit must have been made. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holloway v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 82 MSPR 435, 439 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (assuming that the appellant had a right to the reimbursement of expenses associated with the purchase of a house, he lost no benefit because he submitted no claim; another claim, for moving expenses, was barred by collateral estoppel through prior litigation); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Haddon v. Executive Residence at the White House</span>, 313 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (considering what constitutes a personnel action for the purposes of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act); <span class="Italic">Luna v. VA</span>, DA-1221-16-0223-W-2 (NP 4/12/2023) (correction of an SF-50 is not itself a personnel action); Garnishment of wages, involving a decision concerning pay or benefits, constitutes a covered personnel action. <span class="Italic">Roach v. Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 464, 470 &#x00B6; 14 (1999); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. IBWC</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MCCARTHY_ROBERT_JOHN_DA_1221_09_0725_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_628714.pdf">116 MSPR 594</a>, 2011 MSPB 74 (2011) (considering denial or discontinuation of federal health benefits as a personnel action in an IRA case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although disclosure of irregularities in the processing of grievances or EEO complaints may be protected under 5 USC 2302(b)(8), the irregularities do not fall within the definition of a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Dept. of Army</span>, 89 MSPR 589, 641 &#x00B6; 101 (2001). Removal of major law enforcement duties, e.g., carrying a firearm or the ability to make arrests, constituted significant changes in duties of a criminal investigator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johns v. VA</span>, 95 MSPR 106, 112-13, 115-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14, 23-24 (2003) ("That the appellant may have been able to perform aspects of his job without his law enforcement authority does not mean that the agency did not effect a significant change in his duties, responsibilities, or working conditions."). Failure to consider the appellant for a "mini-grant" was not a covered personnel action, "particularly where the evidence...shows that employees had to compete for this particular "mini-grant" and the appellant's application was not the only one which was denied." <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, 95 MSPR 664, 668 &#x00B6; 12 (2004), <span class="Italic">vacated and remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, 116 Fed. Appx. 264, 267 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP) (rejection of a proposal by a scientist for a "mini-grant" was not a personnel action--the program was meant to improve the agency's service rather than to affect the agency's relations with its employees), <span class="Italic">following remand,</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkes v. USDA</span>, 253 Fed. Appx. 939 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP). A telework agreement modification qualifies as a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUMSEY_ELISSA_DC_1221_11_0466_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_923039.pdf">120 MSPR 259</a>, 272 &#x00B6; 23, <span class="blue">2013 MSPB 82</span> (2013) ("In addition, we find that the cancellation of the appellant's telework agreement constitutes a significant change in working conditions and is a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Termination of retained pay or retained grade benefits is a personnel action within the ambit of an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 400 &#x00B6; 56 (2004) (termination of retained pay or pay benefits was not the product of reprisal).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's claims regarding the agency's failure to extend his appointment during resolution of his EEO complaint and its delayed action on that complaint are not excluded from section 2302(b)(8) coverage simply because they may also fall under subsection (b)(9). <span class="Italic">See Massie v. Department of Transportation</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 12 n.1 (2010). Construing these claims broadly, as required, <span class="Italic">see Usharauli</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 383, &#x00B6; 10, we find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that the <span id="Page_3922"></span>agency's failure to process his EEO complaint in its usual manner may constitute a significant change in working conditions, which would be a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). Similarly, the appellant's claims that the agency changed its normal procedures for processing OWCP claims and providing "standard" post-deployment psychological counseling could also be broadly construed as a significant change in working conditions. We therefore find that the appellant should be allowed to further develop these claims on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Strickland-Donald v. Dept. of Army</span>, DE-1221-15-0132-W-1 (NP 12/31/2015) ("If the appellant is alleging that the agency ignored her repeated requests to reassess the classification of her position in retaliation for her protected disclosures, we find that this does not constitute a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mattil v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board recognized but did not squarely decide whether the issuance of an SF-50 with stigmatizing information constitutes, for IRA analysis, a personnel action separate from the personnel action recorded by the SF-50. <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. Dept. of State</span>, 112 MSPR 587, 595-96 &#x00B6; 18, 2009 MSPB 218 (2009). On appeal, however, the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board, although on alternate grounds, <span class="Italic">Nasuti v. MSPB</span>, 376 Fed. Appx. 29, 33-34 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Nasuti's claim with respect to the April 2008 disclosure fails on the other ground invoked by the Board, however: that the SF-50 did not qualify as a "personnel action" for purposes of the WPA. As the Board explained, an SF-50 is not a personnel action in itself, but is merely an after-the-fact record of a personnel action previously taken. Moreover, in this case both the disclosure (the April 2008 letter) and the alleged personnel action (the issuance of the SF-50) occurred at a time when Mr. Nasuti was no longer employed by the agency. Although the WPA allows an individual right of action to be prosecuted by "an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a), the statute requires that the "personnel action" that is the subject of the individual right of action be taken "with respect to an employee in, or applicant for, a covered position in an agency," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), and it prohibits the personnel action from being taken "with respect to any employee or applicant for employment" because of a protected disclosure of information "by an employee or applicant," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Although the WPA is remedial legislation and is construed liberally to effectuate its purposes, <span class="Italic">Weed v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 221, 227 (2010), it is difficult to stretch the statutory language to cover a claim brought by a former employee complaining of agency action taken after the termination of employment in response to a disclosure that was also made after the termination of his employment. Accordingly, we agree with the Board that the issuance of the SF-50 does not suffice to serve as a predicate for Mr. Nasuti's individual right of action appeal. With respect to the April 2008 disclosure, we therefore affirm the Board's decision.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Nasuti argues that the agency violated OPM guidelines by placing comments on his SF-50 because he was an employee without a right of appeal to the Board, and that the agency should be bound to its original declaration that Mr. Nasuti's termination was for "operational reasons." However, the merits of his claim that adverse comments should not have been placed on his SF-50 are outside the scope of an individual right of action appeal, which is limited to whether a personnel action was taken in retaliation for a protected disclosure; an individual right of action proceeding does not address whether the personnel action in question was otherwise unlawful. <span class="Italic">See Drake v. Agency for Int'l Dev.</span>, 543 F.3d 1377, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Carson v. Dept. of Energy,</span> AT-1221-15-0073-W-1 n.6 (NP 7/20/2015), an agency's failure to request the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel to resolve an issue is not a covered personnel action. <span class="Italic">Carson</span> added that "[t]o the extent that the appellant is alleging that the agency retaliated against him because he disclosed that the Board violated the law by not conducting 'special studies' pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(3), the Board members must recuse themselves from considering this possible allegation."

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant then filed a new IRA appeal after having brought his claim to OSC's Complaints Examining Unit and having received a closure letter. He renewed his allegation that the Board's administrative judge essentially retaliated against him by ruling against him in his disability retirement appeal after he disclosed misconduct by the OPM counsel and the administrative judge himself. After finding that the appellant had now established exhaustion, another Board administrative judge issued a thorough jurisdictional order advising the appellant that it did not appear that he had adequately alleged the other jurisdictional elements of an IRA appeal; namely, failing to nonfrivolously allege that he was subjected to a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302, and the administrative judge directed him to file evidence and argument to establish the Board's jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial decision, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that he was subject to a personnel action in connection with his claim that, in ruling against him in an earlier appeal, a Board administrative judge retaliated against the appellant for having disclosed misconduct during that proceeding. The administrative judge here reasoned that the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) should not be interpreted in a manner that would interfere with normal appeal processes. Accordingly, he dismissed the IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant first argues, as he did below, that, because the administrative judge, through his decision, denied the appellant disability retirement for which he claims he was otherwise qualified, he was thereby subject to a decision concerning benefits, which is a covered personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(ix). He has not, however, shown error in the administrative judge's finding that the Board and our reviewing court have recognized that the WPA should not be interpreted so as to interfere with normal appeal processes. <span class="Italic">See Meuwissen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 234 F.3d 9, 11, 13-14 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the "disclosure" of a decision by an administrative judge, even an incorrect one, is not a disclosure protected by the WPA; even an erroneous decision by an administrative judge empowered to make adjudicative decisions based on operative facts and relevant law is not the type of violation comprehended by the WPA; the remedy for an incorrect decision is an appeal). Acknowledging that <span class="Italic">Meuwissen</span> was legislatively overruled by the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act (WPEA) to the extent that the court found that the appellant did not make a disclosure because the administrative ruling with which he disagreed was already publicly known, the administrative judge determined, nonetheless, that the WPEA did not disturb the court's more general finding that erroneous administrative rulings are not the type of danger or wrongdoing that whistleblower protections were meant to address. <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 94, &#x00B6; 15 n.5 (2013), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 561 F. App'x 926 (Fed. Cir. 2014); <span class="Italic">Francisco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 295 F.3d 1310 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (explaining that alleged disclosures that were merely legal arguments concerning supposed errors by OPM in connection with the appellant's application for benefits to OPM and by OPM in defending its action before the Board are simply not the types of disclosures the WPA was designed to protect; it was not designed to afford an opportunity to collaterally attack the results of earlier litigation brought by the appellant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Noting that these cases addressed whether, in challenging litigation-related conduct, the employee engaged in protected activity, the administrative judge determined that the same considerations support finding that adjudication is not a personnel action covered by the WPA. He reasoned that allowing such collateral challenges would thwart orderly adjudication by allowing administrative judges to sit in appellate review of Board members' previous decisions and would undermine the finality of the Board's determinations by opening the door to an endless cycle of new appeals in every case. The administrative judge further found that, in analogous circumstances, other tribunals, including the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Federal district courts, have refused to adopt interpretations of their governing statutes that would allow this type of collateral challenge. Beyond disagreeing with the administrative judge's ultimate conclusion in this regard, the appellant has not challenged his reasoning or the support he has provided for his findings. To the extent the appellant still believes that the Board's decisions were incorrectly decided based on the same claims that he now raises or others, he acknowledges that the further review he has sought is pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.... In sum, and because we find the administrative judge's reasoning persuasive, we agree that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that he was subject to a covered personnel action under the WPA when the administrative judge, in the appellant's disability retirement appeal, ruled against him. Therefore his IRA appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...In August 2019, she filed an individual-right-of-action ("IRA") appeal with the Board alleging that the Department of Defense Education Activity (that is, the agency that runs Gordon Elementary) engaged in a personnel action in retaliation for Ms. Blount's whistleblower activity. In that proceeding (and in the Office of Special Counsel complaint leading to it), she alleged that the agency retaliated with "disparate work assignment[s]." Specifically, Ms. Blount pointed to (1) an order for her to attend a single training session in April 2019 to make up for one she allegedly missed (though she disputes missing it), (2) a requirement by those conducting the training for attendees to submit an "action plan" (a curricular requirement for all attendees), and (3) reminder emails from the same people that she needed to complete that action plan (and offering to help) As the Board observed, "[i]t is undisputed that [Ms. Blount] received no discipline of any kind" for "failing to respond to emails...regarding her action plan, or for failing to provide the plan itself."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board. A party seeking to bring an IRA appeal has the burden to establish jurisdiction. Ms. Blount has not identified which category of activity in &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) that the alleged actions would fall under. Respondent suggests that the closest possible categories are (1) "a decision...concerning education or training if the education may reasonably be expected to lead to an appointment, promotion, performance evaluation, or other [personnel] action" and (2) a "significant change of duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A).
