<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-56"><span class="space">a.</span> Five-Tier Appraisal System; Marginal, Minimally Successful, or "Needs Improvement" Level of Performance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Of significance in performance actions is the rating the employee receives on critical elements. Somehow, to make a case, there must be a demonstration--irrespective of the overall rating--that the action against the employee is based on an unacceptable rating on at least one of the employee's critical elements. No matter how many summary rating tiers are possible, it must be possible to determine whether an employee's performance has met the satisfactory level, or dropped to unsuccessful, for given critical elements. Some agency performance appraisal systems establish a level for standards at the "marginal" or "needs improvement" level--above unacceptable and below satisfactory or "meets objective." If the employee is placed on a PIP, the PIP will then define what constitutes the retention level, i.e., what the employee must do to be rated on the standard at least at the marginal performance level.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Confusion, or lack of clarity, may result when the agency performance appraisal system calls for a four five tier overall rating, with one level, permitting retention, between unsuccessful and fully successful, but standards are written only at or above the fully successful level. Interpreting guidance in the late FPM, <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 297-98 (1985), determined that an agency action is improper if the level the employee must achieve for retention is one level below "fully satisfactory," but that level is not specified in terms of quality of performance. Yet under <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, an agency with a rating system requiring a standard for more than one level of performance may rescue itself by creating a standard at the "minimally successful" level of performance, or through definitive instructions in a form other than a standard, at the onset of or before a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's system contravenes the cited FPM letter and we agree with OPM's analysis that such a system generally will violate the statutory requirement of objectivity. However, we find that an employee's substantive rights to a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance and to communication of the standards he is expected to meet may be met otherwise than by a performance standard which meets OPM's requirement for extrapolation only one level above or below the written standard. Thus, we hold that an agency may satisfy the employee's rights under 5 USC &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), (2), and (6), by communicating to the employee the standards he must meet in order to be evaluated by demonstrating performance at a level which is sufficient for retention. Those standards may be more or less objective depending upon the job measured, <span class="Italic">Shuman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, but must be sufficiently specific to provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee must aim his performance, and not an elusive goal which the agency may find the employee met or failed to meet at its pleasure. Such communication may occur in the PIP, in counseling sessions, in written instructions, or in any manner calculated to apprise the employee of the requirements against which he is to be measured.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem was addressed in an appeal involving a five-tier system. If an unacceptable performance warning letter is based on a system using only a single standard, but with five rating levels, and the agency does not advise the appellant directly or indirectly of the degree of improvement necessary to avoid demotion by meeting the minimally satisfactory level--there being nothing in the nature of the performance measured by the standard that would not permit the agency to be more specific--the requirements of accuracy and objectivity are not met. The Board will not substitute its judgment as to whether the performance, without a valid standard, was minimally acceptable or unacceptable. <span class="Italic">Goodale v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 28 MSPR 158, 160 (1985) (same appraisal, same problem, and same result as in <span class="Italic">Goodale</span> and <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>); <span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 28 MSPR 153, 156 (1985) (appellant was told what was required for a satisfactory rating, but not for a minimally satisfactory or "needs improvement"; "[s]ince it was only to this level which his performance had to rise, and because there is nothing in the nature of the performance measured by the standard which would allow the agency to be more specific, we find that...the agency failed to meet the statutory requirements of accuracy and objectivity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A five-tier appraisal system based on two written standards ("marginal" and "highly satisfactory") permits the rating official's judgment to be within a reasonable range of accuracy and objectivity. <span class="Italic">Chennault v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 122, 126 n.4 (1985). But when an agency employs a five-tier system for individual elements, including levels at the fully successful, minimally successful, and unsatisfactory levels, it cannot require an individual to meet the fully successful level as a condition of job retention following a PIP. <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Agency performance appraisal systems may include between two and five summary rating levels. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(d). Under any performance appraisal system, the lowest rating level is "unacceptable," which is the only rating that will support removal under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 462, 468 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(6); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.206(b)(8), 430.207(c), 430.208(d).

If an agency adopts such a performance appraisal system, an appellant's performance could be "not satisfactory" without falling to the level that would support removal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.207(c)-(d), 430.208(d); <span class="Italic">Stenmark</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 468.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency rated the appellant under a five-tiered performance appraisal system, including a rating level of "minimally successful" that fell between "fully successful" and "unacceptable." Therefore, under the agency's performance appraisal system, if the appellant's performance was "minimally successful" it would be "not satisfactory" without falling to the level of "unacceptable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.207(c), 430.208(d); <span class="Italic">Stenmark</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 468.

<p class="Body-Text">If standards set at only one level for a five-level review system are inadequate, statutory requirements may be met if the standard for retention is communicated in a performance improvement plan, in counseling sessions, in written instructions, or in any manner calculated to inform the employee of the requirements. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 589 (1985) (Table). In <span class="Italic">Henderson v. NASA</span>, 116 MSPR 96, 104-08 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 18-27, 2011 MSPB 12 (2011), the agency insufficiently defined during the PIP the level of marginal performance (required for retention) in a system requiring performance elements to be graded at five levels:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may cure otherwise fatal defects in the development and communication of performance standards by communicating sufficient information regarding performance requirements at the beginning of, and even during, the PIP. <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 188, &#x00B6; 18; <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 297-98. On September 21, 2007, Timothy Gautney, the Mechanical Team Lead for the West Area who mentored and trained the appellant, provided the appellant with a written list of Test Preparation Sheets (TPSs)[4] to complete, along with "target" completion dates. The appellant testified that there were inconsistencies between his supervisor, Mr. Hammond, and Mr. Gautney on whether the target suspense dates were "guidelines" or "deadlines," because Mr. Gautney presented the target dates as "guidelines" and informed him that there is "no such thing as deadlines" in the West Test Area. The appellant also testified that he was not informed by Mr. Hammond that he was expected to comprehend the knowledge requirements by a specific date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;TPSs essentially are work orders instructing technicians in the Test Lab how to perform various tasks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's "mid-year performance review" on November 26, 2007, occurred less than three months after the appellant was formally assigned to the position and only two months after the appellant was given the September 21, 2007 list of tasks to complete. During that review, Mr. Hammond informed the appellant that his performance in the critical element of "Mechanical Systems Engineer" was unacceptable because he was unable to "manage his time efficiently to meet his deadlines," he "communicates poorly with other members of his team," and he did not show the "initiative that would be expected of an employee of his grade and experience level." Mr. Hammond also found that the appellant: completed less than half the tasks from the original assignment list and wrote fewer than ten TPSs after 90 days on the job. He further found that the appellant failed to meet expectations in his critical element of "Communications" because he routinely failed to communicate verbally or by e-mail in a "clear, concise, and well-organized manner."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performance standards should be specific enough to provide an employee with a "firm benchmark" toward which to aim his performance, <span class="Italic">Greer v. Department of the Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 483 (1998), and must be sufficiently precise so as to invoke general consensus as to their meaning <span id="Page_2923"></span>and content. <span class="Italic">Romero v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 527, 534-35 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Here, the record supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to put the appellant on notice of what he needed to do to be at an acceptable level of performance on the critical elements of "Communications" and "Mechanical Systems Engineer." In this regard, the appellant testified that he learned for the first time in his November 26, 2007 "mid-year performance review" that he was not communicating at a level or in the manner deemed acceptable by agency. The appellant also testified that, prior to the November 26, 2007 review, he was not informed by Mr. Hammond until halfway into the performance period that he was expected to produce TPSs at a higher rate and in a timelier manner. While the agency may have had an expectation that the appellant would produce the TPS reports within a certain time, the record shows that the agency did not initially inform the appellant that he was expected to strictly adhere to "target dates," and, in fact, Mr. Gautney testified that he conveyed to the appellant that the timelines he provided were not deadlines, <span class="Italic">per se</span>, but were goals for completing these assignments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the record supports the administrative judge's finding that the agency failed to cure its invalid written performance standards during the appellant's initial performance period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's communications with the appellant during the PIP did not cure the invalid written performance standards.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record also supports the administrative judge's findings that the agency did not cure its deficient performance standards through written and/or oral communications during the 90-day PIP period. Because the appellant was rated on a five-tier system for his critical elements, the agency was required to inform him, at a minimum, of what he needed to do to perform at the "needs improvement" level to avoid a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7. Although the agency communicated to the appellant the tasks he needed to complete on the PIP and provided him with feedback on his completion of tasks, the agency failed to inform the appellant of the minimum level of performance he needed to demonstrate to avoid a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 298-300 (the appellant's demotion for unacceptable performance could not be sustained where the agency, despite having a five-tier performance system, consistently told the appellant what was required for a "satisfactory" rating only, and not for the "minimally satisfactory" or "needs improvement" level which she had to reach in order to avoid demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record supports the administrative judge's finding that, although Mr. Hammond informed the appellant, through the PIP, of his work duties and expected completion dates, he did not sufficiently communicate to the appellant how his efforts would be evaluated to determine a level of performance. The Board has held that an agency is not required to include in each performance standard specific indicators of quantity, quality, and timeliness that are used to evaluate work. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Department of the Army,</span> 27 M.S.P.R. 305, 309 (1985). Further, the fact that the performance standard may call for a certain amount of subjective judgment on the part of the employee's supervisor does not automatically invalidate it. <span class="Italic">Melnick v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 99 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table). However, as set forth above, the Board has repeatedly held that performance standards must be "sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content and provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee may aim [his] performance." <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 6 (2000); <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Greer</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. at 484 (finding that the agency cured any lack of specificity in the appellant's performance standards when it informed the appellant of specific work requirements through written instructions, information concerning deficiencies and methods of improving performance, and memoranda describing unacceptable performance); <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge correctly found that the agency did not adequately communicate to the appellant the standard of measure for evaluating his assignments and whether difficulty in one particular area or task would preclude a finding that he had successfully completed the PIP. In other words, in looking at the record as a whole, it is not possible to invoke a "general consensus" as to what level of performance the agency expected of the appellant to successfully pass his PIP. <span class="Italic">See Johnson</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 6. The appellant's lack of clarity of what he needed to do to succeed on the PIP is illustrated in a February 13, 2008 e-mail wherein Mr. Hammond addressed the appellant's concerns that if he failed one element of the PIP, he would fail the entire PIP by assuring him that "this was not the case" and that "all knowledge factors and tasks will be evaluated as a whole at the end of [the] PIP." Mr. Hammond reiterated in a March 14, 2008 e-mail to the appellant that: his "overall performance will be determined at the end of the PIP and the PIP will be graded on its entirety"; the key to succeeding on the PIP is the ability to "demonstrate initiative and the ability to work at the GS13 level"; and the appellant's "first priority is to meet the suspense dates of [his] PIP."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Hammond's March 11, 2008 e-mail to the appellant, halfway through the PIP period, further shows the agency's deficiency in properly informing the appellant of what level of performance he needed to achieve to pass the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">You have increased your efforts significantly since your midterm review in November. At your PIP status meeting on February 27th you had completed you[r] knowledge requirements and were slightly behind in your work products. Today you were more behind on your work requirements and unsatisfactory on your knowledge requirements. The things that concern me most are not your technical expertise or learning capability, but your time management, initiative, and your communication with us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He then set forth several examples of the appellant's deficiencies in time management and communication. Mr. Hammond also provided the appellant with more specific information about what he considered constitutes acceptable performance in the tasks of knowledge requirements. The administrative judge found that, while this information provided the appellant with more specific information regarding the level of performance the agency expected of him on the knowledge requirement tasks, the agency did not provide the appellant with this information until two-thirds of the way into the PIP period. ID at 10; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(2) (an agency is required to inform an employee of the expected performance standards at the beginning of a performance "appraisal period"); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.203 (defining "appraisal period" as "the established period of time for which performance will be reviewed and a rating of record will be prepared"), 430.204(b)(1)(ii). In any event, even if the agency had provided the appellant with this information earlier in the PIP, the agency's failure to inform the appellant of how it would evaluate his performance on individual tasks and on the PIP as a whole precludes a finding that the appellant's performance standards were valid as supplemented by the agency's oral and written communications. <span class="Italic">See Donaldson</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 298-300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The totality of the evidence shows that, although the agency informed the appellant of the individual tasks he needed to accomplish during the PIP, it failed to adequately explain to the appellant a sufficiently "firm benchmark" for which he should aim his performance. This is especially true given Mr. Hammond's statement to the appellant that his performance on the PIP would be graded in its entirety, without any further explanation as to how the agency intended to evaluate the appellant's performance as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the agency has not shown that the administrative judge erred in finding that the written performance standards were invalid and were not subsequently cured by the agency's oral and written communications to the appellant, we AFFIRM the initial decision that reversed this 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 performance-based removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Hard on the heels of <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> (but not mentioning that decision) arrived another decision that set aside a Chapter 43 removal because the agency failed to properly set a required marginal level of performance or, alternatively, misdescribed it, <span class="Italic">ala</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis, supra,</span> as a backwards standard. <span class="Italic">Van Prichard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as the administrative judge acknowledged, the agency rated the appellant under a five-tiered performance appraisal system, including a rating level of Marginal that fell between Fully Successful and Unacceptable.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2924"></span>To remove an employee for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, the agency must prove, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's performance standards are valid. <span class="Italic">Diprizio</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 7. To prove that it has valid performance standards, an agency must show that the standards meet the statutory requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) and do not constitute an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Thus, to the maximum extent feasible, an agency is required to establish standards which permit the accurate appraisal of performance, based on objective criteria. <span class="Italic">Neal v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 158, 161 (1996). Performance standards are not valid if they do not set forth the minimum level of performance that an employee must achieve to avoid removal for unacceptable performance under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1441-44 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Absent valid performance standards, the Board cannot consider charged performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Ortiz v. Department of Justice</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 692, 695 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board similarly recognized in <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis</span>, because the agency here could not remove the appellant under chapter 43 if he reached a Marginal level of performance, the question is whether that performance standard is valid. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 9. Unlike the standards in <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis</span>, in which apparently each level of performance was defined for each critical element, here the agency's Performance Plan simply sets forth each critical element but does not define the level of performance for each element as part of the Plan. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 9. Instead, as the administrative judge noted, the only mention of the requirements of meeting the Marginal level of performance are stated generally for the Performance Plan as a whole in the "Definitions" section. The Marginal rating is defined as performance that is "less than Fully Successful and supervisory guidance and assistance is more than normally required. To be rated Marginal, any of the Critical Elements are rated 'Marginal' and no elements are rated 'Unacceptable.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the Marginal performance standard is an invalid backwards standard because, although it is written at the "minimally successful" level, it fails to inform the appellant of what is necessary to obtain an acceptable level of performance, and instead describes what he should not do. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d. at 1443-44; <span class="Italic">Romero v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 527, 534 n.5 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 22 F.3d 1104 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). Because the Marginal standard does not define the minimal performance necessary for the appellant to remain employed in his position, the agency failed to distinguish between Marginal and Unacceptable performance as a practical matter. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 644, 650-51 (1991). In its petition for review, the agency has failed to point to anything in the record that cures this deficiency by advising the appellant of what is necessary to obtain an acceptable level of performance, i.e., a Marginal level of performance rather than a Fully Successful level. <span class="Italic">Cf. Diprizio</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (finding that, while the agency's performance standards were not sufficiently precise, the applicable critical elements identified specific tasks with such details that, when read in conjunction with the performance standards, the appellant was apprised of the tasks he was required to perform to meet the minimally successful level of performance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency asserts that, even if the performance standards lacked specificity, the agency provided the appellant with clear guidance of what was expected of him during the PIP, we agree with the administrative judge that the information provided to the appellant for his PIP was limited to what was required for the appellant to achieve a Fully Successful rating. The issue here turns on not only whether the agency informed the appellant of what duties he was required to perform in his position and/or during the PIP, but also the <span class="Italic">level of performance</span> he was expected to achieve to retain his position. Indeed, as discussed above, the PIP refers on several instances to the improvements needed by the appellant to meet the Fully Successful level. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 4 at 82, 87-88 (stating that the appellant would be given 90 days to "achieve a Fully Successful level of performance," that the appellant "must raise [his] performance to the Fully Successful level," and that "[f]ailure to achieve a Fully Successful level of performance...may result in a performance-based action."). The agency has identified nothing in the PIP that placed the appellant on notice of what was required to reach the Marginal performance level, at which he could retain his position and could not be removed for unacceptable performance under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Department of Labor</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 293, 298-300 (1985) (the appellant's demotion for unacceptable performance could not be sustained where the agency, despite having a five-tier performance system, consistently told the appellant what was required for a "satisfactory" rating only, and not for the "minimally satisfactory" or "needs improvement" level which she had to reach in order to avoid demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts in its petition for review that the administrative judge's "factual finding that the Agency used a summary performance rating of 'Marginally Successful' is not supported by any record evidence" and thus her finding that the Marginally Successful performance rating is invalid was erroneous. The agency maintains that "Marginally Successful" is not defined anywhere in the record, that the administrative judge "coined" the phrase, and that "the phrase does not in anyway [sic] describe or illustrate any of the Agency's critical elements and their respective performance standards." It further asserts that the administrative judge's coined phrase represents the agency's summary level 2 performance rating based on its five-tiered scale and that the agency's definition of level 2 "fully complies with the OPM prescribed definition found at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.207(c)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's assertions on this issue are without merit. While the agency's Performance Plan clearly refers to "Marginal" performance rather than "Marginally Successful" performance as referenced by the administrative judge throughout the initial decision, the deficiency in the Performance Plan's definition of the Marginal level remains, as fully discussed above, regardless of the administrative judge's minor misstatement in referring to the standard. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10. Further, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.207(c) provides nothing more than that "[a]ppraisal programs should provide assistance whenever performance is determined to be below 'Fully Successful' or equivalent but above 'Unacceptable.'" Assuming that the agency met that requirement, it still failed to define the minimal performance necessary for the appellant to remain employed in his position. <span class="Italic">See Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d at 1441-44; <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. at 650-51.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts in its petition for review that the administrative judge failed to issue an order indicating any potential legal problem with the standards or to otherwise place the agency on notice that there were problems with the OPM-approved performance standards. The agency has failed to cite legal authority supporting its implicit assertion that the administrative judge may not find the performance standards invalid without providing the agency an opportunity to supplement the record. The Board has held that, absent valid performance standards, it cannot evaluate whether an agency properly took action against an employee for unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Neal,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 161; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 340, 347 (1993). Thus, because an agency must prove its action was based on valid performance standards in cases involving a performance-based action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 43, the Board has held that it is "obliged to consider this issue, regardless of whether it has been raised by the parties." <span class="Italic">Neal,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 161. The administrative judge properly advised the agency of its burden in proving the appellant's unacceptable performance under chapter 43, which includes proving by substantial evidence that the relevant performance standards are valid. <span class="Italic">See Diprizio</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6; 7; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.104. Accordingly, the agency's assertions on this issue are meritless. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 17 (finding no error by the administrative judge where he considered, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, the validity of the appellant's performance standards because although the administrative judge cancelled the appellant's requested hearing and issued a decision reversing the appellant's removal, he provided the agency with an opportunity to present evidence and argument to show that its standards were valid), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on other grounds in Guillebeau v. Department of the Navy</span>, 362 F.3d 1329, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency maintains in its petition for review that the appellant was removed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(c)(2) because his performance at the end of his PIP remained unacceptable. The agency asserts that the appellant's performance was rated Marginal in his previous final full year appraisal for the period ending on March 31, 2009, and that the appellant did not appeal or grieve his rating, indicating that he understood and accepted the rating. It further asserts that the appellant failed to claim that his performance during his PIP was Marginal and that he thus could not be terminated for unacceptable performance. The agency further asserts that, even if neither issue preclusion nor collateral estoppel apply, the appellant admitted before the administrative judge that his performance was not satisfactory and that he "quintessentially admitted under oath that the performance standards did 'permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria...related to the job in question.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 14-15 (citing <span class="Italic">Neal</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 163).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether the appellant asserted that his performance was Marginal and thus he could not be removed, the Board is obligated to consider and the agency is obligated to prove by substantial evidence that the performance standards under which the appellant was rated were valid before sustaining a removal under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See Neal,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. at 161. Accordingly, the appellant's failure to object to his previous Marginal performance rating or his failure to assert that his performance was Marginal during his PIP does not excuse the agency from meeting its burden on this issue. Further, under the agency's five-tiered performance appraisal system, the agency is required to prove that the appellant's performance is worse than "not satisfactory," i.e., Marginal; it is required to prove that his performance is Unacceptable. <span class="Italic">See Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 7. Therefore, the appellant's admission during his deposition that some of his work products were unsatisfactory does not equate to an admission that his performance was unacceptable. Further, <span id="Page_2925"></span>we note that the appellant's statements regarding the unsatisfactory nature of some of his work products were elicited during a series of questions related to his assertions that someone was tampering with his work products after they were submitted, i.e., he stated that he submitted his work products "in a satisfactory manner" and that the only reason they were unsatisfactory was because someone changed them. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Moreover, as also noted above, absent valid performance standards, the Board cannot consider charged performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 695. Thus, as the administrative judge properly found, the Board cannot consider the appellant's performance deficiencies, or lack thereof, in light of the agency's invalid performance standards.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again, an action was set aside when the agency failed to identify a "needs improvement" level of performance, <span class="Italic">Pace v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0432-14-0335-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015), relying on <span class="Italic">Henderson</span> and <span class="Italic">Van Prichard</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a performance-based action under chapter 43, an agency must establish by substantial evidence that: (1) the Office of Personnel Management approved its performance appraisal system; (2) the agency communicated to the appellant the performance standards and critical elements of his position; (3) the appellant's performance standards are valid under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1); (4) the agency warned the appellant of the inadequacies of his performance during the appraisal period and gave him a reasonable opportunity to improve; and (5) the appellant's performance remained unacceptable in at least one critical element. <span class="Italic">White v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6; 5 (2013). Performance standards are not valid unless they set forth a minimum level of performance that an employee must achieve to avoid a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Under certain performance appraisal systems, performance of a critical element may fall between "Fully Successful" and "Unacceptable." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.207(c), 430.208(d). However, under such systems, only the lowest rating level of "Unacceptable" (or its equivalent) will support an agency action under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See Van Prichard v. Department of Defense,</span> 117 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 14 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 484 F. App'x 489 (Fed. Cir. 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency failed to show by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance standards were valid and that he was notified of the standard for performing at the minimum acceptable level to avoid a performance-based action. The agency's Total Army Performance Evaluation System, under which the appellant was evaluated, provides for a four-tiered system for measuring each individual objective with the standards of "Excellence," "Success," "Needs Improvement," and "Fails." Army Regulation 690-400, Chapter 4302, 1-5.g. (1998). An "Unsuccessful" rating is assigned for an employee who receives a rating of "Fails" in one or more objective, regardless of the ratings assigned to other objectives. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., 1-5.i. The appellant's performance objectives are written at one level and do not provide for varying levels of performance. Thus, the agency stated in its narrative response that these standards are written at the "Fully Successful" level. We therefore find that the standards are invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although, to be valid, performance standards must set forth the minimum level required to avoid a performance-based action, an agency may cure invalid performance standards by communicating sufficient information regarding performance requirements at the beginning of, and even during, a PIP. <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18. We find that the agency failed to cure its defective standards because it did not communicate to the appellant that he only needed to improve to the "Needs Improvement" level and it did not sufficiently describe how he could improve his performance to avoid a performance-based action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the PIP, the appellant received an intern midpoint performance report. In this report, the proposing official provided examples of the appellant's performance, described what was deficient, and explained what he expected for the appellant to perform successfully as measured by the objectives. The report did not describe what was required to receive a "Needs Improvement" rating. Instead, it stated that the appellant needed "to improve performance to avoid an unsuccessful rating for each of [his] performance objectives" and then described what the proposing official expected of the appellant to successfully perform. Nowhere does the report indicate that the appellant may perform at the "Needs Improvement" level to avoid an "Unsuccessful" rating, nor does it describe the "Needs Improvement" level of performance. Therefore, we find that the report does not cure the defective performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Henderson</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (the agency failed to cure its invalid written performance standards because it did not communicate valid performance standards to the appellant during the initial performance period).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant subsequently was placed on a PIP. In its PIP notice, the agency stated, "An acceptable level of performance is that which meets your performance requirements at the successful level...." It also noted that performance standards are written at the "Fully Successful" level. The agency stated that the appellant was failing two performance objectives/critical elements: mission support and organizational support. The PIP notice included the language of the performance standard concerning mission support. The PIP notice very specifically detailed instances where the appellant had not properly performed as to the mission support objective and explained how he could successfully perform in those situations. The notice also generally outlined how the appellant could perform more successfully during the PIP, including, under the mission support objective, having no more than one instance where the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) 300 log is not updated monthly by the established date and/or not updated within 4 working days of a reportable accident. The appellant also was required to meet five expectations in the mission support objective with three or fewer cumulative errors. These expectations included meeting suspense dates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the PIP notice that the agency did not notify the appellant of the performance level required for a "Needs Improvement" rating. First, the PIP notice clearly states that it is written at the "Success" level as opposed to any lower level. Additionally, many of the standards in the PIP are clearly on the same level as the appellant's performance standards, which were written at the "Success" level. For example, under the mission support objective, the appellant's performance standards for a 1-year performance period state that he must maintain the OSHA 300 log accurately and within 4 working days of occurrence with no more than two instances where the log is not maintained accurately or within 4 working days. In the PIP, which lasted for 3 months, the appellant was expected to perform the same task with no more than one instance where the log is not maintained accurately or within 4 working days. The PIP was for 3 months whereas the appellant's performance standards were written for a year. The agency adapted the performance standard to the shorter time period and rounded to the nearest whole number of one instance. We fail to see how this required level of performance along with the same timeframe of 4 working days for maintaining the OSHA log differs materially from the "Success" level outlined in the appellant's performance standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The memorandum subsequent to the PIP further demonstrates that the agency did not notify the appellant during the PIP of the requirements for a "Needs Improvement" performance level and instead notified him of the requirements for a "Success" rating. The proposing official stated that the appellant had raised his performance in the organizational support objective to the "Needs Improvement" level, but failed to raise the mission support objective above the "Fails" level. Regarding the appellant's "Fails" rating for the mission support objective, the proposing official described several tasks that he assigned to the appellant and the errors he committed concerning those tasks. For instance, the memorandum detailed an instance where the appellant completed an assignment with multiple technical errors, missed the established date for completing the assignment, and required excessive assistance. The proposing official stated that successful performance in the critical element of mission support required no more than three errors in the appellant's assigned duties, but that, based upon the cited examples, the appellant had more than three errors. The appellant also had not met suspense dates. The proposing official stated that the appellant was given numerous opportunities to perform at the "Fully Successful" level, but he instead demonstrated unacceptable performance. As a result, he was assigned a "Fails" performance rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The memorandum makes no mention of the standards for the "Needs Improvement" performance level. As a specific example, the appellant's performance standards for the mission support objective stated, "No more than 10 times during the rating period is the task/project not completed on time...and/or returned because results/recommendations are based on faulty conclusions and/or because it was not fully coordinated prior to submission." The memorandum is silent on the prorated number of times during the PIP that the appellant would have been permitted to untimely complete assignments as described above to perform at the "Needs Improvement" level. Consequently, we find that the memorandum subsequent to the PIP also failed to demonstrate that the agency cured its defective performance standards. <span class="Italic">See Henderson</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposing official's testimony further supports our finding that the appellant was not notified of valid performance standards. The proposing official testified that he originally gave the appellant a memorandum detailing what he would need to do to become fully successful. The proposing official testified that it was his understanding, based upon his conversations with employees from human resources, that a PIP was an opportunity for the appellant to demonstrate that he could perform at the "Fully Successful" level. Based upon our consideration of the evidence, we find that the agency improperly failed to communicate to the appellant what he needed to do to avoid a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">See Van Prichard</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency neither developed valid performance standards nor cured defective performance standards by communicating the standards to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Henderson</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16, 18. <span id="Page_2926"></span>Because the agency has not shown that its performance standards were valid, the appellant's removal cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Van Prichard</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 24 (the Board will not consider charged performance deficiencies absent valid performance standards).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the employee's performance work plan does not establish a "minimally successful" level of performance, that lower level may be established in the PIP through specification of the work that is required to meet that level, <span class="Italic">Tripathi v. NASA</span>, DC-0432-14-0612-I-1 (NP 7/28/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agency performance appraisal systems may include between two and five summary rating levels. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(d). Under any performance appraisal system, the lowest rating level is "unacceptable," which is the only rating that will support removal under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">Jackson-Francis v. Office of Government Ethics</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 6 (2006); <span class="Italic">Stenmark v. Department of Transportation</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 462, 468 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(6); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.206(b)(8), 430.207(c), 430.208(d). Under certain performance appraisal systems, performance of a critical element may fall between "fully successful" and "unacceptable." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.207(c), 430.208(d); <span class="Italic">see Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 6. If an agency adopts such a performance appraisal system, an appellant's performance could be "not satisfactory" without falling to the level that would support removal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 430.207(c)-(d), 430.208(d); <span class="Italic">see Jackson-Francis</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 183, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the agency's Performance Plan sets forth each critical element but does not define the level of performance for each element as part of the Plan, defining only the meets expectations and significantly exceeds expectations levels. While the agency's performance standards were not sufficiently precise as to the minimally satisfactory level of performance, the PIP identified specific tasks with such detail that, when read in conjunction with the performance standards, the appellant was apprised of the tasks he was required to perform to meet the minimally successful level of performance. <span class="Italic">Diprizio</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 73, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11. Even if the performance standards lacked specificity, the agency provided the appellant with clear guidance of what was expected of him during the PIP.</p>
