<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-285"><span class="space">b.</span> Reprisal Against the Exercise of USERRA Rights</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As to USERRA retaliation claims, 38 USC 4311(b) and 4311(c)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c) An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited...(2) under subsection (b), if the person's (A) action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (D) exercise of a right provided for in this chapter, is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person's enforcement action...or exercise of a right.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal for the exercise of rights under USERRA may establish a basis for a USERRA claim, <span class="Italic">Stone v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-4324-13-1241-I-1 (NP 7/17/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the appellant alleged that he was retaliated against in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) when the agency issued him the formal reprimand after "advocat[ing] for veterans and USERRA in emails" and "request[ing that the] Agency post the required USERRA workplace rights notices." Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter, (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter. This prohibition in this subsection shall apply with respect to a person regardless of whether that person has performed service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's allegations suggest that he engaged in a protected activity under USERRA or exercised a right under the statute, it is not clear whether his advocacy and requests were issued "in connection with any proceeding" or constituted an exercise of a right under chapter 43 of Title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b)(2), (4); <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2013); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 20 C.F.R. Part 1002, Appendix ("Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4334(a), each employer shall provide persons entitled to rights and benefits under USERRA a notice of the rights, benefits, and obligations of such persons and such employers under USERRA. The requirement for the provision of notice under this section may be met by posting the following notice where employers customarily place notices for employees."). Because we find that the appellant has nonfrivolously established jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a), we need not determine whether his allegations of reprisal, alone, establish the Board's jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). On remand, the administrative judge should adjudicate the merits of both the appellant's USERRA discrimination and retaliation claims in determining whether he has established a violation of either statutory provision by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 392, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8; <span class="Italic">Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2006) (rejecting the appellant's argument that he was retaliated against for filing a USERRA appeal with the Board in 2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal was reconfirmed as a basis for USERRA liability, <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency retaliated against him in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) for exercising his right under USERRA by <span id="Page_482"></span>placing the Blackberry in his car and conducting a follow-up investigation of his complaint. The administrative judge, citing <span class="Italic">Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon</span>, 567 F.3d 860 (7th Cir. 2009), found that USERRA's anti-reprisal provision is limited to barring acts of discrimination in employment and adverse employment actions, and reasoned that the appellant's allegations of agency wrongdoing, even assuming them to be true, did not fall under either category of prohibited act under section 4311(b). For the reasons that follow, we agree with the administrative judge and find that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency discriminated against him in employment or took an adverse action against him in violation of USERRA's anti-retaliation provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The USERRA standard for retaliation claims is set forth at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), which provides in relevant part that an employer "may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person" because he "(1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded <span id="Page_483"></span>any person under this chapter...or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter." <span class="Italic">Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). USERRA, however, does not define "discriminate in employment" or "adverse employment action." <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Crews</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that USERRA's anti-retaliation provision was "more limited in scope" than title VII's ban on retaliation. <span class="Italic">Crews</span>, 567 F.3d at 869. Whereas title VII's anti-retaliation clause provides that it shall be unlawful for an employer "to discriminate against" an employee or applicant because of his exercise of rights under title VII, USERRA's anti-retaliation provision is narrower, banning discrimination "in employment" or "any adverse employment action" based on, among other things, an employee's exercise of rights under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a), <span class="Italic">with</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b); <span class="Italic">see Crews</span>, 567 F.3d at 869. We agree with the administrative judge that this textual difference restricts the scope of actionable conduct under USERRA's anti-retaliation provision to discrimination arising "in employment" or to adverse employment actions.[4] <span class="Italic">Crews</span>, 567 F.3d at 869.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We further find that the textual differences between title VII's anti-retaliation provision and USERRA's anti-retaliation provision counsel against applying to claims of reprisal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) the Supreme Court's finding that title VII's "antiretaliation provision does not confine the actions and harms it forbids to those that are related to employment." <span class="Italic">Burlington Northern &#x0026; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White</span>, 548 U.S. 53, 57 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this narrower standard to the appellant's allegation of reprisal involving the placement of a Blackberry in his car, we find that he has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency either discriminated against him in employment or took an adverse employment action against him because of his prior USERRA appeal. Similar to our findings above concerning the interpretation of the term "benefit of employment," we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the placement of a Blackberry in his car constitutes an act of discrimination in employment because such an act does not deny him a benefit that inures to him by virtue of his employment with the agency. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-15; <span class="Italic">cf. Thomsen</span>, 169 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, moreover, that such an act does not rise to the level of an adverse employment action, which for purposes of Federal employees generally is defined under chapter 75 of title 5 to include a removal, a suspension of more than 14 days, a reduction in pay or grade, or a furlough of 30 days or less. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Even if we were to apply the broader definition of "adverse employment action" employed by several Federal courts of appeals, we still would find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency subjected him to an adverse employment action in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Beyer v. County of Nassau</span>, 524 F.3d 160, 163 (2d Cir. 2008) (including within the list of adverse employment actions "a termination..., a demotion..., a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished material responsibilities, or other indices...unique to a particular situation" in the context of a title VII claim) (internal quotation and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegation that the agency conducted a retaliatory investigation into his complaint fails to nonfrivolously allege reprisal under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). An investigation is neither an act of discrimination, nor an adverse action within the meaning of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">Rhee v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 31 (2012) (noting that an investigation is not a personnel action <span class="Italic">per se</span>), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 43 n.8 (2015). Furthermore, we concur with the administrative judge that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Rhee</span> to the extent the Board held that it "will consider evidence of the conduct of an agency investigation when it is so closely related to a personnel action that it could have been pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against an employee." <span class="Italic">Rhee</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 31. Here, the allegedly retaliatory investigation did not precede the agency's purported act of reprisal at issue in this appeal, but rather was initiated after the appellant filed a complaint with the agency. Rhee is thus distinguishable from the facts of this case, and we find that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege that the agency commenced a retaliatory investigation in violation of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b) upon receiving his complaint.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the Federal Circuit adopted the Board's reasoning and result, <span class="Italic">Kitlinski v. MSPB</span>, 857 F.3d 1374, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2017), <span class="Italic">following remand on a related issue, Kitlinski v. DOJ</span>, 2023 MSPB 13 (2023), post):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA's prohibition against retaliation in section 4311(b) provides that an employer "may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person" because he has taken an action to enforce a protection provided by USERRA or has exercised a right provided for by USERRA. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). Thus, the anti-reprisal statute is limited to barring acts of discrimination in employment and adverse employment actions. <span class="Italic">See Lisdahl v. Mayo Found</span>., 633 F.3d 712, 721 (8th Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Crews v. City of Mt. Vernon</span>, 567 F.3d 860 (7th Cir. 2009).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;As the <span class="Italic">Crews</span> court explained, the language of the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-3(a) does not contain the limiting language found in section 4311(b) of USERRA; for that reason the anti-retaliation provision of Title VII has not been limited to employment-related actions. <span class="Italic">Crews</span>, 567 F.3d at 869.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board held, the Blackberry incident and the investigation that followed it do not constitute acts of "discrimination in employment" or "adverse employment actions." With respect to "discrimination in employment," the placement of a Blackberry in Mr. Kitlinski's car, as the Board found, "does not deny him a benefit that inures to him by virtue of his employment with the agency." Nor does that act constitute an "adverse employment action," which is generally defined to include actions adversely affecting the employee's employment status, such as firing, demotion, suspension, a loss of benefits, or a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, as the Board ruled, an investigation does not ordinarily constitute an act of "discrimination in employment" or an "adverse employment action." That is particularly clear in this case, as the investigation did not relate directly to Mr. Kitlinski's employment with the DEA. As the administrative judge pointed out, Mr. Kitlinski had been on long-term leave from the DEA while he served with the Coast Guard, and the investigation related to an incident that occurred at the time of his deposition in his EEO case against the agency. The investigation thus had no apparent effect on his employment with the DEA and did not constitute discrimination in employment or an adverse employment action. We therefore sustain the Board's ruling that Mr. Kitlinski failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the discrete actions about which he complains--the Blackberry incident and the investigative activities that followed--violated USERRA's anti-retaliation provision.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides that "[a]n employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person...has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter...or...has exercised a right provided for in this chapter." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). A plaintiff bringing a USERRA retaliation claim must show the threshold premises, i.e., an action to enforce a USERRA protection or exercise of a USERRA right, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Kitlinski v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 857 F.3d 1374, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the USERRA-protected activity was "'a substantial or motivating factor' in the adverse employment action," <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Department of Navy</span>, 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citation and footnote omitted); <span class="Italic">see Hayden v. Department of Air Force</span>, 812 F.3d 1351, 1363 (Fed.

"If this requirement is met, the employer then has the opportunity to come forward with evidence to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer would have taken the adverse action anyway, for a valid reason." <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal against an individual who exercises a protected right requires that the person taking the reprisal have actual or constructive knowledge of the appellant's exercise of the right, <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Dept. of Interior,</span> SF-4324-09-0914-I-1 (NP 9/10/2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that he failed to prove retaliation for filing complaints with DOL. The USERRA standard for retaliation claims provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;An employer shall be considered to have engaged in actions prohibited...(2) under subsection (b), if the person's (A) action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter,...or (D) exercise of a right provided for in this chapter, is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person's enforcement action...or exercise of a right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4311(b) and 4311(c)(2). The administrative judge did not cite to this provision in his analysis finding that the appellant failed to prove that the selecting official retaliated against the appellant for filing a complaint with DOL alleging that the agency violated his rights under USERRA. However, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant failed to show retaliation for exercising his rights under USERRA. As the administrative judge found, the appellant failed to show that the selecting official was aware that the appellant had filed a complaint alleging a violation of USERRA, and thus retaliation could not have motivated the selecting official to cancel the vacancy announcements. Therefore, the administrative judge's failure to cite to the appropriate statutory provision, if error, did not harm the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See Brasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 145, &#x00B6; 7 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span>, 703 Fed. Appx. 977, 980 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), summed up the USERRA reprisal burden of proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under a USERRA retaliation claim, the appellant must first show that (1) he took an action protected by USERRA, and (2) his protected action was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action taken against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b), (c)(2); <span class="Italic">Hayden v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 812 F.3d 1351, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 240 F.3d at 1013). Similarly, when the employee meets his initial burden, the employer may only avoid liability by showing that it would have taken the same action in the absence of the employee's protected action. <span class="Italic">See Hayden</span>, 812 F.3d at 1363.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf. Lentz v. Dept. of Interior</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("A USERRA retaliation claim necessarily arises only after a claimant has engaged in a protected USERRA activity[.]").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without further analysis, but with a remand further consideration, the Board said of a USERRA reprisal assertion, <span class="Italic">Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 120 MSPR 392, 395 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8, 2013 MSPB 93 (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly argues on review that he raised below a claim of retaliation under section 4311(b) and that the administrative judge failed to consider his claim. According to section 4311(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer may not discriminate in employment against or take any adverse employment action against any person because such person (1) has taken an action to enforce a protection afforded any person under this chapter, (2) has testified or otherwise made a statement in or in connection with any proceeding under this chapter, (3) has assisted or otherwise participated in an investigation under this chapter, or (4) has exercised a right provided for in this chapter. The prohibition in this subsection shall apply with respect to a person regardless of whether that person has performed service in the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(b). If an appellant engages in one or more forms of the protected activity described above, an agency violates section 4311(b) if the appellant's protected activity "is a motivating factor in the employer's action, unless the employer can prove that the action would have been taken in the absence of such person's [protected activity]." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(c)(2). The "motivating factor" language set forth in section 4311(c)(2) mirrors the identical language of section 4311(c)(1), which applies in actions brought under section 4311(a). Because the two provisions are substantively identical, as is the case with section 4311(a), an agency violates section 4311(b) if it would not have taken the action but for the appellant's protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have not yet had an opportunity to address the burden of proof in cases brought under section 4311(b) and the administrative judge neglected to afford the appellant notice of what is required to establish a claim of retaliation for activity protected by USERRA. The Board has held that an administrative judge must inform an appellant of the USERRA burdens and methods of proof in a USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Haynes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 9, &#x00B6; 7 (2001).
