<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-199"><span class="space">e.</span> Questioning by Inspectors General and Agency Criminal Investigative Units; Executive Order 12171</h5>
<p class="noindent">Resolving a split among the circuit appellate courts, the Supreme Court determined in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1979, 1982-89 (1999), that inspectors general act as components of the agencies they serve when they conduct investigations and that employees being interrogated have the same right to union representation that is provided to employees being questioned by supervisors and managers about conduct that may lead to disciplinary action against them:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 12, 1978, Congress enacted the Inspector General Act (IGA), 5 USC App. &#x00A7; 1 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, p. 1381, which created an Office of Inspector General (OIG) in each of several federal agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The following day, Congress enacted the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (FSLMRS), 5 USC &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, which provides certain protections, including union representation, to a variety of federal employees. The question presented by this case is whether an investigator employed in NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA OIG) can be considered a "representative" of NASA when examining a NASA employee, such that the right to union representation in the FSLMRS may be invoked. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). Although certain arguments of policy may support a negative answer to that question, the plain text of the two statutes, buttressed by administrative deference and Congress' countervailing policy concerns, dictates an affirmative answer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In January 1993, in response to information supplied by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), NASA's OIG conducted an investigation of certain threatening activities of an employee of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, which is also a component of NASA. A NASA OIG investigator contacted the employee to arrange for an interview and, in response to the employee's request, agreed that both the employee's lawyer and union representative could attend. The conduct of the interview gave rise to a complaint by the union representative that the investigator had improperly limited his participation. The union filed a charge with the Federal Labor Relations Authority (Authority) alleging that NASA and its OIG had committed an unfair labor practice<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (8).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) ruled for the union with respect to its complaint against NASA OIG. The ALJ concluded that the OIG investigator was a "representative" of NASA within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), and that certain aspects of the investigator's behavior had violated the right to union representation under that section. On review, the Authority agreed that the NASA OIG investigator prevented the union representative from actively participating in the examination and (1) ordered both NASA and NASA OIG to cease and desist (a) requiring bargaining unit employees to participate in OIG interviews under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) without allowing active participation of a union representative, and (b) likewise interfering with, coercing, or restraining employees in exercising their rights under the statute; and (2) directed NASA to (a) order NASA OIG to comply with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), and (b) post appropriate notices at the Huntsville facility<span class="Italic">. NASA</span>, 50 FLRA 601, 602, 609, 622 623 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NASA and NASA OIG petitioned for review, asking whether the NASA OIG investigator was a "representative" of NASA, and whether it was proper to grant relief against NASA as well as its OIG. The Court of Appeals upheld the Authority's rulings on both questions and granted the Authority's application for enforcement of its order. 120 F.3d 1208, 1215-1217 (CA11 1997). Because of disagreement among the Circuit Courts over the applicability of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in such circumstances, <span class="Italic">see FLRA v. United States Dept. of Justice</span>, 137 F.3d 683 (CA2 1997); <span class="Italic">United States Dept. of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 39 F.3d 361 (CADC 1994); <span class="Italic">Defense Criminal Investigative Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93 (CA3 1988), we granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>. 525 U.S. 960, 119 S. Ct. 401, 142 L. Ed.2d 326 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FSLMRS provides, in relevant part,</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(2)&#x2003;An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(B)&#x2003;any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation if--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"(i)&#x2003;the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">"(ii)&#x2003;the employee requests representation." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case it is undisputed that the employee reasonably believed the investigation could result in discipline against him, that he requested union representation, that NASA is the relevant "agency," and that, if the provision applies, a violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) occurred. The contested issue is whether a NASA OIG investigator can be considered a "representative" of NASA when conducting an employee examination covered by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NASA and its OIG argue that, when &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is read in context and compared with the similar right to union representation protected in the private sector by the National Labor Relations Act, the term "representative" refers only to a representative of agency management "<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the entity that has a collective bargaining relationship with the employee's union." Neither NASA nor NASA OIG has such a relationship with the employee's union at the Huntsville facility, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7112(b)(7) (excluding certain agency investigators and auditors from "appropriate" bargaining units), and so the investigator in this case could not have been a "representative" of the relevant "entity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its terms, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is not limited to investigations conducted by certain "entit[ies]" within the agency in question. It simply refers to representatives of "the agency," which, all agree, means NASA<span class="Italic">. Cf</span>. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2) (referring to employees "in the unit" and an exclusive representative "of an appropriate unit in an agency"). Thus, relying on prior rulings, the Authority found no basis in the FSLMRS or its legislative history to support the limited reading advocated by NASA and its OIG. The Authority reasoned that adopting their proposal might erode the right by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent policy of protecting certain federal employees when they are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action. 50 FLRA, at 615, and n.12. That is, the risk to the employee is not necessarily related to which component of an agency conducts the examination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving this issue, the Authority was interpreting the statute Congress directed it to implement and administer. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7105. The Authority's conclusion is certainly consistent with the FSLMRS and, to the extent the statute and congressional intent are unclear, we may rely on the Authority's reasonable judgment<span class="Italic">. See Federal Employees v. Department of Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 98-100, 119 S. Ct. 1003, 1010 (1999); <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 644-645 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the text of the statute and the Authority's views, NASA and NASA OIG advance three reasons for their narrow reading. First, the language at issue is contained in a larger section addressing rights and duties related to collective bargaining; indeed, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7114 is entitled "Representation rights and duties." Thus, other subsections define the union's right to exclusive representation of employees in the bargaining unit, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1); its right to participate in grievance proceedings, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A); and its right and duty to engage in good-faith collective bargaining with the agency, &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4), (b). That context helps <span id="Page_1433"></span>explain why the right granted in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is limited to situations in which the employee "reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action"--a condition restricting the right to union presence or participation in investigatory examinations that do not threaten the witness' employment. We find nothing in this context, however, suggesting that an examination that obviously presents the risk of employee discipline is nevertheless outside the coverage of the section because it is conducted by an investigator housed in one office of NASA rather than another. On this point, NASA's internal organization is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the phrase "representative of the agency" is used in two other places in the FSLMRS where it may refer to representatives of agency management acting in their capacity as actual or prospective parties to a collective bargaining agreement. One reference pertains to grievances, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A), and the other to the bargaining process itself, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(12) (defining "collective bargaining"). NASA and NASA-OIG submit that the phrase at issue should ordinarily retain the same meaning wherever used in the same statute, and we agree. But even accepting NASA and NASA-OIG's characterization of &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) and 7103(a)(12), the fact that some "representative[s] of the agency" may perform functions relating to grievances and bargaining does not mean that other personnel who conduct examinations covered by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) are not also fairly characterized as agency "representative[s]." As an organization, an agency must rely on a variety of representatives to carry out its functions and, though acting in different capacities, each may be acting for, and on behalf of, the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, NASA and NASA-OIG assert that their narrow construction is supported by the history and purpose of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). As is evident from statements by the author of the provision as well as similar text in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), this section of the FSLMRS was patterned after that decision. In <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, we upheld the National Labor Relations Board's conclusion that an employer's denial of an employee's request to have a union representative present at an investigatory interview, which the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, was an unfair labor practice<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 252-253, 256. We reasoned that the Board's position was consistent with the employee's right under &#x00A7; 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to engage in concerted activities<span class="Italic">. Id.</span>, at 260. Given that history, NASA and its OIG contend that the comparable provision in the FSLMRS should be limited to investigations by representatives of that part of agency management with responsibility for collectively bargaining with the employee's union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This argument ignores the important difference between the text of the NLRA and the text of the FSLMRS.&#x2003;That the general protection afforded to employees by &#x00A7; 7 of the NLRA provided a sufficient basis for the Board's recognition of a novel right in the private sector, <span class="Italic">see id.</span>, at 260-262, 266-267, does not justify the conclusion that the text of the FSLMRS which expressly grants a comparable right to employees in the public sector should be narrowly construed to cover some, but not all, interviews conducted by agency representatives that have a disciplinary potential. Congress' specific endorsement of a government employee's right to union representation by incorporating it in the text of the FSLMRS gives that right a different foundation than if it were merely the product of an agency's attempt to elaborate on a more general provision in light of broad statutory purposes. The basis for the right to union representation in this context cannot compel the uncodified limitation proposed by NASA and its OIG.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Employing ordinary tools of statutory construction, in combination with the Authority's position on the matter, we have no difficulty concluding that &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is not limited to agency investigators representing an "entity" that collectively bargains with the employee's union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Much of the disagreement in this case involves the interplay between the FSLMRS and the Inspector General Act.&#x2003;On NASA's and NASA-OIG's view, a proper understanding of the IGA precludes treating OIG personnel as "representative[s]" of the agencies they are duty-bound to audit and investigate. They add that the Authority has no congressional mandate or expertise with respect to the IGA, and thus we owe the Authority no deference on this score. It is unnecessary for us to defer, however, because a careful review of the relevant IGA provisions plainly favors the Authority's position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2 of the IGA explains the purpose of the Act and establishes "an office of Inspector General" in each of a list of identified federal agencies, thereby consolidating audit and investigation responsibilities into one agency component. It provides: "In order to create independent and objective units</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(1)&#x2003;to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to the programs and operations of the establishments listed in section 11(2);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(2)&#x2003;to provide leadership and coordination and recommend policies for activities designed (A) to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of, and (B) to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in, such programs and operations; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"(3)&#x2003;to provide a means for keeping the head of the establishment and the Congress fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies relating to the administration of such programs and operations and the necessity for and progress of corrective action;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"there is hereby established in each of such establishments an office of Inspector General." 5 USC App. &#x00A7; 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NASA is one of more than 20 "establishments" now listed in &#x00A7; 11(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 3 of the IGA provides that each of the offices created by &#x00A7; 2 shall be headed by an Inspector General appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate, "without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations." &#x00A7; 3(a). Each of these Inspectors General "shall report to and be under the general supervision of the head of the establishment involved or, to the extent such authority is delegated, the officer next in rank below such head," but shall not be subject to supervision by any lesser officer. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Moreover, an Inspector General's seniors within the agency may not "prevent or prohibit" the Inspector General from initiating or conducting any audit or investigation<span class="Italic">. Ibid.;</span> <span class="Italic">see also</span> &#x00A7; 6(a)(2). The President retains the power to remove an Inspector General from office. &#x00A7; 3(b).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 4 contains a detailed description of the duties of each Inspector General with respect to the agency "within which his Office is established." &#x00A7; 4(a). Those duties include conducting audits and investigations, recommending new policies, reviewing legislation, and keeping the head of the agency and the Congress "fully and currently informed" through such means as detailed, semiannual reports. &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 4(a)(1)-(5). Pursuant to &#x00A7; 5, those reports must be furnished to the head of the agency, who, in turn, must forward them to the appropriate committee or subcommittee of Congress with such comment as the agency head deems appropriate. &#x00A7; 5(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> &#x00A7; 5(d). Section 6 grants the Inspectors General specific authority in a variety of areas to facilitate the mission of their offices. Accordingly, Inspectors General possess discretion to conduct investigations "relating to the administration of the programs and operations of the applicable" agency, &#x00A7; 6(a)(2); the ability to request information and assistance from government agencies, &#x00A7; 6(a)(3); access to the head of the agency, &#x00A7; 6(a)(6); and the power to hire employees, enter into contracts, and spend congressionally appropriated funds, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 6(a)(7), (9); <span class="Italic">see also</span> &#x00A7; 3(d). Finally, &#x00A7; 9(a)(1)(P) provides for the transfer of the functions previously performed by NASA's "'Management Audit Office' and the 'Office of Inspections and Security'" to NASA-OIG.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IGA created no central office or officer to supervise, direct, or coordinate the work of all OIGs and their respective staffs. Other than congressional committees (which are the recipients of the reports prepared by each Inspector General) and the President (who has the power to remove an Inspector General), each Inspector General has no supervising authority except the head of the agency of which the OIG is a part. There is no "OIG-OIG." Thus, for example, NASA-OIG maintains an office at NASA's Huntsville facility, which reports to NASA-OIG in Washington, and then to the NASA Administrator, who is the head of the agency. &#x00A7; 11(1); 50 FLRA, at 602. In conducting their work, Congress certainly intended that the various OIGs would enjoy a great deal of autonomy. But unlike the jurisdiction of many law enforcement agencies, an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by the IGA, is performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC App. &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 2, 4(a), 6(a)(2). In common parlance, the investigators employed in NASA's OIG are unquestionably "representatives" of NASA when acting within the scope of their employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Minimizing the significance of this statutory plan, NASA and NASA-OIG emphasize the potentially divergent interests of the OIGs and their parent agencies. To be sure, OIGs maintain authority to initiate and conduct investigations and audits without interference from the head of the agency. &#x00A7; 3(a). And the ability to proceed without consent from agency higher-ups is vital to effectuating Congress' intent and maintaining an opportunity for objective inquiries into bureaucratic waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. But those characteristics do not make NASA-OIG any less a representative of NASA when it investigates a NASA employee. That certain officials within an agency, based on their views of the agency's best interests or their own, might oppose an OIG investigation does not tell us whether the investigators are "representatives" of the agency during the course of their duties. As far as the IGA is concerned, NASA-OIG's investigators are employed by, act on behalf of, and operate for the benefit of NASA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, NASA and NASA-OIG overstate the inherent conflict between an OIG and its agency. The investigation in this case was initiated by NASA's OIG on the basis of information provided by the FBI, but nothing in the IGA indicates that, if the information had been supplied by the Administrator of NASA rather than the FBI, NASA-OIG would <span id="Page_1434"></span>have had any lesser obligation to pursue an investigation<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 4(a)(1), (d), 7; S. Rep. No. 95 1071, p. 26 (1978). The statute does not suggest that one can determine whether the OIG personnel engaged in such an investigation are "representatives" of NASA based on the source of the information prompting an investigation. Therefore, it must be NASA and NASA-OIG's position that even when an OIG conducts an investigation in response to a specific request from the head of an agency, an employee engaged in that assignment is not a "representative" of the agency within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the FSLMRS. Such management-prompted investigations are not rare.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, not all OIG examinations subject to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) will implicate an actual or apparent conflict of interest with the rest of the agency; and in many cases we can expect honest cooperation between an OIG and management-level agency personnel. That conclusion becomes more obvious when the practical operation of OIG interviews and &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rights are considered. The IGA grants Inspectors General the authority to subpoena documents and information, but not witnesses. 5 USC App. &#x00A7; 6(a)(4). Nor does the IGA allow an OIG to discipline an agency employee, as all parties to this case agree. There may be other incentives for employee cooperation with OIG investigations, but formal sanctions for refusing to submit to an OIG interview cannot be pursued by the OIG alone. Such limitations on OIG authority enhance the likelihood and importance of cooperation between the agency and its OIG<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 6(a)(3), (b)(1) (2) (addressing an Inspector General's authority to request assistance from others in the agency, and their duty to respond); &#x00A7; &#x00A7; 4(a)(5), (d); 50 FLRA, at 616; App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a (noting information sharing between NASA-OIG and other agency officials). Thus, if the NASA-OIG investigator in this case told the employee that he would face dismissal if he refused to answer questions, 120 F.3d, at 1210, n.2, the investigator invoked NASA's authority, not his own.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Considering NASA-OIG's statutorily defined role within the agency, we cannot conclude that the proper operation of the IGA requires nullification of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in all OIG examinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although NASA's and NASA-OIG's narrow reading of the phrase "representative of the agency" is supported by the text of neither the FSLMRS nor the IGA, they also present broader but ultimately unpersuasive arguments of policy to defeat the application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to OIG investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, NASA and NASA-OIG contend that enforcing &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in situations similar to this case would undermine NASA-OIG's ability to maintain the confidentiality of investigations, particularly those investigations conducted jointly with law enforcement agencies<span class="Italic">. Cf</span>. 5 USC App. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5(e)(1)(C), (2) (restricting OIG disclosure of information that is part of an ongoing criminal investigation). NASA and its OIG are no doubt correct in suggesting that the presence of a union representative at an examination will increase the likelihood that its contents will be disclosed to third parties. That possibility is, however, always present: NASA and NASA-OIG identify no legal authority restricting an employee's ability to discuss the matter with others. Furthermore, an employee cannot demand the attendance of a union representative when an OIG examination does not involve reasonably apparent potential discipline for that employee. Interviewing an employee who may have information relating to agency maladministration, but who is not himself under suspicion, ordinarily will not trigger the right to union representation. Thus, a variety of OIG investigations and interviews and many in which confidentiality concerns are heightened will not implicate &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) at all. Though legitimate, NASA's and NASA-OIG's confidentiality concerns are not weighty enough to justify a non-textual construction of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rejected by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, NASA and its OIG submit that, in other instances, the Authority has construed &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) so broadly that it will impair NASA-OIG's ability to perform its investigatory responsibilities. The Authority responds that it has been sensitive to agencies' investigative needs in other cases, and that union representation is unrelated to OIG independence from agency interference. Whatever the propriety of the Authority's rulings in other cases, NASA and NASA-OIG elected not to challenge the Authority's conclusion that the NASA-OIG examiner's attempt to limit union representative participation constituted an unfair labor practice. To resolve the question presented in this case, we need not agree or disagree with the Authority's various rulings regarding the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), nor must we consider whether the outer limits of the Authority's interpretation so obstruct the performance of an OIG's statutory responsibilities that the right must be more confined in this context.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The same can be said of NASA and NASA-OIG's concerns that the reach of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) will become the subject of collective bargaining between agencies and unions, or hinder joint or independent FBI investigations of federal employees<span class="Italic">. See United States Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n v. FLRA</span>, 25 F.3d 229 (CA4 1994) (adopting the agency's position that it could not bargain over certain procedures by which its OIG conducts investigatory interviews); [<span class="Italic">NASA</span>], 50 FLRA, at 616, n.13 (distinguishing FBI investigations). The process by which the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) may properly be determined, and the application of that section to law enforcement officials with a broader charge, present distinct questions not now before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, the right Congress created in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) vindicates obvious countervailing federal policies. It provides a procedural safeguard for employees who are under investigation by their agency, and the mere existence of the right can only strengthen the morale of the federal workforce. The interest in fair treatment for employees under investigation is equally strong whether they are being questioned by employees in NASA's OIG or by other representatives of the agency. And, as we indicated in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, representation is not the equivalent of obstruction<span class="Italic">. See</span> 420 U.S., at 262 264. In many cases the participation of a union representative will facilitate the factfinding process and a fair resolution of an agency investigation or at least Congress must have thought so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Whenever a procedural protection plays a meaningful role in an investigation, it may impose some burden on the investigators or agency managers in pursuing their mission. We must presume, however, that Congress took account of the policy concerns on both sides of the balance when it decided to enact the IGA and, on the heels of that statute, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, NASA argues that it was error for the Authority to make NASA itself, as well as NASA's OIG, a party to the enforcement order because NASA has no authority over the manner in which NASA-OIG conducts its investigations. However, our conclusion that the investigator in this case was acting as a "representative" of NASA for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) makes it appropriate to charge NASA-OIG, as well as the parent agency to which it reports and for which it acts, with responsibility for ensuring that such investigations are conducted in compliance with the FSLMRS. NASA's Administrator retains general supervisory authority over NASA's OIG, 5 USC App. &#x00A7; 3(a), and the remedy imposed by the Authority does not require NASA to interfere unduly with OIG prerogatives. NASA and NASA-OIG offer no convincing reason to believe that the Authority's remedy is inappropriate in view of the IGA, or that it will be ineffective in protecting the limited right of union representation secured by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)<span class="Italic">. See generally</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 706 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">The result in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> was applied to OIG criminal investigations, <span class="Italic">DOJ and AFGE Local 709</span>, 56 FLRA 556, 560 (2000) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 266 F.3d 1228 (D.C. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents make a colorable claim that the Supreme Court's decision invites them to make an argument regarding the criminal/administrative distinction. In this regard, Respondents rely upon a quote from <span class="Italic">NASA</span> regarding the Court's unwillingness to discuss application of section 7114(a)(2)(B) to "law enforcement officials with a broader charge" and suggest that this refers to OIG investigators conducting a criminal investigation. Moreover, Respondents also argue that at the time of the investigation in Case No. DE-CA-80076, the DOJ-OIG special agents justified their denial of the bargaining unit employee's request for representation because of the criminal nature of their investigation. Accordingly, unlike the remedy issue discussed in the preceding section, the NASA decision and the record in this case offer support for consideration of Respondents' argument at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;NASA Controls Despite the Criminal Aspect of the DOJ-OIG Investigation in Case No. DE-CA-80076</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Respondents contend that <span class="Italic">NASA</span> is not controlling in Case No. DE-CA-80076 because the criminal aspect of the DOJ-OIG investigation, as opposed to the administrative aspect of the investigation in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, requires a different outcome. This contention fails for a number of reasons, including: 1) Respondents misinterpret the Supreme Court's language distinguishing law enforcement officials from OIG investigators; and, 2) Respondents have continually acknowledged that the employee reasonably feared that discipline might result from the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Respondents Misinterpret <span class="Italic">NASA</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Responding to <span class="Italic">NASA's</span> concerns about "joint or independent FBI investigations of federal employees," the Supreme Court noted that "the application of [section 7114(a)(2)(B)] to law enforcement officials with a broader charge" was not before it. <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1988 n.8. By seeking to apply this comment by the Court to OIG investigations involving criminal matters, Respondents misinterpret the Court's statement. The phrase "law enforcement officials with a broader charge" clearly refers to the FBI--not OIG investigators.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> case did involve an administrative rather than a criminal investigation, this was not the focal point of the Supreme Court's decision. The Court, instead, focused on the OIG's undeniable role within the agency and noted that "unlike the jurisdiction of many law enforcement agencies, an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by <span id="Page_1435"></span>the [IG Act], is performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1986. That is, "as far as the [IG Act] is concerned, [OIG] investigators are employed by, act on behalf of, and operate for the benefit of" the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1987. Because of this role of the OIG within the agency, the Court found that section 7114(a)(2)(B) applies to OIG investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, Respondents' claim that the DOJ-OIG special agents were "conducting an independent investigation to determine whether any criminal activity had occurred with the intent of referring the matter to the appropriate authorities for criminal prosecution" is undercut by the Supreme Court's reliance on the fact that OIG agents are stationed within and act on behalf of the agency. <span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 1986-7. Nothing in the NASA decision indicates that this interrelationship between the agency and OIG changes when a criminal matter is investigated.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;In addition, the Authority has long held that section 7114(a)(2)(B) applies to OIG investigations that involve allegations of criminal activity, to include when an investigation is jointly conducted by the OIG and local police. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Department of Defense, Defense Criminal Investigative Service; Defense Logistics Agency and Defense Contract Administration Services Region, New York</span>, 28 FLRA 1145, 1149 (1987) (DOD, DCIS), <span class="Italic">enforced sub nom. Defense Criminal Investigative Service, Department of Defense v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93 (3d Cir. 1988) (DCIS).</p>
<p class="noindent">The application of <span class="Italic">NASA</span> to criminal investigations was affirmed, <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 266 F.3d 1228, 1230-32 (D.C. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, no one here questions that there was an "examination" of a bargaining unit employee, that the examination was "in connection with an investigation," that the employee requested representation, or that the employee reasonably believed that he might be subject to disciplinary action<span class="Italic">. See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 233. Thus, the only issue in dispute is whether, as the Court found there, the Authority could find that the OIG agents were "representative[s] of the agency" when they conducted the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To support the proposed distinction between criminal and administrative investigations, the Department points to a provision of the Inspector General Statute that it says creates special consequences for an investigation's being criminal. 5 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 4(d) requires any OIG agent to "report expeditiously to the Attorney General whenever the Inspector General has reasonable grounds to believe there has been a violation of Federal criminal law<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. According to the Department, this implies that whenever a criminal investigation is underway, the OIG agent is for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) no longer a "representative of the agency" but rather answers to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First we note that &#x00A7; 4(d) is triggered whenever an Inspector General comes upon "reasonable grounds to believe" that federal criminal law was violated. This is a broader test than what the Department regards as the key distinction of this case from <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, namely the OIG's own classification of the investigation as criminal; our acceptance of it as controlling would thus sweep an unknown number of administrative inquiries into the exception. More important, nothing in &#x00A7; 4(d) overrides 5 U.S.C. App. &#x00A7; 3(a), which requires that each Inspector General shall "report to and be under the general supervision of the head of the establishment involved...." The <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court relied at least in part on this provision in holding that OIG agents are "representatives" of their respective agencies. 527 U.S. at 239. Section 4(d)'s extra reporting requirement does not extract OIG agents from the organizational spot that is assigned them by &#x00A7; 3(a)--under the head of the relevant <span class="Italic">agency</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus the Department's effort at a statutory distinction between criminal and administrative investigations fails. Its remaining argument is mostly that the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> decision rested on factors that are peculiar to administrative investigations and therefore it does not apply to criminal ones. None of the distinctions seems convincing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Department argues that <span class="Italic">NASA</span> was based on the fear that agency managers might hand off their dirty work to OIG agents, thus circumventing &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) by using the OIG to conduct investigations for their own purposes<span class="Italic">. See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 234. With criminal investigations, the Department says, this concern is "totally absent" because agency managers have no "criminal investigative duties" in the first place. But the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> decision rested (in part) on a recognition that the overlaps between "pure" management activities and OIG duties would naturally generate cooperation between agency managers and OIGs. 527 U.S. at 242. It would be astonishing for us to ignore the parallel, and equally obvious, overlap of administrative and criminal enforcement goals and to create an exception resting on this ignorance. In fact, we once observed that "the results of inspections, when no criminal proceedings ensue, are routinely turned over to management for possible use in disciplinary actions." <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service v. NLRB</span>, 969 F.2d 1064, 1072 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Department argues that <span class="Italic">NASA</span> was in part compelled by the fact that Inspectors General, when conducting an administrative investigation, need the cooperation of agency managers, who can direct the employee's use of his time--here, to attend the interview and answer questions. <span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 242. The Department attributes this power to the fact that the employee's refusal to answer questions related to his duties <span class="Italic">may</span> be used against him in an administrative investigation<span class="Italic">. See Kalkines v. United States</span>, 473 F.2d 1391, 1393 n.4 (Ct. Cl. 1973). In contrast, says the Department, the employee's refusal to answer questions in a criminal investigation <span class="Italic">may not</span> be used against him<span class="Italic">. See Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493 (1967). It follows that the agency manager has "no role" to play in forcing the employee to answer questions in a criminal investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We cannot see that the "no role" consequence follows. In <span class="Italic">both</span> administrative and criminal investigations, the employee enjoys a Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself in his answers to a government investigator. The only difference appears to be that in administrative investigations, the investigators usually grant criminal immunity to the employee, <span class="Italic">see Kalkines</span>, 473 F.2d at 1393 n.4, so that they may threaten the employee with administrative penalties unhampered by the Fifth Amendment. But this is a choice made by the Inspector General in a given case, depending on what penalties he or she wishes to seek. In other words, the difference between administrative and criminal investigations in this respect is one of investigative strategy, not one of law. In either case, both OIG and agency management can benefit by mutual cooperation, and it was the likelihood of such cooperation that the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court saw as militating in favor of treating OIG interrogators as "representatives of the agency."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Department argues that in a criminal investigation an employee has the right to an attorney and therefore doesn't need a union representative. But nothing in the language of the statute or of <span class="Italic">NASA</span> suggests that the application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) depends on whether a particular employee "needs" union representation. Moreover, the section implicates the union's rights as well<span class="Italic">. See Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 260-61. In fact, we've already rejected a suggestion that an interrogatee's right to counsel could render &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) inapplicable<span class="Italic">. American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1941, AFL-CIO v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 495, 499 n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Apart from the supposedly distinguishing "factors" and the reference to &#x00A7; 4(d), the Department relies heavily on the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> Court's statement that it was not deciding the applicability of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to "law enforcement officials with a broader charge." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 244 n.8. But the reference doesn't appear to address OIG agents at all. In the previous sentence the Court mentioned the concern that applying &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to the OIG might hinder "joint or independent FBI investigations of federal employees<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Thus the later reference to "law enforcement officials" clearly means "FBI officials" or the like, not an agency's OIG officials pursuing a criminal investigation on their own. As was true for the Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, we need not address the possible application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to a joint OIG/FBI investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Department also argues that application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to criminal investigations is "simply unworkable." Specifically, it says, the union representative might be called to testify at a trial, thereby working against the employee's true interests. But where an administrative investigation turns out to uncover criminality, the union representative may equally be called to testify. And if the employee is concerned about the possible testimony of the union representative, he can simply decide not to ask for one<span class="Italic">. Cf. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 969 F.2d at 1072 n.5 (rejecting idea that risks of a union representative's testimony against an employee could enable the employer to deny the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right). Perhaps inconsistently, the Department also says that application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) will impede criminal investigations. We have no doubt that there is a risk of such impediments, but it presumably closely parallels the risks to effective management (and successful criminal prosecutions) that flow from application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) to administrative investigations, risks that the Court regarded as "not weighty enough to justify a nontextual construction of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rejected by the Authority." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 243-44.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, on the score of workability, the Department's approach presents problems of its own. Many if not most investigations will have both administrative and criminal potential. Classification appears to depend--as one would expect--on the ongoing flow of information. The investigation at issue in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, for instance, was instigated by information from the FBI,<span class="Italic"> see </span>527 U.S. at 231-32, and according to the FLRA decision involved "a serious threat to co-workers," <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 50 FLRA 601, 1995 FLRA LEXIS 82, at *3 (1995). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at *48 (ALJ decision, noting that documents "set forth potential threats and plans for violence"). The investigator determined, "after consulting appropriate investigative agencies," that the employee "had not violated the law and, as a result, that the matter would be administratively, rather than criminally, investigated<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at *3 n.2. At what point, then, would the agent's investigation have become subject to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)? When the agent--to some degree independently--decided to treat it <span id="Page_1436"></span>administratively? What if he had viewed the matter as unclassified, and interviewed the employee in part in order to decide on the classification? Such possibilities erode the likelihood of any bright-line distinction between administrative and criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Considered in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 0922</span>, 57 FLRA 787, 790 (2002), was whether a subsidiary organization, the Bureau, is liable through a ULP complaint for an investigation undertaken by the parent organization, the Department, that resulted in violations of statutory safeguards during an interview of a unit employee. FLRA considered, among other factors, the degree of collaboration among the two entities:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the Activity was not responsible for the OIG agents' conduct, the Judge examined the level of collaboration between the two entities. The GC disputes the Judge's conclusion, but does not dispute the Judge's factual findings or the Authority precedent applied by the Judge. Under these circumstances, the Authority looks to whether the Judge's factual findings and the record as a whole support the Judge's conclusion. <span class="Italic">See Air Force Materiel Command, Warner Robins</span> <span class="Italic">Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.,</span> 53 FLRA 1092, 1093 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several Authority decisions address the liability of an activity for the conduct of an investigative component of the parent agency during an investigatory interview of an employee.&#x2003;These decisions focus on the level of collaboration between the activity and the investigative component. In cases where the Authority has found the collaboration sufficient for an activity to be held responsible for the conduct of the investigative component, several facts have been present, including the presence of the activity's representative at the interview; discussion between the two entities of the statements obtained by the investigative component during the interview; meetings throughout the investigation; substantive briefings of the activity by the investigative component; and an active and continuing effort by the activity to be involved in the investigation. <span class="Italic">See Ogden,</span> 36 FLRA at 764-68; <span class="Italic">Lackland Air Force Base</span> <span class="Italic">Exchange, Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, </span>5 FLRA 473, 486 (1981) <span class="Italic">(Lackland).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the foregoing decisions, there was only limited contact in this case between the Activity and the OIG during the investigation; there was no substantive input by the Activity as to how the investigation would be conducted or any substantive briefings of the Activity by the OIG. Specifically, the contacts between the parties consisted of arranging the date, time and place for the interview, the exchange of the case file, the OIG agents informing a representative of the Activity of their arrival and departure on the day of the interview, and an Activity representative escorting the OIG agents within the building.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is most similar to cases, particularly <span class="Italic">DCIS, </span>where the Authority found that the collaboration between the parties was insufficient to render the activity responsible for the conduct of the investigative component. In those cases, as in this one, the activity initiated an investigation and referred it to the OIG. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">PTO, </span>45 FLRA at 889, 892-93; <span class="Italic">DCIS, </span>28 FLRA at 1146. Also in those cases, as in this one, activity representatives were not present during the interview and statements obtained during the interview were not revealed to the activity. <span class="Italic">See PTO, </span>45 FLRA at 890, 892; <span class="Italic">DCIS, </span>28 FLRA at 1160-61, 1164. In <span class="Italic">DCIS, </span>as here, the activity summoned the affected employee for an interview to a room it provided<span class="Italic">. See DCIS, </span>28 FLRA at 1146, 1150 n.3. Although an Activity representative in this case could hear the polygraph examination from an adjacent room and the Activity representatives were informed of the results of the examination, we find these differences insufficient to reach a different conclusion than in <span class="Italic">DCIS </span>because these facts do not establish collaboration between the Activity and the OIG.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Judge's conclusion that the Activity was not responsible for the conduct of the OIG during the interview is supported by the Judge's factual findings and the record as a whole. Thus, we find that the Judge properly concluded that the Activity did not violate the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden ALC and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 68 FLRA 460, 460-65 (2015) (Member DuBester dissenting) (union review petition denied, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.3d 1291 (10th Cir. 2016) (Judge Phillips dissenting), <span class="Italic">post</span>)), concluded that a union had no right to provide representation during an inquiry by an agency entity exempted under the Statute through E.O. 12171, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employee worked at an Air Force base (the base), where he used a government-issued computer to perform some of his duties for the Respondent. When a coworker reported that the employee was "observing pornography" on his computer, one of the employee's supervisors sent the employee home from work and placed him on administrative leave. Sometime after the Respondent's information-technology department examined the employee's computer, a "confidential source" reported to AFOSI that the employee may have accessed "child[-]pornography sites," and AFOSI opened an investigation into whether the employee committed a felony.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At AFOSI's request, one of the employee's supervisors "arrange[d] for [the employee] to be interviewed." On the day of the interview, the employee requested that his union representative be permitted to attend with him. The lead AFOSI investigator (lead investigator) denied the request, and a few minutes later, the lead investigator and another AFOSI special agent accompanied the employee to the interview room, without the employee's supervisor or union representative joining them. During the interview, the lead investigator stated that he would be reporting the results of the investigation to the general in charge of the base, and stated further that the employee was "not going to be able" to work at the base for "very long" once the general received AFOSI's report.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After completing its investigation, AFOSI sent a copy of its report of investigation to the grievant's supervisor and requested to be informed of any action taken against the employee. Approximately six weeks later, the Respondent proposed the employee's removal based on information from AFOSI's report. To avoid his potential removal, the employee entered into a settlement agreement with the Respondent. As relevant here, the settlement allowed the employee to return to duty on the condition that he cease all computer misuse. About one month later, faced with impending removal for violating the settlement agreement, the employee resigned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC contends, as relevant here, that the Judge erred in finding that AFOSI cannot be a "representative of the [A]gency" (i.e., the Respondent), within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). In particular, the GC argues that, just as a "supervisor" may be a "representative of [an] agency" under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2) despite being excluded by &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2)(B) from the Statute's definition of an "employee," an employee of an agency or subdivision that is excluded from coverage of the Statute under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) still may be a "representative of [another] agency." But, as the Judge recognized, if &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) does not apply to AFOSI investigators, then those investigators could not act as "representatives" of the Respondent, and, consequently, the Respondent could not be liable for a ULP based on AFOSI's conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In matters of statutory interpretation, the U.S. Supreme Court has stated that the first step "is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case."[21] Further, "[w]hen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon [of interpretation] is also the last."[22] Following that guidance, we begin with the statutory wording at issue here.</p>

Section 7103(b)(1)'s reference to the statutory "chapter" as a whole, and the section's use of the plural word "provisions," support the Judge's conclusion that an executive order issued under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) excludes the affected agencies and subdivisions from the entirety of the Statute.[25] And although the dissent reaches a contrary conclusion, we note that the dissent does not reconcile its conclusion with the specific wording of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1)(B)--that "the provisions of th[e Statute] cannot be applied" to excluded entities.</p>

The crucial factor in this case--and the reason that Chairman Pope finds reliance on <span class="Italic">DHS</span> misplaced here--is the operation of Executive Order 12,171, which (in conjunction with &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) of the Statute) <span id="Page_1437"></span>removes AFOSI from the coverage of the Statute entirely. However, in order to form a majority opinion on this issue and avoid an impasse in the resolution of this case, she agrees to the citation to <span class="Italic">DHS</span>. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Louisville, Ky</span>., 65 FLRA 787, 789 n.6 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 727</span>, 62 FLRA 372, 374 (2008) (Separate Opinion of then-Member Pope)) (joining majority opinion in order to avoid impasse).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next subsection of the Statute--&#x00A7; 7103(b)(2)--reinforces our understanding of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1), insofar as &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2) allows the President to "issue an order suspending <span class="Italic">any provision</span>" of the Statute.[28] The use of the singular "provision" in &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2) indicates that Congress could have granted the President authority in &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) to suspend particular provisions of the Statute without suspending others. But Congress did not include such wording in &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1); instead, as stated above, Congress stated in &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) that an executive order would suspend coverage of "this chapter" and "the provisions of this chapter"[29]--in other words, the entire Statute. And when "Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same [statute]"--as is the case with &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and (b)(2)--"it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion."[30] This contrast between &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and (b)(2) further supports the Judge's conclusion that an executive order issued under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) excludes the pertinent agency or subdivision from the entire Statute--not just specific provisions thereof.[31]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the wording of Executive Order 12,171 confirms that President Carter excluded AFOSI from "coverage under" the entire Statute,[32] which necessarily includes the "representative[-]of[-]the[-]agency" provision in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).[33] In that regard, the order states that "<span class="Italic">Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the United States Code</span> cannot be applied" to AFOSI "consistent with national[-]security requirements and considerations,"[34] which indicates that the exclusion applies to every provision in the Statute.

<p class="noindent-1">In its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, the Respondent argues that the Judge correctly found that "[b]ecause the President...issued an [e]xecutive [o]rder excluding AFOSI from coverage under the Statute, none of the provisions of the Statute apply to AFOSI." In addition, the Respondent asserts that the GC's complaint is an attempt to "perform an 'end[-]around' attack" on AFOSI's exclusion under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) by charging another entity with a ULP based on the actions of AFOSI investigators. In its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, DOD concurs with the Respondent's arguments and adds that "[t]here is no carve-out in the [e]xecutive [o]rder that allows for piecemeal application of the Statute," as DOD contends that the GC is seeking here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contrast to the <span class="Italic">amici</span> briefs of the Respondent and DOD, the GC, AFGE, and the dissent contend that the Authority should reject the Judge's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) for reasons other than the plain wording of the Statute and the plain wording of Executive Order 12,171. We address those arguments further below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the GC, AFGE, and the dissent argue that &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) should be interpreted as authorizing the President to exclude agencies and subdivisions <span class="Italic">only</span> from the Statute's benefits of collective bargaining and exclusive representation. But, as explained above, the plain wording of the Statute does not indicate that an order under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) excludes agencies or subdivisions from only <span class="Italic">some</span> provisions of the Statute. Rather, such an order applies to the Statute as a whole.[39] Further, Congress had no need to empower the President in &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) to deny AFOSI investigators the benefits of collective bargaining and exclusive recognition. In that regard, the investigators would <span class="Italic">already be denied</span> those benefits by virtue of their exclusion from the definition of an "appropriate unit" in &#x00A7; 7112,[40] owing to their "intelligence,...investigative, or security work"[41] or their "investigation or audit functions."[42] For these reasons, the GC, AFGE, and the dissent provide no basis for interpreting &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) as authorizing the President to exclude agencies or subdivisions from only some provisions of the Statute.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Second, the GC argues that the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) reflects congressional intent to ensure that most federal employees enjoy representational rights during investigatory interviews. But, as the GC admits, there is no relevant legislative history regarding &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) on this point. In that regard, the focus of this case is the <span class="Italic">interaction</span> of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2). In particular, this case concerns how an exclusionary order under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) affects the application of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2) to employees of excluded agencies or subdivisions. The GC also argues that "[n]othing in the legislative history of [&#x00A7;] 7103(b)(1)...indicates that Congress intended to deprive employees of agencies [that are] not excluded from the Statute of their [s]tatutory rights," and AFGE and the dissent make similar arguments. But, by definition, employees covered by the Statute have representational rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) only in examinations by a "<span class="Italic">representative</span> of [an] agency." Thus, finding that AFOSI investigators are not "representatives" of the Respondent would not deprive employees of an existing right but, rather, would recognize that AFOSI-conducted interviews do not involve &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rights to begin with. As such, the GC's and AFGE's reliance on legislative history does not support interpreting &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) as authorizing the President to exclude agencies or subdivisions from only some provisions of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the GC and the dissent argue that adopting the Judge's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) will "erode the right" to representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) "by encouraging the use of investigative conduits outside the employee's bargaining unit, and would otherwise frustrate Congress' apparent policy of protecting certain federal employees when they are examined and justifiably fear disciplinary action"[48]--a concern that the U.S. Supreme Court found in<span class="Italic"> NASA v. FLRA</span>[49] was a permissible basis for the Authority to hold that employees of an agency's inspector general (IG) acted as "representatives" of the IG's parent agency, for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).[50] Further, the GC and the dissent note that the Authority has also held that contractors hired by agencies may act as "representatives" of those agencies for purposes of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2).[51]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The GC and the dissent are correct that the Authority has found that individuals who are not <span class="Italic">employees</span> of an agency or subdivision may still act as "representatives" of that agency or subdivision under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2).[52] But the Authority has never recognized that non-employees may act as agency "representatives" in a situation where those non-employees work for an entity that has been expressly excluded from coverage of the <span class="Italic">entire</span> Statute--including &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)--<span class="Italic">by an executive order</span> issued under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1).

To the contrary, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit recently rejected a similar argument made by NTEU concerning IG investigators.[54] Further, we are not persuaded by the dissent's reliance on decisions that, as the dissent acknowledges, did not address &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) at all.[55]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the policy concerns that the GC and the dissent raise, as an initial matter, we note that there is no dispute that AFOSI was acting within the scope of its legal authority in this case, and nothing in our analysis in this case addresses situations where agencies use entities otherwise excluded from the coverage of the Statute by executive order to conduct investigations that are outside the scope of those entities' legal authority. When agencies or subdivisions excluded from coverage from the Statute are acting within their legal authority, the policy concerns raised by the GC and the dissent must give way to the plain wording of the Statute. As the Authority has recognized, even when "[i]t seems incongruous for Congress to...provide rights, but...deny...enforcement" of those rights in particular circumstances, "it is for Congress, not the Authority, to correct" any problems arising from plain statutory wording.[56]</p>

Because there can be no violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute unless there has been (among other things) action by a "representative of the [A]gency," we find that there was no violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in this case.

<p class="noindent-1">The Labor-Management Statute provides a comprehensive framework for labor relations between the federal government and its employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>. (1978). It regulates employees' rights to join a public-sector union, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7102; the formation and recognition of unions, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7111; collective bargaining, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7117, 7119; and the rights and duties of management and unions, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106, 7113, 7114. It also identifies actions by either an agency or a union that constitute unfair labor practices, such as interfering with the rights granted by the statute, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), encouraging or discouraging union membership by discrimination in conditions of employment, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(2), or otherwise violating the statute, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(8). The FLRA has authority to determine whether an unfair labor practice occurred, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7118, subject to judicial review by a federal court of appeals, <span class="Italic">see id</span>. &#x00A7; 7123(a). The Labor-Management Statute provides a variety of remedies for unfair labor practices, including orders to cease and desist, orders to renegotiate a collective-bargaining agreement, orders to reinstate an aggrieved employee with backpay, or "such other action as will carry out the purpose of [the Labor-Management Statute]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Not all federal employees are covered by the Labor-Management Statute. The statute explicitly excludes certain agencies, such as the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Secret Service. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3). And "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security" is barred from belonging to a union. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6). In addition, Congress provided the President with authority to exclude other agencies from coverage under all or some of the provisions of the statute. The President may suspend <span class="Italic">portions</span> of the Labor-Management Statute for agencies and activities outside the United States if the President deems it necessary for national security. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2). Or, relevant here, the President may exclude an agency from the <span class="Italic">entire</span> statute if the agency "has as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work," and the statute "cannot be applied to that agency...in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1). President Carter exercised this latter authority in Executive Order No. 12,171, 44 Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">We review FLRA decisions to determine "if they are arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps., AFL CIO Local 1592 v. FLRA</span>., 288 F.3d 1238, 1240 (10th Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In assessing whether it properly interpreted the Labor-Management Statute, we proceed under the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> framework, which governs our review of "an agency's construction of the statute which it administers." <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 842 (1984). We ask first whether Congress has spoken to "the precise question at issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843 n.9. If so, we must apply the unambiguous meaning of the statute. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. If, however, the statute is ambiguous on the issue, we will defer to an agency's reasonable interpretation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 843-44; <span class="Italic">Nat'l Fed'n of Fed</span>. <span class="Italic">Emps</span>., <span class="Italic">Local 1309 v</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 92 (1999) (When "the [s]tatute's language [is] sufficiently ambiguous or open on the point," courts must defer "to reasonable interpretation or elaboration by the agency charged with its execution."); <span class="Italic">Am</span>. <span class="Italic">Fed'n of Gov't Emps</span>., 288 F.3d at 1240 ("FLRA is entitled to considerable deference when interpreting and applying the provisions of its enabling statute." (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This deference is justified on two grounds.&#x2003;First, "[u]nder <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, we read Congress' silence as a delegation of authority to [the agency] to select from among reasonable options." <span class="Italic">EPA v</span>. <span class="Italic">EME Homer City Generation</span>, <span class="Italic">L</span>.<span class="Italic">P</span>., 134 S. Ct. 1584, 1604 (2014); <span class="Italic">see Mississippi Power &#x0026; Light Co</span>. <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">Mississippi ex rel</span>. <span class="Italic">Moore</span>, 487 U.S. 354, 381-82 (1988) (Scalia, J., concurring) ("[T]he general rationale for deference [is that] Congress would naturally expect that the agency would be responsible, within broad limits, for resolving ambiguities in its statutory authority or jurisdiction."). Second, the agency has expertise on the subject. <span class="Italic">See Pension Ben</span>. <span class="Italic">Guar</span>. <span class="Italic">Corp</span>. <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">LTV Corp</span>., 496 U.S. 633, 651-52 (1990) ("[T]he judgments about the way the real world works that have gone into the [agency's] policy are precisely the kind that agencies are better equipped to make than are courts. This practical agency expertise is one of the principal justifications behind <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a statute is unambiguous, courts are to "employ[&#8197;] traditional tools of statutory construction." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843 n.9. "These tools include examination of the statute's text, structure, purpose, history, and relationship to other statutes." <span class="Italic">Harbert v</span>. <span class="Italic">Healthcare Servs</span>. <span class="Italic">Grp</span>., <span class="Italic">Inc</span>., 391 F.3d 1140, 1147 (10th Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">see Gen</span>. <span class="Italic">Dynamics Land Sys</span>., <span class="Italic">Inc</span>. <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">Cline</span>, 540 U.S. 581, 600 (2004). Even a statutory provision whose words might have multiple meanings is not necessarily ambiguous. "Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context." <span class="Italic">Brown v</span>. <span class="Italic">Gardner</span>, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our deference to the agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute comes with a caveat: when an agency rests its interpretation on the erroneous view that the statute is unambiguous, we will not defer to the agency. <span class="Italic">See PDK Labs</span>., <span class="Italic">Inc</span>. <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">DEA</span>, 362 F.3d 786, 798 (D.C. Cir. 2004) ("[D]eference to an agency's interpretation of a statute is not appropriate when the agency wrongly believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress." (internal quotation marks omitted)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Negusie v</span>. <span class="Italic">Holder</span>, 555 U.S. 511, 516, 521-24 (2009) (declining to defer to agency interpretation and remanding for reconsideration because agency erroneously believed its interpretation was compelled by a previous Supreme Court decision). This rule follows from <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>'s underlying rationale. When an agency believes the statutory language leaves it no choice, it is not bringing its policy preferences or expertise to bear on the question, so the reasons for <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference are not present. <span class="Italic">See Peter Pan Bus Lines</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc</span>. <span class="Italic">v</span>. <span class="Italic">Fed</span>. <span class="Italic">Motor Carrier Safety Admin</span>., 471 F.3d 1350, 1354 (D.C. Cir. 2006) ("<span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step 2 deference is reserved for those instances when an agency recognizes that the Congress's intent is not plain from the statute's face. In precisely those kinds of cases, it is incumbent upon the agency not to rest simply on its parsing of the statutory language--it must bring its experience and expertise to bear in light of competing interests at stake." (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case the FLRA found the statute unambiguous.&#x2003;It wrote, "Because the plain wording of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) excludes AFOSI from all of the Statute's provisions, including &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2), we find that AFOSI's investigator did not act as a representative of [Hill] and, consequently, that [Hill] may not be held responsible under the Statute for the investigator's conduct in this case." 68 FLRA at 460. It rejected the policy concerns offered by the Union and the dissent because these concerns "must give way to the plain wording of the Statute" when, as here, AFOSI is acting within the scope of its authority. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464. In essence, it decided that its decision was compelled by Congress. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. ("[E]ven when it seems incongruous for Congress to provide rights, but deny enforcement of those rights in particular circumstances, it is for Congress, not the [FLRA], to correct any problems arising from plain statutory wording." (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1439"></span>As a result, there is no room for deference to the FLRA on this appeal. If we agree that the Labor-Management Statute is unambiguous, we will either reverse in favor of the Union or dismiss the petition, depending on our view of what the plain meaning requires. If, however, we find the statute ambiguous, we must remand to the agency to interpret the statute anew, free from its view that Congress has compelled its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now turn to interpreting the statute.&#x2003;After employing traditional tools of statutory interpretation, we hold that the statute clearly does not apply to AFOSI's investigation of Ptacek.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Right to a Representative"&#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to have a union representative present during employee disciplinary investigations has been recognized as a central component of labor law for decades.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">NLRB v</span>. <span class="Italic">J</span>. <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc</span>., 420 U.S. 251 (1975), the Supreme Court upheld the National Labor Relations Board's decision that it was an unfair labor practice to deny an employee's request for union representation at an investigatory interview that the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 252-53, 260. The Court described the importance of such a right:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Requiring a lone employee to attend an investigatory interview which he reasonably believes may result in the imposition of discipline perpetuates the inequality the [National Labor Relations] Act was designed to eliminate, and bars recourse to the safeguards the Act provided to redress the perceived imbalance of economic power between labor and management....The Board's construction also gives recognition to the right when it is most useful to both employee and employer. A single employee confronted by an employer investigating whether certain conduct deserves discipline may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors. A knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by eliciting favorable facts, and save the employer production time by getting to the bottom of the incident occasioning the interview. Certainly his presence need not transform the interview into an adversary contest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 262-63 (internal quotation marks omitted). Section 7114(a)(2)(B) codifies the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right for federal employees, providing the right to union representation when requested at any examination by an employer representative that the "employee reasonably believes...may result in disciplinary action against the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Supreme Court addressed the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 527 U.S. 229 (1999). It held that "an investigator employed in NASA's Office of Inspector General (NASA-OIG) can be considered a 'representative' of NASA when examining a NASA employee, such that the right to union representation in the [Labor-Management Statute] may be invoked." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 231. The employee, who worked at the NASA facility in Huntsville, Alabama, was suspected of threatening activities and was investigated by NASA-OIG. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 231-32. Because the employee reasonably believed that the investigation could result in his being disciplined, he requested representation by the union at the Huntsville facility. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 233. NASA and NASA-OIG argued that a "representative" of NASA could be only "a representative of agency management--i.e., the entity that has a collective bargaining relationship with the employee's union." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 233-34 (internal quotation marks omitted). They contended that because "[n]either NASA nor NASA-OIG ha[d] such a relationship with the employee's union[,]...the investigator in this case could not have been a 'representative' of the relevant 'entity.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court rejected this interpretation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) because the provision's text was "not limited to investigations conducted by certain entities within the agency in question," and all agreed that the relevant "agency" was NASA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 234 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). It held that "[i]n common parlance, the investigators employed in NASA's OIG are unquestionably 'representatives' of NASA when acting within the scope of their employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 240.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although there are potentially significant differences between <span class="Italic">NASA</span> and our case, we will assume without deciding that AFOSI was functioning as a "representative" of Hill Air Force Base when conducting the interview of Ptacek. The question before us is the effect of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and Executive Order 12,171 on Ptacek's rights during that interview. We now turn to those provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusion of AFOSI under Executive Order 12,171</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the mandate of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), the FLRA held that Ptacek was not entitled to the presence of a union representative during his interview by the AFOSI. It relied on Executive Order 12,171, authorized by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1). We agree that the statute and executive order, read in context, unambiguously withdraw the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> obligations from AFOSI investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the statutory text.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See King v</span>. <span class="Italic">St</span>. <span class="Italic">Vincent's Hosp</span>., 502 U.S. 215, 218 (1991). Section 7103(b)(1) is broad:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The President may issue an order excluding any agency or subdivision thereof <span class="Italic">from coverage under this chapter</span> if the President determines that--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A) the agency or subdivision has as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B) the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(emphasis added). The plain language excludes covered agencies from every provision under the chapter. There is no limiting language, for instance, that the agency would be subject to the provisions of &#x00A7; 7117 (relating to the duty to bargain in good faith) but not the provisions of &#x00A7; 7119 (relating to negotiation impasses). This breadth appears in sharp relief when contrasted with the narrower scope of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2). Under that section the President may "issue an order suspending <span class="Italic">any provision of this chapter</span> with respect to any agency, installation, or activity" outside the United States. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2) (emphasis added). Under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(2) the President can pick and choose which provisions of the Labor-Management Statute should not apply to an agency, but under &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) the President must exclude it from coverage under the <span class="Italic">entire</span> statute or not at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, there is a potential ambiguity in the statute, depending on whose perspective to adopt in construing the statute. The Union, naturally, looks at the matter from the employee's point of view. The employee seeking to assert his <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right is not an employee of the excluded agency. He faces potential work-related discipline from his employing agency (here, Hill), not the excluded agency (here, AFOSI). Why then should his representational rights be affected by the exclusion of that other agency from the statute? As the Union puts it, "[A] covered agency [like Hill]...does not magically become uncovered simply because it happens to choose a tool [like the AFOSI] that [may] not itself be subject to [Labor-Management Statute] liability."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The investigator, on the other hand, <span class="Italic">is</span> part of the excluded agency and takes it as a given that the executive order means that the statute, including &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2), does not apply to his actions. And that being the case, there was no violation of the Labor-Management Statute by anyone--either the AFOSI investigator or Hill Air Force Base.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To resolve this conflict, we look to the statutory structure, context, and purpose. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 513 U.S. at 118 ("Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context."); <span class="Italic">Harbert</span>, 391 F.3d at 1147 (traditional tools of statutory construction include "examination of the statute's text, structure, purpose, history, and relationship to other statutes"). It then becomes clear that an investigator from an excluded agency does not have any <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> obligations when acting within the agency's proper scope.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">One strong indication that AFOSI's perspective is the proper one is that the focus of the statutory exception and the executive order is national security. Their function is to override the interests protected by the Labor-Management Statute when required by national security. Congress recognized the importance of certain employee rights by enacting the Labor-Management Statute. But by the same token it recognized that those rights may sometimes need to give way to national security, as determined by the President. In short, the employee's interests are subordinate in this context.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further supporting this view is that the Union's interpretation would give the executive order no reasonable purpose and would undermine an important national-security purpose. To begin with, the purpose of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and the executive order could not have been to exclude national-security investigators from the union-membership and collective-bargaining provisions of the Labor-Management Statute. Such employees are already excluded from those provisions under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6), which states that a potential bargaining unit is not appropriate for labor-organization representation if it includes "any employee engaged in intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or security work which directly affects national security." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the exclusion could still have the purpose of exempting AFOSI employees who do not come under the &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) exemption, such as clerical employees. But this purpose must satisfy the requirements of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1), under which the President may exclude an agency only if the President determines that the "the agency or subdivision has as a primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative, or national security work, <span class="Italic">and</span>...the provisions of this chapter cannot be applied to that agency or subdivision in a manner consistent with national security requirements and considerations." (emphasis added). The Union utterly fails to explain how limiting the collective-bargaining rights of the nonexempt AFOSI employees could have been so important to this country's national security that President Carter would decide to include AFOSI in his executive order. Nor can we think of a good reason. We note that even without the Executive Order, &#x00A7; 7112(b)(6) exempts from statutory rights more than just AFOSI's investigators. Clerical employees may also be covered by the exemption. <span id="Page_1440"></span>"[A]n employee is engaged in 'security work' within the meaning of [the exemption] if the employee's duties include 'the regular use of, or access to, classified information.'" <span class="Italic">U</span>.<span class="Italic">S</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice Washington</span>, <span class="Italic">D</span>.<span class="Italic">C</span>., 62 F.L.R.A 286, 292 (2007). Perhaps a strike by nonexempt employees could injure national security; but federal workers are prohibited from striking anyway. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7311 ("An individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States...if he...participates in a strike, or asserts the right to strike, against the Government of the United States...."); 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1918 (violation of &#x00A7; 7311 is punishable by fine or imprisonment for up to one year).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the FLRA's interpretation of the statute has an obvious national-security purpose. Freeing AFOSI investigators from <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> restrictions when interviewing union members can serve two interests: (1) restricting access to national-security information that might otherwise be disclosed to union representatives attending investigatory interviews; and (2) obtaining greater cooperation in a national-security investigation from an interviewee who cannot gain psychological strength to resist by having a champion present during the interview. We recognize that there may be some (perhaps many) AFOSI interviews in which such interests are not served. But the statute does not permit the executive order to be finely tailored. The Union admitted at oral argument that under its interpretation of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and the executive order, a Union member would <span class="Italic">always</span> be entitled to have a representative present at an interview, no matter what the national-security interests at stake. As the Union sees it, there would be <span class="Italic">no</span> way for the President to exclude AFOSI's national-security interrogations from <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> restrictions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not to say that <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights are not important. Certainly they are. But they may need to yield to national-security interests. Congress allowed for that to happen, and the President took the step. We conclude that the sole reasonable interpretation of &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and the executive order is that <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights are not available to union members during AFOSI investigations within the scope of its authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The relevant administrative and judicial precedents also support our interpretation.&#x2003;For instance, the Federal Circuit, in upholding the removal of an Air Force mechanic from his position because of marijuana usage, rejected a challenge to his questioning by the AFOSI without the presence of a union representative. <span class="Italic">See Lawson v</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Air Force</span>, 215 F.3d 1347, 1999 WL 594536, at *1 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 6, 1999) (unpublished). It explained, "[A]n executive order clearly exempts Air Force OSI and other investigative agencies or subdivisions from [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Likewise, in <span class="Italic">U</span>.<span class="Italic">S</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command</span>, <span class="Italic">Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr</span>., <span class="Italic">Robins Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Georgia</span>, 66 FLRA 589, 593, 596 (Jan. 12, 2011) (ALJ Decision), an ALJ held that a threat by an AFOSI investigator during an interrogation was not an unfair labor practice because "it is clear that the [AFOSI] and those working within its authority are excluded from all requirements and limitations imposed by the [Labor-Management Statute] and not just certain provisions therein. Therefore, the General Counsel's argument that the inclusion of AFOSI in E.O. 12171 only excuses that subdivision from collective bargaining with its own employees must fail." And in <span class="Italic">U</span>.<span class="Italic">S</span>. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr</span>., <span class="Italic">Hill Air Force Base</span>, <span class="Italic">Utah</span>, FLRA ALJ Dec. Rep. No. 130, 1997 WL 798919, at *1 (Oct. 9, 1997), an ALJ rejected an unfair-labor-practice claim based on the refusal by AFOSI investigators to grant requests that union representatives be present for interviews. Relying on Executive Order 12,171, the ALJ held that "[AFOSI] is excluded from coverage under the [Labor-Management] Statute,...[and] the requirements of &#x00A7; [7114] (a)(2)(B) may not be imposed on [AFOSI]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union urges that two previous FLRA decisions support its position.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Lackland Air Force Base Exch., Lackland Air Force Base, Tex.,</span> 5 FLRA 473 (1981), and <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill Air Force Base, Utah,</span> 36 FLRA 748 (1990). True, in both decisions the FLRA held that an Air Force employee had the right to union representation under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2) during an examination by an AFOSI officer. But neither decision addressed whether &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) and Executive Order 12,171 exempted AFOSI from complying with &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2). In fact, the alleged violation in Lackland occurred on July 14, 1979, more than four months before the issuance of Executive Order 12,171 on November 19, 1979. We therefore reject the assertion by the FLRA dissenting member in this case that "[t]he only credible explanation for the positions taken--and not taken--by the parties in <span class="Italic">Lackland</span> is that all of the parties--and the [FLRA]--understood clearly that EO 12,171 and &#x00A7; 7103(b)(1) were not intended to preclude the AFOSI investigator from acting as a 'representative of the agency' when the investigator conducted the interview." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force,</span> 68 FLRA at 467 (DuBester, M., dissenting). A better explanation is that the parties understood, if they had even noted the issuance of the executive order, that it did not apply to conduct occurring before its issuance. And the later decision in <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr.,</span> 36 FLRA 748, contains no mention of Executive Order 12,171 in either the FLRA decision or the ALJ decision. In our view it is not entitled to any consideration on the issue before us.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we do not address whether an AFOSI interrogation would be exempt from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) if--as the Union argues could be the result of the FLRA's interpretation--the Air Force engaged AFOSI for routine employment disciplinary matters in order to systematically avoid the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right or if AFOSI acted outside the scope of its authority in conducting an investigation. The Union has not disputed, either before the FLRA or in the argument section of its opening brief on appeal, that AFOSI was acting within the scope of its authority in this case; and the FLRA reserved judgment on what would happen if AFOSI was operating outside the scope of that authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 68 FLRA at 464 ("[W]e note that there is no dispute that AFOSI was acting within the scope of its legal authority in this case, and nothing in our analysis in this case addresses situations where agencies use entities otherwise excluded from the coverage of the Statute by executive order to conduct investigations that are outside the scope of those entities' legal authority."). We leave the question for another day.</p>
<p class="noindent">The historical development of the law pertaining to representational rights at interrogations conducted by agency criminal investigative unit and IG agents is traced below.</p>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU</span>, 23 FLRA 876, 878 (1986), involving telephone monitoring of an employee by the agency, and in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 36 FLRA 41, 48-49 (1990), involving an interview about a suspected arson case conducted by agents of the DOJ Office of Professional Responsibility, FLRA determined that <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> protections apply to investigations conducted by agency investigative units. <span class="Italic">Border Patrol</span> was reviewed in <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol v. FLRA</span>, 939 F.2d 1170, 1172-73 (5th Cir. 1991). The court agreed with FLRA's construction of the federal employee's right to representation under <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251 (1975), extended to federal employees by 5 USC 7114(a)(2)(B), with the options to an employer during a covered interview of granting the employee's request for representation, discontinuing the interview, or offering the employee a choice to continue the interview without representation or to have no interview. The court concluded that FLRA did not decide whether the employee voluntarily decided to participate in the interview through coercion to withdraw his request that his union representative be present. The court remanded to FLRA to decide whether the employee's decision to participate in the interview was voluntary. On remand FLRA reaffirmed the result originally reached, <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, Border Patrol, El Paso and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 42 FLRA 834, 840-41 (1991), determining the interview was involuntary<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Lackland AFB Exch. and AFGE Local 2911</span>, 5 FLRA 473, 487 (1981) (ALJ Decision) (<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> representation rights were improperly refused when agency managers and OSI investigator questioned the appellant about her potential misconduct but failed to permit union representation she requested).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Criminal Investigative Serv. and AFGE Local 2567</span>, 28 FLRA 1145, 1149 (1987) (<span class="Italic">DCIS</span>), reaffirmed the right to investigative protections during criminal inquiries and noted that, as to the agency unit conducting the investigation, "although DCIS was not the employing entity of the employees, once it was aware of the employees' statutory right to union representation in the interview, it could not act in such a manner so as to unlawfully interfere with that right." FLRA's decision was reviewed and affirmed by the Third Circuit in <span class="Italic">Defense Criminal Investigative Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93, 98-101 (3d Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the 1987 <span class="Italic">DCIS</span> decision, an FLRA ALJ determined that an inspector general interview was not within agency control and not subject to the protections of <span class="Italic">IRS and Brookhaven Serv. Ctr.</span>, 9 FLRA 930 (1982)<span class="Italic">. PTO and NTEU Chap. 243</span>, 45 FLRA 886, 892-93 (1992) (ALJ Decision). A decision reviewed on exceptions, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Washington, D.C. and Nat'l Border Patrol Council, AFGE</span>, 46 FLRA 1526 (1993), adopted an ALJ's decision, based on <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>, that an agency committed a ULP when an OIG agent interviewed a unit employee without investigatory protections. That result was set aside by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">DOJ v. FLRA</span>, 39 F.3d 361, 367 (D.C. Cir. 1994), concluding that "Congress gave the Inspector General the independent authority to decide "when and how" to investigate...; that the Inspector General's authority encompasses determining how to conduct interviews under oath; and that the Inspector General's independence and authority would necessarily be compromised if another agency of government--the Federal Labor Relations Authority--influenced the Inspector General's performance of his duties on the basis of its view of what constitutes an unfair labor practice."</p>
<p class="noindent">The Second Circuit reviewed an unexcepted ALJ Decision (<span class="Italic">DOJ and AFGE Local 1917</span>, BN-CA-50149 <span class="Italic">et al.</span>, July 30, 1996), deciding that an agency committed a ULP through an IG investigation conducted without <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> protections. The court determined in <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 125 F.3d 106, 111-14 (2d Cir. 1997), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 137 F.3d 683, 690-91 (2d Cir. 1998), that OIG interviews would be subject to <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights: "so long as the OIG agent is questioning an employee for <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> purposes within the authority of the IGA and not merely accommodating the agency by conducting interrogation of the sort traditionally performed by agency supervisory staff in the course of carrying out their personnel responsibilities, the OIG agent is not a 'representative' of the employee's agency for purposes of section 7114(a)(2)(B)."</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1995, FLRA reaffirmed its determination that agencies provide <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> protections to employees questioned by IG representatives. <span class="Italic">NASA and AFGE Local 3434</span>, 50 FLRA 601, 612-22 (1995), <span class="Italic">enforcement granted</span>, <span class="Italic">FLRA v.
