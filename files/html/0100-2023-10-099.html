<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-99"><span class="space">c.</span> Timing of Evidentiary Submissions, Responses</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The parties are responsible for submitting their evidence and argument within the time directed by the AJ's order setting a deadline for the closing of the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. EEOC</span>, 45 MSPR 229, 233 (1990). It is error for the AJ to issue an order or initial decision prior to the expiration of time allowed for the party's response. <span class="Italic">Tackett v. USDA</span>, 89 MSPR 348, 351 (2001) (stating the rule); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 83 MSPR 545, 547 (1999) (considering the impact of error under the harmful error rule). An AJ will not be faulted for not receiving a deposition agreed to by the parties during the hearing if the transcript is submitted after the issuance of the initial decision when the parties were aware that the AJ had 25 days to issue the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ramos v. SBA</span>, 27 MSPR 607, 608 n.* (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ should ensure that the record reflects what date controls submission of posthearing evidence: there is a distinction between the date of mailing by a party and the date of receipt by the AJ. The distinction should be made clear on the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roach v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 443, 445 (1990). If the AJ states that materials must be received by a certain date, that date controls and the mailing date is immaterial. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ayala v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 515, 519 (1994); <span class="Italic">Douglass v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 1, 3 (1993) (AJ could set a receipt rather than a postmark date for submissions concerning jurisdiction: "Although the Board's regulations set filing deadlines for submission of appeals, petitions for review, cross petitions for review, and responses, they are silent as to deadlines for responses to administrative judges' orders."). Under <span class="Italic">Christie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 447, 449 (1986), if the agency submissions are late and rejected, the agency has no defense to the untimeliness because the appellant sought and received prior postponements of the hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 2012 regulatory changes, a party may reply to submissions made by the other party close to the date set for closing of the record. 5 CFR 1201.59 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;When there is a hearing, the record ordinarily will close at the conclusion of the hearing. When the judge allows the parties to submit argument, briefs, or documents previously identified for introduction into evidence, however, the record will remain open for as much time as the judge grants for that purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;If the appellant waives the right to a hearing, the record will close on the date the judge sets as the final date for the receipt or filing of submissions of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Once the record closes, additional evidence or argument will ordinarily not be accepted unless:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The party submitting it shows that the evidence or argument was not readily available before the record closed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;It is in rebuttal to new evidence or argument submitted by the other party just before the record closed....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Practice before the regulatory change allowed for rebuttals to last minute submissions. If the agency submitted new evidence shortly before the record closed, the appellant should have been given a reasonable period to respond. "[W]here an appeal is decided without a hearing, the procedures utilized by the regional office must comport with basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity to respond to submissions of the parties." <span class="Italic">Anastos v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 18, 21 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 412, 416 (1997) (AJ may "<span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> extend the record closing date to ensure that the record is fully developed and that the case is fairly and justly adjudicated"); <span class="Italic">Buscher v.

These were material issues which possibly could affect the outcome of this appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may require that the party who opposes a new assertion in a final submission request the AJ to accept a response, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 276, 280-82 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the record shows that the agency was on notice before it removed the appellant that he could not perform his duties with prolonged standing of more than two hours at a time. In his oral reply to the agency's notice of proposed removal, the appellant informed the agency that he believed that he "could still work," and that "[his] restrictions [were] based on...letters from [his] doctors." At the hearing, the agency-retained physician, the appellant's supervisor, and the agency's deciding official all testified that they were aware that the appellant's medical restrictions did not permit him to stand for prolonged periods of time longer than two hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge gave the parties an opportunity to submit written closing arguments. In his written closing argument, certified as mailed on November 21, 1988, the appellant contended specifically "that he merely had to sit down occasionally to accommodate his varicose veins." In its written closing argument, certified as mailed on November 22, 1988, the agency addressed the issue of accommodation by reassignment and job restructuring, but did not mention the appellant's closing argument or his suggested accommodation. The administrative judge thereafter found that the agency could have reasonably accommodated the appellant by adopting his "suggestion" of "permitting him to have occasional rest periods where he could sit down before resuming his duties."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not articulate until his closing argument the "magic words" that he merely needed "to sit down occasionally" as reasonable accommodation, the agency was well aware throughout this case of his medical restrictions and qualifications. Indeed, the medical evidence of record, and the appellant's assertions in response to the agency's notice of proposed removal, plainly indicate that his medical restriction against prolonged standing could be accommodated if he were merely permitted to get off his feet for a while every few hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the fact that the appellant did not <span class="Italic">specifically</span> assert this accommodation (which is supported by the evidence previously submitted in the record) until his closing argument is not fatal to his claim. An administrative judge should consider timely-filed closing arguments. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Surface v. Department of the Navy,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 102, 103 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 818 F.2d 876 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has determined that an administrative judge commits prejudicial error by closing the record, or by not reopening the record, so as to deny a party an opportunity to respond to another party's material arguments or evidence first raised in a closing submission....&#8197;Here, the agency did not address the appellant's asserted accommodation in its November 22, 1988, closing argument apparently because it had not received his closing argument at that time. However, during the more than 2-week period that followed until the issuance of the December 7, 1988, initial decision, the agency did not (a) complain to the administrative judge that it was "surprised" by the appellant's asserted accommodation, (b) object to the raising of this accommodation, or (c) request that the record be kept open or the hearing continued so that it could present evidence or testimony on this issue. Nor has the agency shown that the administrative judge denied such requests....&#8197;The agency's failure to object to the appellant's accommodation (that was specifically asserted in his closing argument and is supported by the evidence of record) or to the administrative judge's consideration of that specific argument thus constitutes a waiver of such an objection....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent argues that the agency was not required during the more than 2-week period after the record closed below to complain of surprise or request the administrative judge to reopen the record to permit it to respond to the appellant's reasonable accommodation argument...and that permitting the agency to raise the matter before the full Board on petition for review is proper. Nothing, however, prohibited the agency from requesting the administrative judge to reopen the record to permit it to submit rebuttal argument....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency had not moved to reopen the record, but had instead below (a) objected to the appellant's accommodation argument because the agency would not have an opportunity to respond to it, or (b) submitted after the close of the record a rebuttal to the appellant's argument, the Board has held that it is prejudicial error for an administrative judge not to accept and consider such an additional rebuttal submission....&#8197;The agency in this appeal, however, did nothing below to submit rebuttal argument to the administrative judge, or <span id="Page_1396"></span>to preserve an objection to the submission of the appellant's closing arguments for the Board's review on petition for review.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Quadri v. Dept. of Army,</span> DA-0752-14-0258-I-1 (NP 3/24/2015) ("While the appellant argues in his petition for review that he was not given the opportunity to respond to the agency's August 12, 2014 rebuttal, he has not alleged that he tried to submit a response or that he sought the administrative judge's permission to do so. Moreover, he did not object to the rebuttal pleading below. During the 37 days between the agency's rebuttal and the administrative judge's decision, neither party submitted anything.&#8197;...Finally, even if the appellant should have been given the opportunity to respond to the agency's August 12, 2014 rebuttal, as he alleges, the petition for review process presented a sufficient opportunity for doing so."); <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 685, 692 n.2 (1992) (appellant waived objection to the AJ's failure to permit a response if, during the two weeks between the close of the record and the issuance of an initial decision, the appellant failed to file an objection with the AJ, request the reopening of the record or offer rebuttal evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the appellant preserves his right to offer a response to new evidence submitted by the agency at the date set for the close of the record, the AJ should honor the appellant's request when the agency submits new evidence, <span class="Italic">Nordhoff v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 68 MSPR 45, 48 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although setting the deadline for closing the record is within the sound discretion of the administrative judge, the judge's rulings in this regard must comport with the basic requirements of fairness and notice, including an opportunity for a party to respond to material evidence submitted by the opposing party. <span class="Italic">Gavette,</span> 44 MSPR at 174.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an order summarizing a telephonic conference, the administrative judge ordered the appellant to submit evidence and argument by November 7, 1994, and afforded the agency ten days after the appellant's submission to file its evidence and argument, with the record to close on November 17, 1994. In a pleading filed November 3, the appellant objected to the administrative judge's summary, stating that he had thought that November 7 was to be the deadline for both parties. The appellant further stated that he wished to preserve the right to rebut any evidence that the agency might submit, which would necessarily be evidence that he would see for the first time after November 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted his evidence and argument on November 7, reiterating that he wished to reserve the right to rebut the agency's evidence and argument. The agency filed its submission on November 17, the day the administrative judge had set as the close of the record. That submission included new evidence in the form of declarations made under penalty of perjury by R.E. Riester and David Schulte. The appellant filed a motion to extend the close of the record to allow him to respond to the agency's new evidence, which the administrative judge denied, without explanation, in the remand initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's refusal to extend or reopen the record was error because it denied the appellant the opportunity to respond to the agency's evidence submitted on November 17, 1994. This error affected the appellant's substantive rights, and merits a second remand for additional factfinding, because the administrative judge relied on the Riester and Schulte declarations. <span class="Italic">See Anastos v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 38 MSPR 18, 21-22 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ fails to allow a response to material submitted shortly before the record closes, the Board will occasionally consider whatever information the opposing party submits with its PFR and, if it can, decide without remand the significance of the materials newly submitted. <span class="Italic">Mooney v. DOD</span>, 44 MSPR 524, 528 (1990) (noting that the agency did not inform the AJ of its interest in responding to the appellant's last submissions); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 29 MSPR 464, 465 n.2 (1985) (if the AJ erred by considering rebuttal evidence from the agency after the close of the record, the error was cured by considering the appellant's response in the PFR). The Board reasons that when it considers the response and determines that the party suffered no harm, the initial decision need not be vacated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caparaz v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 670, 672 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Eriksen v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 135, 138 (1984) (AJ erred, in an appeal decided without a hearing, by not forwarding a copy of the appellant's closing submission to the agency for its response; the error was cured when the Board considered material that the agency submitted with its PFR); <span class="Italic">Abbott v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 21, 22 (1982) (AJ should have reopened the record to permit the appellant to respond to an agency submission, but the issue was jurisdiction and "the agency's submission would not have impacted upon the presiding official's decision since the merits of the case were never reached"). The same result is achieved if the appellant submits material too late for the AJ's consideration. The Board examines the material to determine if the AJ's error in prematurely closing the record harmed the party whose submission was not considered. If the appellant maintains that the case should be remanded for the AJ to consider the materials, the appellant must explain why a remand is needed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 67 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Spigner v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 86 MSPR 677, 679 &#x00B6; 4 (2000), presents an example of analysis concluding that there was no harm to an appellant who was precluded from responding to an agency submission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that he was not allowed to refute the agency's final argument, which was filed on August 19, 1999. First, the appellant has not explained what he would have said in response to the agency's final submission. Second, the order closing the record states that the parties agreed that the record would close on August 19, 1999, and that no submissions would be accepted after that date. Third, the appellant never asked the administrative judge to reopen the record to allow him to respond. Fourth, the agency's final submission consists merely of a brief on the issues; it contains no new argument or evidence. Thus, before the agency submitted its final brief on August 19, 1999, the appellant knew what the agency's evidence included and what it was arguing, and he had ample opportunity before that time to respond. For these reasons, we find that the appellant has not shown how his substantive rights were prejudiced by the administrative judge's order closing the record, and his argument does not provide a basis for the Board to grant his petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Karapinka v. Department of Energy,</span> 6 MSPB 114, 6 MSPR 124, 127 (1981).</p>
