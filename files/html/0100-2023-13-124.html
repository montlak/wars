<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-123"><span class="space">6.</span> Inquiry Into Other Issues</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 680, 689 (1991), described the indefinite suspension as being potentially available pending criminal proceedings or agency inquiry, under "certain other circumstances in which an agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to Federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public." But criminal investigations and security clearance proceedings aside, there is not much law concerning other bases that support indefinite suspensions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor v. Slattery</span>, 87 MSPR 528 (2000) (nonprecedential final decision; compare separate opinions of Acting Chairman Slavet and Member Marshall concerning use of indefinite suspension of ALJ who was investigated for misconduct that could, but did not at the time, lead to revocation of his license to practice law). In her separate opinion in the <span class="Italic">Slattery</span> case, Ms. Slavet offered a short catalogue of the uses of an indefinite suspension. She identified the customary uses--investigations into criminal matters and investigations into matters causing suspension of security clearances. She alluded to "other matters" not involving crimes or clearances but that could place the government in jeopardy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Concerning the first reason, I note that the Board has upheld an indefinite suspension only under very limited and delineated circumstances. Thus, the Board has authorized indefinite suspensions when an agency has suspended or revoked an employee's access to classified information and the employee needs a security clearance to do his job. However, the Board has authorized such indefinite suspensions only after the agency has suspended or revoked the employee's access to classified information<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Holley v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 300, 305 (1994); <span class="Italic">Alston v. Department of the Navy</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 19, 23-24 (1994), <span class="Italic">rev'd on other grounds sub nom. King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657 (Fed. Cir. 1996). There is no legal basis for indefinitely suspending an employee merely because he is in danger of losing a professional credential necessary for his position. Here, respondent has not yet lost his law license, and he may never lose it. <span class="Italic">Cf. McGean v. National Labor Relations Board</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 49, 53-54 (1983) (after the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended the appellant's law license, the Board affirmed the agency's decision to remove the appellant from his position as attorney-advisor based, in part, on the appellant's failure to maintain a basic qualification requirement for service in his position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also authorized an agency's indefinite suspension of an employee in order to allow examination of charged criminal misconduct if the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed<span class="Italic">. See Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1155 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Campbell v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 691, 694 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 833 F.2d 1024 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (Table). Nevertheless, the respondent in this case has not been charged with a crime. Although the BPR found that the respondent committed theft under the D.C. Code, the D.C. Court of Appeals has held that, unless the respondent has been convicted of an offense, neither the Court nor the BPR is authorized to decide in a disciplinary proceeding that the attorney has violated a criminal statute, <span class="Italic">In re Stiller</span>, 725 A.2d 533, 539-40 (D.C. 1999) ("an attorney may be subjected to disciplinary sanctions only for his conduct, not for any supposed violation of a criminal statute with which he has never even been charged").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board has upheld an agency's indefinite suspension of an employee when the agency has reason to believe that the employee poses an immediate danger to himself or others<span class="Italic">. See Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 772 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (employee threatened to kill his supervisor); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 88-90 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (employee engaged in bizarre and intimidating behavior in the workplace and was evaluated as suffering from a paranoid complex), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843 (1985). The agency does not allege, and there is no evidence to indicate, that the respondent poses a threat to himself or others. Thus, our decisions upholding indefinite suspensions do not support an indefinite suspension in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Acting Chair Slavet cited to <span class="Italic">Thomas v. GSA</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985), as approval of an indefinite suspension taken against an employee who was exhibiting unusual and threatening behavior in the workplace. The agency first placed Mr. Thomas on enforced leave, and then suspended him pending the outcome of the agency's decision on whether to apply for his disability retirement. A regulation then in effect, 5 CFR 831.1206 (1983), required an agency to maintain an employee in duty status pending an OPM decision on an agency-initiated retirement application; however, an agency could place an employee on involuntary leave, or suspend the employee, if it would be detrimental to the interests of the government, coworkers, or the general public to keep the employee at the worksite while the retirement application was being adjudicated. That regulation was dropped in 1984. An agency was no longer normally required to maintain an employee on the rolls during consideration of an agency-initiated retirement application; rather, the agency could separate the employee through adverse action. In the other decision cited by Ms. Slavet, <span class="Italic">Mercer v. DHHS</span>, 772 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the reasoning, although not the regulation, underpinning <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was applied to an employee who was placed on enforced leave pending the outcome of a psychiatric fitness examination ordered because of the employee's allegedly threatening behavior. In <span class="Italic">Mercer</span> the court determined that the suspension was proper without defining a broader set of circumstances that could justify an indefinite suspension for conduct that was not either overtly criminal in nature or that did not result in the suspension of a security clearance. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, allowing a suspension for conduct that implicated the employee's fitness to an extent that caused the agency to file a disability retirement application for the employee, and <span class="Italic">Mercer</span>, resulting in a suspension because of concerns about an employee's fitness that necessitated a psychiatric fitness examination, are not necessarily authority for allowing indefinite suspensions any time an agency is examining the conduct of an employee who is deemed too disruptive to have on the premises during the pendency of the investigation. But without more precise definition through OPM regulations, the indefinite suspension is a largely defined by caselaw, an argument can be made that broad authority for an indefinite suspension (involving an unrecoverable loss of pay) is found in those two decisions because both cases were considered to involve disciplinary actions. The lack of definite authority from 1985 to the present suggests that the law is in need of clarification.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Some clarification arrived through <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GONZALEZ_MANUEL_J_NY_0752_09_0052_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_514402.pdf">114 MSPR 318</a>, 320-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-28, 2010 MSPB 132 (2010). The Board explained that indefinite suspensions are used: (1) When the agency has invoked the crime provision; (2) when the agency has legitimate concerns that an employee's medical condition makes his continued presence in the workplace dangerous or inappropriate--pending a determination that the employee is fit for duty; and (3) when an employee's access to classified information has been suspended and the employee must have such access to perform his job, pending a final determination on the employee's access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> <span id="Page_2173"></span>concluded, in an extensive decision analyzing the historical basis for and application of indefinite suspensions, that an agency investigation into potential misconduct, even of a potentially criminal nature, cannot, without more, support an indefinite suspension:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a GS-1811-13 Criminal Investigator with the agency's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On September 30, 2008, the agency issued the appellant written notice of its proposal to suspend him without pay indefinitely, pending an agency investigation into allegations that he had committed acts of domestic violence on September 7, 2008. The notice specifically stated that, "while these issues raise the possibility of criminal prosecution by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, this action is <span class="Italic">not</span> being proposed based upon a reasonable cause to believe that you have committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed." The agency indicated that it was relying on a Report of Investigation prepared by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility and a criminal complaint executed by a police officer regarding the alleged incident on September 7, 2008. The appellant made an oral reply to the indefinite suspension proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 7, 2008, the agency provided the appellant with written notice of its decision to indefinitely suspend him without pay beginning November 9, 2008. The agency's deciding official found that the allegations against the appellant were "sufficiently credible" and, because the agency had provided the appellant with at least 30 days' notice of its proposed action, "the only applicable standard is whether an indefinite suspension in this case promotes the efficiency of the service." The deciding official found that the indefinite suspension satisfied that general standard under the circumstances. The decision letter indicated that the suspension would remain in effect until the later of the resolution of the allegations pending against the appellant, the completion of any agency investigation concerning the factual situation that formed the basis of the allegations, or the notice period of any adverse action proposed based on the factual situation that formed the basis of the criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed this appeal asserting, among other things, that the agency lacked "just cause" to suspend him. Specifically, he argued that the mere existence of an open agency investigation into the allegations against him was not grounds for disciplinary action. He further disputed the deciding official's claim that the allegations against him were credible, and he introduced evidence suggesting that a court had determined that there was no probable cause related to the criminal complaint against him, based in part, on a statement from the alleged adult victim of the alleged abuse. The agency responded that the indefinite suspension was based solely on its investigation into the allegations against the appellant--not on any criminal proceedings related to those allegations--and therefore, it did not need to establish a reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. The agency maintained that it could indefinitely suspend the appellant without pay for the purpose of conducting its own investigation into the allegations. The agency also argued that it did not need to prove that the appellant actually committed the alleged acts of domestic violence, but only that there were allegations that the agency was investigating and that it promoted the efficiency of the service to suspend the appellant without pay while it completed its investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Nature of the Agency's Charge</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's proposal notice labeled the "reason" for its action as "Indefinite Suspension Pending Agency Investigation," and the agency supported its "reason" with the following "specification":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">On September 8, 2008, the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) was notified of allegations of misconduct committed by you. Specifically, OPR has an open administrative investigation into whether you committed acts of domestic violence (physical assault and verbal threats) against [Ms. X], on September 7, 2008, in the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Aguadilla, in Moca, Puerto Rico. A preliminary investigation by the Puerto Rico Police Department indicates you employed physical violence against [Ms. X] when you pushed her, choked her neck and pulled her hair. The investigation also indicates that you made threatening statements when you stated "If you take the girl, I will kill you and your parents." Moreover, Judge Jose Morales, Department of Justice, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico found probable cause for your arrest and you were charged in violation of Puerto Rico's domestic violence law 54, Articles 3.1 and 3.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposal notice further explained that the suspension would "remain in effect until such time as the agency has concluded its investigation into this matter, or there is sufficient evidence to return [you] to duty or to support an administrative action against you."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must review the agency's decision solely on the grounds invoked by the agency; the Board may not substitute what it considers to be a more appropriate basis for the agency's action. <span class="Italic">E.g., O'Keefe v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 318 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Administration,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). Despite the deciding official's statement that he found the allegations against the appellant to be "sufficiently credible," the proposal notice makes clear that the agency was not charging the appellant with the underlying misconduct itself. The agency did not charge the appellant with, for instance, committing acts of domestic violence by employing physical violence against Ms. X, or by making threatening statements to Ms. X. Indeed, one of the stated purposes of the agency's continuing investigation is to determine whether grounds exist for taking "an administrative action" against the appellant based on his alleged conduct on September 7, 2008. In addition, the proposal notice specifically stated that "the action is <span class="Italic">not</span> being proposed based upon a reasonable cause to believe that you have committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed."[2] Instead, the express basis for the agency's action is that it has an open investigation into allegations regarding the appellant's off-duty conduct.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency has been adamant throughout these proceedings that it did not invoke the "crime provision" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), and there is no dispute that the agency provided the appellant with at least 30-days notice before effecting his suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In explaining why an indefinite suspension was a reasonable penalty, the proposing official mentioned that the agency had taken away the appellant's weapon, credentials, badge, and government owned vehicle. These facts are not mentioned in the decision letter, however, and it is clear that the agency's charge is based on the existence of its own open investigation into allegations against the appellant rather than the fact that the agency had taken away the appellant's access to these items.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, among other things, that the agency may not lawfully suspend him without pay based "merely on the fact that it wishes to investigate allegations of off-duty misconduct. The agency maintains that, because it gave the appellant at least 30-days advance notice, it may suspend him without pay indefinitely while it investigates whether he actually engaged in misconduct that would justify disciplinary action because the suspension serves the purpose of protecting agency personnel, the public, or government property, and maintains the orderly operation of the government. The practical effect of such a procedure is that the agency has subjected the appellant to a severe adverse action--a lengthy suspension without pay--while the agency conducts its investigation into whether any grounds exist for taking an adverse action against the appellant for misconduct. In addition, the agency has, in effect, unilaterally and indefinitely delayed the point at which it could be required to meet its statutory obligation to prove by preponderant evidence that the appellant actually engaged in conduct warranting an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). For the following reasons, we find that the appellant's suspension is unlawful and must be reversed.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2174"></span>Subchapter II of chapter 75 (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-14) governs major adverse actions against federal employees, such as a removal, a reduction in grade or pay, or a suspension lasting for more than 14 days. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. The Reform Act provides that an agency may take such an action against an employee "only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). "Cause" under section 7513(a) generally connotes some specific act or omission on the part of the employee that warrants disciplinary action, and an agency charge that does not set forth actionable misconduct cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Justice,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 287, 297 (1995) ("Regardless of whether the charged misconduct actually occurred, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the charged misconduct is not actionable."); <span class="Italic">Capozzella v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee subjected to an action identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 is entitled to procedures prescribed in the Reform Act, including an advance notice period (generally 30 days) and the right to file an appeal with the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b), (d).

First, it must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the charged conduct occurred. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B) (1994).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although chapter 75 contains no specific reference to "indefinite" suspensions, the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 75 apply to "a suspension for more than 14 days." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2).[5] An "indefinite" suspension is a "suspension" for purposes of chapter 75, even though it is imposed without a definitive end date. <span class="Italic">McClure v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;For purposes of subchapter II of chapter 75, a suspension means the placing of an employee, for disciplinary reasons, in a temporary status without duties and pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501(2), 7511(a)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The indefinite suspension in this case is not based on any of these recognized bases. Instead, the agency has suspended the appellant while it investigates allegations regarding the appellant's off-duty conduct to determine whether grounds exist to take "an administrative action."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice of proposed indefinite suspension issued to the appellant states the agency's belief that OPM's regulations set forth a standard applicable to indefinite suspensions, and that the standard is satisfied under the circumstances of this case. Specifically, the notice states that "[u]nder [OPM's] regulations, indefinite suspensions can be effected pending criminal proceedings or administrative inquiry, under certain other circumstances in which an agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public. For the following reasons, we find that OPM's regulations do not set forth this standard for imposing an indefinite suspension or authorize an indefinite suspension on the grounds asserted by the agency in this case.</p>

In its revised regulations, OPM has added a fourth usage of the term "indefinite suspension" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.403(a), which provides, "An agency may take an adverse action, including...an indefinite suspension, under this subpart only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." 5 C.F.R. part 752, note (2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, OPM's regulations do not purport to authorize indefinite suspensions "pending criminal proceedings or administrative inquiry, under certain other circumstances in which an agency <span class="Italic">believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public</span>," as the agency claims here. The only regulation in part 752 containing language even remotely similar to this italicized language is contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(3), which generally mandates that an agency retain an employee in a <span class="Italic">paid</span> duty status during the advance notice period prior to taking an adverse action. That regulation sets forth alternatives an agency may employ "[i]n those rare circumstances where the agency determines that the employee's continued presence in the workplace during the notice period may pose a threat to the employee or others, result in loss of or damage to Government property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Government interests." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(3) (2009); <span class="Italic">accord</span> revised version <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 C.F.R. part 752, note (2010). Suspending an employee, definitely or indefinitely, is not one of the stated alternatives, and, except in one special circumstance not applicable here, the agency must retain the employee in a <span class="Italic">paid</span> status during the "advance notice period" even in these "rare circumstances."[12] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(3)(i)-(iv) (2009); <span class="Italic">accord</span> revised version <span class="Italic">codified at</span> 5 C.F.R. part 752, note (2010). Thus, this regulation provides no support for the agency's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12] The limited exception is when an employee has absented himself from the worksite without requesting leave and the agency carries the employee in a leave without pay status. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(3)(ii) (2009). As a general rule, an employee who voluntarily absents himself from the workplace is deemed not to have been subjected to a suspension appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75. <span class="Italic">E.g., Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the above-quoted language in the agency's proposal notice does not appear in 5 C.F.R. part 752, similar language did at one time appear in OPM's regulations related to an agency's obligation to file for disability retirement on behalf of an employee, i.e. former 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206 (1984). That regulation provided that, as a general rule, when an agency filed an application for disability retirement on behalf of an employee, the agency was required to retain the employee in an active duty status, except that the agency could, based on medical evidence, place the employee on leave with the employee's consent, or without the employee's consent "when the circumstances are such that his/her retention in an active duty status may result in damage to Government property, or may be detrimental to the interests of the Government, or injurious to the employee, his/her fellow workers, or the general public." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206 (1984).[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13] OPM amended this regulation in early 1984. 49 Fed. Reg. 1321, 1331-32 (Jan. 11, 1984). Under current disability retirement regulations, the agency must actually separate an employee before OPM will consider an agency's application for an employee's disability retirement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1205(a)(1), (c)(1) (2010). Thus, OPM's disability retirement regulations no longer prescribe situations in which the agency may be excused from the general rule that an employee be kept on active duty while an agency-filed application for disability retirement is pending, which was the issue addressed in the prior regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration,</span> 756 F.2d 86, 89 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal Circuit discussed this former regulation, which was then in effect, in deciding that federal employees had the right to file an appeal with the Board regarding an "enforced leave" suspension of that type. However, we decline to consider this discussion in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> as implicitly authorizing a suspension on the basis charged by the agency here, given that it concerns a regulation that no longer exists, and was based on a claim that the employee was medically unfit for duty--a claim which is not at issue here.[14] In addition, we note that the court's decision upholding the suspension in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> was based on more than the mere existence of an inquiry into allegations of medical unfitness, and instead including a finding that the agency met its burden with medical evidence establishing the existence of a medical disorder and evidence that the disorder had actually manifested itself in several instances of inappropriate, disruptive, or threatening behavior in the workplace. 756 F.2d at 90. In contrast, the agency has charged the appellant in this matter only with being the subject of allegations that are under investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14] <span class="Italic">But cf. Engdahl v. Department of the Navy,</span> 900 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (broadly stating that <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 756 F.2d at 89, "held" that suspensions were "authorized and reviewable" in certain circumstances, without mentioning the particular medical circumstances at issue in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the Board has previously relied on the court's discussion of the former disability retirement regulations in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> for the proposition that "indefinite suspensions can be effected, pending criminal proceedings or agency inquiry, <span class="Italic">under certain other circumstances</span> in which an agency believes that the employee's retention on active duty could result in damage to Federal property, be detrimental to government interests, or be injurious to the employee, his fellow workers, or the public." <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Navy,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 680, 689 (emphasis added), <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons.,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 607 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992). As explained above, the "certain...circumstances" surrounding the pending inquiry in <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> however, are not present here. Moreover, the particular "circumstance" the Board was addressing in <span class="Italic">Jones</span> was an indefinite suspension taken after the agency suspended an employee's required access to classified information, which is also not an issue here. 48 M.S.P.R. at 682-84, 687-91. The agency has not identified, and we are unaware of, any legal authority establishing that the mere existence of an agency investigation or inquiry into allegations of misconduct constitutes a circumstance justifying, or cause for imposing, a suspension under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Cf. Martin v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. 12, 21 (1982) ("[A]n investigation should not <span class="Italic">per se</span> form the basis for an indefinite suspension....") (<span class="Italic">see supra</span> n.7 for subsequent case history). Further, the type of investigation allegedly being conducted by the agency in the instant matter is substantially different from the types of investigations or inquiries that the Board and its reviewing court have previously recognized could constitute "cause" for indefinite suspensions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">See supra,</span> &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For instance, the Board has previously recognized that special concerns arise when there is reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. <span class="Italic">See Martin,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. at 18 (noting that subjecting an employee to an administrative hearing while a criminal action is pending raises due process concerns and could prejudice the employee's defense in that trial.)[15] In such circumstances, the employing agency lacks control over the resolution of the criminal matter, and its ability to conduct its own investigation may be substantially impaired while criminal charges are pending. <span class="Italic">See Engdahl v. Department of the Navy,</span> 40 M.S.P.R. 660, 664-65 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In part because of the potential impairment of an agency's ability to conduct a thorough investigation in such circumstances, the Board has approved indefinite suspensions when the agency has reasonable cause to believe the appellant may have committed a crime for which he may be imprisoned, which may continue for a reasonable period of time after the criminal charges have been resolved to allow for a reasonable agency investigation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Drain v. Department of Justice,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 8 (2008); <span class="Italic">see also Pararas-Carayannis,</span> 9 F.3d at 957; <span class="Italic">Dunnington,</span> 956 F.2d at 1155; <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy,</span> 900 F.2d 1572, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1990). <span class="Italic">But cf. Perez v. Department of Justice,</span> 480 F.3d 1309, 1313-14 (finding that the "reasonable cause to believe" clause in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) is not a substantive requirement for imposing an indefinite suspension after at least 30-days notice), <span class="Italic">petition for reh'g and reh'g en banc denied</span>, 508 F.3d 1019 (Fed. Cir. 2007).[16]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15] The peculiar nature of such circumstances is recognized in the Reform Act itself, which contains a special procedural rule that applies only to circumstances in which there is reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16] Although there appears to have been, at least initially, some <span id="Page_2176"></span>potential for criminal prosecution in this case, the agency explicitly decided not to charge the appellant on the grounds that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime had been committed. Further, the agency's litigation position is that pending criminal proceedings were not the reason for its suspension, and neither the proposal notice nor the decision notice mentioned any obstacles to the agency's ability to timely complete its investigation. Thus, we make no finding regarding whether such a charge might have been appropriate here. <span class="Italic">See O'Keefe,</span> 318 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">Gottlieb,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. at 609.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, when an employee is medically unfit for duty, the length of the suspension is dependent, to a large extent, on the employee's diligence in pursuing effective medical treatment and/or obtaining a firm determination that he is fit for duty. The employee largely controls the pace at which he produces medical evidence establishing fitness for duty, and thus the length of the suspension. <span class="Italic">Compare Sarratt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 405, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10 (2001) (because the appellant initially failed to submit medical evidence that he could perform the duties of his position, the agency properly placed him on enforced leave based on physical inability to perform; however, the agency should have returned the appellant to work upon receipt of adequate medical documentation), <span class="Italic">with Norrington v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-13 (1999) (the agency properly continued the appellant's enforced leave based on physical disability because the appellant failed to submit medical evidence demonstrating his physical capacity to perform without endangering his health).[17]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17] Further, as discussed above, OPM s regulations explicitly authorized such a suspension, at least at one time. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18; <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 756 F.2d at 89-90; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1206 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case of indefinite suspensions based on the suspension of required access to classified information, it is true that the Board cannot review the underlying merits of an agency's decision to suspend or revoke access to such information. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988); <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Department of Justice,</span> 479 F.3d 1343, 1351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. at 689-91. However, that does not mean that such indefinite suspensions are based on the mere existence of an inquiry into allegations of misconduct, as the agency has charged here. Rather, they are based on the fact that required access to classified information has been suspended. The limited scope of Board review of the agency's "sensitive and inherently discretionary" determinations does not alter the nature of the underlying cause for the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, however, none of the foregoing special considerations are present. Instead, the agency has indefinitely suspended the appellant while it investigates whether it has strong enough grounds to take an adverse action against him for off-duty conduct. The underlying issues are within the Board's typical review authority, and the timely completion of the investigation appears to be largely within the agency's control.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency deciding official mentioned in his decision letter that he believed that the allegations against the appellant were "sufficiently credible. The agency's belief regarding the credibility of the allegations against the appellant is immaterial to our analysis, given the agency's charge. Notwithstanding the deciding official's remark, the agency plainly did not charge the appellant with committing actionable misconduct during the alleged incident on September 7, 2008. Further, the Reform Act generally protects federal employees from adverse actions based on mere suspicion or mere allegations of misconduct by mandating that adverse actions may only be taken for "cause," and by requiring an agency to prove the specific alleged "cause" by a preponderance of the evidence when an employee seeks review of the action by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a), 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Remy v. Veterans Administration,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 141, 145 &#x0026; n.2 (1981) (on appeal to the Board, the relevant standard is whether the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the charged misconduct occurred, not whether the agency reasonably concluded that misconduct occurred); <span class="Italic">see also Martin,</span> 12 M.S.P.R. at 21 ("[A]n investigation should not <span class="Italic">per se</span> form the basis for an indefinite suspension...."). The agency has failed to identify any valid statutory or regulatory basis for the proposition that it can preliminarily suspend the appellant based on some lesser standard of proof while it gathers additional evidence to support an action based on the underlying alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cox-Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 246, &#x00B6; 18 (2005) ("[T]he law does not permit an agency to place an employee on emergency suspension during the notice period of a removal and then effect a removal for the same act of misconduct"); <span class="Italic">Littlejohn v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 478, 481 (1984) (the agency could not effect both a suspension and removal action against the appellant for the same act of misconduct); <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 624, 627-32 (1981) (finding that, after the enactment of the Reform Act, "emergency suspensions" based on standards inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 were no longer authorized by law).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has argued that the suspension here "promotes the efficiency of the service," citing alleged governmental interests in effecting the suspension. Before the Board would reach such issues, however, the agency would first need to establish that there is "cause" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). If the agency fails to allege or prove that there is "cause" for action, the Board's inquiry stops there. <span class="Italic">See Holland,</span> 31 F.3d at 1121-22; <span class="Italic">Ray,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 54; <span class="Italic">Wilson,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 297; <span class="Italic">Capozzella</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. at 556-57; <span class="Italic">see also Pope,</span> 114 F.3d at 1147 &#x0026; n.2 (in an adverse action appeal, an agency must prove first that the charged conduct occurred and second that there is a nexus between that conduct and the efficiency of the service; only after an agency has proven that charged actionable misconduct occurred "may an agency rely on the presumption of harm to the efficiency of the service" applicable in certain situations). Because we find that the agency's pending inquiry into allegations against the appellant is not actionable "cause" as required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), the agency's arguments regarding the efficiency of the service are immaterial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's assertion that this suspension is authorized by <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 480 F.3d 1309, and <span class="Italic">Lamour v. Department of Justice,</span> 106 M.S.P.R. 366 (2007). The narrow legal issue raised by the appellant in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> was whether the agency was required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) to prove before the Board that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed in order to have its indefinite suspension action sustained on review. <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 480 F.3d at 1311-12. The court found that, although an agency must have reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed to take an action on a shortened notice period under section 7513(b)(1), the agency was not required to establish such "reasonable cause" to effect the appellant's suspension, which was taken on 31 days' notice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1313-14. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Perez</span> that excuses an agency from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) when imposing an indefinite suspension lasting more than 14 days.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also supra</span> &#x00B6; 12 (an indefinite suspension lasting more than 14 days is subject to the requirements of chapter 75, subchapter II). Because the panel majority deemed the appellant not to be raising any challenge that his suspension failed to satisfy the substantive criteria of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), the court did not have occasion to decide whether the mere existence of an open agency investigation of the sort at issue here satisfies those criteria. <span class="Italic">See Perez,</span> 480 F.3d at 1313-14; <span class="Italic">see also Perez,</span> 508 F.3d at 1022-23 (concurring and dissenting opinions regarding the denial of the petition for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (both noting the narrow scope of the legal issue decided by the panel decision in <span class="Italic">Perez,</span> 480 F.3d 1309).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lamour,</span> the Board specifically noted the requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) that an agency may only take an adverse action for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. 106 M.S.P.R. 366, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9. The Board reversed the appellants' indefinite suspensions because the agency's "insufficiently detailed" proposal letters violated the appellants' rights to due process, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10, and the agency failed to prove that it had any basis to believe that the employees had engaged in any improper behavior, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15. In reversing the indefinite suspension, the Board noted that it did not intend to "imply" that credible allegations of serious misconduct could never satisfy the "efficiency of the service" requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) in taking an indefinite suspension when there is no related criminal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 15 n.5. However, the Board did not explain the circumstances in which such a suspension might be appropriate, and this statement was unnecessary to the decision in <span class="Italic">Lamour</span>. Thus, to the extent that the Board implied that a suspension such as the one here might be consistent with law, the Board's statement was <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that we decline to follow in this case. <span class="Italic">See Cruz-Packer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In resolving this appeal, we hold only that the mere existence of the agency's open investigation into allegations regarding the appellant's conduct is not "cause" for taking an action under subchapter II of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 7513(a). We give no opinion on whether the agency could impose an indefinite suspension or other adverse action on some other grounds based on the facts of this case, constrained, as we are, to review this action solely on the basis charged by the agency. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., O'Keefe,</span> 318 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">Gottlieb,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. at 609.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a GS-12 Deportation Officer with the agency's Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in New Orleans, Louisiana. On March 16, 2009, the agency issued her written notice of its proposal to suspend her without pay indefinitely, pending an investigation by the agency's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) into an incident of alleged off-duty misconduct that occurred on February 24, 2009, which, the agency asserted, resulted in the appellant's arrest on charges of battery and criminal trespass. The notice stated that "these issues raise the possibility of criminal prosecution. However, this action is not being proposed based upon a reasonable cause to believe that you have committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be <span id="Page_2177"></span>imposed." The agency advised the appellant that she had been placed on administrative leave and would remain in that status pending a decision on the proposal. The appellant made a written reply to the indefinite suspension proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency may not indefinitely suspend the appellant merely because it has a pending investigation into allegations regarding her conduct.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The express basis for the action in this case is that the agency has an open investigation into allegations regarding the appellant's off-duty conduct, in order to determine whether grounds exist to take an administrative action. The agency did not charge the appellant with the alleged conduct; nor did it determine whether, in fact, the conduct occurred. Moreover, as noted, the agency specifically stated that it was not proposing the action based on the "crime provision" of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), i.e., based on reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recently considered whether an agency may, in fact, suspend an employee indefinitely pending investigation into allegations regarding the employee's conduct. In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010), the Board first noted that it and its reviewing court have only approved of the use of indefinite suspensions in three limited situations: (1) When the agency has invoked the crime provision; (2) when the agency has legitimate concerns that an employee's medical condition makes his continued presence in the workplace dangerous or inappropriate--pending a determination that the employee is fit for duty; and (3) when an employee's access to classified information has been suspended and the employee must have such access to perform his job--pending a final determination on the employee's access to classified information. The Board found that the Office of Personnel Management's regulations do not provide support for the position that an agency may indefinitely suspend an employee merely because it has a pending investigation into allegations regarding his conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17. The Board further held that an agency may take an adverse action against an employee only for "cause," that it must prove the specific alleged "cause" by a preponderance of the evidence when an employee seeks Board review of the action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a), 7701(c)(1)(B), and that there is no valid basis in statute, regulation, or case law for allowing an agency to preliminarily suspend the employee based on a lesser standard of proof while it gathers additional evidence to support an action based on the underlying alleged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 138, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-27. Concluding that an agency charge based on the mere fact that it has an open investigation into allegations regarding an employee's conduct is not "cause" for taking an action under subchapter II of chapter 75, the Board ordered the agency to cancel the indefinite suspension that it imposed on that basis. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case imposed an indefinite suspension against the appellant under circumstances virtually identical to those in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>. As noted above, it based its action solely on the fact that it was investigating allegations of misconduct by the appellant, and it made no determination that the appellant actually engaged in any misconduct. Like the action in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, therefore, the appellant's suspension cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another indefinite suspension was set aside in <span class="Italic">Mederos v. DHS,</span> NY-0752-10-0117-I-1 (NP 4/27/2011), when the basis for the agency's action was that the appellant was arrested and "was facing a criminal proceeding for felony assault":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318 (2010), the administrative judge properly found that the agency failed to show that, under the circumstances of this case, an indefinite suspension promoted the efficiency of the service. As the administrative judge found, the agency did not take the action under the crime provision of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) and it failed to prove that the appellant had a medical condition that raises legitimate concerns that the appellant's continued presence in the workplace is dangerous or that the appellant had access to classified information that was suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency assertion that this case is factually distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> is without merit. The agency asserts that, even though the agency did not rely on the crime provision to indefinitely suspend the appellant, it could indefinitely suspend him because he had been arrested and the appellant was facing a criminal proceeding for felony assault. However, the facts of <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span> and the facts of this case do not allow for the distinction that the agency asserts. In <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, the agency relied on the pending investigation of allegations that he had committed acts of domestic violence and "a criminal complaint executed by a police officer regarding the alleged incident." <span class="Italic">Gonzalez</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 2.</p>
