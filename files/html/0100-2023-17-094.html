<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-92"><span class="space">h.</span> Award Served by Email</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under FLRA's 2010 revisions to its regulations, service rules are set by the type of delivery of the award. 5 CFR 2425.2(c) (2022) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Methods of service of arbitration award; determining date of service of arbitration award for purposes of calculating time limits for exceptions.</span> If the parties have reached an agreement as to what is an appropriate method(s) of service of the arbitration award, then that agreement--whether expressed in a collective bargaining agreement or otherwise--is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. If the parties have not reached such an agreement, then the arbitrator may use any commonly used method--including, but not limited to, electronic mail (hereinafter "e-mail"), facsimile transmission (hereinafter "fax"), regular mail, commercial delivery, or personal delivery--and the arbitrator's selected method is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. The following rules apply to determine the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions, and assume that the method(s) of service discussed are either consistent with the parties' agreement or chosen by the arbitrator absent such an agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If the award is served by e-mail or fax, then the date of service is the date of transmission, and the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;If the award is served by more than one method, then the first method of service is controlling when determining the date of service for purposes of calculating the time limits for filing exceptions. However, if the award is served by e-mail, fax, or personal delivery on one day, and by mail or commercial delivery on the same day, the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions, even if the award was postmarked or deposited with the commercial delivery service before the e-mail or fax was transmitted.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 68 FLRA 1015, 1018 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting) ("Although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.2(c)(5) provides that an excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing when an award is served by email and commercial delivery on the same day, &#x00A7; 2425.2(c)(5) is prefaced by the following wording: '[t]he following rules...assume that the [methods] of service discussed are either consistent with the parties' agreement or <span class="Italic">chosen</span> by the arbitrator absent such an agreement.' And, in promulgating the regulations, the Authority stated that 'the Authority purposely drafted the proposed rule to leave to the parties (or, absent agreement by the parties, to the arbitrator) decisions regarding how arbitration awards will be served.' Therefore, the Authority's regulations leave it to the arbitrator--absent the parties' agreement to the contrary--to determine what is the official method of service. Section 2425.3(c)(5)'s "first-method-of-service" rule only applies when the arbitrator has not made such a determination.").</p>
<p class="noindent">When the arbitration award is served by email, the time for filing exceptions runs starting on the day of service even if the award is served on a weekend. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAIL Local 5 and DOD, DLA Texarkana</span>, 66 FLRA 704, 705-06 (2012) (reconsideration decision noting that an example contained in the FLRA <span class="Italic">Guide to Arbitration</span> is nonprecedential and nonbinding); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 70 FLRA 347, 347 (2017) (<span class="Italic">"</span>Parties to an arbitration may agree as to what method of service should be used to serve an award, and that agreement is controlling for purposes of calculating the time limit for filing exceptions. Here, the parties agreed that the Arbitrator would serve her award by email....When an award is served by email, the date of service is the date the email is <span class="Italic">transmitted</span> to the parties."). The rule clocking the time for exceptions from dispatch of an emailed award was strictly applied when the agency did not get the email but did receive correspondence that should have alerted it to email transmittal of the award, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Defense, DCMA and AFGE Local 2433</span>, <span class="blue"><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-80.html">70 FLRA 370</a></span>, 370, 370-71 (2018):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the Arbitrator served his award by both e-mail and regular mail on April 3, 2017. When an award is served by e-mail, the date of service is the date the e-mail is transmitted to the parties. Further, when an award is served by both e-mail and regular mail on the same day, the excepting party does not receive an additional five days for filing its exceptions, like it would if the award had been served solely by regular mail.[2] Applying these principles here, to be timely, any exceptions had to be postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, filed in person with the Authority, deposited with a commercial delivery service, or filed electronically through use of the Federal Labor Relations Authority's eFiling system no later than May 3, 2017.[3]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed its exceptions on May 8, 2017, five days after the filing deadline. The Agency argues that its exceptions were timely because it was only "actually served" the award by regular mail on April 3, 2017. In this regard, the Agency submitted declarations from two Agency representatives who declared that they never received the e-mailed award, and from an Agency system administrator who declared that a thorough search of the Agency's e-mail database demonstrated that the Agency never received the Arbitrator's e-mail containing the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's Regulations provide that the thirty-day clock for the filing of arbitration exceptions begins to run upon the <span class="Italic">service</span> of the award. In this regard, &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) states that exceptions to an arbitrator's award must be filed "during the [thirty]-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party." And &#x00A7; 2429.23(d) of the Authority's Regulations provides that the "[t]ime limit[&#8197;] established in...[&#x00A7;] 7122(b) may not be extended or waived."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining the timeliness of exceptions, the Authority, in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2145</span>, found that the union's exceptions, filed some months after the award was first served by the arbitrator by mail, were timely.[10] In that case, the union demonstrated that the original award was only served on the agency, and had never been served on the union. The agency did not forward a copy of the award to the union until three months later.[11] Since the award had never been served on the union by the arbitrator, <span id="page_1834"></span>the Authority found that the union's exceptions were timely filed relative to the date of service when the agency forwarded a copy of the award, three months later.[12]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, the Agency argues here that the award should be considered served by mail on April 3, 2017, because of how it was "actually served" on the Agency. We do not agree. Unlike the excepting party in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2145</span>, the Agency does not argue that the award was never served, but rather, argues that the mail method of service should control, over the e-mail method, because it did not receive the award by e-mail. But the Authority's Regulation is quite explicit, stating, "if the award is served by e-mail, fax, or personal delivery on one day, and by mail or commercial delivery on the same day, the excepting party will not receive an additional five days for filing the exceptions." When the Authority published the regulation, the Authority specifically acknowledged that one commentator requested that it include a "successfully-served" requirement in the new rule, but the Authority expressly rejected that request.[16] Instead, the Authority encouraged the parties to settle any concerns regarding how arbitration awards will be served, and to agree to a method of service.[17] This view is consistent with Congress' intent to promote the arbitration process and its finality by limited, expeditious review by the Authority.[18]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In deciding this case, we note that our Statute clearly establishes filing deadlines,[19] and, as noted previously, our Regulations provide that some of those deadlines--including the deadline for filing arbitration exceptions--"may not be extended or waived."[20] Enforcing these deadlines ensures that our Statute is applied in a manner that is consistent with the timely and efficient resolution of cases brought before the Authority.[21] Thus, to avoid any uncertainty, we caution that statutory provisions concerning filing deadlines--e.g., the thirty-day deadline for filing arbitration exceptions provided in &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute--will be strictly enforced.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In summary, because the Agency filed its exceptions five days after the filing deadline, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Decisions that follow must be read in the context of the regulations then applicable. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 63 FLRA 302, 303-06 (2009), overruling <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS,</span> 60 FLRA 966, 967 n.2 (2005), determined that as to awards served by email, the period for filing exceptions ran from the date of service by email unless there was a different agreement by the parties:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122 of the Statute, the time limit for filing an exception to an arbitration award is 30 days "beginning on the date the award is served on the [filing] party[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). The 30-day time limit may not be extended or waived by the Authority. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.23(d); <span class="Italic">see also United States Info. Agency,</span> 49 FLRA 869, 871-73 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The award was served on the parties</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award was not properly served on the parties because 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 of the Authority's Regulations do not authorize service of an arbitral award by e-mail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 of the Authority's Regulations does not address the method of service by an arbitrator on the parties</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the plain wording of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27, the provision applies only to "any party filing a document [under] this subchapter[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.11, an arbitrator is not a "party" in proceedings before the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2421.11. Consequently, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 does not apply to the method of service of an arbitrator's award on the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that the question of how an arbitrator is to serve his or her award on the parties is typically addressed informally between the parties and the arbitrator at or after the hearing, or it may be addressed in the arbitration provision of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works,</span> 314-315 (Marlin M. Volz and Edward P. Coggin, eds., BNA Books 5th ed. 1997). We further note that it is the function and responsibility of the arbitrator to determine procedural matters upon which the parties have not reached agreement. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 314; <span class="Italic">see also United Steelworkers of America v. Ideal Cement Co., Div. of Ideal Basic Indus., Inc.,</span> 762 F.2d 837, 841 (10th Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America</span>) (holding that matters of procedure lie solely within the discretion of the arbitrator). Therefore, unless the parties specifically limit the powers of the arbitrator in deciding the various aspects of the issue submitted to him, it is "presumed that [the parties] intend[ed] to make the arbitrator the final judge on any questions which arise in the disposition of the issue...." Elkouri and Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> at 517-18. As the Authority's regulations do not currently specify or limit the method of service of an arbitrator's award on the parties, and the evidence does not indicate that the parties placed any limitations on the method of service of the award, the Arbitrator had the option to select the method of service. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, even in forums that allow service by e-mail, the parties must consent to such service and that, in this case, the Agency did not consent to service by e-mail. In support of its claim, the Agency submits an affidavit, dated October 27, 2006, indicating that it did not consent to service by e-mail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, in arbitration proceedings, the manner in which an arbitrator serves his award on the parties is a matter typically addressed informally by the arbitrator and the parties. When the parties do not reach agreement on procedural matters, these matters are the responsibility of the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See</span> Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> at 314; <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America,</span> 762 F.2d at 841. Here, there is no evidence in the record that indicates that the Arbitrator was aware of any agreement or limitation on the method of service of the award. In this regard, the Agency's affidavit does not indicate that, at the time the award was transmitted, the Arbitrator knew that the Agency had not consented to service by e-mail. Consequently, as 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 does not cover the method of service of an arbitrator's award on the parties and, as the record does not show that there was an agreement or limitation on the method of service of the award, the Arbitrator's selection of e-mail as a method of service was within her authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> Elkouri &#x0026; Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span> at 314; <span class="Italic">United Steelworkers of America,</span> 762 F.2d at 841.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that in <span class="Italic">Department of Labor,</span> 61 FLRA 64, 64 n.2 and in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service., Washington., D.C.,</span> 60 FLRA 966, 967 n.2 (2005), the Authority construed the service provision of &#x00A7; 2429.27(d) to apply to the service of arbitration awards. To the extent that the Authority's decisions in those cases are inconsistent with the wording of the regulation, they will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;There is no violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that, if the Authority concludes that the date of service of the award is the date the e-mail was sent, then the Authority would be in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b) and (c) because it would have changed its regulations without providing the public with notice and an opportunity to comment. In support of its argument the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Alaska Professional Hunters Association, Inc. v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 111 F.3d. 1030, 1033-34 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (<span class="Italic">Alaska Prof. Hunters</span>) and <span class="Italic">Tunik v. MSPB,</span> 407 F.3d 1326, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">Tunik</span>). We find the Agency's argument, in this regard, unpersuasive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Procedure Act requires an administrative agency to publish notice of a proposed substantive rule in the Federal Register to allow an opportunity for interested members of the public to comment.&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 553(b) and (c). The rulemaking requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553 apply only to substantive rules. Substantive rules are those which effect a change in existing law or policy. <span class="Italic">Powderly v. Schweiker,</span> 704 F.2d 1092, 1098 (9th Cir. 1983) (<span class="Italic">Powderly</span>) (a rule is not substantive when it does not <span id="page_1835"></span>change any existing law or policy, nor remove any previously existing rights). Substantive rules create law, and usually implement existing law, incrementally imposing general, extra-statutory obligations pursuant to authority properly delegated by the legislature. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Alcaraz v. Block,</span> 146 F.2d 593, 613 (10th Cir. 1984). Interpretive rules are those which merely clarify or explain existing law or regulations. <span class="Italic">See Powderly,</span> 704 F.2d at 1098. Interpretive rules, general statements of policy and rules of agency organization, procedure or practice are exempt from the requirements of &#x00A7; 553(b) and (c). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b)(A).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Alaska Prof. Hunters,</span> the court found that notice and comment were required under the APA because the agency's action extended the coverage of a regulation to a group of individuals who until then had been exempt from its coverage. In <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, a case <span class="Italic">which</span> <span class="Italic">the</span> <span class="Italic">Agency</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">cites</span>, the court found that the MSPB violated the APA when it attempted to overturn a regulation which gave certain employees the right to file complaints when facing removals, or other adverse actions. The court found that to the extent that promulgation of agency regulations is subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553, the repeal of those regulations is also subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553. <span class="Italic">See Tunik,</span> 407 F.3d at 1341. In <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> the court further held that the exception in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553(b)(3)(A) did not apply to the revoked regulation because procedural requisites in manuals or handbooks for the removal of agency employee were substantive rules. <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> 407 F.3d at 1344. (citing <span class="Italic">Chrysler Corp. v. Brown,</span> 441 U.S. 281 (1979) (distinguishing substantive or legislative rule from interpretive rule)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is distinguishable from the cases cited by the Agency.&#x2003;Here, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Alaska Prof. Hunters</span> and <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> the Authority is not changing or revoking any existing law, regulation or policy. The clarification of the general terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 does not have an impact on any substantive right. <span class="Italic">Cf. Anderson v. Butz,</span> 550 F.2d 459 (9th Cir. CA 1977) (where the Agency's interpretation was found to have an impact on the substantive rights of a segment of the public). In contrast to <span class="Italic">Alaska Prof. Hunters</span> and <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> the Authority's clarification of its regulation here does not create any new obligations or deny rights to any groups of individuals. The Authority is merely explaining what the regulation already provides. <span class="Italic">See Powderly,</span> 704 F.2d at 1098.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that agencies are given deference when interpreting their own regulations. <span class="Italic">See R.I. Hosp. v. Leavitt,</span> 548 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2008) (courts defer to the views of the agency Congress has entrusted with relevant rule-making authority, affording considerable deference to the agency's interpretation of regulations promulgated under that authority). Moreover, the Authority's clarification of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 is consistent with the plain language of the regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2429.27; &#x00A7; 2421.11; <span class="Italic">see also Glover v. West,</span> 185 F.3d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("in construing a statute or regulation, [the court] commence[s] by inspecting its language to ascertain its plain meaning...[i]f we conclude that the terms of the statute or regulation are unambiguous, no further inquiry is usually required"). Accordingly, as the Authority is merely explaining what the regulation already provides, there is no need for notice under the APA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;There is no violation of due process</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that service by e-mail violates due process because due process requires adequate notice "so that a party may be afforded the opportunity to be heard. The Agency asserts that service must be reasonably calculated under all the circumstances to apprise the interested parties. In support of this argument, the Agency cites, among others, <span class="Italic">Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &#x0026; Trust Co.,</span> 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950) (<span class="Italic">Mullane</span>) ("[a]n elementary and fundamental requirement of due process...is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections") and <span class="Italic">Rio Props. Inc. v. Rio Int'l Interlink,</span> 284 F.3d 1007 (9th Cir. 2002) (<span class="Italic">Rio Properties</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the question of whether e-mail, as a form of service, complies with the requirements of due process, we note that trial courts have authorized a wide variety of alternative methods of service. For example, in applying Rule 4(f)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, some of the alternative methods of service that the courts have authorized include: publication, ordinary mail, mail to the defendant's last known address, delivery to the defendant's attorney, telex, and most recently, e-mail. <span class="Italic">See Securities and Exch. Comm'n v. Tome,</span> 833 F.2d 1086, 1094 (2nd Cir. 1987) (publication); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Islamic Emirate,</span> 2001 WL 1658211 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 26, 2001) (publication); <span class="Italic">Levin v. Ruby Trading Corp.,</span> 248 F. Supp. 537, 541-44 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (ordinary mail); <span class="Italic">Int'l Controls Corp. v. Vesco,</span> 593 F.2d 166, 176-78 (2nd Cir. 1979) (mail to last known address); <span class="Italic">Forum Fin. Group LLC v. Harvard College,</span> 199 F.R.D. 22, 23-24 (D. Me. 2001) (service to defendant's attorney); <span class="Italic">New Eng. Merchs. Nat'I Bank v. Iran Power Generation &#x0026; Transmission Co.,</span> 495 F. Supp. 73, 80 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (telex) (<span class="Italic">New England Merchants Nat'l Bank); Broadfoot v. Diaz,</span> 245 B.R. 713, 719-21 (N.D. Ga. 2000) (e-mail).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, in <span class="Italic">Rio Properties,</span> a case cited by the Agency, the court found that service by e-mail was reasonably calculated to apprise the defendant--an international corporation--of the action and afford it an opportunity to respond. In this connection, the court noted that the Constitution does not require any particular means of service of process, only that the method selected be reasonably calculated to provide notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See</span> 284 F.3d. at 1016-17 (citing <span class="Italic">Mullane,</span> 339 U.S. at 314). The court also noted that "[c]ourts...cannot be blind to changes and advances in technology." <span class="Italic">See Rio Properties,</span> 284 F.3d at 1017 (quoting <span class="Italic">New England Merchants Nat'l Bank,</span> 495 F. Supp. at 81); <span class="Italic">see also, Philip Morris USA Inc. v. Veles Ltd.,</span> 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19780, 8.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As courts have embraced advances in technology, and e-mail has become an acceptable method of service within the legal system, we find that the Arbitrator's selection of e-mail, under the circumstance of this case, was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See, e.g. Rio Properties,</span> 284 F.3d at 1017-18. Moreover, we find that, as the parties provided the Arbitrator with their e-mail addresses, the Arbitrator had no reason to believe that e-mail was not an acceptable method of communication. <span class="Italic">See Maclean-Fogg Co. v. Ningbo Fastlink Equip. Co.,</span> 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 97241, 6. In addition, we note that, here, there is no uncertainty as to whether the e-mail was received because the Agency acknowledged receipt of the e-mail with the attached award. Also, the record indicates that on June 23, 2006, the Union sent an e-mail to the Agency calling its attention to the Arbitrator's e-mail with the attached award and to the fact that the Arbitrator had included a "new certificate of service so [that the Agency] would have a new 30 days to appeal." Consequently, as the record demonstrates that the Agency received the award, we find that the Agency had sufficient notice and ample opportunity to file its exceptions. Therefore, the Agency has not demonstrated that it was denied due process.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we find that the Agency has failed to show that service of the Arbitrator's award by e-mail was not an adequate form of service. Consequently, the Arbitrator's award was properly served on the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The date of service is the date the award was transmitted by e-mail</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that in the event that the Authority concludes that the award was properly served on the parties, the date of service should be the date it gained actual notice of the award, June 22, 2006, rather than the day the Arbitrator transmitted the award, June 21, 2006.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that in determining the timeliness of exceptions, it is the date of service--not the date of receipt of the award--that controls. <span class="Italic">See e.g. AFGE, Local 2401,</span> 58 FLRA 1 (2002) (<span class="Italic">AFGE,</span> <span class="Italic">Local</span> <span class="Italic">2401</span>). Also, in forums where service by electronic methods are authorized, the day of service is considered to be the date of transmission. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(E). In this case, the certificate of service contained in the Arbitrator's award specifically states that, on June 21, 2006, the Arbitrator's decision "was sent via electronic mail." Accordingly, the date of service of the award is June 21, 2006, which is the date certified by the Arbitrator as the day of service of the award. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 2401,</span> 58 FLRA at 1. We also note that the Agency does not dispute that the award was transmitted by e-mail on June 21, 2006.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As such, June 21, 2006 constitutes the date on which the 30-day time limit began to run. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b); <span class="Italic">see also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). In order to be timely, any exception to the Arbitrator's award was required to be postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, filed in person, by facsimile, or received by commercial delivery with the Authority no later than July 20, 2006. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2425.1(b), 2429.21(b), 2429.24(e). As the Agency's exceptions were filed with the Authority by mail (postmarked) on July 21, 2006, the exceptions were untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2554,</span> 63 FLRA 345, 346-47 (2009), also determined when the award was emailed and later placed in the mail, the date of the emailing started the clock running for the filing of exceptions. FLRA affirmed the result in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2554</span> on the agency's reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 2554</span>, 64 FLRA 807, 808-09 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The Authority did not retroactively apply a new rule when it dismissed the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Authority acted improperly when it retroactively applied a new rule concerning email service of arbitrators' awards to dismiss the Agency's exceptions. An assertion that an intervening change in the law affected dispositive issues is a ground for seeking reconsideration. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 375th Combat Support Group, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.,</span> 50 FLRA 84, 86 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support, the Agency asserts that at the time it filed its exceptions, the applicable regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27(b), did not authorize arbitrators to serve their awards by email.[2] The Agency further contends that when the Authority dismissed the Agency's exceptions, it relied on a new rule established in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">Woodlawn</span> that email service of awards by arbitrators is acceptable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27(b) states:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">Service of any document or paper under this subchapter, by any party, including documents and papers served by one <span id="page_1836"></span>party on any other party, shall be accomplished by certified mail, first-class mail, commercial delivery, or in person. Where facsimile equipment is available, service by facsimile of documents described in &#x00A7; 2429.24(e) is permissible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertions do not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of the Authority's Order. The claim that <span class="Italic">SSA,</span> <span class="Italic">Woodlawn</span> established a new rule permitting email service of arbitrators' awards was thoroughly discussed and rejected by the Authority in that decision. In <span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn,</span> the Authority clarified that &#x00A7; 2429.27, which lists the methods by which a party to a proceeding before the Authority may serve documents or papers, "does not address the method of service by an arbitrator on the parties." 63 FLRA at 303. The Authority found that &#x00A7; 2429.27 applies only to a party filing a document and that, because an arbitrator is not a party to a proceeding before the Authority, &#x00A7; 2429.27 does not apply to the method of service an arbitrator uses to serve his award on the parties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rejecting the claim that its clarification changed its regulations, the Authority explained: "[T]he Authority is not changing or revoking any existing law, regulation or policy.... The clarification of the general terms of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.27 does not...create any new obligations or deny rights to any groups of individuals. The Authority is merely explaining what the regulation already provides." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 304.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 60 FLRA 966, is misplaced. Contrary to the Agency's contentions, <span class="Italic">IRS</span> did not exclude email as a method of serving arbitrators' awards. Rather, because the Authority was able to decide the case based on an "earlier" service of the award by regular mail, the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> specified that it did not need to address the issue of service by email.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 967 n.2. In addition, although the Authority noted in IRS that email is not an accepted method of service under &#x00A7; 2429.27(b), it did not hold that this regulation applies to arbitrators' service of their awards. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, in relying on <span class="Italic">IRS</span> as authority for its decision to ignore the Arbitrator's service of the award by email, the Agency is relying on inapposite precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we reject the Agency's contention that reconsideration is warranted on the ground that the Authority retroactively applied a new rule when the Authority dismissed the Agency's exceptions as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Agency was not denied an opportunity to address the Authority's dismissal of its exceptions as untimely, based on the date the Arbitrator served the award by email.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that it did not have an opportunity to respond to <span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn</span>'s assertedly new procedural rule concerning arbitrators' service of their awards by email. An assertion that a party has not been given an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Authority in the decision is a ground for seeking reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB,</span> 50 FLRA at 86.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support, the Agency repeats its argument, discussed in &#x00A7; IV.A., above, that the Authority retroactively applied a new rule when it dismissed the Agency's exceptions. In addition, the Agency asserts that it did not have the opportunity to address the rationale the Authority relied on in its dismissal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These assertions do not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of the Authority's Order. As discussed in &#x00A7; IV.A., above, the claim that <span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn</span> established a new procedural rule is meritless.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency had a full opportunity, in responding to the Authority's Order to Show Cause, to address why its exceptions should not be dismissed as untimely based on the Arbitrator's service of his award by email. The Agency's complaint, that it did not have an opportunity to respond to the "legal rationale" that the Authority ultimately employed in dismissing the Agency's exceptions, merely reflects the Agency's disagreement with how the Authority resolved the issue the Agency addressed in its response to the Order to Show Cause. We therefore reject the Agency's contention that reconsideration is warranted on the ground that it did not have an opportunity to address an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Authority in its dismissal order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Agency's view that an arbitrator may not serve an award by email because email is not reliable does not raise an extraordinary circumstance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency argues in effect that arbitrators should not be allowed to use email to serve awards because email is not reliable. An assertion that the Authority erred in its remedial order, process, conclusion of law, or factual finding is a ground for seeking reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB,</span> 50 FLRA at 86.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support, the Agency argues that email service is difficult to verify and that because of the technology that supports email, "[t]oo much is outside the control of the recipient[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's views on email's reliability do not establish extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of the Authority's Order. The Agency does not present any information or explanation that substantiates its view of email's reliability. Thus, this Agency claim constitutes a bare assertion that the Authority's Order is in error, and we reject it on that basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, as the Authority explained in <span class="Italic">SSA, Woodlawn,</span> the method by which an arbitrator serves his award upon the parties is a matter for the parties and the arbitrator to determine. 63 FLRA at 303. This issue can be discussed informally between the parties and the arbitrator at or after the hearing or it can be addressed in the section of the collective bargaining agreement dealing with arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the Agency's concerns regarding email as a method of serving an arbitrator's award may be addressed within the collective bargaining relationship or during an arbitration proceeding. However, those concerns, even if not bare assertions, do not constitute extraordinary circumstances warranting reconsideration of the Authority's Order.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under regulations preceding FLRA's 2010 revisions, and presumably under the newer regulations, FLRA considers the language of the parties' contract and their course of dealing to determine, when an award is sent by email, whether the time for filing exceptions runs from the date that the award is mailed, as in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and UPTO</span>, 65 FLRA 131, 132-33 (2010) (overruled as to scope of remedy, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 3571</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-157.html">71 FLRA 798</a> (2020) (Members Abbott and DuBester dissenting in part)), considering an agency's response to an order to show cause concerning the timeliness of the agency's exceptions to an award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Order, the Agency asserts that Article 6.15 of the parties' CBA "limits the method of service to mail for arbitration awards." In particular, the Agency contends that Article 6.15 "clearly establishes the mailing of the award as the operative and proper method of service...." Moreover, the Agency asserts that the parties had an informal agreement that the award would be served "by mail" and that "mail would be the method of service for...the arbitration award." The Agency contends that the award was served on the Agency by mail on April 6 and that because its exceptions were mailed to the Authority on May 7, the exceptions are timely.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We note the Agency's claim that the Authority has allowed email service of arbitration awards in some cases without promulgating rules addressing that method of service. Agency Response to Show Cause Order at 3. We also note on July 21, 2010, the Authority issued its final rule clarifying the processing of arbitration cases, including email. <span class="Italic">See </span>75 FR 42283, 42290 (July 21, 2010) (&#x00A7; 2425.2(c) of the Authority's Regulations concerns the methods of service of an arbitrator's award, including e-mail). The new regulations become effective on October 1, 2010.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In arbitration proceedings, the manner in which an arbitrator serves his or her award on the parties is a matter typically addressed informally by the arbitrator and the parties at, or after, the hearing; alternatively, it may be addressed in the arbitration provision of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA Headquarters, Woodlawn, Md.,</span> 63 FLRA 302, 303 (2009) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Here, the Agency argues that Article 6.15 establishes mail as the method of service of arbitration awards. Article 6.15 provides, in relevant part, that an arbitrator's fee is reduced "for every day that the award is <span class="Italic">mailed</span> later than the date required in this article." This wording supports the Agency's claim that mail is the method of service for the award. Accordingly, based on the parties' CBA and the Agency's undisputed assertions that the parties had an additional, informal agreement that the award would be served by mail, we find that the record demonstrates that the agreed-upon method of service for the award was mail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record shows that the award was served on the Agency by mail on April 6; as a result, to be timely, the Agency's exceptions had to be mailed by May 10. Because the Agency's exceptions were mailed on May 7, they are timely.</p>
