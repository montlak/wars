<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-98"><span class="space">a.</span> Historical Development of Light Duty Analysis</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion that follows traces the light duty jurisdictional analysis, its derivation and deviations.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1988), involved employees of the Postal Service who, because of physical conditions, were given light work assignments pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement. They were placed in nonpay, nonduty status when the agency ran out of work for them to perform in the light duty assignments. The court affirmed the jurisdiction of the Board to determine whether the agency's actions were improper, based on analysis of the disputed factual issue of whether their was sufficient work for the employees to perform within their work restrictions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The analytical focus intensified as to issues involving light duty with and without a collective bargaining agreement in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 49 MSPR 21, 25-26 (1991), an unusual case because--unlike most of the appeals over constructive suspensions that involve the failure of the agency to provide due process protections to the employee--the agency followed statutory procedures to place the employee on nonpay status and the employee then filed an adverse action appeal. After Mr. Barnes, a letter carrier, developed medical problems, he was provided with temporary light duty work as a clerk, but he was not granted permanent light duty status under the Postal Service labor agreement. The agency issued him a notice of proposed denial of continued light duty and it then placed him, following his reply, into nonpay, <span id="Page_2092"></span>nonduty status until he was able to work without medical restrictions. The appeal contested the agency's action as a suspension. The Board determined that Barnes was constructively suspended, that he was given the proper procedural protection, and that the Postal Service proved that its action was substantively correct because it did not have work for the appellant within his medical limitations--the agency got it procedurally right:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Horner v. Schuck</span>, 843 F.2d 1368, 1376-77 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the court held that employees in light-duty assignments, who were placed in nonduty, nonpay status because of lack of work, were entitled, under their labor agreement, to a 40-hour week. Thus, the court held that placing them in such status constituted adverse actions that were appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In <span class="Italic">Maltzman v. United States Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 239, 242 (1990), the Board determined that the holding in <span class="Italic">Schuck</span> was limited to the situation where the employee was already in a light-duty assignment when placed in a nonduty, nonpay status. The Board contrasted that situation with one in which the agency denied an employee's request to be placed on light duty and the employee thereupon failed to report to his assigned position due to perceived medical problems. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board held that, in the latter situation, no appealable action had occurred. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge found here that, pursuant to the holding in <span class="Italic">Maltzman</span>, the appellant had not been subjected to an adverse action. Additionally, the administrative judge found that the agency's action was not a constructive suspension because it was not "disciplinary" within the meaning of <span class="Italic">Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), and <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 87-90 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985). We disagree. The court in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> expressly held that an agency's placement of an employee into a nonduty, nonpay status pending inquiry into his medical ability to perform his duties was "disciplinary" and thus constituted a suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7501(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The outcome in <span class="Italic">Maltzman</span>, as well as that in <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 136, 142 (1990), and <span class="Italic">Perry v. United States Postal Service</span>, 46 MSPR 456, 460-61 (1990), cases upon which the administrative judge also relied, hinged on whether the employee's absence from work had been voluntary on his part, or had been involuntarily imposed upon him by the agency. Here, although the agency was free to act as the agencies had in those cases, i.e., to deny, within its discretion, the employee's request for light-duty placement and to allow him to assume the duties of his former position if he chose to do so, it did not follow that course. Rather, the agency affirmatively placed the appellant into an indefinite, nonduty, nonpay status and stated that it would not end that placement unless the appellant were to demonstrate that he was medically able to perform the duties of his position. For this reason, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant here "never presented himself for work," is not dispositive of the voluntariness issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's formal placement of the appellant into a nonduty, nonpay status contingent upon his submission of evidence that he was medically able to perform, renders this case indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>. In <span class="Italic">Pittman</span>, at 599-600, the court held that an employee's placement into an enforced leave status, after the agency determined that he could not perform the full range of his duties due to medical restrictions, constituted an appealable suspension. Thus, we find that, by its terms, the agency's decision letter imposed an indefinite constructive suspension upon the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, in so suspending the appellant, the agency provided the requisite statutory procedures of 5 USC 7513(b). Moreover, the administrative judge found that the appellant conceded, on appeal, that he could not perform the duties of his Letter Carrier position, due to his medical restrictions. The appellant established no right to placement in a light-duty assignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, at 460 (denial of a request for light-duty placement is within the discretion of the agency). The administrative judge found that the agency proved that it did not have available work that was within the appellant's medical limitations. Based upon all of the above findings, we conclude that the agency's action was procedurally correct, and that the agency supported its basis for the action by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B). In <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> at 600, the court sanctioned an agency's suspension of an employee "pending inquiry" into his ability to work, so long as requisite procedures had been followed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following<span class="Italic"> Barnes,</span> <span class="Italic">Magno v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 466, 468-70 (1992), decided the Board had jurisdiction if the agency placed the employee on nonduty status through an adverse action proposal and decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that an employee's placement on enforced leave for more than 14 days, pending the agency's inquiry into the employee's physical ability to perform is a disciplinary action with the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The court has also held, however, that an employee who voluntarily absents himself from the workplace, even due to a valid medical consideration, has not been subjected to an adverse action when an agency simply carries him in a leave status that reflects this situation. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 21, 22, 25-26 (1991), decided after the initial decision in this case was issued, the Board relied upon the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> in holding that the agency constructively suspended the appellant when it issued proposal and decision notices that placed him in non-duty, non-pay status until such time as work within his medical restrictions became available or his medical restrictions changed to the point that he was able to perform work that was available. In reaching this conclusion, the Board distinguished cases, such as <span class="Italic">Maltzman, Perry v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 46 M.S.P.R. 456 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 937 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table), and <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 136 (1990), where the Board found that the appellants' absences from work were voluntary and, therefore, did not constitute suspensions. The Board stated that the agency in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> was free to act as the agencies in these other cases had done, by acting within their discretion and denying the employees' requests for light duty assignments and allowing them to assume the duties of their former positions. <span class="Italic">Barnes,</span> at 26. Instead, the agency chose to affirmatively place the appellant into a non-duty, non-pay status, stating that it would not end this status until the appellant demonstrated that he was medically able to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Board concluded that this affirmative formal action, contingent upon the appellant's submission of evidence that he was medically able to perform, renders the appeal indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pittman. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the present case is governed by <span class="Italic">Barnes.</span> As in <span class="Italic">Barnes,</span> the agency here affirmatively placed the appellant on non-duty, non-pay status, until he became able to perform available work, by issuing formal proposal and decision notices. Thus, under <span class="Italic">Barnes,</span> this action constitutes an appealable suspension. <span class="Italic">See also Brown v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 124 (1992). We, therefore, find that remand is necessary for further proceedings, including a hearing, and findings on the merits of the agency action as well as the appellant's allegation of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge should also determine whether the appellant was improperly suspended during the notice period of the action before us. Both parties stipulated that the appellant did not receive any pay during the notice period, and identified the appropriateness of this action as an issue to be adjudicated in this appeal. This matter should also be considered in light of the various cases discussed above, as well as the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 45 (1991), where the Board held that an employee's placement in leave status was not an appealable suspension where, even though the employee's absence was medically justified, it was not at the behest, or under the control, of the agency, or contingent upon the agency changing its mind. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 50.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal not involving the Postal Service, <span class="Italic">Marren v. DOJ</span>, 49 MSPR 45, 49-51 (1991), the jurisdictional issue was resolved against the appellant when the Board decided that it lacked the authority to resolve the appellant's claim to light duty under a collective bargaining contract. The appellant, a border patrol agent, was unable to work for a period of time as a result of an allergic or asthmatic condition that was found by OWCP to be work related. The appellant requested and was denied advanced sick leave or limited duty. When the agency placed him in AWOL status, the appellant claimed that he was subjected to a constructive suspension, a claim supported by a provision of his collective bargaining contract requiring assignment of available limited duty to work to a capable employee recovering from injury or incapacitation. The Board assumed a breach of the contractual requirement of a limited duty assignment, but found no constructive suspension within its jurisdiction. The Board reasoned, providing a limited view of its jurisdiction in appeals from the denial of light duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant...maintains that the administrative judge's finding that he was not ready, willing, and able to work is erroneous, because he did not "voluntarily" absent himself from work; rather, he was denied limited duty he had requested, and his medical condition did not permit him to work. He also claims that the finding that he was not placed in a non-duty, non-pay status against his will is erroneous because he did not refuse to provide requested medical documentation; rather, it was his doctor who refused to provide it. Third, the appellant maintains that he did contact officials with decision-making authority, <span class="Italic">albeit</span> to request limited-duty assignments, to which he claims he was entitled. Finally, the appellant maintains that the agency's requirement that he voluntarily use annual leave or LWOP although suffering from an OWCP-compensable illness, and its refusal to afford him limited duty, demonstrate that its action was disciplinary in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held in <span class="Italic">Martel v. Department of Transportation</span>, 735 F.2d at 507, that the criteria for determining whether a suspension exists are: (1) The agency must have <span class="Italic">placed</span> the employee in the suspended status, without duties and pay, against his will (i.e., the agency's action must be adverse); and (2) the agency must have done so for <span class="Italic">disciplinary</span> reasons. <span id="Page_2093"></span>To the extent that the Board also required that an employee show that he communicated his desire to return to work to an agency official with decision-making authority, the court held that to be erroneous and not required by law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, n.7. That inquiry, however, is relevant to finding whether the appellant was ready, willing, and able to work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for appeal, the appellant stated, "I have been denied contractually provided for light [<span class="Italic">sic</span>, limited] duty." In the initial decision, however, the administrative judge did not address the appellant's claim that he was entitled to limited-duty assignments pursuant to provisions of the negotiated bargaining agreement between the agency and its unions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Article 17--Health and Safety provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;The Agency agrees to provide safe and healthful working conditions, taking into account the mission of the Agency and the inherent hazards of the job performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">and, Article 20--Disabled Employees--provides, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;Any employee who has been injured or incapacitated and able to perform limited duty will be assigned to such duties that he is able to perform, when such duty is available, until he has recovered from the injury or incapacitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have therefore considered the appellant's contentions in light of the proper <span class="Italic">Martel</span> test for constructive suspension, and the relevance, if any, of the bargaining agreement provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the agency imposed a constructive suspension upon him. Although the appellant's failure to report to work was perhaps medically justifiable upon the agency's failure to assign him limited duty, it was nevertheless entirely voluntary and was not at the behest, or under the control, of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Caballero v. United States Postal Service</span>, 34 MSPR 263, 267 (1987). In addition, we find that the appellant's letter of September 15, 1989 clearly constitutes a refusal to provide medical documentation requested by the agency to support the appellant's request for an advance of sick leave. The appellant's absence was thus not contingent upon agency review, and his return was not dependent upon the agency's changing its mind. Therefore the appellant was not placed in a non-duty, non-pay status by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Maki v. United States Postal Service</span>, 41 MSPR 449, 456 (1989); <span class="Italic">Finn v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR 658, 662 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge correctly concluded that the agency's action was not based upon disciplinary reasons. The agency's stated reason for denying the appellant's request for limited duty was that it had "no light [sic] duty" at the Fabens Station. Since the appellant declined the option of properly requesting approved leave, the agency's action in carrying him in an AWOL status was a natural consequence of his decision. In short, we find that the appellant's situation was the same as that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Finn v. Veterans Administration</span>, 39 MSPR at 662; that is, his situation was the same as that of "any other employee who wants time off from his job and is told that he must request leave." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's belief that he was entitled to limited duty assignments notwithstanding, he failed to show that he was placed in a non-duty, non-pay status against his will for disciplinary reasons. Even assuming that the agency breached the agreement by denying him limited duty, the Board does not have jurisdiction over all actions that are alleged to be incorrect; rather, the Board only has the jurisdiction that pertinent statutes and regulations provide it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pledger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 325, 329-32 (1991), decided a few months after <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span> (and in an earlier decision, <span class="Italic">Pledger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 456 (1987)), did not explain precisely what obligated the agency to provide a modified job for the appellant (perhaps it was a labor contract obligation, perhaps the Board felt that it was a required accommodation, or perhaps the agency had voluntarily undertaken the responsibility). Whatever the triggering obligation, the Board expressed the necessity for the agency to communicate to the appellant the availability of work and the employer's potential liability for disability discrimination against a qualified disabled employee should it fail to do so:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although Mr. Matthews testified at the hearing on remand that, based on agency policy, he could not have denied the appellant work if he had presented himself for duty, and that he would have found work for the appellant to do, he did not further testify, nor is there any other indication in the record, that he ever communicated this information to the appellant. The administrative judge emphasized the fact that Mr. Matthews offered the appellant a Laborer position which he refused. However, although Mr. Matthews stated that he would have accommodated the appellant in that position because, as written, its duties exceeded the appellant's medical restrictions, he (Mr. Matthews) failed to respond when the appellant indicated to him that the position would have to be restructured before he would be able to physically perform its duties, and that he "looked forward to receiving (an) answer."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Howell, the appellant's first-line supervisor, testified consistently, as the administrative judge found, that there was work for the appellant to do, but, again, Mr. Howell did not further testify that he communicated this information to the appellant or otherwise ordered him back to work. Thus, neither Mr. Matthews nor Mr. Howell informed the appellant that he should report for duty or that there was Laborer work available that he could perform as an accommodation for his medical restrictions. In addition, the appellant came into the workplace on several occasions during the LWOP period to check on personal matters, and although Mr. Howell and Mr. Matthews both saw him, neither spoke to him to inquire about his status or to request that he to return to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the agency's failure to affirmatively inform the appellant that it had work for him to do, coupled with the contrary oral and written documentation that it provided to him reflecting that no work was available within his medical restrictions, we find that the appellant reasonably understood, during the time he was on LWOP, that there was no work available that he could perform within the scope of his medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find incredible the agency's claim before us that the appellant's leave was voluntary when its contemporaneous statements assert the contrary. This is not a situation in which an employee simply left the workplace unqualifiedly, in which case it would be incumbent upon him to notify the employer of a willingness to return to work. Here, by contrast, the agency seeks to reap the benefits of its own inaction in not responding to the appellant's request for accommodation within his medical restrictions, and of its failure to inform him that it had work available for him to perform. The agency attempts to excuse its inaction by shifting the burden to the appellant to offer to return to work. It is illogical to require an employee to take this initiative after being informed that no work was available. Nor is it significant that the appellant came to the workplace for personal reasons but did not inquire also about his reemployment prospects. <span class="Italic">Cf. United States v. Stoppelman</span>, 1406 F.2d 127, 131 (1st Cir. 1969), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 395 U.S. 981 (1969).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the period of enforced leave constitutes a suspension within the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. See Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (an employee's placement on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending the agency's inquiry into his physical ability to perform, is a disciplinary-type action within the Board's jurisdiction). It is undisputed that, in taking the action, the agency did not afford the appellant any of the procedural protections associated with adverse actions. 5 USC 7513(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding our reversal of the case on the merits, we must now address and resolve the appellant's allegation that, in placing him on enforced leave, the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his physical handicap<span class="Italic">. See Marchese v. Department of the Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 461, 464 (1987) (the Board must decide a discrimination issue in a case even if the underlying action is overturned on procedural grounds). Handicap discrimination is a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC 2320(b) which the appellant must plead and prove as an affirmative defense<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(2)].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A Federal agency is required to make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of a qualified handicapped employee unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program<span class="Italic">. Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151 (1988); 29 CFR 1613.704(a)<span class="Italic">. See also</span> 29 USC 794. Failure to make reasonable accommodation in accordance with this requirement constitutes discrimination on the basis of handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant always has the burden of persuasion in a handicap discrimination case, the burden of production of evidence shifts: The appellant must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination; the burden of production then shifts to the agency to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action and to demonstrate that reasonable accommodation would impose undue hardship on its operations; finally, the appellant must show that the agency's articulated reason is merely a pretext prohibited handicap discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Stalkfleet v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPR 637, 647-48 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of handicap discrimination. The record reflects that he has a long and persistent history of recurrent and continuous back pain, and that he has been placed on medical restrictions which include the avoidance of heavy lifting and excessive climbing, stooping, or bending. 29 CFR 1613.702(a). Thus, he has shown that he has a physical impairment that substantially limits one or more of his major life activities, specifically, working<span class="Italic">. See Clark v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 167 (1988). The appellant has further shown that his enforced leave was based on his inability to perform the duties of his position. Furthermore, by indicating that he might be able to perform the duties of the Laborer position offered by the agency if it were restructured, he articulated a method by which he believed the agency could reasonably accommodate his handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the agency has not met its burden of showing that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <span id="Page_2094"></span>In other words, the agency has failed to show that the appellant is not a qualified handicapped person<span class="Italic">. Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. A qualified handicapped person is a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others. 29 CFR 1613.702(f). Reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position in the agency, but it does not include accommodation that would impose an undue hardship on the agency's operation. 29 CFR 1613.704(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Matthews stated that he would have accommodated the appellant in the Laborer position. There is no suggestion that accommodating the appellant in that position would have imposed an undue hardship. Accordingly, because the agency has failed to show that its action was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, we find that the appellant has established his claim of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 23, 26-28 (1993), the employee was apparently permitted to work on limited duty until OWCP disallowed his claim. The appellant requested a continuation of light duty and the agency responded by stating it could not provide that assignment and that "[u]ntil such time that your limitations change or improve there is no work available for you." The issue was whether the employee was placed on enforced leave, within the jurisdiction of the Board, or whether his inability to resume regular duties was a voluntary status, beyond the jurisdiction of the Board. The Board concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, noting but not giving jurisdictional effect to a provision of the Postal Service collective bargaining agreement relied on by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that he (the appellant) absented himself from the workplace on his own volition, and refers to the agency's January 9, 1991 letter stating that "there is no work available." The appellant further states that, after his termination from his limited duty assignment, he continued to request a light duty assignment, that it was the agency that said that he could not perform the duties of his position, and that his being subjected to a physical examination constituted a "pending inquiry" under <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration,</span> 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir.),[1] <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985). We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;...The appellant has also submitted a copy of Article 16 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the American Postal Workers Union and the U.S.P.S. However, we find that it fails to support a basis for Board jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has held that an employee's placement on enforced leave for more than 14 days, pending the agency's inquiry into the employee's physical ability to perform is a disciplinary action within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 832 F.2d 598, 599-600 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">citing Thomas,</span> 756 F.2d at 89. The court has also held, however, that an employee who voluntarily absents himself from the workplace, even due to a valid medical consideration, has not been subjected to an adverse action when an agency simply carries him in a leave status that reflects this situation. <span class="Italic">See Perez v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 21, 25-26 (1991), the Board relied upon the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> in holding that the agency constructively suspended the appellant when it issued proposal and decision notices that placed him in non-duty, non-pay status until such time as work within his medical restrictions became available or his medical restrictions changed to the point that he was able to perform work that was available. Thus, the Board found that whether the appellant "never presented himself for work," as the administrative judge had found, was not dispositive of the voluntariness issue. In reaching this conclusion, the Board distinguished cases where it had found that the appellant's absences from work were voluntary and, therefore, did not constitute suspensions. 49 M.S.P.R. at 26. The Board stated that the agency was free to act as the agencies in these other cases had done, by acting within its discretion and denying the employee's request for light duty assignments but allowing him to assume the duties of his former position if he chose to do so. 49 M.S.P.R. at 25. However, the Board noted that, instead, the agency affirmatively placed the appellant in a non-duty, non-pay status and stated that it would not end this status until the appellant demonstrated that he was medically able to perform the duties of his position. 49 M.S.P.R. at 25-26. The Board concluded that this formal placement of the appellant in such status, contingent on his submission of medical evidence that he was able to perform, rendered the appeal indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pittman.</span> 49 M.S.P.R. at 25-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the present case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Barnes.</span> Although the appellant states that it was the agency's view that he could not perform the duties of his position, we note that the agency did not stop the appellant from assuming his regular duties when it terminated his limited duty position, although it implicitly recognized his belief that he was unable to perform his regular duties because of his injury. Similarly, the agency's letters of January 9, and March 25, 1991, which denied the appellant's light duty requests, did not order him to stay away from the workplace until he submitted evidence that he was medically able to perform the duties of his former position.[3] In stating that there was no light duty work available within the appellant's restrictions as outlined by his physician, these letters recognized the possibility that such work might be available if the appellant's condition improved. At no time did the agency order the appellant not to assume his regular duties or to stay away from the work site. <span class="Italic">Compare Marr v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 196, 201 (1991) (appeal remanded for separate determination of constructive suspension action, where the appellant alleged that the agency placed him on unpaid leave and told him not to report for work until further notice). Accordingly, we find that, unlike the case in <span class="Italic">Barnes,</span> where the agency placed the employee on non-duty, non-pay status by issuing formal proposal and decision notices, the agency did not affirmatively place the appellant in such status. Rather, as the administrative judge found, the appellant voluntarily elected not to report to work when the agency did not provide him with light duty. We therefore conclude that this action did not constitute an appealable suspension.[4] <span class="Italic">See Magno v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 466, 469 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;It is well established that the decision to deny an employee light duty is at the discretion of the agency and is not an adverse action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Perry v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our finding that the appellant's absence from work was voluntary is similar to our ruling in <span class="Italic">Maltzman v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 239, 242 (1990), where we held that the agency's denial of light duty did not render that appellant's decision not to report for duty an involuntary furlough.</p>

USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 34 (1994), <span class="Italic">post</span>), if the enforced leave claim is not within the Board's jurisdiction, neither is a related claim of discrimination, in Green's case, based on race and disability, because "the Board lacks jurisdiction over allegations of discrimination in the absence of an otherwise appealable matter."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Marren,</span> <span class="Italic">Green</span>, and <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> left jurisdiction at the pleasure of the agency, albeit at some risk of disability discrimination under <span class="Italic">Pledger</span> if the agency failed to provide light duty work to a qualified disabled employee. In <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, the agency provided due process protection and Board appeal rights--if the agency placed an employee on enforced leave or nonduty through adverse action procedures, there was jurisdiction. If, however, as in <span class="Italic">Green</span> and <span class="Italic">Marren</span>, the employee was unable to work in his regular job and was placed on leave without adverse action procedures, there was no Board jurisdiction over the claimed constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found the Board's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Green</span> unconvincing and wrote an (unfortunately) nonprecedential decision analyzing the interplay between light duty and enforced leave, still not mentioning the source of the agency's obligation (if any) to supply light duty work, but suggesting that there was a constructive suspension because the agency actually precluded Green from returning to regular duties without medical clearance, meaning the agency was essentially barring him from his regular job, irrespective of the availability of light duty, <span class="Italic">Green v.

Certain personnel actions, even though not termed "suspensions" by the agency, may remove an employee's duties and cause a loss of pay, thus producing the same effects as actual suspensions. These "constructive suspensions" are also within the jurisdiction of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Merit Sys. Protection Bd.</span>, 931 F.2d 853, 855 (Fed. Cir. 1991). The dispositive inquiry in determining whether an agency has suspended an employee is whether the employee's absence from the agency was voluntary or involuntary. There is no constructive suspension or other agency action appealable to the Board when an employee is voluntarily absent from work. <span class="Italic">Holloway v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 993 F.2d 219, 221 (Fed. Cir. 1993). Thus, to establish the Board's jurisdiction based on an alleged suspension, Green must prove that his absence from work was not voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Green relies on the diagnoses of an agency-appointed physician and of his personal physician who both advised him that his physical injuries prevented him from <span id="Page_2095"></span>returning to the full duties of his regular position. After terminating his light duty assignment, the agency directed Green to report for a fitness for duty examination on January 3, 1991. The agency appointed physician determined that Green's permanent condition, a back-disc problem which was not job related, prevented him from returning to the full duties of his regular position. Green's own physician certified that he was fit for light duty on March 3, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Green contends that his absence from work was not voluntary, but rather, was ordered by the agency when the agency denied his request for light duty work that would accommodate his physical limitations. The agency's letter of January 9, 1991 supports Green's contention. That letter stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We are unable to grant you a light duty assignment at this time due to physical limitations outlined by your physician. Until such time that your limitations change or improve there is no work available for you.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Upon improvement of your physical condition, please contact your supervisor in the event an accommodation compatible with your limitations exists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency denied another request by Green for a light duty assignment in a letter dated March 25, 1991, for the reasons stated in the January 9 letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's action denying Green a light duty assignment amounts to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board.[1] A reasonable person reading the agency's January 9 letter would conclude that Green would not be permitted to return to work with his current medical restrictions. A reasonable inference can be drawn that, had Green shown up at the work site, the agency would have sent him home on the basis that he could not perform the regular duties of his position and that no work which he could perform was available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The agency may have legitimate reasons for not providing Green with light duty work that satisfies his medical restrictions. This issue goes to the merits of Green's appeal to the Board which we do not address when reviewing a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">Pittman v. MSPB</span>, 832 F.2d 598 (Fed. Cir. 1987). In that case the employing agency placed the petitioner on enforced leave after determining that it could no longer retain him in a light duty position and that it had no other position which he was capable of performing within his medical restrictions. We concluded that this enforced leave was a suspension within the jurisdiction of the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600. This case is also similar to <span class="Italic">Barnes v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 MSPR 21 (1991), in which the agency placed the appellant in a nonduty, nonpay status until work satisfying his medical restrictions became available or his medical restriction changed. The Board found that the agency's action was indistinguishable from <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> and, therefore, amounted to a constructive suspension over which the Board had jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board attempted to distinguish <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> because the agency here did not formally place Green on nonduty, nonpay status as the agency had in <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the fact that an agency does not take formal action regarding an employee's status cannot control whether the employee's absence is voluntary without elevating form over substance. The agency refused to give Green work that he could perform even though Green requested such work. Certainly, Green's absence from light duty work was not voluntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board states, however, that Green's absence from regular duty work was voluntary simply because the agency did not place him on a formal nonduty, nonpay status list. This cannot be correct for two reasons. First, the agency, through its appointed physician, acknowledged that Green could not perform his regular duties. This acknowledgment is much more than simply "implicitly recogniz[ing] his belief that he was unable to perform his regular duties," as the Board characterized the situation. The agency held the same "belief" that Green was unable to perform his regular duties. It is nonsensical for the Board to suggest that Green had the real option of choosing to do work that two physicians stated he could not perform.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondly, the agency's letter of January 9 implies that the agency will not allow Green to perform regular duty work in his present condition when it states, "[u]ntil such time that your limitations change or improve there is no work available for you." The Board's conclusion that Green's absence from work was voluntary is not supported by substantial evidence because the only evidence of the agency's intent to allow Green to work is the January 9 and March 25 letters. These letters only support a finding that the agency would not allow Green to perform light duty or regular duty work, contrary to the Board's position that the January 9 letter "did not stop the appellant from assuming his regular duties when it terminated his limited duty position."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Taking the hint from its reviewing court, the Board remanded <span class="Italic">Green</span> for further adjudication at the regional level and then determined, <span class="Italic">Green v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 34, 35 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its decision, the court found that the appellant's absence from work was involuntary, and that the agency's action denying the appellant a light duty assignment amounted to a constructive suspension appealable to the Board, where the agency would not allow the appellant to perform light duty or regular duty work. Consequently, the court reversed the Board's dismissal of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and remanded the case to the Board for further proceedings consistent with its decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency violated the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process of law in taking this action because it did not afford the appellant prior notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond. Thus, we conclude that the agency's suspension action cannot be sustained. Since the administrative judge did not, however, consider the appellant's allegations of race and handicap discrimination below, we find that it is necessary to remand the appeal for adjudication of these issues.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A bar to the appellant's return to work without medical clearance to either regular or light duty was again treated as a constructive suspension in <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 126-28 (1994), determining that the dispositive jurisdictional issue is not the availability of work, but whether the agency or the employee initiates the employee's absence from work:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant's absence from the workplace was involuntary because, although the appellant had reported for work, the agency told him to leave and not to return. As we have indicated above, it is undisputed that the appellant appeared for work at the Coral Gables facility on September 30, 1991, and that Mr. Rodriguez refused to allow him to work at that facility. Further, as the administrative judge noted, the agency advised the appellant that, if he failed to update his medical information, he would not be permitted to work in either a light-duty or a regular capacity. On October 1, 1991, the appellant's treating physician stated that the appellant could supervise no more than 15 people. On October 5, 1991, the appellant requested indefinite light duty. The appellant was advised by letter of October 30, 1991, from James C. Walton, Postmaster of the Miami Field Division, that a light-duty assignment was not available and that "until such time as your limitations change or improve there is no work available for you." The appellant was further advised in this letter to contact his supervisor upon improvement in his physical condition "in the event an accommodation compatible with [his] limitations exists." It is evident, therefore, that the appellant's absence was involuntary because the agency initiated his absence. <span class="Italic">See Pledger v. Department of the Navy,</span> 50 MSPR 325, 328-30 (1991) (requiring an employee to offer to return to work after being informed that no work was available would be illogical). Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the agency suspended the appellant on September 30, 1991.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of the duration of the suspension remains. As we have noted above, the administrative judge based his finding that the appellant's suspension had ended on October 11 on evidence related to the availability of light-duty assignments on or after that date. The availability of work within an employee's medical restrictions may be relevant to the merits of an agency's decision to suspend an employee<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Mercer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 772 F.2d 856, 858 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (court found suspension proper in light of evidence supporting reasons for the action); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. General Services Administration</span>, 756 F.2d 86, 90 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985). It is not relevant, however, to the jurisdictional issue raised here because, in the absence of circumstances not present here,[6] it does not tend to show either that the agency placed the appellant on leave contrary to his wishes or that the appellant voluntarily placed himself on leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Finn</span>, 39 MSPR at 661-62.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Pledger,</span> 50 MSPR at 328-30, the Board's finding that the agency had suspended the employee was based in part on evidence that there was work available for the employee to perform during the time he was on leave. That evidence was relevant because the agency had informed the employee that no such work was available. Under those circumstances, the Board found that the employee's failure to offer to return to work did not cause his absence to be voluntary. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574-75 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (a retirement action is involuntary if the agency made misleading statements upon which the employee reasonably relied to his detriment). The present appeal differs from <span class="Italic">Pledger</span> in that there is no showing that agency misinformation regarding the availability of light duty caused the appellant's absence from work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 45 MSPR 136, 142 (1990), on which the administrative judge relied, includes a statement that, "[i]f...an employee presents himself for work, and the agency has work that the employee can perform within the scope of any medical restrictions that may exist, the agency's refusal to allow the employee to work and its action in putting that employee on leave status can constitute an appealable suspension." To the extent this and other Board decisions suggest that the availability of work in appeals such as this generally is relevant to the issue of jurisdiction, we hereby overrule those decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Finn</span>, 39 MSPR at 622 (reference, in decision finding appellant's leave voluntary, to agency's "prompt and reasonable efforts to locate another available position in which the appellant believed he <span id="Page_2096"></span>could satisfactorily perform," and to its "ultimate inability" to locate such a position). The dispositive question is whether the appellant or the agency initiated the absence. <span class="Italic">See Magno v. United States Postal Service,</span> 52 MSPR 466, 469 (1992); <span class="Italic">Barnes,</span> 49 MSPR at 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as noted above, the appellant was told to leave the agency's premises, and he was not told to return. Thus, the appellant was suspended for more than 14 days. We therefore find that the appellant's suspension constitutes an adverse action over which the Board has jurisdiction.[7] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Whether the appellant was "ready, willing, and able to work" is a back-pay, compliance issue and not a jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Vargo v. United States Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 49 MSPR 284, 286-87 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the agency, in suspending the appellant, provided him with none of the procedural protections of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). Nor did it provide him with any other advance notice or opportunity to respond to such a notice. Thus, the action violates the appellant's constitutional right to minimum due process, and it cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Pledger,</span> 50 MSPR at 330; <span class="Italic">Vargo v. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Postal Service,</span> 49 MSPR 284, 287 (1991); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672, 681 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rivas</span> left unelucidated the jurisdictional significance of the presence or absence of an agency policy, regulation, or collective bargaining obligation to supply light duty work to an employee whose medical restrictions precluded full-time performance of his or her regular duties. In <span class="Italic">Moon v. Dept. of Army</span>, 63 MSPR 412, 419-20 (1994), light duty that was provided was concluded (the case report did not state whether the light duty was provided gratuitously or otherwise), but the ensuing nonduty status was not within the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant was not precluded from returning to her regular duties, that is, the nonduty status was not imposed by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant contends that <span class="Italic">Pittman</span> is applicable in this appeal because the agency initiated the leave. The crux of this matter is whether the agency's October 3, 1991 letter terminating her light duty assignment instructed the appellant to cease reporting to work. In the first paragraph of this letter, Tolton stated that the appellant had been on light duty since April 12, 1991, because her medical restrictions prevented her from performing the duties of her position. The first paragraph also stated that, due to the lack of any other work that she could perform, she had been allowed to sit at a desk and answer the telephone. The second paragraph stated that the agency had reviewed all vacancies within the organization and had found none that were consistent with her medical limitations. The third paragraph informed the appellant that the agency would hold her proposed separation in abeyance pending a decision on her application for disability retirement. The fourth paragraph stated that, due to imminent staff cuts, many employees were in fear of their jobs and that accommodating the appellant by permitting her to answer telephones had had an adverse effect on employee morale. Further, the letter stated that the combination of the morale factor and the anticipated duration of the accommodation made it "infeasible to continue [her] in [her] current light duty status." In the fifth paragraph, Tolton stated that, effective October 7, 1991, the agency would be unable to provide her with light duty work within her restrictions, but that "I will, of course, approve leave for you." Finally, the last paragraph notified the appellant that she may be eligible for OWCP benefits and provided a contact for her if she wished more information, and informed her to contact Tolton if she had questions about the notice itself.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is immediately clear that the letter did not deny the appellant the right to return to duty. It simply told her that she would no longer be given light duty and that she could apply for leave or for OWCP benefits. In other words, the agency did not specifically bar the appellant from reporting to work and attempting to perform the assigned duties of her regular position. Rather, the agency offered her the choice of returning to her regular position or requesting leave and/or applying for OWCP benefits. Such a choice of unpleasant alternatives does not render involuntary her decision not to return to her regular position. <span class="Italic">See Connor</span>, 52 MSPR at 587; <span class="Italic">Finn</span>, 39 MSPR at 661-62. As the administrative judge found, although the appellant's failure to return to duty in her Engineering Technician position may have been medically justifiable, it was entirely voluntary and not at the behest, or under the control, of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant did not suffer an appealable constructive suspension and that the Board therefore lacks jurisdiction over her appeal of that matter. Because we lack jurisdiction over this appeal, we also lack jurisdiction to hear the appellant's allegations of harmful error and handicap discrimination raised in connection with such appeal....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The underpinnings of the constructive adverse action appeal based on denial of light duty status were summarized by <span class="Italic">McNamee-Marrero v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 487, 490-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (1999), tying the constructive suspension to either the employer's initiation of nonduty or nonpay status pending the employer's inquiry into the employee's ability to perform her own duties or to the denial of light duty allegedly available under an agency policy, regulation, or labor contract:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's absence for more than 14 days that results in a loss of pay may be a constructive suspension appealable under 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2) and 7513(d). Constructive suspension claims may arise in two situations. The first situation occurs when an agency places an employee on enforced leave pending an inquiry into her ability to perform. <span class="Italic">See McIver-Smith v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 464, 467 (1997); <span class="Italic">Gallegos v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 70 MSPR 483, 485 (1996) (for jurisdictional purposes, the key question is whether the agency or the employee initiated the leave). In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant voluntarily absented herself from work from February 6, 1997 through August 27, 1997, and that her absence during this period was not a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second situation that may result in a constructive suspension claim occurs when an employee who is absent from work for medical reasons asks to return to work with altered duties, and the agency denies the request. <span class="Italic">See McIver-Smith,</span> 74 MSPR at 467. If an employee who is absent due to medical restrictions requests work within those restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light duty work to such employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light duty work. <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 680, 692 (1996). Moreover, once an employee makes a non-frivolous allegation that she was able to work within certain restrictions, that she communicated her willingness to work, and that the agency prevented her from returning to work, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show either that there was no work available within the employee's restrictions, or that it offered such work to the employee and she declined it. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 693.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant claims that the agency constructively suspended her on August 28, 1997 when it denied her request to return to work with certain restrictions. Thus, her claim should be analyzed under the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 692-93. The administrative judge erred by not giving the appellant notice of the <span class="Italic">Baker</span> standard for evaluating her constructive suspension claim. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (an appellant must receive explicit information on what is required to establish jurisdiction). Therefore, we remand this appeal for further adjudication on whether the appellant's absence from August 28, 1997 through November 3, 1997 was a constructive suspension under <span class="Italic">Baker.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. MSPB</span>, 301 Fed. Appx. 935, 938 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP) (the appellant was properly denied a hearing on a constructive suspension theory: there was no policy, regulation or contract requiring alternative work for the appellant and he did not make an unconditional offer to return to his original position).</p>
