<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-195"><span class="space">3.</span> Successorship</h4>
<p class="noindent">Reformation of FLRA's occasionally unclear treatment of successorship issues arrived with <span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Eng'g Serv. Ctr., Port Hueneme, Cal. and NAGE Local R12-28</span>, 50 FLRA 363 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>), determining that if there is a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit, and the unit would promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of, the agency involved, and if a new employing entity is the successor to a previous one, an election is not necessary to determine representation rights of employees who moved to the successor when:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;An entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred and the transferred employees: (a) are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; and (b) constitute a majority of the employees in such unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;The gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;It has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 366-74:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents the Authority an opportunity to consider and address issues concerning the criteria and analysis for determining successorship in cases involving reorganizations.&#x2003;As noted in <span class="Italic">NFESC</span>, 50 FLRA at 32, it is unclear from Authority precedent whether and/or how successorship can be established in certain situations. As also noted in <span class="Italic">NFESC</span>, the likelihood that other reorganizations will raise these issues creates a need for further guidance. Indeed, briefs filed in this case emphasize that reorganizations affecting many employees and bargaining units have become commonplace in the Federal government and underscore the significance of the successorship doctrine. <span class="Italic">Cf. Fall River Dyeing &#x0026; Finishing Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 482 U.S. 27, 36 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Fall River</span>) (Court granted petition for <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>, in part, because of "the importance of the successorship issue in labor law[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The briefs filed by the parties and <span class="Italic">amici</span> in this case persuade us, for the reasons discussed more fully below, that the <span class="Italic">DOE</span> [<span class="Italic">DOE, WAPA and IBEW</span>, 3 FLRA 77 (1980)] doctrine previously applied to determine successorship should no longer be followed. The criteria for determining successorship must strike an appropriate balance between clarity and flexibility. In this regard, one of the purposes motivating statutory protection of, and authority for, collective bargaining in the Federal sector is to promote stability in labor-management relationships. <span class="Italic">See National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union v. FLRA</span>, 810 F.2d 295, 300 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("Congress...has...determined that collective bargaining contributes to stability in federal labor-management relations, and to effective and efficient government.") (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)). Such stability is not promoted by the current ambiguity in the approach to determining successorship. At the same time, it is impossible at this point to predict with any certainty all of the facts and circumstances that may arise in the contexts of reorganizations. To be useful, therefore, successorship criteria must be applicable in a myriad of unanticipated situations. The <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factors do not appear to be flexible enough to apply, as they must, to the types of organizational changes being undertaken in Government at the present time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the briefs filed in this case demonstrate the extent to which the existing criteria for determining successorship under the Statute differ from those that have been developed and applied in the private sector. Of course, there are obvious and fundamental differences between labor relations in the two sectors. <span class="Italic">E.g., Fort Stewart Schools v.

However, the differences that relate to successorship principles are neither numerous nor significant. Moreover, "as the legislative history of the [Statute] makes clear, the structure, role and functions of the Authority and its General Counsel were closely patterned after the structure, role and functions of the N[ational] L[abor] R[elations] B[oard] and its General Counsel under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA)," and "[i]n view of the clearly expressed intent of Congress to pattern the Authority upon the model of the NLRB, it is appropriate...to consider precedent developed under the NLRA in interpreting the [Statute]." <span class="Italic">Turgeon v. FLRA</span>, 677 F.2d 937, 939-940 (D.C. Cir. 1982).

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytic Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based upon our careful consideration of the Statute and the arguments presented, we adopt and will henceforth apply the following framework to determine whether, following a reorganization, a new employing entity is the successor to a previous one such that a secret ballot election is not necessary to determine representation rights of employees who were transferred to the successor. In particular, we will no longer follow the <span class="Italic">DOE</span> doctrine and, instead, we will find that a gaining entity is a successor, and a union retains its status as the exclusive representative of employees who are transferred to the successor, when:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;An entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred and the transferred employees: (a) are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; [4] and (b) constitute a majority of the employees in such unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;It has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">[4] Under section 7112(a)(1), a unit may be determined appropriate only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; and (2) promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of, the agency involved. The Authority makes determinations under section 7112(a)(1) on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region II, New York, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 1245, 1254 (1992) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>, <span class="Italic">Region II</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The First Factor--Characteristics of the Unit</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This factor, which modifies the first and second <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factors, states three requirements: (1) at least a portion of a recognized unit must be transferred; (2) the post-transfer unit must be appropriate; and (3) transferred employees must constitute a majority of the new unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the first and second <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factors, respectively, successorship depended on finding that a recognized collective bargaining unit was transferred "substantially intact" to a gaining employer, and that the appropriateness of "the unit" was "unimpaired in the gaining [entity]." <span class="Italic">DOE</span>, 3 FLRA at 79. The first factor has been applied in only two cases: <span class="Italic">DOE</span> and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration</span> <span class="Italic">for Children and Families, Washington, D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 247, 251 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Administration for Children and Families</span>). In both cases, an entire bargaining unit was transferred to a gaining entity. However, in <span class="Italic">Administration for Children and</span> <span class="Italic">Families</span>, in addition to the unit transferred entirely intact, a portion of another unit was also transferred. The Authority concluded that the first <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factor was not satisfied because the gaining entity did not "constitute a bargaining unit that was transferred substantially intact...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 251. To the extent that this application of <span class="Italic">DOE</span> can be interpreted to require that a unit transferred to a gaining entity encompass the predecessor unit exclusively, the doctrine could significantly restrict the number of cases where successorship is possible.[6] In particular, it would eliminate a finding of successorship where a unit, or a portion thereof, was combined with other employees after a transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Although the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">Administration for</span> <span class="Italic">Children and Families</span> relied on the first <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factor, it is consistent with the literal wording of the second <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factor, which focuses on whether the appropriateness of "the unit" is "unimpaired."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such a restriction does not similarly limit a finding of successorship in the private sector.&#x2003;Under the National Labor Relations Act, "successorship is not precluded because the entire bargaining unit is not transferred to the new employer." <span class="Italic">Hydrolines, Inc.</span>, 305 NLRB 416, 422 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Hydrolines</span>) <span id="page_194"></span>(footnote omitted). <span class="Italic">See also International Union</span> <span class="Italic">of Petroleum &#x0026; Industrial Workers v. NLRB</span>, 980 F.2d 774, 780 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Petroleum Workers</span>) ("The mere fact...that [the transferred] employees were drawn from a larger unit cannot defeat the successorship obligations that arose in this case."); <span class="Italic">Stewart Granite Enterprises</span>, 255 NLRB 569, 573 (1981) ("successorship obligations are not defeated by the mere fact that only a portion of a former union-represented operation is subject to...transfer to a new owner[&#8197;]"). Consistent with permitting successorship when less than entire units are transferred, private sector precedent requires only that "the acquired employees must be in appropriate units both before and after successorship." <span class="Italic">Petroleum Workers</span>, 980 F.2d at 780. <span class="Italic">See also Hydrolines</span>, 305 NLRB at 421-23. The portion of a unit which is transferred need not constitute a separate appropriate unit by itself, provided that the transferred employees constitute a majority of the post-transfer unit. In addition, there is no requirement that the portion transferred be "substantial."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no basis in the Statute, its legislative history, or the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">DOE</span> to warrant applying more restrictive requirements concerning the transferred employees in the Federal sector than in the private sector. Accordingly, we are modifying the first two <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factors and will no longer either: (1) require that a unit of employees be transferred "substantially intact" to a gaining entity which encompasses that unit exclusively; or (2) condition successorship on a finding that the same unit existed and was appropriate, by itself, in the predecessor and the successor entities (that the "appropriateness of the unit remains unimpaired"). Instead, successorship is possible even if only a portion of a unit is transferred, and a post-transfer unit may be found appropriate even if it has been expanded to include employees in addition to those transferred.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;It is clear that a union may be certified as the exclusive representative only of employees in an appropriate unit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111. Accordingly, there is no question that successorship may not be found unless, after a reorganization, the employees for whom recognition is claimed are in an appropriate unit. In addition, employees other than those transferred may be included in an appropriate successor unit only pursuant [to] the criteria set forth in section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, consistent with established accretion principles. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel</span> <span class="Italic">Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span>, 47 FLRA 602, 611-12 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Air Force</span>). In particular, additional employees must be integrated with those in the claimed unit. As is discussed in connection with the third factor, however, even in some situations in which additional employees may be included in an appropriate unit with transferred employees, an election may be appropriate to determine the representational rights of the employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we are recognizing that the transferred unit may be expanded to include other employees, it becomes necessary to address the requirement under the Statute that a union is entitled to act as exclusive representative only if it has been selected by a majority of employees in the unit. Since a finding of successorship under the Statute results in continued recognition, without a new, secret ballot election, successorship depends on the fact that the affected union is the choice of a majority of employees in the claimed successor's unit. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Defense Supply Agency, Defense Property</span> <span class="Italic">Disposal Office, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Maryland</span>, 3 FLRC 789, 802 (1975) (if successorship requirements are satisfied, then there "is no requirement that a new secret ballot election be conducted, since the election requirement...was already satisfied at the time the previous recognition was accorded"). In the private sector, the principle is firmly established that the majority of the claimed successor's bargaining unit must consist of unit employees of the predecessor. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. Jeffries Lithograph</span> <span class="Italic">Co.</span>, 752 F.2d 459, 464 (9th Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Jeffries Lithograph</span>) ("The presumption that the old union should represent the new workforce applies only when a majority of the new workforce once worked for the old employer."). <span class="Italic">Cf. NLRB v. Burns</span> <span class="Italic">International Security Services., Inc.</span>, 406 U.S. 272, 279 (1972) ("[A] mere change of employers...is not such an 'unusual circumstance' as to affect the force of the Board's certification...if a majority of employees after the change of ownership...were employed by the preceding employer."). Consistent with the foregoing, we conclude that this requirement should similarly be applied in the Federal sector successorship context.[8] Accordingly, although the post-transfer unit need not encompass the transferred employees exclusively, those employees must constitute a majority of the post-transfer unit.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;We also note that requiring that transferred employees constitute a majority of a claimed successor's appropriate unit is consistent with Authority case law concerning accretion. In particular, the Authority has held that even "a large number of employees who have historically resisted attempts at union representation" may be accreted into a bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 47 FLRA at 612. However, elections must be held "where the number of employees proposed for inclusion nearly equals or exceeds the number of employees in the existing unit[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">HHS, Region II</span>, 43 FLRA at 1255-56). <span class="Italic">Cf. Renaissance Center Partnership</span>, 239 NLRB 1247 (1979) (NLRB stated that it is "cautious" in finding accretion "when the accreted group numerically overshadows the existing certified unit....").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In cases where a claimed successor's operations are subject to a start-up period and, for example, the successor is gradually hiring employees, issues can arise as to the appropriate time for determining whether employees of the predecessor constitute a majority of the successor's unit. In these situations, the NLRB uses the "substantial and representative complement" rule for determining whether the successor's unit is sufficiently representative of the ultimate unit, in size and composition, so that it is appropriate to measure whether employees of the predecessor constitute a majority of the unit. <span class="Italic">See Fall River</span>, 482 U.S. at 47. <span class="Italic">See also Jeffries Lithograph</span>, 752 F.2d at 464 ("[W]e permit the Board to make a successorship determination when the new employer has achieved a 'substantial and representative' complement of workers.") (citation omitted). We note that the Authority has previously adopted the "substantial and representative complement" rule for determining whether and when to hold a representation election in an expanding unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center, Chesapeake, Virginia</span>, 34 FLRA 946, 951-54 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Second Factor--Characteristics of the Successor Employer and Continuity in Working Conditions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second factor set forth above requires that the claimed successor have substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity and that transferred employees perform substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions after the transfer.&#x2003;In this connection, the approach taken by the NLRB, and approved by the Supreme Court, "requires that the Board focus on whether the new company has...'continued, without interruption or substantial change, the predecessor's business operations.'" <span class="Italic">Fall River</span>, 482 U.S. at 43 (citation omitted). Stated more simply, the "focus is on whether there is 'substantial continuity' between the enterprises." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The inquiry emphasizes "the employees' perspective[,]" that is, whether the employer's operations, as they affect unit employees, remain essentially the same after the transfer. <span class="Italic">Petroleum Workers</span>, 980 F.2d at 779. <span class="Italic">See also Fall River</span>, 482 U.S. at 43 (Board focuses on, among other things, "whether the employees of the new company are doing the same jobs in the same working conditions under the same supervisors[.]").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This requirement in private sector labor law recognizes that there are situations where changes in an employing entity's operations are so substantial that successorship is defeated. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Radiant Fashions, Inc.</span>, 202 NLRB 938, 941 (1973) (NLRB concluded that hiatus in operations, evidence pointing towards a purchase of assets rather than an ongoing business, absence of significant carryover in customers, and differences in markets between predecessor and claimed successor indicated "an extinguishment of the continuity of...business enterprise[&#8197;]" so as to defeat successorship); <span class="Italic">Lincoln Private Police, Inc.</span>, 189 NLRB 717, 719 (1971) (where claimed successor did not purchase any of predecessor's assets or property, obtained its own operating capital, purchased new uniforms, vehicles, and equipment, and occupied different premises from those of the predecessor, NLRB found no successorship because there had been "a substantial and material alteration in the employing enterprise."). At the same time, the requirement of substantial continuity furthers the principle preserving a labor organization's status as exclusive representative in situations where changes in an employer's operations are not sufficient to question whether the union remains the choice of a majority of employees in an appropriate bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, noting the absence of any assertion to the contrary, and in furtherance of this same basic principle, that requiring substantial continuity in the employer's operations and in the employees' duties, functions, and working conditions is also appropriate under the Statute. However, recognizing that we determine successorship among Governmental entities, the requisite continuity in the Federal sector is better stated as a continuity in mission rather than in business enterprise. As in the private sector, we will not require that the missions of the predecessor and claimed successor be identical, <span class="Italic">see Fall River</span>, 482 U.S. at 46, n.11, and our approach will be "primarily factual in nature and...based upon the totality of the circumstances of a given situation[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Third Factor--An Election Is Not Necessary</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we conclude that the third <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factor continues to be appropriate, but needs to be modified to avoid the confusion it has fueled. The language in <span class="Italic">DOE</span>, providing that for successorship to be found, a QCR "may not be timely raised as to the representative status of the incumbent union[,]" is, as this case illustrates, susceptible to an interpretation that would preclude a finding of successorship based on the mere filing of a petition. The parties in this case agree, as do those filing <span class="Italic">amicus</span> <span id="page_195"></span>briefs, that the mere filing of a petition should not be sufficient to bar a finding of successorship. In particular, although an agency may file an RA petition to determine the impact of a reorganization,[10] it is not proper to view the mere act of filing an RA petition as sufficient to preclude a finding of successorship. Until the merits of a petition are reviewed, it is not possible to determine whether an election is necessary to determine representation matters following a reorganization. To permit the mere filing of a petition, without regard to its merits, to frustrate successorship would not effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute. To avoid this result, we restate the <span class="Italic">DOE</span> factor to focus on whether or not an election is necessary, rather than whether a document has been filed.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Section 2422.1(c) of Authority's Regulations provides, in relevant part, that:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">A petition seeking to clarify a matter relating to representation may be filed...where the activity or agency has a good faith doubt, based on objective considerations...that, because of a substantial change in the character and scope of the unit, it has a good faith doubt that such unit is now appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, whenever all of the three factors set forth and explained above are met, we will find that successorship exists and, as a result, the agency involved must recognize the exclusive representative of the employees in a former unit without a new, secret ballot election. Moreover, insofar as the new unit includes employees in addition to those transferred, they will be found, consistent with the foregoing, to have accreted to the unit.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;As noted previously, at note 7, established accretion principles are used to make such a determination. However, even assuming that a post-transfer unit that includes additional employees would be appropriate under the Statute, if such additional employees constitute a separate, appropriate unit, then an election may be appropriate to determine representational rights. <span class="Italic">Cf. Rinker Materials Corp.</span>, 294 NLRB 738 (1989) (self-determination election directed where, following a reorganization, single overall unit was appropriate but separate units of employees performing different functions were also appropriate); <span class="Italic">Melbet Jewelry Co.</span>, 180 NLRB 107, 110 (1969) (NLRB held that it would not, under the "guise of accretion," compel a group of employees who may constitute a separate appropriate unit, to be included in an overall unit without an election).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;Community of Interest</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the "RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters because the BOB and Execution Branch employees in Galveston do not have the same mission...or similar work assignments," and that the "nature of the work performed by BOB and Execution Branch employees is completely different." However, in its post-hearing brief to the RD, the Agency claimed that all DOC-Fort Worth employees (i.e., including the BOB and Execution Branch employees in Galveston) "share the same unified mission, are subject to the same DOC command structure, [and] <span class="Italic">have similar duties, job titles, and work assignments</span>."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2422.31(b) of the Authority's Regulations,"[a]n application may not raise any issue or rely on any facts not timely presented to the Hearing Officer or [RD],"and &#x00A7; 2429.5 likewise precludes consideration of "evidence, factual assertions, [or] arguments...that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the [RD] [or] Hearing Officer." "The Authority has held that &#x00A7; 2429.5 prevents a party from advancing a position in its application for review that contradicts that <span id="page_196"></span>party's earlier position before the RD or hearing officer." As such, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2422.31(b) and 2429.5 preclude the Agency from making this contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that the RD erred because the two groups of employees "do not have the same...chain of command." However, the RD acknowledged that "employees in the [BOB] in Galveston report directly to the [BOB] located in Fort Worth and are not supervised by [the local supervisor]."Accordingly, the Agency has not established that the RD premised his community-of-interest determination on a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, although the Agency states that the RD failed to apply established law and recites the appropriate community-of-interest standard, it does not identify which precedents the RD allegedly misapplied or explain how he misapplied them. The Agency does assert that it is "clear that the transferred employees...share a community of interest with the DOC employees in Fort Worth." But to the extent the Agency is claiming that an all-DOC-Fort Worth unit would be more appropriate, such a claim would not amount to a failure to apply established law because "what is required under the Statute is an appropriate bargaining unit, not necessarily the only or most appropriate unit."[43] As such, the Agency has not shown that the RD failed to apply established law when he concluded that the employees shared a community of interest.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;Effective Dealings</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the RD made a prejudicial factual error when he concluded that the reorganization "has had little practical effect on the way labor relations is handled by the DOC." More specifically, it claims that, because "Fort Worth DOC employees are not represented by a bargaining unit[,]...[the] effect upon the Agency will be substantial," and that it will be difficult for the Agency to maintain uniform procedures throughout DOC-Fort Worth. However, these assertions do not dispute any of the specific factual findings that the RD relied upon in reaching his conclusion that the reorganization's effect on DOC labor relations was not significant, and thus, do not demonstrate that the RD made clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.[46] Likewise, although the Agency asserts that the "first-line supervisor has no authority to negotiate or change working conditions or policies...at his location," the record supports the RD's finding that labor-relations issues are generally handled locally, with the involvement of the supervisor, and that the supervisor, therefore, "has some limited authority to handle labor[-]relations issues locally with [the Union]." As such, the Agency has not established that the RD based his determination that the unit would promote effective dealings on a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NLRB</span>, 62 FLRA 25, 36 (rejecting claim that RD made clear and prejudicial error concerning substantial factual matter when he found that division between two components "was '[i]n many respects...on paper only'" where agency failed to dispute facts relied on by RD in reaching conclusion) (alteration in original) (citation omitted) <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by NLRB v.

<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency argues that "[r]equiring the DOC to treat Fort Worth employees located in Galveston as if they were still on the Galveston payroll would create additional responsibilities to try and maintain uniform policies and procedures." It is unclear what the relevance of this argument is, as nothing in the Statute requires that the Agency keep the policies that apply to the Galveston-based DOC employees consistent with those of USACE-Galveston. Further, even if this factor does weigh against a conclusion that the unit would promote effective dealings, it would not mean that the RD failed to apply established law, as the test is whether all of the factors, taken together, weigh in favor of finding that the petitioned-for unit would promote effective dealings.[51] In this regard, the record supports the RD's conclusions that the DOC has experience dealing with the Union, that the administering personnel office continues to be the CPAC Southwestern Division, and that bargaining authority remains at the district level. Therefore, the Agency has not shown that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[51]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Commander, Naval Base Norfolk, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 328, 332-33 (2000) ("The Authority makes appropriate unit determinations on the basis of a variety of factors, without specifying the weight of any individual factors. It would be inconsistent with this practice to hold that changes in one factor...render[&#8197;] inappropriate an existing unit, without assessing whether and how those changes have affected the variety of other factors that are considered in assessing each of the unit appropriateness criteria." (citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;Efficiency of Operations</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency alleges that the RD erred when "he concluded that DOC employees are <span class="Italic">administratively</span> assigned to Fort Worth" because this "implies the reorganization was a 'paper transfer' only." The Agency claims that, in fact, the reorganization involved eliminating positions and changing the chain of command, and that it plans to fill future vacancies in Fort Worth. But because there is no dispute that, at present, the Galveston-based DOC employees are administratively (as opposed to physically) assigned to Fort Worth, the Agency has not demonstrated that the RD made a factual error in this regard. Further, because "unit determinations must reflect the conditions of employment at the time of the hearing, 'unless there are definite and imminent changes planned by the agency,'"[54] even if the RD had made a clear and prejudicial error regarding the Agency's <span class="Italic">long-term</span> plans to move positions from Galveston to Fort Worth, the error would not be substantial.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the RD erred when he concluded that the DOC's Galveston office operates largely independently from DOC-Fort Worth because the three BOB employees report to a supervisor in Fort Worth. But the RD acknowledged that this was the case, concluding "that this fact alone [wa]s not dispositive of whether the proposed unit rationally relates to [the] DOC's overall organizational structure." Therefore, the Agency fails to establish that he erred in this respect. Likewise, the Agency alleges that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial factual error "when he concluded that the existence of bargaining units in two other USACE Districts proves that the Agency would not be negatively impacted by dealing with a stand-alone unit in Galveston." But because the Agency does not argue that dealing with the other units has interfered with the DOC's operations, it is not claiming that the RD made a factual error. Rather, the Agency is merely challenging the weight the RD accorded the evidence, and "[i]t is well settled that disagreement over the weight that an RD has accorded certain evidence is not sufficient to find that an RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter."[58]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency asserts that it "will not be able to perform its operations efficiently if it has to concern itself with Fort Worth policies for DOC employees there and different bargaining[-]unit policies for BOB and Execution Branch employees in Galveston" and that "a stand-alone bargaining unit will result in additional costs, loss of productivity, and use of additional resources." However, because these assertions do not identify any factual errors, they do not establish that the RD made a clear and prejudicial error. Therefore, the Agency has not established that the RD relied on a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter when he concluded that the unit would promote the efficiency of Agency operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the forgoing, we conclude that a unit of all Galveston-based DOC employees is appropriate and, therefore, affirm the RD's decision and his order to certify the stand-alone unit of Galveston-based DOC employees. The existing USACE-Galveston certification shall remain in effect for non-DOC employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Application of the successorship principles of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> was demonstrated in a consolidation of an Army and Air Force units, each represented by a different union, into a joint base, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Joint Base Langley-Eustis and NAIL</span>, 66 FLRA 752, 752-57 (2012):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, prior to the Joint Base's establishment, NAIL represented one professional and one nonprofessional unit of employees at the U.S. Department of the Army, Installation Management Command (IMC), Fort Eustis, Virginia (Army Fort Eustis); and NAGE/SEIU represented one professional and one nonprofessional unit of employees at the U.S. Department of the Air Force, Langley Air Force Base (Langley AFB). As the result of a reorganization, both Army Fort Eustis and Langley AFB became component installations of the Joint Base. Employees at the Eustis installation (Eustis employees) and employees at the Langley installation (Langley employees) were administratively transferred to the Joint Base as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Acting on petitions filed by NAIL, the Regional Director (RD) determined that the Joint Base was the successor employer of a single Langley-Eustis unit of professional employees and a single Langley-Eustis unit of nonprofessional employees, and that NAGE/SEIU would represent both units....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that, after their transfer to the Joint Base, Eustis and Langley employees could continue bargaining in their existing units with their <span id="page_197"></span>existing exclusive representatives if: (1) the Joint Base was a successor to Army Fort Eustis and Langley AFB; and (2) the existing bargaining units continued to be appropriate following the reorganization and transfer. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 368).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the Joint Base was a successor, the RD found that the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> successorship test required her to apply the three appropriate&#8209;unit criteria in &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) (&#x00A7; 7112(a)). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 18 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Fleet &#x0026; Indus. Supply Ctr., Norfolk, Va.</span>, 52 FLRA 950, 959 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FISC</span>)). She stated that, under &#x00A7; 7112(a), an appropriate unit must: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the Joint Base; and (3) promote the efficiency of the Joint Base's operations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the community&#8209;of&#8209;interest criterion, the RD found that, since the reorganization: (1) the 633d ABW Commanding Officer sets conditions of employment and policies for both Eustis and Langley employees; (2) the ABW does not maintain separate personnel and employment policies for those employees; (3) the professional Eustis and Langley employees encumber the same or similar positions; and (4) the non&#8209;professional Eustis and Langley employees have the same or similar job titles and perform the same or similar work. The RD also found that the 633d Mission Support Group (MSG) provides installation&#8209;management functions at the Langley installation and certain installation&#8209;management functions at the Eustis installation, and also is responsible for all information technology at both the Langley and Eustis installations. In addition, she determined that installation&#8209;management functions that had been performed at Army Fort Eustis had been transferred from IMC to the 633d ABW of the Joint Base, and that, although at the time of the representation hearing, a different MSG--the 733d MSG--continued to perform some installation&#8209;management functions at the Eustis installation, its mission was to perform those functions to facilitate transition of Eustis installation&#8209;management work to the Joint Base. Further, the RD found that the ABW's mission is the same as the missions of the disestablished IMC at former Army Fort Eustis and the former Langley AFB operation that employed the NAGE employees. Moreover, the RD found that, since the creation of the Joint Base, both the Eustis and Langley employees are serviced by the same personnel office, and that areas of consideration for vacancies are at least Joint Base&#8209;wide. She concluded that "[t]hese facts, taken together," establish that employees in single Langley&#8209;Eustis units would share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to effective dealings, the RD found that, since the reorganization, the same personnel policies apply to the Langley and Eustis employees because the 633d ABW Commanding Officer sets conditions of employment and establishes policy for those employees. She also found that the locus and scope of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies is the same Civilian Personnel Office (CPO). Thus, she determined that single Langley&#8209;Eustis units "would enable the personnel authorities to deal with one unit each of professional and nonprofessional employees, instead of four units," and would thereby promote effective dealings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to efficiency of operations, the RD found that combined units "reflect[&#8197;], and bear[&#8197;] a rational relationship to, the operational and organizational structure of the...Joint Base." In this regard, she reiterated that the same entities administer personnel matters for both the Langley and Eustis employees, and that the 633d ABW Commander sets policy for all of them. As a result, she stated that employees at both sites are "integrated [because] personnel policy within the ABW is the same regardless of site within the Joint Base," and she concluded that single Langley&#8209;Eustis units would promote efficiency of operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the RD found that the former Eustis professionals and non&#8209;professionals have been integrated into the 633d ABW workforce and the ABW's personnel administration. She stated that, although the 633d ABW's establishment of the 733d MSG ostensibly contemplates some distinct operations by former Army Fort Eustis personnel, the 733d MSG's mission is to transition Fort Eustis personnel and facilities to the Joint Base. She further stated that with the creation of the Joint Base, the 633d MSG addresses the needs of these personnel with respect to computers, phones, internet, and other information technology, as it does for the former Langley AFB employees incorporated in the Joint Base, and that it provides contracting and acquisition services for the entire 633d ABW, including the Eustis installation. She then stated that, "[b]ased on the record as a whole,...the result of maintaining separate NAIL units would be fragmentation that is inconsistent with the integrated operations of" the Joint Base.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also found that the second prong of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> test--whether the gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity--was met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the third prong of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> test--whether an election was necessary to determine the transferred employees' exclusive representative--the RD found that Langley employees represented by NAGE/SEIU accounted for more than eighty percent of the membership of the Langley&#8209;Eustis professional and nonprofessional units that she found appropriate. Applying <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>, 56 FLRA 126, she found that NAGE/SEIU&#8209;represented employees were "sufficiently predominant" over NAIL&#8209;represented employees to warrant recognition of NAGE/SEIU, without an election, as the exclusive representative of both newly&#8209;formed Joint Base units. Thus, she revoked NAIL's certification as the exclusive representative of the Eustis&#8209;only professional and nonprofessional units, and she amended NAGE/SEIU's unit certifications to specify the Joint Base as the employer and to expand the certifications' coverage to both Langley and Eustis appropriated&#8209;fund employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not fail to apply established law or commit clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL argues that, in finding that the Eustis employees do not share a community of interest separate and apart from the Langley employees, the RD failed to apply established law and erred "as a matter of [f]act." We construe the latter argument as a claim that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Tyndall Air Force Base, Tyndall AFB, Fla.</span>, 65 FLRA 610, 614 (2011) (construing a party's arguments in its application as raising a recognized ground for review). We note that, where an application for review neither "provides...precedent" to support its arguments, nor "demonstrate[s]...a departure from...[or] inconsisten[cy] with...relevant precedent," the Authority has rejected arguments that an RD failed to apply established law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot.</span>, 61 FLRA 485, 493 (2006) (<span class="Italic">CBP</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a unit is appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a), the Authority considers whether the unit would: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the activity; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the activity. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a); <span class="Italic">see also FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959. A unit must satisfy all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961 n.6. Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Military Traffic Mgmt. Command, Alexandria, Va.</span>, 60 FLRA 390, 394 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring in relevant part, dissenting as to other matters). The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In order for a separate bargaining unit to be appropriate, the employees who would be members of that separate unit must have significant employment concerns or personnel issues that are different or unique from those of other employees. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 311, 315 (1999). Moreover, the employees at issue cannot be so integrated, either physically or functionally, with other organizational components that the establishment of a separate unit would cause undue unit fragmentation resulting in operational inefficiency or confusion in dealings between labor and management. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first appropriate unit criterion--whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--the Authority examines such factors as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'r Command, Se. Jacksonville, Fla.</span>, 62 FLRA 480, 487 (2008). In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 487-88.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, the RD relied on numerous factors in finding that employees in single Eustis&#8209;Langley units share a community of interest, and that Eustis employees do not share a community of interest separate and apart from Langley employees. Specifically, she found that: (1) the 633d ABW Commanding Officer sets conditions of employment and policies for both Eustis and Langley employees; (2) the ABW does not maintain separate personnel and employment policies for those employees; (3) the professional Eustis and Langley employees encumber the same or similar positions; (4) the non&#8209;professional Eustis and Langley employees have the same or similar job titles and perform the same or similar work; (5) the 633d MSG provides certain installation-management functions for both Langley and Eustis; (6) the ABW's mission is the same as the missions of the disestablished IMC at Eustis and the former Langley AFB operation that employed the NAGE employees; (7) the employees <span id="page_198"></span>are serviced by the same personnel office; and (8) areas of consideration for vacancies are at least Joint Base&#8209;wide. She determined that, as a result, the Eustis employees have been integrated into the 633d ABW workforce and the ABW's personnel administration, and "maintaining separate NAIL units would [result in] fragmentation that is inconsistent with the integrated operations of" the Joint Base.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL argues that the RD erred in finding that the groups of employees are serviced by the same personnel office.&#x2003;But there is record evidence that supports the RD's finding that the same personnel office--in particular, the CPO of the 633d Force Support Squadron (FSS)--services appropriated&#8209;fund employees at both Langley and Eustis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Tr. at 123 (personnel officer servicing Eustis testified that she was part of 633d FSS and that her satellite office was an "extension of the personnel office at Langley"). Thus, NAIL has provided no basis for finding that the RD made a clear and prejudicial error regarding a substantial factual matter in this regard. Further, NAIL does not cite any Authority precedent with which the RD's decision allegedly conflicts. <span class="Italic">See CBP</span>, 61 FLRA at 493. Therefore, this argument does not provide a basis for finding that the RD failed to apply established law or made a clear and prejudicial error regarding a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL also argues that the RD erred in finding that the 733d MSG and the 633d MSG perform the same mission, because the 733d provides support to Eustis and its soldiers, while the 633d has a much "broader" mission to Langley, Headquarters, and several other locations and their airmen. But the RD did not find that the 733d MSG and the 633d MSG perform precisely the same mission, and, in fact, she acknowledged that the 633d MSG provides some services that the 733d does not provide. Thus, NAIL does not demonstrate that the RD made a factual error in this regard. And, as before, NAIL does not cite any Authority precedent with which the RD's decision allegedly conflicts. <span class="Italic">See CBP</span>, 61 FLRA at 493. For these reasons, NAIL's argument does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law or made a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL's remaining arguments--that Eustis and Langley employees are geographically separated and have no interaction, that "similar facts" apply to the appropriated&#8209;fund employees as apply to the NAF employees, that Eustis employees perform some different functions and have some different positions from Langley employees, and that Eustis employees continue to have local access to certain services--do not identify any factual findings of the RD and, thus, do not demonstrate that the RD made clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters. To the extent that these arguments challenge the RD's weighing of the numerous community&#8209;of&#8209;interest factors, they do not provide a basis for finding that the RD struck the wrong balance. Further, once again, NAIL's arguments do not cite any Authority precedent with which the RD's balancing allegedly conflicts. <span class="Italic">See CBP</span>, 61 FLRA at 493. Accordingly, these arguments do not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law or made clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that NAIL has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law or committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters in connection with her community&#8209;of&#8209;interest determinations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated previously, a proposed unit must meet all three appropriate&#8209;unit criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 961 n.6. As we have found that NAIL has not shown that the RD erred in finding that the employees in NAIL's proposed Eustis&#8209;only units would not share a community of interest separate from Langley employees, NAIL's proposed units are inappropriate, even if the RD erred in her findings regarding the other two appropriate&#8209;unit criteria. Thus, we find it unnecessary to resolve NAIL's arguments regarding the RD's findings with respect to effective dealings and efficiency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that NAIL has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law or committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Established law does not warrant reconsideration.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL argues that Authority precedent contravenes employees' rights under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 and 7102 of the Statute to choose their representatives, and "ignore[s]" &#x00A7; 7112 "to create agency[&#8209;]desired units, or the largest unit, rather than...appropriate unit[s]," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 17. For these reasons, NAIL asserts that established law warrants reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the claim that Authority precedent contravenes employees' rights to choose their representatives, the Authority rejected similar claims in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Commander, Navy Region Mid&#8209;Atlantic Program Director, Fleet &#x0026; Family Readiness, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 64 FLRA 782, 784 (2010), which concerned competing successorship and accretion claims regarding a group of transferred employees. As stated there, the Authority has rejected the argument that "employees must always be given an opportunity to vote on which exclusive representative will represent them." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Human Resources Serv. Ctr. Nw., Silverdale, Wash.</span>, 61 FLRA 408, 412 (2005). For example, under basic accretion principles, employees who are accreted into an existing unit are included in the unit without having the opportunity to vote. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 963. NAIL's first claim provides no basis for reconsidering this well&#8209;established precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for the claim that Authority precedent favors larger units or units desired by agencies, the Authority has explained, in response to a similar contention, that the Statute requires a determination of unit appropriateness, and regardless of parties' preferences, a unit cannot be found appropriate unless it satisfies the &#x00A7; 7112(a) criteria. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Facilities Eng'g Command, Mid&#8209;Atlantic, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 65 FLRA 272, 276, 280 (2010). We have found that NAIL has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law or made clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters in applying the &#x00A7; 7112(a) criteria. Thus, NAIL's existing Eustis&#8209;only units are no longer appropriate, regardless of their size or their desirability to the agency. As such, NAIL's second claim provides no basis for reconsidering Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme,</span> a regional director considering a successorship issue must determine that the petitioned-for unit is appropriate (Prong I), and that a successor employer has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity and the transferred employees perform substantially the same duties and functions under substantially the same working conditions in the gaining entity (Prong II). But the gaining entity's mission need not be identical to the entity losing the employees. The gaining entity may have a broader mission than the losing entity. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Facilities Eng'g Command and AFGE Local 2010</span>, 57 FLRA 216, 218-19 (2001). If the regional director determines that proposed separate units involved in a reorganization do not share a community of interest distinct from the agency's existing units, she cannot properly find the proposed units appropriate and other statutory criteria need not be considered. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Facilities Engineering Command and AFGE Local 1415</span>, 70 FLRA 263, 266 (2017) ("Where, as here, it is alleged that the transferred employees should remain in their existing bargaining unit and retain their incumbent exclusive representative, the relevant community-of-interest inquiry is whether these employees share a community of interest that is 'different or unique' from the community of interest shared by the gaining organization's employees.").</p>
<p class="noindent">A reassignment of employees to a new office from a prior location may result in the application of successorship principles. In <span class="Italic">SSA, Kissimmee Dist. Office and AFGE</span>, 62 FLRA 18 (2007), to better serve beneficiaries, the agency established a new service office in Kissimmee, Florida. Until it moved to its new quarters, the Kissimmee office was located in the Orlando Office. The union, having represented a large number of employees in a consolidated bargaining unit that included the Orlando office, filed a petition seeking to clarify, without an election, that the new Kissimmee office was a successor employer and should be part of the unit of employees within the consolidated bargaining unit. The Kissimmee employees performed essentially the same work as those employees in other local offices. Labor relations were administered through a nationwide collective bargaining agreement. FLRA's regional director concluded that the creation of the Kissimmee office was a reorganization that fell within the successorship framework, so that a secret ballot election was not necessary to determine the representation rights of employees who moved to Kissimmee. FLRA affirmed that successorship criteria must be applicable in a myriad of unanticipated situations during periods of government reorganization. FLRA found no support for the claim of the agency that successorship may only occur when employees are transferring to an existing organization. Creation of the Kissimmee office involved restructuring and readjustment of workload. It was immaterial that employees going to Kissimmee volunteered to work there instead of being involuntarily transferred there. Nor was it significant that the employees who moved to Kissimmee occupied positions that did not fall within the express terms of an existing bargaining certificate. When FLRA determines that successorship tests are met, it orders that the certificate be amended to acknowledge representation of the employees acquired through successorship.</p>

Typically, the Authority has narrowly applied doctrines providing for the inclusion of employees in a bargaining unit without a self-determination election. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA at 1125 (the accretion doctrine is generally narrowly applied because it precludes employee self determination).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents a situation to which both successorship principles and the principle of employees' right to self-determination apply. Under the successorship doctrine, where employees transferred from a recognized <span id="page_199"></span>bargaining unit constitute a majority of the claimed successor's unit, employees other than the employees transferred from a recognized unit may become part of the successor unit as long as the unit remains appropriate with their inclusion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Port Hueneme, </span>50 FLRA at 370 n.7. In this regard, successorship situations will often involve previously unrepresented employees. Such unrepresented employees may include current employees of the successor employer when successorship conditions arise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, not only were the unrepresented non-nurse professional Omaha employees not included in the recognized unit that was transferred, they had been specifically excluded from that unit's certification. The record is silent as to the reason why the non-nurse professional Omaha employees were specifically excluded from Omaha's professional unit. Nevertheless, reflecting the importance the Authority has placed on the right of self-determination, Authority case law addresses that special circumstance. In particular, specifically excluded employees may only be added to a unit without an election "where there have been 'meaningful changes' in the employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances that eliminate the original distinctions between employees[.]" <span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus, </span>53 FLRA 1123-24 (internal citation omitted); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Langley Air Force Base, Va.</span>, 40 FLRA 111, 113, 117 (1991). This case law is pertinent in a successorship context because, under <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>, where successorship analysis must resolve the status of employees other than those transferred from a recognized bargaining unit, it must do so "consistent with established accretion principles." <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme, </span>50 FLRA at 370 n.7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, although a straightforward application of successorship principles would resolve the status of a predecessor's unrepresented employees transferred to a successor, the same cannot be said as to the unrepresented non-nurse professional Omaha employees in this case. Because Authority self-determination case law addresses their special situation, and because the RD did not resolve their situation consistent with that case law, we find that the RD failed to apply established law by determining that NWI is the successor employer of the non-nurse professional Omaha employees. For the reasons discussed above, successorship law cannot be applied to include the unrepresented non-nurse professional Omaha employees in the NWI professional bargaining unit, and they must be excluded from the NWI professional unit in the certification issued by the RD.</p>
