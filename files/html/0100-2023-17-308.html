<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-306"><span class="space">18.</span> Management Right to Discipline; "Just Cause"</h4>
<p class="noindent">Recall from the discussion of 5 USC 7121 and actions subject to statutory appeals that FLRA is statutorily divested of jurisdiction to review arbitration awards involving or related to adverse actions (removals, demotions, and suspensions exceeding 14 days) and performance-based actions (removals and demotions for unacceptable performance). Arbitrators may adjudicate those matters, and when they do so they are supposed to apply the same standards that the Merit Systems Protection Board would apply to the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648 (1985). Arbitrators' awards in those cases are reviewed directly in appellate court or through MSPB and EEOC and district courts if there are affirmative defenses of discrimination. As a result of the preclusion of FLRA review in adverse actions and performance-based actions, FLRA does not develop case law defining review standards for arbitration awards in those cases. [Refer to Broida's <span class="Italic">A Guide to Merit Systems Protection Board Law and Practice</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/mspbguide">Dewey Publications, Inc.</a> 2023).]</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reviews arbitration awards involving minor disciplinary actions, principally reprimands, suspensions of 14 days or less, and disciplinary reassignments. Because FLRA does not impose on arbitrators the substantive or procedural (harmful error) analysis used to adjudicate adverse and performance-based actions, arbitrators are generally free to decide the burden of proof, standard of procedural regularity, and substantive law to apply to grievances challenging minor disciplinary actions--subject to requirements of constitutional due process and the practical necessity of producing an award capable of review by FLRA. During the discussion that follows, references to "discipline" will, unless otherwise noted, be to cases not involving an action subject to statutory appeals. Although when arbitrators review major adverse actions--matters that are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the MSPB and the Federal Circuit (removals, demotions, suspensions of more than 14 days)--arbitrators apply the statutory and decisional standards governing MSPB adjudication, in disciplinary cases not involving major adverse actions, decisional standards for arbitrators are more relaxed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although FLRA maintains that because under 5 USC 7106(a)(2) nothing in the Statute shall affect the authority of an agency to take disciplinary action, no arbitration award may interpret or enforce a provision of a contract to deny an agency the authority to exercise its rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, <span class="Italic">PATCO and FAA</span>, 5 FLRA 763, 767 (1981) (a contract immunity clause), <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., El Reno FCI and AFGE Local 171</span>, 35 FLRA 329, 336 (1990), observed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority noted in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 30 FLRA 1156, 1162 (1988): "[A]rbitrators routinely resolve under the Statute and the Civil Service Reform Act grievances over whether disciplinary action was warranted and, if so, whether the penalty assessed was appropriate." Indeed, as the Authority indicated in <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 636 (1987), this is precisely one of the functions that arbitrators perform, and that Congress intended that arbitrators perform, under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">"It is well established that an arbitrator has the authority to determine that all or part of a disciplinary penalty is not imposed for just cause and to set aside or reduce the penalty. Specifically, an arbitrator's mitigation of a penalty does not interfere with management's right to discipline." <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed.

Misco, Inc.,</span> 484 U.S. 29, 37-38 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the award is contrary to its right to discipline.&#x2003;When an agency asserts that an arbitrator's award violates a management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects those rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Business Administration and AFGE, Local 2951,</span> 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). If it does, then the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.,</span> 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) <span class="Italic">(BEP).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> the Authority determines whether the arbitrator was enforcing either an applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span> at 153. Under prong II, the Authority determines whether the award constitutes a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the applicable law or contract provision at issue. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 154. In the instant award, the Arbitrator set aside a five-day suspension, thereby affecting management's right to discipline. As a result, it is necessary to apply the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to prong I, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's suspension violated Article 10, Section 14 and Article 62 of the CBA. The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator ignored Article 10, Section 2 of the CBA, which the Agency interprets as permitting it to bypass non-disciplinary remedies when deciding to discipline an employee for an operational error. The Agency also asserts that the Arbitrator interpreted the phrase "promote the efficiency of the service" in a way that permitted him to impose his own standards for discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has found that requirements that discipline be for "the efficiency of the service" are functionally identical to requirements that discipline be for "just cause." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1760,</span> 22 FLRA 195, 197 (1986). Further, the Authority has held that contract provisions requiring discipline for just cause constitute appropriate arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt. Md.,</span> 53 FLRA 1751, 1754 (1998) <span class="Italic">(SSA, Balt.).</span> As the Authority has held both that contract provisions requiring just cause for discipline satisfy the requirements of prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> and that provisions permitting discipline "in the efficiency of the service" are the functional equivalent of just cause requirements, the award in this case satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span> 22 FLRA at 197.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> the Authority has held that an arbitrator's enforcement of a just cause provision, by setting aside or reducing the disciplinary action, "operates in effect to reconstruct what management would have done had the provision been followed." <span class="Italic">SSA, Balt.,</span> 53 FLRA at 1754 (citation omitted). The Arbitrator's setting aside of the five-day suspension based on the "efficiency of the service" provision in the CBA operates in effect to reconstruct what management would have done if it had complied with the provision. Therefore, we find that prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">In a more comprehensive statement of the authority of an arbitrator to set aside discipline without infringing management rights, <span class="Italic">VAMC Birmingham and AFGE Local 2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 272-75 (1995), explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, management has the right to take disciplinary action against employees. The Authority has consistently held that an arbitration award setting aside or reducing a suspension does not impermissibly conflict with management's right to take disciplinary action when the arbitrator finds that the suspension was not for just cause under a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Navy, Naval Aviation Depot, Norfolk</span>, <span class="Italic">Virginia and International Association of Machinists and</span> <span class="Italic">Aerospace Workers</span>, <span class="Italic">Local 39</span>, 42 FLRA 322, 327-28 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Aviation Depot</span>). In these cases, the Authority did not consider or apply the approaches it had established to resolve exceptions to arbitration awards claiming that awards impermissibly conflicted with other management rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span> <span class="Italic">and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1122</span>, 34 FLRA 323 (1990) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Applying this precedent, we conclude, as discussed below, that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the parties' negotiated just cause provision does not impermissibly interfere with management's right to take disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> two-prong analysis was developed and is applied when an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a). 37 FLRA at 313-14; <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 199</span>, 37 FLRA 841, 846 (1990). The Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> that it would "examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights, and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right." 37 FLRA at 313-14. Applying this approach to the award in this case enforcing a contractual provision requiring just cause for discipline leads to the conclusion that the award is not deficient as inconsistent with section 7106(a)(2)(A). With respect to the first prong of the <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> analysis, the Authority has long held that contract provisions establishing general standards, including "fair," or "for just or specific cause," to guide the exercise of management's right to discipline constitute appropriate arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. As such provisions reserve to management the right to discipline employees for all conduct for which management can establish that the standards have been met, their enforcement does not abrogate management's right to discipline. Accordingly, under the <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> approach, the award in this case is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether a remedy ordered in an arbitration award impermissibly conflicts with a management right in other contexts, the Authority has required that the remedy reflect a reconstruction of what management would have done had it acted properly. <span class="Italic">E.g., SSA</span>, 34 FLRA at 328. We conclude that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the provision requiring just cause for discipline in this case constitutes such a reconstruction. Thus, where an arbitrator vacates or mitigates a disciplinary action taken in violation of a contractual just cause provision, that award operates in effect to reconstruct what management would have done had the provision been followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As this discussion makes clear, the application of the Authority's <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and reconstruction analysis in this case results in a conclusion that the award is not deficient. This result is, in turn, consistent with prior Authority decisions involving the arbitral enforcement of provisions requiring just cause for discipline. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Naval Aviation Depot; U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, New York District Office and American Federation of Government Employees, Immigration and Naturalization Service Council, Local 1917</span>, 42 FLRA 650, 657-58 (1991). As there is no basis in the Statute to apply a different approach to reviewing awards claimed to interfere with management's right to discipline than to reviewing claimed interference with other rights, we will henceforth apply the <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> and reconstruction precedent to determine whether an arbitrator's enforcement of a contractual just cause provision is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award is not contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In so finding, we reject the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Tinker AFB</span>, which did not involve an arbitrator's determination of whether a disciplinary action was for just and sufficient cause under a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Executive Office for Immigration Review and NAIJ</span>, 66 FLRA 221, 225 (2011) ("The Authority has consistently held that provisions requiring discipline to be for just cause, or to promote the efficiency of the federal service, constitute appropriate arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Army, Fort Huachuca, Ariz.</span>, 65 FLRA 442, 445-46 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Army</span>); <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 63 FLRA at 385 (citing <span class="Italic">Soc.

Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 53 FLRA 1751, 1754 (1998)).").</p>
<p class="noindent">Many contracts require "just cause" for the imposition of discipline of minor adverse actions--reprimands, suspensions of less than 14 days, disciplinary reassignments. That phrase is known to all arbitrators who resolve employment disputes. The nature of a "just cause" determination was explored in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 63 FLRA 241, 243-44 (2009), involving a three-day suspension grievance:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority has recognized, the enforcement of a contractual just cause standard presents two questions: whether discipline was warranted, and if so, whether the penalty assessed was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization</span> <span class="Italic">Serv., New York Dist. Office</span>, 42 FLRA 650, 658 (1991). Here, the Arbitrator's determination that discipline was warranted is not disputed. Rather, the Agency challenges the Arbitrator's assessment of the penalty, claiming that the award fails to draw its essence from the agreement. In doing so, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">SSA, Lansing, </span>58 FLRA 93, and <span class="Italic">SSA, St. Paul, </span>61 FLRA 92, two cases in which arbitration awards were found deficient on essence grounds because the arbitrators did not administer disciplinary action consistent with the parties' agreements. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Lansing, </span>58 FLRA at 95 (then-Member Pope dissenting) (award failed to represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement because, even though the arbitrator found that the agency had just cause to discipline the grievants, he did not administer any form of disciplinary action provided under the parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">see also SSA, St. Paul, </span>61 FLRA at 94 (then-Member Pope dissenting) (award exhibited a manifest disregard for the agreement where it imposed the least serious form of discipline possible under the parties' agreement in the case of a serious infraction and the agreement allowed management to bypass its progressive discipline policy in favor of more stringent discipline in cases of serious infractions). Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was not treated in a fair and equitable manner as required by Article 28, Section 1 of the LMA, and that thus, there was not just cause for the three-day suspension. In contrast to the cases cited by the Agency above, the Arbitrator mitigated the disciplinary action to a written reprimand, which is an allowable penalty under Article 28, Section 4 of the LMA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority applies a deferential standard of review to arbitrators' interpretations of parties' agreements, <span class="Italic">AFGE, </span>54 FLRA at 159, and the text of the LMA specifically provides for the mitigated disciplinary action that was ordered by the Arbitrator. Moreover, the Agency has not offered any evidence showing that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OSHA</span>, 34 FLRA at 575. As such, the Arbitrator's award is not deficient as failing to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. Rather, the Arbitrator's mitigation of the Agency's disciplinary action represents a plausible interpretation of the LMA, as a written reprimand is within the parameters of disciplinary action provided for by the LMA. Thus, the Agency's exception is denied.</p>
<p class="noindent">When a "just cause" clause is considered in conjunction with a disciplinary action, the arbitrator is presented with two questions: whether discipline was warranted, and if so, whether the penalty assessed was reasonable. <span class="Italic">SSA, St. Paul and AFGE Local 220</span>, 61 FLRA 92, 93 (2005), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 61 FLRA 256 (2005); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 53 FLRA 1751, 1754 (1998) ("just clause contract provisions are appropriate arrangements for the exercise of management's right to discipline"). Not all contracts use "just cause" language. There are no special phrases required. Some contracts speak of "cause" or "service efficiency," or employ other language as test of the fairness of minor disciplinary actions. If the action is one that could be appealed to the MSPB--removal, suspension of more than 14 days, downgrading or disciplinary reduction in pay, the statutory standards governing MSPB adjudication--"efficiency of the service" and all that phrase subsumes--apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">Starting in 2010, FLRA determined that it would not set aside awards based on alleged management rights infractions if the award applies a contractual arrangements clause unless the contract provision abrogates, as opposed to excessively interferes with, the management right, e.g., the right to discipline employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a> (2010) (Member Beck concurring). The approach starting in 2010 would result in less intrusive review by FLRA of awards challenged for infringement upon management rights, since it would be unusual that a negotiated contract provision completely prevented, as opposed to limited, the exercise of a management right. A shift in FLRA membership led to a shift of the law. The abrogation standard for assessing interference with management rights through arbitration awards returned to the "excessive interference" standard used in negotiability cases in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018).</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of application of the abrogation standard is in <span class="Italic">DHS, ICE and AFGE Local 1917</span>, 65 FLRA 529, 533-34 (2011), determining that a contract clause allowing for discipline of tardiness only if the tardiness is habitual did not abrogate, although it limited, the right of management to discipline employees for lateness:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, the Arbitrator's determination that Article 35, Section M of the parties' agreement only allows the Agency to discipline an employee for being absent if his absence constitutes habitual tardiness excessively interferes with management's right to discipline. Moreover, the Agency claims that, by interpreting Article 36, Section D of the parties' agreement to require that employees cannot be disciplined for failure to follow procedures unless they have been formally counseled and by ignoring the Agency's ability to demand appropriate medical certifications from its employees, the award improperly affects management's right to discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management rights exceptions to arbitration awards.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 106-07 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>). Under the revised analysis, the Authority will first assess whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If so, then, as relevant here, the Authority examines whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Also, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority, under the revised analysis, assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 116-18. In concluding that it would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 118.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator set aside the reprimand, thereby affecting management's right to discipline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. DOT, FAA</span>, 63 FLRA 383, 385 (2009) (finding that, because the arbitrator set aside a five-day suspension, management's right to discipline was affected) (<span class="Italic">DOT</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Energy, Sw. Power Admin., Tulsa, Okla.</span>, 56 FLRA 624, 625 (2000) (determining that, because the arbitrator mitigated a two-day suspension to a one-day suspension, management's right to discipline was impacted) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Energy</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not dispute that Article 35, Section M and Article 36, Section D constitute arrangements, but it asserts that the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 35, Section M "excessively interferes with [its] right to discipline [because his interpretation] prevent[s] [it] from disciplining [employees in situations] where it has an undeniable rationale for doing so." <span class="Italic">See U.S. DOT, FAA</span>, 65 FLRA 171, 174 (2010) (noting that the agency did not dispute the arrangement requirement). The Agency's assertion is without merit. As interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 35, Section M of the parties' agreement precludes the Agency from disciplining an employee for tardiness only if tardiness is not habitual. Although the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement limits the Agency's ability to discipline an employee for tardiness, the Agency is not precluded from disciplining an employee for tardiness in all cases. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 118 (finding that the agreement did not abrogate the agency's right to assign work because the agreement did not necessarily preclude disclosure of employee medical records to local coordinators in all cases). Instead, the parties' agreement, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, preserves the Agency's right to discipline an employee for habitual tardiness. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>(finding that the agency's right to assign work was not abrogated because the agreed-upon arrangement preserved the agency's ability to request, obtain, and evaluate medical information).</p>
