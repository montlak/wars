<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-154"><span class="space">a.</span> One Year of Qualifying Service; Current Continuous Service in Same or Similar Position</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">To have an appeal right, a preference eligible Postal employee must have at least one year of continuous service in the same or a similar position. <span class="Italic">Hartsell v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 539, 540, 5 MSPB 64 (1981); 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B). The same requirement applies to individuals who acquire appeal rights as Postal Service managers or supervisors. [Discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-156.html#sec1-155">Postal Supervisors, Managers</a>"] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perillo v. USPS</span>, PH-0752-14-0084-I-1 (NP 9/15/2014) ("A U.S. Postal Service employee may file a Board appeal under chapter 75 only if he is covered by 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Toomey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 10, 12 (1996). Thus, to appeal an adverse action under chapter 75, a U.S. Postal Service employee (1) must be a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity; and (2) must have completed 1 year of current, continuous service in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">Toomey</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 12."); <span class="Italic">Burrell v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 204, 207 (1997) (under both 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) and 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii), Board jurisdiction is limited to employees who have completed one year of current continuous service in same or similar positions). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-051.html#sec1-52">Current Continuous Service</a>," "<a href="0100-2023-08-088.html#sec1-87">Same Line of Work</a>"; refer earlier to "<a href="0100-2023-08-086.html#sec1-85">Tacking of Prior Service: Competitive Service Probation</a>," concerning determination of probationary periods for employees in the competitive and excepted services; refer to decisions, particularly <span class="Italic">Gettings v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 48 MSPR 502 (1991), concerning tacking of employees with Veterans Readjustment Act appointments.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One year of continuous service means either that the employment is in one position without a break of a workday or that the employment is in more than one position in the same line of work without a break of a workday. <span class="Italic">O'Gorman v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 310, 312 &#x0026; n.2, 7 MSPB 201 (1981) (two month break in employment prevented employment from being current continuous service). Under <span class="Italic">Strope v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 429, 438-39 (1996), service by a nonpreference eligible in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of one year of service under 39 USC 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have long held that service by a preference-eligible employee in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of 1 year of service under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)<span class="Italic">. See Hales v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 53 MSPR 503, 507 (1992). We have not had the occasion, however, to address the issue presented here--whether service by a nonpreference eligible in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of 1 year of service under 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). For the reasons set forth below, we find that such service may be counted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The provision at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) requiring completion of 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions for preference-eligible excepted service employees does not contain language excluding service under a temporary appointment from the 1-year current continuous service determination. In contrast, the provision at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) providing appeal rights to competitive-service employees defines an "employee" as one who has "completed 1 year of current continuous employment <span class="Italic">under other than a temporary appointment limited to one year or less</span>." 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Relying on this difference in statutory language, we have held that service by a preference eligible excepted service employee in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of the 1-year requirement under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), but that service under a temporary limited appointment in the competitive service may not be counted toward the completion of the 1-year requirement under section 7511(a)(1)(A)<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_246"></span>The provisions requiring completion of 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions for preference-eligible employees and certain nonpreference-eligible employees (e.g., managers) in the excepted service are identical<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) <span class="Italic">with</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). Neither statutory provision contains language excluding service under a temporary appointment from the 1-year current continuous service determination. We therefore hold that service in a temporary excepted service position may be counted toward the completion of the 1-year current continuous service requirement regardless of whether the employee is a preference eligible covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), or a nonpreference-eligible employee covered by subsection 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). To hold otherwise would exclude from coverage a group of Postal Service employees who, because of the temporary nature of their appointments, are ineligible for coverage under a collective bargaining agreement. Inclusion of this group of temporary employees, we therefore believe, is consistent with the purpose of section 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). As noted above, that section was intended to provide third party review of adverse actions taken against certain nonpreference-eligible employees (e.g., managers) who are excluded from any collective bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the requirement that the service be in the same or a similar position, under <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. USPS</span>, 7 MSPR 18, 20, 6 MSPB 630 (1981), different positions worked in the first year were within the same line of work if: (1) they were so similar that they would require the same qualifications; (2) they would be in the same competitive level for RIF purposes; and (3) they would allow the employee to be interchanged between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program. With some reluctance, in <span class="Italic">Van Skiver</span> the Board looked behind the official position descriptions of jobs held by the appellant, and then determined that he had been doing the same type of postal clerk duties for a year, placing his appeal within the Board's jurisdiction. If an appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations that his position is the same as or similar to another position for purposes of calculating the one-year service requirement, the appellant is entitled to a hearing on the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Newman v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 64, 67 &#x0026; n.2 (1998) (issue of whether job description and job duties diverged).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit compared the phrases "line of work" and "same or similar positions," <span class="Italic">Mathis v. USPS</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234 (Fed. Cir. 1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The reason why Congress required employees in the competitive service to have completed only "one year of current continuous employment"...but added the qualification...for preference eligibles that service must have been in the "same or similar positions," is unclear. Taken together, however, these two definitions reflect a congressional intent to limit "employees" who may appeal an adverse action to the Board to those employees who have completed one year of permanent service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Federal Personnel Manual for 1978, although not a Civil Service regulation, sheds some light on the problem. FPM Supplement 752-1, issued October 11, 1976, subchapter S2, deals with "Employee Coverage" for purposes of adverse actions. Subchapter S2-3(a) states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meaning of "current continuous employment." Current continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service may be either (i) employment in one position without a break of a workday or (ii) employment in more than one position <span class="Italic">in the same line of work</span> without a break of a workday....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that for a preference eligible employee to have completed "one year of current continuous service" the service must have been "in the same line of work" is similar to the requirement in section 7511(a)(1)(B) that the employee's continuous year of service must have been "in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the statute, Federal Personnel Manual and these decisions show, the requirement for preference eligibles that the year of service must be in positions that, if not the same, are "similar," indicates that to be an "employee" a preference eligible must occupy positions that involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board apparently deemed it critical that a special delivery messenger delivered the mail outside the Post Office after it had been sorted, but a distribution clerk worked solely inside the Post Office and separated both incoming and outgoing mail and then distributed it inside the facility. Those differences in the nature of the work performed in the two jobs, however, are not inconsistent with their being "similar positions." In each position the critical fact is that the petitioner handled the mail. The fact that he did that handling in different physical locations and in different steps of the mail distribution process did not alter the fundamental character of the work he did, which was sufficiently closely related in the two jobs to make those positions "similar."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit applied <span class="Italic">Mathis</span> in <span class="Italic">Benedict v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1992 NP No. 92-3058), involving an employee who worked as an operator of a mail-sorting machine, the FSM, and who then undertook training on a more complex machine, the MPLSM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span> held that a special delivery messenger and a distribution clerk were "similar positions" within the meaning of the statute because both required handling mail and the skills required to perform the work were closely related. Both of the positions held by Mr. Benedict involved operating a machine by means of a keyboard to sort mail. The position description requirements published by the Postal Service state both positions require the same skills. For operation of both machines the visual acuity requirements are the same and the ability to act on visual information and to sequence mail in the proper order is required; applicants must have passed the Postal Service Test 400; both machines require sufficient manual dexterity to perform keyboard sorting operations at the required rate, 45 pieces of mail per minute on the flat sorter machine, and up to 60 pieces per minute on the MPLSM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus the Board's dismissal for lack of jurisdiction is incorrect in law, and is reversed. The case is remanded for the Board's review of the merits of Mr. Benedict's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mathis</span> was also interpreted and applied in <span class="Italic">McDonald v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 148, 151-53 (1989), considering an employee's claim that work performed as a city letter carrier was the same or similar to work he performed as a general expeditor. Whether the jobs were in the same competitive level was not a controlling consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7511-7513, a preference eligible employee who has completed 1 year of current continuous work "in the same or similar positions" is entitled to appeal several enumerated adverse actions, including removal, to the Board. In <span class="Italic">Mathis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently examined the meaning of the phrase "in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court noted first that the meaning of the phrase is not clear from the terms of the statute or its legislative history. The only indication of Congress's intent was found in a Senate committee report that stated that its meaning was intended to be the same as that in use in civil service regulations at the time.[2] The court noted further, however, that there were no civil service regulations in use at that time, but that there was a provision in the Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 752-1, Subchapter S2-3(a) (Oct. 11, 1976), which defined "current continuous employment" as employment in one position without a break of a workday or employment in more than one position "in the same line of work" without a break of a workday<span class="Italic">. Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Senate committee report was issued in 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the court looked to the decisions of the Court of Claims, its own predecessor court, in <span class="Italic">Horne v. United States</span>, 419 F.2d 416 (1969), and <span class="Italic">Dargo v. United States</span>, 176 Ct. Cl. 1193 (1966), both of which compared the "nature" and "character" of the jobs in question. The court further considered three decisions by the Board. In <span class="Italic">Shobe v. United States Postal Service</span>, 5 MSPR 466, 471 (1981), the Board looked to whether "experience in a position demonstrates the knowledges, skills, and abilities required to perform the work of the other job"; in <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. United States Postal Service</span>, 7 MSPR 18, 20 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd on reconsideration</span>, 9 MSPR 380 (1982), the Board found two positions to be similar "since the nature and character of the duties did not change"; and in <span class="Italic">Wafford v. United States Postal Service</span>, 34 MSPR 691, 695-96 (1987), the Board found determinative the fact that the appellant served his last year in "two distinctly different lines of work." The court then concluded that positions were "similar" when they "involve[d] related or comparable work that require[d] the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 234-35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Van Skiver</span> and in <span class="Italic">Wafford</span>, the Board noted a provision in the Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 315, Appendix A-3c(1)(b), that stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Same line of work means that the two positions are so similar that they require the same qualifications, and, insofar as the nature of the work is concerned, would be in the same competitive level for reduction in force purposes. In essence, an incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training and without unduly interrupting the work program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board then considered whether the position descriptions for the jobs at issue involved significantly different responsibilities and duties to the extent that they were not interchangeable, noting that, in addition to having many differing duties, the positions were in different competitive levels for reduction-in-force purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We point out here that the Board has never ruled that, in order for two positions to be "the same or similar," they must be in the same competitive level. The competitive level is simply one consideration in making that determination<span class="Italic">. See Shobe</span>, 5 MSPR at 471 ("a 'line of work' may be a series, a specialization in a series, a group of jobs with common qualification in a series, or even positions in several series"). The "interchangeability" and <span id="Page_247"></span>"minimal disruption" concepts in reduction-in-force law are merely akin to the "same or similar positions" concept in adverse action law, although the former may be somewhat more restrictive than the latter. We note further that, without any discussion of competitive levels, the court in <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 235, found that the two positions in question, which we believe could be deemed to be in different competitive levels for reduction-in-force purposes, were nevertheless "similar positions." <span class="Italic">Mathis</span> found that the special delivery messenger and distribution clerk positions required closely related skills to perform their duties: distribution of mail outside the facility in the case of the former, and sorting and distributing mail inside the facility in the case of the latter. The fact that these similar activities occurred in different locations and in different steps in the mail distribution process did not make the two positions dissimilar, the court said<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, we find that the positions of general expeditor and letter carrier at issue in this appeal are not similar in their duties and in the skills required and, therefore, that the appellant is not entitled to appeal rights. The administrative judge reviewed the position descriptions of letter carrier and general expeditor and found substantial differences. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter carrier is responsible for the prompt collection and distribution of mail in a prescribed area, while the general expeditor is responsible for a combination of tasks requiring the knowledge of ingoing and outgoing schemes, transportation schedules, and receipt and dispatch information in performing mail distribution. In addition, the expeditor arranges for the proper transfer of mail between various mail routes and units, and for the separating, loading, and unloading of various vehicles by contractors and postal employees to ensure proper and expeditious handling. The differences between the duties and fundamental character of the work involved in the positions of general expeditor and letter carrier, including the fact that the positions may well be in different competitive levels for reduction-in-force purposes, preclude a finding that the positions are similar. The appellant, in fact, counters his own argument that they are similar by stating that the carrier position is "lower-rated" and "requires less job knowledge than the general expeditor position." In addition, and also contrary to the appellant's argument, his personal ability to perform either the job of general expeditor or the lower-ranked job of letter carrier is irrelevant to the proper classification of the positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, while there are some similarities between the distribution clerk and mail carrier positions, the appellant's argument that his prior experience as a distribution clerk satisfies the time requirement of 12 months in the same or similar positions is inconsequent in view of the requirement that the employee complete 1 year of <span class="Italic">continuous</span> service in the same or similar positions. 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B). The record shows that the appellant's service as a general expeditor occurred between his employment as a distribution clerk and his employment as a part-time letter carrier.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comparison of Postal Service employees' duties continued with <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 563, 568 (1989). An employee claimed tenure through successive positions as distribution clerk and postmaster at a small post office. Although the postmaster performed some duties that a distribution clerk could have been assigned, the postmaster had additional managerial duties. Determining that the positions were dissimilar, the Board reaffirmed the principle that similarity of positions is not determined by whether the positions are in the same competitive level. <span class="Italic">Nash v. USPS</span>, 97 MSPR 220, 221-24 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 7-10 (2004), analyzed the duties of a distribution clerk and a carrier technician and determined the positions to be the same or similar:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that on October 31, 2001, the appellant, a preference eligible employee, was reassigned from the position of Letter Carrier, Grade 6, to the position of Distribution Clerk Rehabilitation, Level 5, to accommodate his physical limitations. On June 29, 2002, the appellant was assigned to work at the Austin General Mail Facility as a Distribution Clerk, Level 5, with modified duties assigned to accommodate his medical restrictions, i.e., processing mail on the "ISS/OCR," manually distributing mail, and performing other duties assigned within his medical restrictions. On April 19, 2003, the appellant was reassigned to a modified city carrier position in the carrier craft, Carrier Technician, Grade Q-02/H. His duties were to include delivering mail, processing router mail, and other duties as assigned within his restrictions. The appellant filed this appeal asserting that he was constructively suspended when the agency would not allow him to work from May 10, 2003, through May 29, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For purposes of this case, "employee" means "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). The issue before the Board is whether the Distribution Clerk and Carrier Technician positions are similar within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) so that the appellant would have standing to bring a constructive suspension claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2). The Board has previously determined that these positions are similar positions, <span class="Italic">Graham v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 565, 567-68 (1990), and we find no basis upon which to find that the appellant's Distribution Clerk position with modified duties is not similar to a Carrier Technician position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions are similar if experience in one position demonstrates the knowledge, skills, and abilities required to perform the duties of the other job. <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 567. As the Board set forth in <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, the duties of a Distribution Clerk involve the sorting and distribution of mail within a postal facility. A Carrier Technician's duties involve the delivery and collection of mail by foot or vehicle. Each position involves the handling of mail, although at a different stage in the distribution process. The range of duties in the Distribution Clerk position appears to be less than those of the Carrier Technician position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Carrier Technicians and Distribution Clerks work in different physical locations and in different stages of the distribution process does not alter the fundamental character of the work. <span class="Italic">Mathis v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 235 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In this case, from October 31, 2001, through May 10, 2003, when the appellant claims that he was constructively suspended, the appellant served in the positions of Distribution Clerk Rehabilitation, Level 5, Distribution Clerk, Level 5, with modified duties, and Carrier Technician with modified duties. There is no indication in the record that the appellant had training requirements for any of the three positions. <span class="Italic">See Graham</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. at 568 (one factor supporting the conclusion that two positions were similar for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) was that "extensive retraining" was not necessary to move from one position to the other).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, because the modifications of the appellant's duties for all of these positions were essentially the same, i.e., sitting intermittently, intermittent standing and walking, and use of either or both hands intermittently, the modifications are not distinguishable among the positions. Similarly, the physical limitations for the positions are also the same, i.e., lifting, pulling and pushing limited to 25 pounds intermittently, sitting 3 hours, walking, standing and operating a motor vehicle 6 hours, and reaching, reaching above shoulder, twisting, squatting, kneeling, and climbing restricted to 2 hours. Thus, we find that the Distribution Clerk positions are similar to the Carrier Technician position within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) and that the appellant therefore has standing to bring a constructive suspension claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The essence of the similarity analysis appears to be whether jobs involve "related or comparable work requiring the same or similar skills." <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 515, 518 (1991). Same or similar skills are not involved when each of the two jobs in successive assignments required substantial training, meaning they did not qualify under the then-applicable FPM Ch. 315, App. A-3c(3), requiring positions to be interchangeable without significant training or undue interruption in work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Benedict v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 334, 337 (1991) (flat sorter machine operator is not the same as or similar to a distribution clerk, or a multiposition letter sorting machine trainee because each job required at least 50 hours of training). Chairman Levinson, a dissenter in <span class="Italic">Benedict</span>, argued that the two positions should have been considered under a competitive level analysis involving RIF regulations providing a 90-day period to become proficient in the critical duties of a position<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 588, 591 (1993) (demotion from a position held less than a year; no appeal right because of insufficient similarity between Supervisor, Mails and Delivery, and Manager, Station/Branch Operations: "Two positions are not similar under 7511(a)(1)(B) if several specified managerial functions are entailed by one position but not by the other"; "the Manager position entails administrative and managerial functions of a substantially broader scope and greater degree of responsibility than those of the Supervisor position"); <span class="Italic">Graham v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 565, 567 (1990) (distribution clerk and carrier technician both involved the handling of mail, although at different stages of the distribution process; the positions are sufficiently similar within the meaning of 7511(a)(1)(B)); <span class="Italic">Goodman v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 127, 129 (1988) (employee's service as acting supervisor does not entitle him to the rights of a position held through detail and cannot be credited toward the completion of one year of qualifying service); <span class="Italic">Wafford v. USPS</span>, 34 MSPR 691, 694 (1987) (distribution clerk and a supervisor of mails are not in the same line of work).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The positions of mail processing clerk and network specialist were dissimilar, <span class="Italic">Shafford v. USPS</span>, 293 Fed. Appx. 760, 763-64 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge found that Mr. Shafford's service as a Mail Processing Clerk could not count toward the one-year requirement because that position was not the same as or sufficiently similar to the Networks Specialist position. <span class="Italic">Board Decision</span>, slip op. at 5-6. Two positions are "similar" when they "involve related or comparable work that requires the same or similar skills"; however, if positions "involve 'two distinctly different lines of work,'" the positions are not sufficiently similar. <span class="Italic">Mathis v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 234-35 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (quoting <span class="Italic">Van Skiver v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 7 M.S.P.R. 18, 20 (1981); <span class="Italic">Wafford</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. at 696).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After a jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge found that the Mail Processing Clerk and Networks Specialist positions "involve significantly different responsibilities and duties." While the Mail <span id="Page_248"></span>Processing Clerk physically processes, sorts, and distributes the mail, the Networks Specialist occupies a higher-level position that "coordinates activities between contract carriers and postal supervisors" and helps administer "network changes regarding dispatch and routing activities." On appeal, Mr. Shafford alleges that the positions are similar because, in both, an employee may respond to inquiries from contract carriers. A minor overlap, however, does not establish similarity where the evidence indicates that the two positions involve different types of work requiring different skill sets. In addition, Mr. Shafford argues that the two positions are similar because the "basic fuction [sic] " of both is "the efficient movement of the mail." But simply having a common basic function also does not indicate that two positions are "similar," especially when this basic function applies to nearly <span class="Italic">any</span> position with the USPS. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 403(b)(1) (The USPS is responsible for "maintain[ing] an efficient system of collection, sorting, and delivery of the mail.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that substantial evidence supports the administrative judge's finding that the Mail Processing Clerk and Networks Specialist positions "involve significantly different responsibilities and duties" and, thus, are not sufficiently "similar." Because Mr. Shafford has not established that he "completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions," the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii)(II); <span class="Italic">Waldau</span>, 19 F.3d at 1398. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's interpretation of the jurisdictional requirement of one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position can have the effect, not likely intended by Congress, of an immediate loss of tenure and appeal rights by a long-term employee who undertakes a substantial change in jobs, even if the change is through an agency-directed reassignment. An example of "up and out" precipitous loss of appeal rights is <span class="Italic">Burrell v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 204, 210 (1997). The appellant was reassigned from building services supervisor to postmaster. When she did not report to the postmaster's job, she was terminated for AWOL. The issue was whether she had standing to appeal loss of the postmaster position. She served more than a year in the building services job, but the Board determined the duties of that position were dissimilar to those of postmaster. The Board all but dismissed the appeal, suggesting that if the appellant could show that the agency lacked a legitimate management reason for reassigning her, the adverse action "could reasonably be said to have been directed at the employee in his or her former position." On remand, the AJ resolved that the agency's actions were without fault. Ms. Burrell advanced to the Federal Circuit. That court confirmed lack of Board appellate jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Burrell v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3097):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the Board concluded that the AJ had failed to fully address the jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Burrell v. United States Postal</span> Serv., No. DA-0752-96-0254-I-1 (August 22, 1997). For the Board to have jurisdiction over an appeal raised by a supervisory employee, such as Ms. Burrell, the employee must have completed at least one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(iii). Because Ms. Burrell had not been in her position as a postmaster for at least one year and because her former position as a maintenance supervisor was not the same as, or similar to, her position as a postmaster, the Board would not have jurisdiction unless her reassignment was not for a legitimate management reason, i.e., it was based on discrimination or retaliation. If her reassignment was not for a legitimate management reason, then Ms. Burrell would effectively still be in her prior position, in which she had served for more than a year. Accordingly, the Board held that its jurisdiction turned on whether Ms. Burrell's reassignment was based on discrimination or retaliation. The Board affirmed the AJ's finding that Ms. Burrell had failed to carry her burden of proving discrimination, but remanded the case for the AJ to address the claim of retaliation. <span class="Italic">See Burrell</span>, No. DA-0752-96-0254-I-1 (August 22, 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the AJ concluded that Ms. Burrell had failed to establish that retaliation was a significant or substantial factor in the agency's decision to reassign her, and that she had failed to rebut the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that it had a legitimate management reason for reassigning her. <span class="Italic">See Burrell v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, No. DA-0752-96-0254-B-1 (April 24, 1998) ("second initial decision"). Accordingly, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The second initial decision became final on November 18, 1998 when, as noted above, the Board denied Ms. Burrell's petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board's decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703; <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy</span>, 727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The decision of the Board in this case is none of these.</p>

After a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision that sustained the charge but mitigated the penalty to a demotion to the next lower-graded nonmanagerial position with the least reduction in grade and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency does not challenge the administrative judge's determination regarding the merits of the appeal but argues for the first time that the Board lacks jurisdiction because the appellant did not complete one year of current continuous service in the Manager position or in similar positions. The appellant has timely responded in opposition to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a limited-jurisdiction tribunal, the Board must satisfy itself that it has the authority to adjudicate the matter before it and may raise the matter of its own jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> at any time. <span class="Italic">Waldrop v. United States Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 12, 15 (1996). Furthermore, the agency cannot be estopped from arguing for the first time on petition for review that the Board lacks jurisdiction, even if this position is contrary to the agency's position below<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Therefore, the appellant must point to some law, rule, or regulation that gives him a right to appeal the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a); <span class="Italic">Schall v. United States Postal Service</span>, 73 F.3d 341, 343-44 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, a preference eligible veteran, asserts that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii) (1996) and 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(i) (supp. 1999). To qualify as an employee entitled to appeal to the Board under those provisions, the appellant must show that he is a "preference eligible," and that he has completed "1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." <span class="Italic">See Mathis v. United States Postal Service</span>, 865 F.2d 232, 232-33 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant is a preference eligible veteran, and that he is also a management employee. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii).[1] The agency asserts, however, that the appellant did not fulfill the jurisdictional requirement of one year of current continuous service in the Manager position, from which he was removed, or in similar positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 1005(a)(4)(A) provides: "Subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5 shall apply...(ii) to any other individual who (I) is in the position of a supervisor or a management employee in the Postal Service, or is an employee of the Postal Service engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity; and (II) has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute that he received a promotion to the Manager position on March 2, 1996, and that he was removed less than a year later, on December 13, 1996. He argues that, as a preference-eligible, he was not required to serve a probationary period in the Manager position because he previously served a probationary period as a Distribution Clerk, a position he held from April 30, 1983, until his promotion nearly 13 years later. He construes 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) to require "only that, at some point in the past, the employee must have served in the same or similar position for one year." According to the appellant, "[t]he words 'current continuous service' do not mean that service had to occur in the past year." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The appellant concedes that his interpretation is contrary to that of the Board, which has found that the "current continuous service" requirement applies to the last year of employment. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Spillers v. United States Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 22, 26 (1994). Nevertheless, the appellant argues that the Board's decisions are "based on an incomplete and erroneous analysis of the applicable statutes, legislative histories and case law prior to, and since, passage of the Civil Service Reform Act." Specifically, the appellant asserts that the Board has misinterpreted the plain language of section 7511(a)(1)(B), eradicated the traditional rights of preference eligible veterans, and permitted an absurd result. We address these arguments in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself, which governs absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Consumer Product Safety Commission v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.</span>, 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 169 F.3d 1383, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The statutory language at issue states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For the purpose of this subchapter "employee" means...(B) a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...(ii) in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The phrase "1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions" is also used in 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a)(4)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See, supra</span>, footnote 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_249"></span>The appellant focuses on the words "has completed" and argues that "this use of the past tense is significant, indeed it is determinative, of the meaning of the section." According to the appellant, the use of the past tense indicates that an employee is only required to have served in the same or similar position "at some point in the past." In fact, the verb "has completed" is in the present perfect tense, not the past tense.[3] In any event, we do not find the verb tense of section 7511(a)(1)(B) to be determinative of its meaning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;According to standard usage, the past tense ("completed") indicates an action that occurred in past time, while the present perfect tense ("has completed") denotes an action that has been completed at some indefinite time in the past or an action occurring in the past and continuing into the present. <span class="Italic">See</span> Edward A. Doman and Charles W. Dawe, <span class="Italic">The Brief English Handbook</span> 70-71 (2d ed. 1987); Margaret Shertzer, <span class="Italic">The Elements of Grammar</span> 28-29 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A more significant problem with the appellant's interpretation is that it ignores the word "current," which is an integral part of the phrase "current continuous service." The appellant's interpretation would render the word "current" superfluous. <span class="Italic">Cf. Forest v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 47 F.3d 409, 412 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (petitioner's contention that all excepted service employees would have a vested right to appeal under section 7511(a)(1)(C) once they completed a probationary or trial period would render subpart (C)(ii) superfluous and thus violate the rule of construction that a statute should not be interpreted in a way that renders one of its parts inoperative). Therefore, we decline to adopt the appellant's interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that "current continuous service" is defined by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) as "a period of employment or service <span class="Italic">immediately preceding an adverse action</span> in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.402(b) (1999) (emphasis supplied). As the agency charged with implementing chapter 75 of title 5, OPM's interpretation is entitled to deference unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong. <span class="Italic">Todd v. Department of Defense</span>, 63 MSPR 4, 8 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Moreover, OPM's predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, participated in developing chapter 75, <span class="Italic">see National Treasury Employee's Union v. Devine</span>, 9 MSPB 448, 10 MSPR 194, 200 (1982), and in such a case the administrative agency's interpretation of the statute is especially persuasive. <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the Board, starting with its decision in <span class="Italic">Shobe v. United States Postal Service</span>, 5 MSPB 468, 5 MSPR 466 (1981), has "gutted" the rights conferred upon preference eligible veterans by the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 (VPA), Pub. L. No. 78-359, 58 Stat. 390. Section 14 of the VPA provided preference eligibles with certain procedural rights, including the right to appeal removal actions to the Board's predecessor, the Civil Service Commission. Section 14 stated in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">No permanent or indefinite preference eligible, who has completed a probationary or trial period employed in the civil service, or in any establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, or department, hereinbefore referred to shall be discharged...except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service and for reasons given in writing...such preference eligible...shall have the right to appeal to the Civil Service Commission from an adverse decision of the administrative officer so acting....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span>, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1944 USCCAN 400, 403. The Civil Service Commission was authorized to promulgate regulations to implement this section. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant, the VPA required a preference eligible to serve only one initial probationary period, even if the preference eligible subsequently encumbered a dissimilar position. However, that view was consistently rejected by the U.S. Court of Claims.[4] For example, in <span class="Italic">Bander v. United States</span>, 141 Ct. Cl. 373, 158 F. Supp. 564 (1958), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 358 U.S. 855, 79 S. Ct. 85, 3 L. Ed.2d 89 (1958), the Court of Claims considered whether Bander, a preference eligible veteran who had served three years at the Department of Commerce before accepting an appointment with the Post Office, was entitled to the procedural rights afforded by the VPA. Bander admitted that he did not serve out his probationary period with the Post Office, but claimed that the language of section 14 of the VPA was nevertheless met because he had completed a probationary period in his previous service with the Department of Commerce. 158 F. Supp. at 566. In addressing this argument, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Veterans' Preference Act does not, of course, provide a direct answer to this question, or define the term "probationary period." However, since the Civil Service Act of 1883 there has been a requirement for "a period of probation before any absolute appointment or employment" in the civil service. This period has been defined in the Civil Service Rules. It is thus necessary to look to the Rules for such assistance as they may give in determining the meaning of the disputed provision of the Veterans' Preference Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Court of Claims was one of the predecessors of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See South Corp. v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>) (adopting prior decisions of Court of Claims as binding precedent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court found that the regulations then in effect did not count prior service toward completion of a probationary period unless it was in the same agency and in the same line of work. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 567. The court held that the Post Office's refusal to count Bander's prior service with the Department of Commerce toward his probationary period was "plainly reasonable" and he therefore was not entitled to the protections of the VPA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Even though [Bander] previously had acquired competitive status his previous service was in wholly unrelated fields of work, and it plainly was reasonable to require him to demonstrate his aptitude and suitability for the new position of carrier, since he had not already demonstrated his ability to the Post Office Department, or indeed to any agency, in that kind of work. There is certainly no indication that Congress intended to give the procedural rights of section 14 to veterans who had not proved their abilities to the employing agency either in the job for which they were hired or in the same type of work in the same agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant points to dicta in <span class="Italic">Bander</span> in which the court noted that its holding should not be applied so broadly as to require that "any change by a Government employee in his agency or line of work means automatic loss of his rights or status." 158 F. Supp. at 568. Indeed, the current version of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) recognizes that a preference eligible who is appointed to a "similar" position does not lose his appeal rights. The appellant also relies on Judge Madden's dissenting opinion in <span class="Italic">Bander</span>, in which he argued that the VPA was broad enough to cover preference eligibles who had completed one year of probation anywhere in the civil service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 569-71. Obviously, Judge Madden's views were not adopted by the majority.[5] Neither the dicta quoted by the appellant nor the dissent alters the court's basic holding that Congress did not intend to give the procedural rights of the VPA--including the right to administrative review--to those "who had not proved their abilities to the employing agency either in the job for which they were hired or in the same type of work in the same agency." 158 F. Supp. at 567.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The court revisited Judge Madden's dissent in <span class="Italic">Marcus v. United States</span>, 200 Ct. Cl. 544, 473 F.2d 896, 899-900 (1973), discussed below, and again rejected his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also relies on <span class="Italic">Lamb v. United States</span>, 116 Ct. Cl. 325, 90 F. Supp. 369 (1950). In <span class="Italic">Lamb</span>, the Court of Claims found that the VPA applied to a preference eligible veteran with competitive status who transferred from the competitive service to the excepted service, "regardless of the length of time he had served in such excepted position." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 374. As the court later noted in <span class="Italic">Bander</span>, however, the plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Lamb</span> was transferred to an excepted position that did not require that he serve a probationary period. <span class="Italic">Bander</span>, 158 F. Supp. at 569. Therefore, he met the requirements of the VPA under the Civil Service Commission regulations then in effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not cite any cases issued by the Court of Claims after 1966, when the VPA was amended.[6] The revised statute defined "preference eligible employee" to mean "a permanent or indefinite preference eligible who has completed a probationary or trial period as an employee of an Executive agency...." Pub. L. No. 89-554, 80 Stat. 378, <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1966 USCCAN 429, 635. The Court of Claims construed that definition, as codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511 (1970), in <span class="Italic">Marcus v. United States</span>, 200 Ct. Cl. 544, 473 F.2d 896 (1973). The plaintiff in <span class="Italic">Marcus</span> was a preference eligible who claimed that the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) separated him from his position without following the procedures of the VPA<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 897. Marcus had entered the civil service in 1952 and obtained permanent status in 1953. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In 1970, he was appointed from the Civil Service Register to the position of Claim Representative Trainee at HEW and was placed in a one-year probationary period<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> Seven months later, HEW terminated Marcus for inefficiency<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> The Civil Service Commission refused to hear Marcus' appeal because he was a probationer<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As the appellant notes, the Postal Reorganization Act, Pub. L. No. 91-375, 84 Stat. 719 (1970), preserved the existing rights of preference eligible employees of the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Andress v. United States Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 501, 505-506 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Court of Claims, Marcus argued that his prior government service should be counted toward his probationary period at HEW. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 898. The court found that Marcus' contention was not supported by provisions in the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) or by applicable case law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 898-99. The court quoted a section of the FPM stating that the requirement that a preference eligible serve a one-year probationary period applied to subsequent appointments, regardless of whether the employee had previously completed a probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court noted that there were exceptions to this rule where employees were <span id="Page_250"></span>transferred, rather than appointed, and where prior service was in the same line of work and in the same agency as the position for which the action is taken. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 899. The court concluded that "[s]ince plaintiff's prior service was not in the same line of work as his service at the time of his dismissal it cannot count towards his probationary period." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Five years after <span class="Italic">Marcus</span>, Congress passed the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. As the Supreme Court has observed, the CSRA continued the preferred position of preference eligible veterans, a traditional feature of the pre-CSRA civil service system. <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 449, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed.2d 830 (1988). The legislative history of the CSRA indicated that the phrase "1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions" in section 7511(a)(1)(B)[7] defined the extent of coverage of employees in the excepted service and was "intended to be the same as that currently used in civil service regulations." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48, <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> in 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2770. <span class="Italic">See also Shobe</span>, 5 MSPB 468, 5 MSPR at 470 (legislative history of section 7511(a)(1)(B) indicates that Congress intended to incorporate in the new law the same rights for preference eligible employees serving in the excepted service which they had under existing regulations). The pre-CSRA regulations granted appeal rights to "any preference eligible employee who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.201(a)(3) (1978). The term "current continuous service" in a position outside the competitive service was defined in FPM Supplement 752-1, S2-3a(3) to mean "either (i) employment in one position without a break of a workday or (ii) employment in more than one position in the same line of work without a break of a workday."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;As amended by the CSRA, section 7511 (a)(1)(B) stated: "For the purposes of this subchapter (1) 'employee' means...(B) a preference eligible in an Executive agency in the excepted service, and a preference eligible in the United States Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission, who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With this background, the Board in <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> considered whether it had jurisdiction over an appeal by a preference eligible who was terminated by the Postal Service while serving a probationary period in the position of Distribution Clerk. 5 MSPB 468, 5 MSPR at 467. The appellant had previously worked seven years at the Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development (HUD) and had obtained career status in the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> After examining section 7511(a)(1)(B) and its legislative history, the Board concluded that the statute referred to the year immediately prior to the appellant's termination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 470-71. The Board remanded the case to the Field Office to determine whether the appellant's service with HUD was in "the same line of work" as his position with the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 471-72. Thus, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> and subsequent Board decisions to the same effect[8] are consistent with pre-CSRA law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The instant case is indistinguishable from a long line of Board cases finding that section 7511(a)(1)(B) requires an examination of a preference eligible's last year of service to determine whether the employee has completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Vercelli v. United States Postal Service</span>, 70 MSPR 322, 329 (1996); <span class="Italic">Spillers</span>, 65 MSPR at 26; <span class="Italic">Carr v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 681 (1990); <span class="Italic">Schmidt v. United States Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 563, 566-68 (1989); <span class="Italic">McDonald v. United States Postal Service</span>, 42 MSPR 148, 151-53 (1989); <span class="Italic">Goodman v. United States Postal Service,</span> 36 MSPR 127, 129-30 (1988); <span class="Italic">McAteer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the Board's interpretation would lead to an absurd result because it would permit the agency to remove him without appeal rights even though he has nearly 13 years of continuous service in his previous position as Distribution Clerk and even though he was "good enough, in the first instance, to be promoted to a supervisory or managerial position." The appellant further warns that the Board's interpretation would permit an agency to "get rid of" a preference eligible by promoting him to a supervisory position and then promptly terminating him during his probationary period. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An interpretation of a statute which would lead to absurd results is to be avoided when it can be given a reasonable application consistent with its words and legislative purpose. <span class="Italic">Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The appellant has not shown, however, that the Board's interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(B) is absurd. The requirement of one year of current continuous service allows employing agencies a means of measuring the ability of a candidate to perform the work of a position<span class="Italic">. See Shobe</span>, 5 MSPB 468, 5 MSPR at 471. <span class="Italic">See also Marcus</span>, 473 F.2d at 900 ("It is unfortunately true that long service in a tenured position in Government is no guarantee of competence"). The appellant himself states that "[w]hether the Board deems section 7511(a)(1)(B) to impose a probationary period or not, it is clear that the purpose of the section is [to] provide for a trial period so the agency can gauge an employee's actual performance in a job and, if necessary, remove that employee from the job without being unduly hampered by procedural requirements." Thus, the Board's interpretation of the statute is not absurd on its face. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agency promoted the appellant as a ploy to deny him appeal rights. Public officers are presumed to perform their duties in good faith and in accordance with the law and governing regulations unless there is "irrefragable proof" to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. White</span>, 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999)<span class="Italic">. See also Marcus</span>, 473 F.2d at 900 (presumption of regularity of official action required court to suppose that valid reasons existed for the official decision unless it affirmatively appeared that the reason was something improper, or the action was taken without reason).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SEPARATE OPINION OF BENJAMIN L. ERDREICH, CHAIRMAN</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although I am compelled to reach the result called for by the majority opinion, I write separately to express my agreement with Mr. Preyor's well-stated argument that this outcome cannot have been intended by Congress and conflicts with the merit system principles our Board is mandated to protect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The absurdity of the outcome here is obvious and requires little analysis. Mr. Preyor has almost 20 years of government service, 14 of which have been with his current agency. Because of his successful performance, he was recently promoted to a management position. However, unless he can prove on remand that the position he held immediately before he was promoted is "similar" to the management position from which he was terminated, he will not be able to appeal his removal to the Board (nor to grieve his removal to an arbitrator since he is not in the bargaining unit); in such an event the agency will be able to terminate a long-term employee without providing the fundamental right to due process our merit system embodies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Mr. Preyor was employed by an agency other than the Postal Service and he was found to be performing unsuccessfully as a newly promoted manager, the agency could demote him to his prior position during the one-year supervisory probationary period without providing Board appeal rights. 5 USC &#x00A7; 3321(a)(2). Any adverse action other than demotion taken by the agency, however, would require that Mr. Preyor be given Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately, the statutory language applicable to veterans in the Postal Service does not mirror this protection provided to other government employees. A Postal Service employee retains Board appeal rights only so long as he does not move from one position to another position with different duties during his career. Paradoxically, it is the successful employee, the employee who moves up the career ladder through hard work and promotion, that stands the greatest chance of losing his appeal rights because of a position change.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I concede that this is the outcome required by our controlling precedence and the applicable law. However, I find the result to be troubling and fundamentally inconsistent with a merit-based civil service. I write separately to highlight this systemic flaw, with the hope that Congress will see fit to correct this anomalous result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the Board lacks jurisdiction over the employee, it lacks jurisdiction over any allegations raised as the action appealed. If the Board does not have jurisdiction over a Postal Service employee's appeal because he has not been in a position for a year, an allegation that the removal was based on a physical disability does not establish jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 15 MSPR 748, 750 (1983); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hartsell v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 539, 540, 5 MSPB 64 (1981) (no jurisdiction over the removal of an individual who asserted sex discrimination but was not in the position for a year).
