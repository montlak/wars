<h2 class="h2" id="sec2-291"><span class="space">V.</span> SANCTIONS</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not sanction the conduct of representatives or litigants through the imposition of personal discipline as a court might sanction an attorney or another individual for contempt of the court or sanction an attorney for violation of provisions of the Federal Rules concerning good faith submission of pleadings, although an AJ could disqualify a representative for a conflict of interest or exceptionally objectionable conduct during the course of a hearing. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-219.html#sec2-216">Representatives</a>."] Instead, the Board sanctions a party who violates a Board order through procedural steps that may adversely affect the outcome of the sanctioned party's case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gannon v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 660, 666 (1995). 5 CFR 1201.43 (2022), establishes guidelines for AJs governing the imposition of sanctions for failure to comply with Board regulations and orders:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The judge may impose sanctions upon the parties as necessary to serve the ends of justice. This authority covers, but is not limited to, the circumstances set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. Before imposing a sanction, the judge shall provide appropriate prior warning, allow a response to the actual or proposed sanction when feasible, and document the reasons for any resulting sanction in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to comply with an order</span>. When a party fails to comply with an order, the judge may:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard to the information sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Prohibit the party failing to comply with the order from introducing evidence concerning the information sought, or from otherwise relying upon testimony related to that information;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Permit the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence concerning the information sought; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Eliminate from consideration any appropriate part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party that fails to comply with the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to prosecute or defend appeal</span>. If a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal, the judge may dismiss the appeal with prejudice or rule in favor of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to make timely filing</span>. The judge may refuse to consider any motion or other pleading that is not filed in a timely fashion in compliance with this subpart.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exclusion of a representative or other person</span>. A judge may exclude or limit the participation of a representative or other person in the case for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. When the judge excludes a party's representative, the judge will afford the party a reasonable time to obtain another representative before proceeding with the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cancellation, suspension, or termination of hearing</span>. A judge may cancel a scheduled hearing, or suspend or terminate a hearing in progress, for contumacious conduct or conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice on the part of the appellant or the appellant's representative. If the judge suspends a hearing, the parties must be given notice as to when the hearing will resume. If the judge cancels or terminates a hearing, the judge must set a reasonable time during which the record will be kept open for receipt of written submissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Colleran v. USPS,</span> SE-0752-01-0293-C-1 (NP 8/19/2011), summarized Board sanctioning authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An administrative judge has the authority to impose sanctions for the failure to follow the Board's regulations or failure to follow the administrative judge's orders. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43 (2010); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 10 (2003). An administrative judge, however, should not resort to the imposition of sanctions unless necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">Robinson,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 10. The Board's regulations allow an administrative judge to impose sanctions for failure to comply with an order, failure to prosecute or defend an appeal, failure to respond to discovery, or failure to make a timely filing. <span class="Italic">Wagner v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge has the authority to sanction a party when necessary to serve the ends of justice. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43. In particular, an administrative judge may sanction a party for failure to comply with an order. may submit such documents as part of her prehearing submissions pursuant to the administrative judge's orders. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a). However, sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise due diligence in complying with an order or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to so comply. Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior, 78 M.S.P.R. 615, &#x00B6; 4 (1998)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we find that the administrative judge should have issued a show cause order to afford the parties an opportunity to respond prior to imposing sanctions. <span class="italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43 (stating that before imposing a sanction, the judge shall provide appropriate prior warning, allow a response to the actual or proposed sanction when feasible, and document the reasons for any resulting sanction in the record)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions for adjudicative misconduct, imposed if the ends of justice require it, are not limited to the regulatory examples. <span class="Italic">Stone v. OPM</span>, 5 MSPR 68, 70, 5 MSPB 142 (1981). "An appellant's right to a hearing, however, should not be denied as a sanction absent extraordinary circumstances." <span class="Italic">Hart v. USDA</span>, 81 MSPR 329, 332 &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (communications from the agency led the appellant to believe her appeal would be dismissed without prejudice, leading to her failure to participate in the prehearing conference); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Filiberti</span>, 29 MSPR 533 (1985) (considering but not imposing sanctions for the purported failure of the agency to reveal material information to the Board impacting upon the imposition of the penalty assessed by the Board against respondent).

Dept. of Army</span>, 82 MSPR 375 (1999), and the possibility of sanctions against parties who intimidate witnesses appearing before the Board.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sanctions are available to punish those who disobey Board rules and rulings. Although the imposition of sanctions is within the sound discretion of the AJ, under 5 CFR 1201.43 (2022) sanctions may be applied only when necessary to preserve the ends of justice. The Board's ability to impose sanctions is a means to ensure compliance. <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. OPM</span>, 49 MSPR 324, 330 (1991). Sanctions are not granted based only upon violation of an AJ's order. An appellant is not entitled to sanctions against an agency for untimely compliance with an AJ's order without a showing of prejudice. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 631, 636 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 46 MSPR 154, 161 (1990)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 70 MSPR 182, 186 (1996) (unless there was prejudice, sanctions were inappropriate against the agency for failure to follow the AJ's order to engage in settlement discussions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it is generally recognized that sanctions may be imposed for violations of AJs' orders, e.g., discovery orders following motions to compel discovery, sanctions may be applied for violations of Board regulations, as occurred when an agency's witness was precluded from testifying, with outcome determinative effect, as a result of the agency's failure to properly make initial disclosures required by regulation, <span class="Italic">Brunner v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/BRUNNER_MICHAEL_L_SF_0752_10_0274_I_1_ORDER_WITH_SEPARATE_DISSENTING_OPINION_635782.pdf">116 MSPR 679</a>, 2011 MSPB 79 (NP 8/31/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge denied the agency's request for Kreuziger's testimony because the agency did not identify Kreuziger in its initial disclosures. We find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of this sanction because the agency's omission of the polygraph examiner from its initial disclosure reflected, at best, a lack of due diligence. Specifically, given the agency's reliance on the polygraph to support its action against the appellant, its oversight in identifying the examiner in its initial disclosure could, and apparently did, mislead appellant's counsel into believing that the agency was not going to rely on him as a witness. We also reject the notion that the agency complied with its disclosure obligation because the examiner's name appeared in the report of investigation which it submitted to the appellant as part of the agency file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's interest in employing sanctions, or the threat of sanctions, as a means of securing compliance with Board rules, rather than a means of denying appellants effective hearings on their appeals, was illustrated in <span class="Italic">Fickie v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 MSPR 525, 535-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2000). The agency complained, and the Board determined, that the appellant's certificates of service were irregular and that the appellant was faxing submissions to the AJ but mailing them to the opposing counsel, with the result that the AJ delayed some conferences among the parties. The AJ sanctioned the appellant by suppressing the appellant's submissions. The Board set aside the sanction and remanded the case for further consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sanctions are to be imposed in Board proceedings only as necessary to serve the ends of justice....&#8197;It is the Board's practice, however, to provide the party on which sanctions may be imposed with an opportunity to cure the defect in question<span class="Italic">. Campbell v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 92, 96 n.2 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 497 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 469 U.S. 881 (1984)....&#8197;[N]othing in the record indicates that the administrative judge previously expressed his disapproval of the service practices mentioned above, that he instructed the appellant or his representative to alter those practices, or that he instructed the appellant or his representative to cure the deficiencies noted above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances described above, we find that the sanction imposed by the administrative judge was not necessary to serve the ends of justice. On remand, the administrative judge shall provide the agency with an opportunity to show that it failed to receive any documents attached to the appellant's pleadings, and he shall provide the appellant with an opportunity to serve any such documents on the agency in an appropriate manner. He also may require the appellant to serve by facsimile any submission he files with the administrative judge in that manner, and he may exclude from consideration any document not properly served on the agency representative. If certificates of service accompanying documents filed by the appellant on remand contain deficiencies similar to those described above, the administrative judge may impose sanctions necessary to serve the ends of justice, including, if appropriate, the sanction of declining to consider those submissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A motion for sanctions should be timely filed. The Board will not consider on PFR a request for sanctions that could have been, but was not, made prior to the close of the record at the regional level. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vercelli v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 322, 329 (1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In determining whether the imposition of sanctions is warranted against a party, an AJ considers a party's diligence, or lack of it, and a party's good faith effort to comply with the AJ's order. <span class="Italic">Venable v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 14 MSPR 249, 252 (1982) (agency's failure to timely file prehearing submissions should not have led to a sanction when the regional office orders were confusing; although the submission was not sent to the AJ, it was sent to the appellant's representative). The AJ may consider whether both parties contributed to the adjudicative problem; if so, a sanction against only one party is unwarranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 597, 603 (1996) (improper to sanction the appellant for failing to respond to an order concerning the timeliness of an appeal when the problem would not have arisen had OPM submitted its response to the appeal in a timely manner).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming a timely appeal, sanctions will ordinarily not be imposed for filing of untimely submissions without a showing of demonstrable prejudice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Osler v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 539, 542 (1994) (appeal response was a day late and the agency representative belatedly initiated settlement discussions: a party is not entitled to sanctions against an agency for the untimely filing of a submission unless there is a showing of prejudice); <span class="Italic">Hey v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 443, 448-49 (1993) (late response by the agency to an acknowledgment order). The purpose of sanctions is to ensure compliance with orders or regulations, not to cause wholesale dismissals or defaults.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A single or isolated failure to obey an order ought not to result in a sanction<span class="Italic">. In re Bohannon</span>, 1 MSPR 15, 16, 1 MSPB 15 (1979); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 218, 220 &#x00B6; 6 (1999) (single failure to respond to the AJ's show-cause order); <span class="Italic">Averella v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 181, 183 (1993) (applying the "single failure" rule to preclude an AJ from striking, without further notice, evidence submitted by an undesignated representative); <span class="Italic">Roth v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 54 MSPR 172, 176 (1992) (failure to obey a discovery order). Sanctions should be imposed only when a party failed to exercise the basic due diligence expected of it in complying with any order, or when a party exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">Peck v. OPM</span>, 35 MSPR 175, 178 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Rivas v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 584, 589 (1997) (declining to impose sanctions in a compliance case; no indication that the agency acted in bad faith; the agency partially complied with the Board order).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "single violation" rule was explained in <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Dept. of Army</span>, 103 MSPR 462, 466 &#x00B6; 10, 2006 MSPB 285 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that our regulations do not permit dismissal with prejudice as a sanction for failure to comply with a single order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a). Dismissal may be an appropriate sanction for failure to prosecute an appeal, provided that the sanction is necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b).<span class="Italic"></span> However, we have specifically held that the "extreme sanction of dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute should not be imposed for a single instance of failure to comply with a Board order." <span class="Italic">Burnett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 34, 38 (1996). As we discern no bad faith on the part of the appellant, or any evidence that he intended to abandon his appeal, we find that the sanction of dismissal with prejudice was inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Seltzer v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 694, 697 (1991), declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The imposition of sanctions upon a party for failure to follow orders is a matter within an administrative judge's sound discretion, but it must be used only when necessary to serve the ends of justice....&#8197;Further, although the Board is not reluctant to impose sanctions against an agency when it fails to produce testimony or other evidence that is necessary for fair adjudication, sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise the basic due diligence expected of it in <span id="Page_1279"></span>complying with any order, or has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board was none too clear on the definition of the lower levels of actionable misconduct in <span class="Italic">Seltzer</span>, 47 MSPR at 698:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board finds that imposing sanctions on OPM for its failure to respond to the administrative judge's first acknowledgment order and for its late response to the second order was not necessary to serve the ends of justice. OPM's actions did not exhibit negligence or bad faith. Whether it exercised basic diligence is a closer question....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Imposition of sanctions assumes the validity of the underlying ruling. The AJ improperly imposes sanctions for failure to comply with an improper discovery order, e.g., an order to prepare and produce synopses of anticipated testimony. <span class="Italic">Affsa v. USDA</span>, 7 MSPR 446, 452, 7 MSPB 314 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gangi v.

<p class="Body-Text">Because sanctions are serious, and when used improperly undermine confidence in Board impartiality, they should be used sparingly. But they should be used as justified to avoid the appearance of partiality. <span class="Italic">Hazelton v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 170, 172 (1984) ("The presiding official is instructed to impose clear and specific sanctions against the agency for its prior failure to comply with his orders. The sanctions are to be within the discretion of the presiding official in order to serve the ends of justice pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43."). Not every violation of a regulation should result in sanctions. The Board may waive strict enforcement of a procedural regulation if the violation is minor and the other party has not shown harm by the failure to follow the regulation, e.g., the failure to notify appellant immediately of a change in the name on a certificate of service. <span class="Italic">Burton v. VA</span>, 35 MSPR 52, 53-54 n.* (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Frazier v. DMA</span>, 4 MSPR 202, 4 MSPB 281 (1980)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a sanction, for example, denial of a hearing, is imposed for failure to cooperate in discovery procedures, the AJ should notify the parties that the sanction is imposed. <span class="Italic">Abbott v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 18 MSPR 429, 432 (1983). Sanctions imposed must be clearly stated. They should not leave the parties in a state of confusion as to what evidence will be permitted and excluded through the sanction. <span class="Italic">Hazelton v. USPS</span>, 21 MSPR 170, 172 (1984) (sanctions deprived the appellant of needed evidence rather than penalizing the agency for failure to comply with discovery orders).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Once a sanction is imposed by the AJ, the Board will not ordinarily disturb it unless it is shown that the sanction was harmful error. <span class="Italic">Thorne v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 408, 410 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cohen v. GSA</span>, 48 MSPR 451, 460 (1991) (without a showing that an AJ's discretion in imposing a sanction has been abused, the Board will not find reversible error). Should an AJ fail to impose sanctions, the Board is not likely to reverse a case without a showing of how a party was prejudiced by the AJ's inaction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Box v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Baca v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3360), demonstrated the reviewing court's reluctance to set aside a Board decision denying sanctions requested by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Baca also seeks sanctions pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43 against OPM "to deter such outrageous conduct by OPM and to compensate appellant and his family." In particular, Mr. Baca argues that the Board failed to consider the gravity of OPM's conduct and its prejudicial effects on his case. The award of sanctions is committed to the sound discretion of the judge because the judge is in the best position to evaluate the conduct of the parties. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43 ("The judge <span class="Italic">may</span> impose sanctions upon the parties as necessary to serve the ends of justice." (emphasis added)). We will overturn a judge's decision not to impose sanctions only upon a showing that the judge abused his discretion. <span class="Italic">See A. Hirsh, Inc.</span>, 948 F.2d at 1246.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This deferential standard of review is particularly appropriate in this case because Mr. Baca alleges that OPM's conduct during the course of the Board proceeding, including defying the judge's orders, justified sanctions. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1246-47 ("[W]e are mindful that 'no advantage...would result if this Court were to conduct a second-hand review of the facts from the trial court level, as [the trial court has] a better grasp of what is acceptable trial-level practice among litigating members of the bar than will appellate judges.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Capital Sec. Servs., Inc.</span>, 836 F.2d 866, 873 (5th Cir. 1988)). The judge, who described OPM's handling of this matter as "unreasonably protracted," was obviously disturbed by OPM's conduct. Nonetheless, the judge did not impose sanctions, even though invited and authorized by law to do so. After considering the allegations made by Mr. Baca, which he admits the judge considered, we are not convinced the judge abused his discretion in denying the sanctions....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Unlike EEOC (and courts), the Board does not sanction through interim counsel fee awards or other monetary penalties. <span class="Italic">Santiago v. EEOC</span>, 26 MSPR 633, 639 (1985), considered but failed to decide whether an AJ could award monetary sanctions against an appellant who put the agency to some expense as a result of the appellant's failure to appear at a deposition. The Board later determined it lacks authority to order attorney fees as a sanction. <span class="Italic">Puhar v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 71, 73 (1986) (application for fees as sanction against the agency in a discovery dispute). In <span class="Italic">Wobschall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 583, 585-86 (1987), the agency claimed it should be reimbursed for counsel fees and expenses in defending what it considered to be a frivolous appeal, but the Board demurred:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The fact that the Board ultimately determines that it does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues raised by an appellant cannot provide a basis for an award of attorney fees to an agency under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(g) or as a sanction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the agency request can be construed as a request that the Board require the appellant to pay some sum of money to penalize him for filing the instant appeal, we must reach a similar result. Although the Board is a "quasi-judicial agency," it does not have all the powers of a court. Our authority is limited to that granted to us by law, rule, or regulation....&#8197;The agency has cited to no authority--and we can discern none--which would provide any support for the imposition of a monetary penalty on an employee or an applicant as a sanction for filing a "frivolous" petition for appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kuykendall v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 314, 320 (1995), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the Board may impose sanctions on a party "as necessary to serve the ends of justice," it will not do so because of a frivolous appeal. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43. Since the Board's regulations contemplate that dismissal of an appeal is the ultimate sanction, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(a), (b), and a frivolous appeal will be dismissed, an appellant need not be separately sanctioned for bringing such an appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board tends to avoid imposing innovative sanctions at the behest of one party against another party or its counsel. The sanctions employed by the Board are spelled out in its regulations, at 5 CFR 1201.43 (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conerly v.
