<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-290"><span class="space">1.</span> Performance Evaluations</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency may remove someone through adverse action procedures for unsatisfactory performance--proving its case by specific examples of poor work--even if that individual's most recent performance evaluation is fully satisfactory. An agency need not rely on evaluations to support a charge of unsatisfactory performance in an adverse action, but if it does so and the employee's rating is marginal or higher, the Board will not sustain the action. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 508, 510, 4 MSPB 28 (1980). An unsatisfactory performance rating is not necessary for removal under Chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Washington v. USDA</span>, 10 MSPR 465, 468 (1982). If, however, the employee is charged with failing to meet the standards of his position, the charge is not established by a preponderance of the evidence if an evaluation on the alleged deficiency is not at the unsatisfactory level (assuming the evaluation covers the area of deficiency). <span class="Italic">Moretz v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 376, 378 (1984). But if an evaluation is a sham, it will not prevent managers from testifying about, and the Board from relying on, the true state of the appellant's past performance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Turner v. Dept. of Army</span>, 13 MSPR 499, 501-02 (1982) (supervisor testified that he gave the appellant a satisfactory rating, although there were demonstrated performance deficiencies, because he lacked the time to counsel and guide the appellant or to give him another type of rating; another supervisor gave the employee a satisfactory rating because he hoped the appellant's performance would improve). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Murdock-Doughty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 70 MSPR 119, 122-23 (1996) (discouraging the practice of providing a good performance rating and then faulting the employee's performance in adverse action litigation). [Refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-070.html#sec7-69">Performance, Evaluation</a>"; refer to Chapter 9, "<a href="0100-2023-16-079.html#sec9-78">Failure to Use Chapter 43</a>," concerning the relationship of performance evaluations and unacceptable performance actions under Chapter 43.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept that an employee may have an earlier satisfactory rating yet be removed under Chapter 75 for performance-related deficiencies was not new to the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Ward</span>, 225 F.2d 953, 955 (D.C. Cir. 1955), said of the Performance Rating and Veterans Preference Acts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we view appellee's contention it comes down to this: that an employee in the classified civil service can be removed "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of such service," 5 USCA &#x00A7; 652, where the "cause" relates to the employee's performance of his official duties, only if he first has been rated unsatisfactory, and that a performance rating of satisfactory precludes dismissal for "cause" of that sort. Nothing in the applicable statutes, however, expressly provides for such a limitation on discharges for cause and nothing in them compels such a construction. Performance ratings were introduced--long before the adoption of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act--to measure employee performance for the purposes of promotion, retention priority or other adjustments in grade and pay. While an unsatisfactory performance rating may sometimes lead to dismissal for cause, it may also justify lesser personnel action such as transfer to a more suitable position or demotion without severance of employment. On the other hand, though an employee's ordinary over-all performance of duties throughout the rating period may be rated as satisfactory he may still be guilty of conduct in connection with the execution of his official duties, either in particular instances or in a particular aspect of his tasks, which would justify dismissal under 5 USCA, &#x00A7; 652 in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">DeBusk v. United States</span>, 132 Ct. Cl. 790, 796-97 (1955), added:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]here is not necessarily a contradiction between plaintiff's removal and his "Satisfactory" rating. A performance rating evidently is a composite rating which takes into account many phases of a person's work. Even if the character of one's work were such as to cause it to be classed as satisfactory or at least such as one would not want to class as unsatisfactory, yet he may be so defiant toward those under whom he is working and so critical of his co-workers as to disrupt an organization to such a degree as to justify his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Valles v. Dept. of State,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211101192">___F.3d____</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021), concluded the Board should have considered a fully successful rating that arguably encompassed some of the incidents supporting the adverse action removal appellant, but the error was not harmful when the deciding official had considered appellant's performance record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Valles argues that the Board erred in disregarding the "Fully Successful" evaluation because the evaluation rebuts Charge One.[2] On Charge One, the Board rejected Mr. Valles' argument that the evaluation undermined the agency's proof, found no inconsistency between the evaluation and the charge, and instead credited "management's conclusion that [Mr. Valles'] misbehavior presented an issue of misconduct more than performance" and "management's distinction that performance involves an employee who ‘can't do,' while misconduct involves an employee who ‘won't do.'"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In support of his argument, Mr. Valles cites to <span class="Italic">Moretz v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 376, 378 (1984), for the proposition that "a successful performance rating rebuts a charge of failing to meet the standards of a position." Appellant's Opening Br. 37. However, in <span class="Italic">Moretz,</span> the agency relied on the evaluation to establish below standard performance. 19 M.S.P.R. at 378. The Board merely determined that a work evaluation could not sustain a charge of failing to meet the standards of the position because the specifications were based on "scores connoting less than fully satisfactory, but not entirely unsatisfactory, work performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the deciding official did not rely on the evaluation to establish unsatisfactory performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with Mr. Valles that the Board should have considered the evaluation. Issues of misconduct and performance may overlap. In this case, the agency's employee appraisal form itself demonstrates that following instructions can fall within this area of overlap: one performance requirement is that an employee "[f]ollows passport services procedures and directives related to the adjudication of a passport application." At oral argument, the government admitted that the evaluation covers following instructions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Arg. at 14:20-15:06, <a href="http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20-1686_08312021.mp3">http://oralarguments.cafc.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20-1686_08312021.mp3.</a> Under these circumstances, the evaluation was clearly relevant, and the Board was obligated to consider it. In so holding, we do not suggest that the existence of a fully successful performance evaluation bars discipline for matters covered by the evaluation, but merely that the evaluation must be considered in making the determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we also conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the Board's disregard of the evaluation was not reversible error. As an appellate court, we are obligated to apply the rule of harmless error, examining the record "without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties." 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2111. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Shinseki v. Sanders,</span> 556 U.S. 396, 411 (2009); <span class="Italic">Boss v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 908 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (Fed. Cir. 2018); <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 230 F.3d 1333, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Although the test for harmful error can be complex, we think that, in the circumstances of this case, Mr. Valles must show a "likelihood that the result would have been different." <span class="Italic">Sanders,</span> 556 U.S. at 411.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Valles bears the burden of establishing harmful error. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 409-10 (party appealing an administrative decision bears the burden of establishing harmful error); <span class="Italic">see also Palmer v. Hoffman,</span> 318 U.S. 109, 116 (1943) ("He who seeks to have a judgment set aside because of an erroneous ruling carries the burden of showing that prejudice resulted.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Valles has not shown that the consideration of the evaluation would likely lead to a different result on Charge One. He did not dispute at the agency or the Board that any of the events underlying the specifications occurred. Mr. Valles held onto completed applications for three days before passing them along to his supervisor despite being told to move them along "as soon as possible" to limit delays (Specifications 1-4), provided an inaccurate or untimely text update on an application (Specification 5), misplaced applications (Specification 6), held off on working on an application for a day despite being told to do so promptly (Specification 7), and passed along incomplete batches of applications to his supervisor that were not ready for review (Specifications 8-11). Furthermore, five of the eleven specifications in Charge One took place in 2019, after the evaluation period, and thus could not be rebutted by the evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2835"></span>Under these circumstances, Mr. Valles has not shown harmful error with respect to the proof of Charge One.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Penalty Determination</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Penalty determinations must be reasonable based on an analysis of the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.B. at 331-32. "[A]n appropriate penalty must reflect a responsible balancing of the relevant factors." <span class="Italic">Connor v. Dep't of Veterans Affs.</span>, 8 F.4th 1319, 1324-25 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). One such factor is the "nature and seriousness of the offense." <span class="Italic">Douglas,</span> 5 M.S.P.B. at 332. "The choice of penalty is committed to the sound discretion of the employing agency and will not be overturned unless the agency's choice of penalty is wholly unwarranted in light of all the relevant factors." <span class="Italic">Guise v. Dep't of Just.,</span> 330 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall,</span> 178 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 1999)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Valles argues on appeal that the evaluation provides a "dispositive" and "comprehensive assessment of the seriousness of the alleged misconduct." Mr. Valles is correct that his fully successful rating is relevant to the seriousness of the offenses insofar as the offenses occurred during the evaluation period. The Board did not discuss the evaluation in relation to the penalty, though it did cite the agency's decision letter which "took into account [Mr. Valles'] seven years of federal service and job performance." However, here again, Mr. Valles has not shown harmful error even if we assume that the Board erroneously failed to consider the evaluation in connection with the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, even if the Board did not consider the evaluation, the deciding official did consider it. In a thorough analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the deciding official expressly weighed Mr. Valles' evaluation and past work record among other mitigating factors. The deciding official considered whether alternative sanctions might be appropriate, and ultimately decided that "any lesser or alternative sanction [than removal] would be ineffective to stress upon [Mr. Valles] the importance of following management's instructions to avoid potential harm to our U.S. citizen customers and ensure the efficient operations of the Colorado Passport Agency." The fact that the deciding official admitted that he did not read part of the narrative summary portion of the evaluation does not alter the fact that the gist of the evaluation was considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, consideration of the evaluation was not likely to alter the Board's conclusion that the penalty was reasonable. Even if the evaluation suggested that the 2018 events in Charge One were not serious in and of themselves,[3] the failure to follow instructions is undoubtedly a serious matter when it occurs repeatedly over a prolonged period. In affirming the reasonableness of the agency's penalty, the Board "found [the deciding official's] testimony highly credible...about the seriousness and repetitive nature of the misconduct." In the decision letter, the deciding official cited "the repetitive nature of [Mr. Valles'] misconduct" and his "history of consistently ignoring management instructions" in determining that removal was a reasonable penalty. The Board found that the agency's decision letter "meticulously addressed all of the pertinent <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, its repeated nature, and its relationship to [Mr. Valles'] duties." The Board found that the letter "expressly took into account that [Mr. Valles] was clearly on notice of management's expectations, in part based on [his] prior discipline," and also "took into account [Mr. Valles'] seven years of federal service and job performance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Valles also argues that the penalty is unreasonable due to the commonplace nature of his errors. There was no evidence in the record to show that it was commonplace for employees to make errors to the extent that Mr. Valles did. The Board credited testimony that "what distinguished [Mr. Valles] was the frequency of his misconduct, in contrast to his colleagues who would change course after limited guidance or discipline."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The prior discipline concerned the suspension of Mr. Valles in early 2018, in part for a charge of failure to follow instructions. For this earlier charge, Mr. Valles admitted his failure to follow instructions regarding the underlying specifications. Those specifications resemble the ones at issue in Charge One; they involved Mr. Valles keeping active cases in his work-in-progress box for too long, failing to provide appropriate and complete text updates on applications, and stamping or signing applications that were not fully approvable. Five of the eleven specifications of Charge One took place in 2019, after the evaluation period. Given the repetitive nature of the conduct and the deciding official's reliance on this conduct, consideration of the evaluation was not shown to be likely to change the Board's determination of reasonableness.</p>
