<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-126"><span class="space">k.</span> Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an individual who files a USERRA Board appeal was involved in related proceedings in another forum, the Board accepts jurisdiction over the appeal, but the Board then determines whether the appeal is moot because the appellant waived the Board appeal or received from the related litigation everything that could be obtained through the Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 194-96 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under USERRA, the Board has appellate jurisdiction over appeals alleging discrimination in federal employment on account of prior military service. <span class="Italic">See Petersen v. Department of the Interior</span>, 71 MSPR 227, 231-40 (1996). An appeal against a federal executive agency alleging discrimination on the basis of prior military service may be filed directly with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Jasper v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 MSPR 367, 369 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant has alleged that the agency violated USERRA by removing him because of his military training. USERRA gives the Board jurisdiction to hear appeals involving the denial of employment retention, or any benefit of employment, because of prior service in the uniformed service. 38 USC &#x00A7; 4311(a). Thus, absent the appellant's pursuit of his removal with the EEOC and his settlement of that complaint, his USERRA claim would be properly before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Duncan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 73 MSPR 86, 92 (1997). The issue before us, therefore, is whether the EEOC settlement divests us of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that it will review the terms of a settlement agreement and the surrounding circumstances to determine if it retains jurisdiction over an appeal of an action that was settled in another procedural avenue. <span class="Italic">See Perry v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, MSPB Docket No. DC-0752-97-0142-I-1, slip op. at 3 (Jul. 16, 1997); <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 261 (1994). The Board has also found that a presumption exists that Board appeal rights are waived where the other procedural avenue is a grievance, and the settlement of that grievance does not specifically reserve the right to file a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 261-62. We find, however, that this presumption does not apply to the present case because the other avenue here is an EEO complaint, and the appellant's claims there and before us now seek to vindicate different substantive rights that arise under different statutory schemes--Title VII, 42 USC 2000e-2 (1988), and USERRA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 262; <span class="Italic">Rivas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 MSPR 121, 129-30 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, 72 MSPR 383 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board treats a settlement such as the one at issue here, that is not made a part of its record and is reached free of Board intervention, as a contract. <span class="Italic">See Perry</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">Collier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 51 MSPR 513, 515 (1991). The interpretation of the settlement is, therefore, a matter of law based on the words of the agreement itself, and where the words are ambiguous, upon parol evidence. <span class="Italic">Perry</span>, slip op. at 3; <span class="Italic">Laity</span>, 61 MSPR at 261.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The settlement at issue before us does not waive the appellant's right to pursue his USERRA discrimination claim regarding his removal with the Board. The agreement covers three EEO complaints. It states that, in an "effort to resolve this matter," the agency agreed to remove all discipline from the appellant's files, and reinstate him with back pay, including any overtime he would have earned since his removal. The agreement further states that the appellant agreed to withdraw "all EEO cases, whether formal or informal, as of November 2, 1995," that the settlement also "<span id="Page_1055"></span>resolves any and all grievances pending," and that the appellant waived his rights to "any further appeal of [his] allegations(s) [sic] through the EEO process."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agreement, therefore, resolved all existing EEO complaints and grievances, and only waived the appellant's right to pursue his existing allegations through the EEOC process. We find the agreement unambiguous in this regard and conclude that it did not waive the appellant's right to bring his USERRA claim to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, however, the Board may lose jurisdiction over a matter that would otherwise be properly before it, if the appellant has received all of the relief he would have received had he prevailed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Department of the Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 386, 387 (1996).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Where the Board determines that a federal executive agency has violated USERRA, it is required to enter an order directing the agency or employee to comply with the violated provisions and to "compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance." 38 USC &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). USERRA further provides that this compensation is in addition to any other right or benefit provided under 38 USC Chapter 43, such as the right to make up benefits to employee pension benefit plans, and that the Board may, in its discretion, also award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4318, 4324(c)(3) and (c)(4). USERRA's legislative history indicates that Congress intended only these enumerated remedies. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As mentioned above, the settlement here provides for the appellant to be "reinstated with back pay to include any overtime he would have earned for the removal." Without more, we are unable to determine whether reinstating the appellant into his former position, with back pay that includes overtime, constitutes the USERRA remedy of compensation for any loss of wages or benefits. If the appellant suffered some other wage or benefit loss unrelated to back pay or overtime, he would be entitled to a greater remedy under USERRA, and his appeal would, therefore, be properly before us. If, however, the terms of the settlement contemplated lost wages or benefits, then the appellant would have received all of the relief he could receive under USERRA, and the agency's failure to provide these benefits should be pursued through the EEOC enforcement mechanism. We, therefore, find that this aspect of the settlement is ambiguous and parol evidence is necessary to ascertain the parties' intent regarding the pay and benefits the appellant was to receive upon his reinstatement under the settlement. <span class="Italic">See Greco v.

<p class="Body-Text">A USERRA appeal was mooted by successful pursuit of a VEOA claim that the agency improperly denied the appellant consideration for a position, <span class="Italic">Isabella v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]t is unnecessary to resolve definitively whether the appellant's military status was a substantial or motivating factor in the agency's decision to terminate its consideration of the appellant's application because our disposition of the appellant's VEOA appeal renders the appellant's USERRA appeal moot. Mootness can arise at any stage of litigation, and an appeal is moot when, by virtue of an intervening event, the Board cannot grant any effectual relief because the appellant has obtained, by whatever means, all of the relief he could have obtained had he prevailed before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Moore v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 689, &#x00B6; 6 (2006); <span class="Italic">see also Fernandez v. Department of Justice,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 443, &#x00B6; 5 (2007) (for an appeal to be deemed moot, the employee must have received all of the relief that he could have received "if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA provides that the Board, upon determining that an executive agency has not complied with the provisions of USERRA, "shall enter an order requiring the agency...to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). In this case, even if the appellant established that his military status was a substantial factor in the agency's decision to terminate consideration of his application, the appellant did not establish that the agency would have appointed him if it had continued to process his application. Thus, the only relief the Board could order with respect to the appellant's USERRA appeal would be an order directing the agency to continue to process his application. <span class="Italic">See Tully v. Department of Justice,</span> 58 Fed. Appx. 501, 503 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (NP) (where the appellant established that the agency did not process his applications for various positions in retaliation for his past USERRA appeals, a Board order directing the agency to process his applications was the relief to which the appellant was entitled). The appellant is already entitled to such an order, however, as a result of the Board's disposition of his VEOA appeal. In addition, like USERRA, VEOA also requires the Board to award compensation for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by the individual by reason of the violation involved, but the provisions of VEOA are more generous than the provisions of USERRA with respect to damages[14] and attorney fees and litigation expenses. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4) (the Board may, in its discretion, award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses to a person for whom the Board issues an order requiring an agency to comply with the provisions of USERRA) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b) (the Board shall award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses to a preference eligible who prevails in an action under VEOA). Thus, there is no effective relief that we could order with regard to the appellant's USERRA appeal in addition to the relief we are ordering with regard to the appellant's VEOA appeal. Accordingly, we DISMISS the appellant's USERRA appeal is moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;Other than an award of compensation for lost wages and benefits, USERRA does not provide for the award of damages, while VEOA requires the Board to award an amount equal to back pay as liquidated damages if it finds that the agency's violation was willful. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">For an appeal to be rendered moot, an appellant must receive all of the relief that he could have received "if the matter had been adjudicated and he had prevailed." <span class="Italic">Harris v.

U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 191, 198 (1996).

<p class="Block-Quote1">A different rule applies when an appellant seeks corrective action for retaliation for whistleblowing. In such a case, the appellant's potential recovery of attorney fees prevents an appeal from being rendered moot. <span class="Italic">Turner v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 476, &#x00B6; 6 (2004); <span class="Italic">Walton v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 401, 403-04 (1998). This is so because the applicable statutory provision states that, when the Board finds whistleblower retaliation, "[c]orrective action shall include attorney's fees and costs." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g)(1)(B). In other words, in whistleblower cases, the recovery of attorney fees incurred by the appellant is part of the relief on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorney fees in USERRA cases such as this are covered under a separate statutory provision, i.e., 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324. Under that provision, the appellant's recovery of attorney fees is not part of the relief on the merits. The relevant portion of section 4324 provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)(1) The Merit Systems Protection Board shall adjudicate any complaint brought before the Board pursuant to subsection (a)(2)(A) or (b), without regard as to whether the complaint accrued before, on, or after October 13, 1994. A person who seeks a hearing or adjudication by submitting such a complaint under this paragraph may be represented at such hearing or adjudication in accordance with the rules of the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If the Board determines that a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management [OPM] has not complied with the provisions of this chapter relating to the employment or reemployment of a person by the agency, the Board shall enter an order requiring the agency or [OPM] to comply with such provisions and to compensate such person for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Any compensation received by a person pursuant to an order under paragraph (2) shall be in addition to any other right or benefit provided for by this chapter and shall not diminish any such right or benefit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;If the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board pursuant to subsection (b) that such person is entitled to an order referred to in paragraph (2), the Board may, in its discretion, award such person reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324. Unlike the statute governing corrective action in whistleblower cases, which expressly makes attorney fee awards part of <span id="Page_1056"></span>the relief on the merits, USERRA treats attorney fee awards as separate from relief on the merits. Thus, a successful USERRA appellant is entitled to "an order requiring the agency or [OPM] to comply with" the provisions of USERRA that have been violated and "to compensat[ion]...for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by such person by reason of such lack of compliance." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). The Board has the "discretion" to award attorney fees to the appellant in a USERRA case if the Board has already determined that he is entitled to an order referred to in 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that, based upon the structure and language of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c), a USERRA appeal is covered by the general mootness principles that the Board has developed for cases governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).
