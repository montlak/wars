<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-199"><span class="space">d.</span> Elections; 70% Rule</h5>
<p class="noindent">An election is not required in a unit clarification proceeding involving a claimed successorship unless the gained unit is larger than the gaining unit, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BLM, Sacramento, Cal. and NFFE Local 951</span>, 53 FLRA 1417, 1420-22 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span> [52 FLRA 1084 (1997)], the Authority considered both Authority and National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) precedent to determine how to evaluate whether an election is necessary to determine the representation rights of transferred employees. The Authority stated that it and the NLRB have found a question concerning representation, and therefore directed an election, in only a limited number of situations in cases where successorship or accretion are otherwise appropriate. The Authority further stated that "[u]nion majority status among employees in the gaining entity is crucial to such a determination." <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1091, citing <span class="Italic">Geo. V. Hamilton, Inc.</span>, 289 NLRB 1335 (1988). The Authority noted that both it and the NLRB have found that an election would be necessary to determine representation after a reorganization or consolidation when the number of unrepresented employees in the gaining entity exceeds the number of represented employees. Additionally, the Authority noted that the NLRB also has found an election necessary after a reorganization when more than one labor organization represents employees transferred into the new unit. With respect to the employees involved in <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, the Authority concluded that, "[a]s the transferred [represented] employees constitute a majority of the employees of the gaining entity, and no other labor organization represents, or seeks to represent, the transferred employees," no election was necessary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity does not dispute the fact that, under the Authority's current standard in successorship situations, an election is necessary to determine representation after a reorganization or consolidation when the number of unrepresented employees in the gaining entity exceeds the number of represented employees.[4] Rather, it seeks to modify this standard by requiring an election in a successorship situation when the number of unrepresented employees in the gaining entity <span class="Italic">nearly equals</span> the number of represented employees. The Activity's argument is premised on its contention that the Authority applies such a standard in accretion situations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Because a finding of successorship under the Statute results in continued recognition, without a new, secret ballot election, successorship depends on the fact that the affected union is the choice of a majority of employees in the claimed successor's unit. <span class="Italic">See Port Hueneme</span>, 50 FLRA at 370-71. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Defense Supply Agency</span>, 3 FLRC at 802 (if successorship requirements are satisfied, then there "is no requirement that a new secret ballot election be conducted, since the election requirement...was already satisfied at the time the previous recognition was accorded").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity accurately states that the Authority has stated that a "nearly equals or exceeds" standard applies in accretion cases.[5] In this regard, the Authority stated, in two cases, that a "nearly equals or exceeds" standard applies in accretion cases. Those two cases are: (1) <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command, Wright-Patterson</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force Base</span>, 47 FLRA 602, 612 (1993) <span class="Italic">(Wright-Patterson);</span> and (2) <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1089.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Activity mistakenly cites <span class="Italic">HHS Region</span> II, 43 FLRA at 1255-56, as the source of that standard. In <span class="Italic">HHS Region II</span>, the Authority referenced NLRB cases in which the NLRB refused to find an accretion, and the NLRB ordered an election where the number of unrepresented employees sought to be accreted to an existing unit was <span class="Italic">equal to or greater than</span> the number of employees in the established unit. There was no "nearly equals or exceeds" standard either referred to or applied in <span class="Italic">HHS</span> <span class="Italic">Region II</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, the Authority found that following a consolidation, a smaller group of unrepresented employees accreted to an existing bargaining unit containing a larger number of employees. The Authority rejected the activity's argument that an election was needed and referenced the "nearly equals or exceeds" standard as an exception to the general rule that elections are not needed to clarify the bargaining unit status of employees. The Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">With one exception, elections are not conducted when there is an <span id="page_209"></span>attempt to clarify the bargaining unit status of employees. That exception, involving situations where the number of employees proposed for inclusion nearly equals or exceeds the number of employees in the existing unit, was found not to apply here because the existing unit contains considerably more employees than are sought to be accreted. Consequently, an election is not warranted<span class="Italic">. See, HHS, Region II</span>, 43 FLRA at 1255-56.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, the Authority found that, following a transfer, a larger group of represented employees joined a smaller group of unrepresented employees in a successor organization; that an election was not necessary to determine representation; and that the unit was appropriate for inclusion in a consolidated bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, 52 FLRA at 1089.

<p class="noindent-1">Neither <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, nor the parenthetical describing it in <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>, explained why the phrase "nearly equals" was added to the standard previously set forth in other accretion cases, including <span class="Italic">HHS Region</span> II and the NLRB precedent cited therein. The Activity has not explained, and it is not apparent to us, why the Authority should depart from the "majority" standard. That standard recognizes that there is no need for an election where a majority of the employees are represented, since the election requirement was already satisfied when the exclusive representative was certified. In addition, that standard, unlike the standard of "nearly equals," is capable of being administered in a clear, unambiguous manner. For these reasons, we will continue to apply the majority standard in accretion cases involving groups of represented and unrepresented employees. Accordingly, to the extent the Authority previously stated that the "nearly equals or exceeds" standard applies in accretion cases, those cases will no longer be followed.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;We are not addressing, and leave for discussion in future appropriate cases, the circumstances under which an election may be necessary in accretion situations other than those involved in <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span> and <span class="Italic">SSA Valdosta</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The issue of when a merger of two units and two potentially competing unions requires an election, or when one unit is sufficiently predominant that an election is not needed, arose in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Aviation Missile Command and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 56 FLRA 126, 126-27, 129-32 (2000). FLRA concluded that, "absent special circumstances, not present here, a union that represents more than 70 percent of the employees in a newly combined unit formerly represented by two or more unions is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue on which the Authority granted review concerns whether an election is necessary between two groups of employees, represented by different labor organizations, who have been assigned to a newly created appropriate unit where one union claims to represent a sufficiently predominant number of employees to avoid an election. The Authority directed the parties to file briefs and published a Notice in the Federal Register inviting interested parties to file briefs as <span class="Italic">amici curiae</span>, to address the following questions:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">1.&#x2003;Should the Authority's "successorship" and/or "accretion" doctrine be modified to apply to situations where more than one unit of employees represented by different exclusive collective bargaining representatives are transferred to (a) a <span class="Italic">new</span> <span class="Italic">entity</span> with a new mission or (b) a <span class="Italic">new entity</span> with a mission that is a combination of the missions of previously existing organizations? If so, why, and what should the modification be?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">2.&#x2003;Is a question concerning representation necessarily raised when more than one group of employees, represented by different labor organizations, are transferred to a newly established organization, and neither our current successorship doctrine nor our current accretion doctrine permits certification without an election? If not, is it consistent with the Statute and appropriate to apply the "sufficiently predominant" or some other doctrine to determine whether an election is not required?</p>
<p class="noindent-2">3.&#x2003;If Authority doctrine is modified, what guidelines, numerical or otherwise, should the Authority use to determine whether a group represented by one labor organization is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons that follow, we find that the Department of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, is a successor employer, and that the employees represented by AFGE Local 1858 are sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary. Accordingly, we clarify the units represented by AFGE Local 1858 to include former employees of the two commands who transferred to the successor employer, and we amend the certification to reflect the change in name of the activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;Background and Regional Director's Decision</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case arose as a result of a reorganization that disestablished two commands and moved their former employees, represented by different labor organizations, into a newly created entity. Aviation Troop Command, known as ATCOM, in St. Louis, Missouri, and U.S. Army Missile Command, or MICOM, located at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, were disestablished. Both had been activities within the Army Materiel Command (AMC). On October 1, 1997, a new entity, the Army Aviation Missile Command, or AMCOM, was established as an activity within AMC and the former ATCOM and MICOM employees were transferred to AMCOM, which is located at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to the reorganization, NFFE Local 405 represented an exclusive unit of professional/nonprofessional employees of the former ATCOM, in St. Louis. Of the 1,453 employees in this unit, 1,384 accepted transfer when ATCOM was disestablished and became part of the newly created AMCOM. At the same time, when MICOM was disestablished, its 4,711 unit employees stationed at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, represented in separate professional and nonprofessional units by AFGE Local 1858, likewise became part of AMCOM. The petitions raise the issue of whether there is a question concerning representation (QCR) regarding the 1,384 former ATCOM employees represented by NFFE and the 4,711 former MICOM employees represented by AFGE, or whether an election is unnecessary and employees of both former activities who are now employed by AMCOM should be represented by AFGE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;AMCOM Is A Successor Employer</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The analytical framework for resolving a representation petition after a reorganization, when both successorship and accretion principles are claimed to apply, is set out in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Fleet and Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia</span>, 52 FLRA 950, 958-59 (1997) (<span class="Italic">FISC</span>). As pertinent here, the Authority first will determine whether the new group of employees are included in, and constitute a majority of a separate appropriate unit. Having so found, the Authority will then apply the remaining successorship principles as set out in that case and <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority set out the test in full in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>. Thus, it will find that a gaining entity is a successor, and a union retains its status as the exclusive representative of employees who are transferred to the successor, when:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;An entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred and the transferred employees: (a) are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; [4] and (b) constitute a majority of the employees in such unit;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;The gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;It has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As pertinent here, regarding the requirements of the first factor or prong, it is undisputed, and the Regional Director found, that the former ATCOM and MICOM employees constitute a separate, appropriate unit in the newly established AMCOM organization.[4] Furthermore, the transferred employees constitute a majority of the new unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The parties stipulated that units of all professional employees of AMCOM and all nonprofessional employees of AMCOM, are appropriate units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prong two requires that the claimed successor have substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity and that transferred employees perform substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions after the transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director determined that AMCOM is not a successor employer because, for two reasons, it does not meet the requirements of prong two. In this regard, the Regional Director concluded first that its mission is a combination of the missions of the former ATCOM and MICOM organizations, and that AMCOM therefore does not have substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We adopt the Regional Director's statement of the legal standard, which is that missions of the former and gaining employers be substantially the same and that the transferred employees perform substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions, and <span id="page_210"></span>her factual determination that AMCOM's mission is a combination of the missions of ATCOM and MICOM. However, we conclude, contrary to the Regional Director, that this combined mission represents substantially the same organizational mission as those of the two predecessor organizations.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Application for Review was granted "to determine whether to develop a 'sufficiently predominant' or other theory to apply to cases where a reorganization has disestablished activities and placed their former employees in a newly created entity, where the employees were exclusively represented by more than one labor organization." 55 FLRA at 643. The Petitioner's Application regarding prong two of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> claimed that the Regional Director interpreted "substantially similar" as being nearly identical....&#8197;We determined that the Regional Director articulated and used the correct legal standard. 55 FLRA at 643 n.7. However, in light of our reservation of judgment as to whether a "sufficiently predominant" number of the larger unit was present to avoid a QCR, we did not analyze whether the Regional Director properly applied the prong two standard. As set forth below, we now adopt and apply a definition of "sufficiently predominant" numbers in a new unit to determine that prong three of the successorship doctrine has been met in this case. As a result, it is necessary to assess whether the new organization's mission complies with the test under prong two of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>. In that regard, for the reasons discussed, <span class="Italic">infra</span>, we conclude that the Regional Director's original holding as to prong two of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> is incorrect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no claim that the combination of missions represents any new elements not found in one or the other of the disestablished organizations.&#x2003;Rather, the mission of one entity was added to that of another when the new organization was created, combining the missions of the disestablished organizations. This is not a case of combining two disestablished entities with the result that an entirely new mission has been created. When more than one group of employees is transferred into a new entity, the potential exists for the blending of the two missions into the gaining employer while maintaining a mission in the new entity that is substantially the same as the missions of the disestablished organizations, as we have found here. Therefore, AMCOM satisfies this aspect of the prong two requirements to be a successor employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Regional Director concluded, second, that the requirements of prong two were not met because over a third of the unit employees were no longer performing substantially the same duties and functions, and the work environment of many had changed. Thus, employees now are relocated throughout AMCOM. The Regional Director also found that a number of employees picked up additional and different job functions, while some did not. Further, some employees received training to perform their additional duties and some employees changed jobs altogether. However, most of the examples the Regional Director relied upon consist of employees performing the same function, but applying it to both aviation and missile operations. For example, the Regional Director noted that "MICOM employees who worked with missiles now work on aviation functions," but are performing the same task....&#8197;Similarly, program analysts deal with matters related to the aviation function as well as the missile systems. Based on the record as a whole, we do not find this a sufficient basis for concluding that the changes in duties, functions and working conditions were so great as to no longer be substantially the same or similar, respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where prong two is thus satisfied, we proceed to prong three. If it has not been demonstrated that an election is necessary, successorship is established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;AFGE Represents A Sufficiently Predominant Number of Employees In AMCOM To Make An Election Unnecessary</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third prong of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> test to determine whether a gaining entity is a successor employer is whether it has been demonstrated that an election is necessary. The Authority has recognized that when more than one labor organization has represented employees in a new unit, one group may be "sufficiently predominant" to render an election unnecessary. <span class="Italic">See Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Columbus, Columbus, Ohio</span>, 53 FLRA 1114, 1134 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus</span>). However, the Authority has yet to define when a group is sufficiently predominant.[6] The Petitioners and the General Counsel, <span class="Italic">amicus</span>, expressed different views.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The numbers of employees in the two groups in <span class="Italic">DLA, Columbus</span> were so close that the case did not present an opportunity for the Authority to set a standard. In determining that an election was necessary, the decision noted that the two groups, of 212 and 198 unit employees, were "virtually equal in number," and that therefore there was no evidence that either group was sufficiently predominant to remove the question concerning representation. 53 FLRA at 1134.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE suggests that if one group constitutes at least 10 percent of the combined employees in the new unit, this should be seen as a substantial showing of interest sufficient for an election. In other words, a union would have to represent more than 90 percent of the unit to find that it is sufficiently predominant to become the representative of all employees in the unit without an election. AFGE and the General Counsel state that 70 percent should be the guideline. Furthermore, the General Counsel states that there may be special circumstances where an election is necessary in a new unit even though more than 70 percent of the employees are represented by one union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We take as the guiding principle for determining whether one group is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary whether there is a reasonable assurance of a meaningful contest.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. U.S. Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast Guard Finance Center, Chesapeake, Virginia</span>, 34 FLRA 946, 949 (1990) (requirement for showing of interest helps to avoid unnecessary expenditure of time and funds where there is no reasonable assurance that a genuine representation question exists). We also note with approval the practice of the NLRB, which will not direct an election where it would be a useless exercise or prejudicial to the dominant group<span class="Italic">. See DLA, Columbus</span>, 53 FLRA at 1134, citing NLRB cases. If there is no reasonable assurance that the smaller group could succeed in an election, the holding of such a contest would be a waste of time and resources, since the predominant group already has voted for its representative. The statutory requirement of section 7111(a) that an exclusive representative be selected in a secret ballot election by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit is thus fulfilled.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the measure of "sufficiently predominant," both the General Counsel and the AFGE draw our attention to the fact that a 30 percent showing of interest is required by the Statute for a petitioner to gain an election where there is not an exclusive representative, or where there is an allegation that an exclusive representative no longer represents a majority. Section 7111(b)(1)(A) and (B).[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;We note, in addition, that experience in the private sector has led the NLRB to promulgate a rule that a 30 percent showing of interest is required to raise a QCR by a petitioning labor organization or a person seeking decertification. NLRB Rules and Regulations, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 101.18(a) (1999). The Board also has applied a 30 percent rule involving such voluntary recognition situations as, for example, where a voluntary recognition barred the processing of a subsequent petition unless the petitioner demonstrated that it had a 30 percent showing of interest at the time of recognition. <span class="Italic">Smith's Food and Drug Centers, Inc.</span>, 320 NLRB 844 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NFFE's argument that its situation here is like that of an intervenor, which needs only a 10 percent showing of interest to gain participation in an election under the Statute, ignores an important distinction. Here, a 30 percent showing of interest would determine whether a QCR exists, requiring an election, in contrast to whether an intervenor with a 10 percent showing of interest may participate in an election where a QCR already exists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, absent special circumstances, not present here, a union that represents more than 70 percent of the employees in a newly combined unit formerly represented by two or more unions is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise.[8] In such a situation, prong three of <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span> is satisfied through the determination that an election would be unnecessary. We base our conclusion on a finding that unless the smaller group consists of at least 30 percent, absent special circumstances, there is no question concerning representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;"Special circumstances" would include cases where there is clear evidence that the percentage of employees represented by the unions in the separate, appropriate unit is not a dispositive indicator of their respective strength. For example, where the smaller union produces reliable evidence that it is supported by more than 30 percent of the employees in the proposed unit, the larger union's historical representation of more than 70 percent of the employees in the newly combined unit would not establish that it is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, as AFGE represented the 4,711 MICOM employees who transferred to AMCOM, compared to the 1,384 ATCOM employees who transferred and were formerly represented by NFFE, AFGE is sufficiently predominant, representing more than 77 percent of eligible employees, so as to render an election unnecessary. No special circumstances were alleged. Accordingly, we clarify the units represented by AFGE Local 1858 to include former employees of the two commands who transferred to the successor employer, and we amend the certification to reflect the change in name of the activity, which is now Department of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">V.&#x2003;Order</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petition by AFGE Local 1858, AFL-CIO, in AT-RP-80005, is granted. The former MICOM units represented by AFGE are clarified to include <span id="page_211"></span>all the professional and nonprofessional employees, respectively, who are employed at the new AMCOM facility, which is the successor to the former ATCOM and MICOM organizations. The certification of AFGE Local 1858 is amended to state that the activity is Department of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having found that no question concerning representation exists, the petition by NFFE Local 405, in ATRP-80007, is dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The 70% rule was again discussed in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Human Resources Serv. Ctr. and AFGE</span>, <a href="http://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-075.html">61 FLRA 408</a>, 411-12 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD applied <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span> in finding that, as certain labor organizations were substantially predominant in the various bargaining units following a reorganization, there was no need to conduct an election in those units. In discussing the requirements used to determine whether a gaining entity is a successor employer, such that an election among labor unions that previously represented employees in the new unit is not necessary, the Authority held in<span class="Italic"> Redstone Arsenal</span> that, "absent special circumstances...a union that represents more than 70 percent of the employees in a newly combined unit formerly represented by two or more unions is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise." 56 FLRA at 131 (citation omitted). In reaching this result, the Authority cited, with approval, the practice of the National Labor Relations Board, which, in interpreting the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), has declined to direct an election where doing so would be a useless exercise or prejudicial to the dominant group. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>Here, the RD found, based on the numerical representation of the bargaining units, that IFPTE, Local 12 was substantially predominant in two of the newly combined units because it represented more than 70 percent of the employees in each of the newly combined units and that BMTC was substantially predominant in the third unit for the same reason. The RD concluded that no elections were necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The applicant does not contest the RD's factual determinations. Instead, the applicant claims that he was not permitted to determine his new exclusive representative through an election and, as a consequence, that he was denied his &#x00A7; 7102 right "to form, join, or assist any labor organization[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As was made clear in <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>, where, following an agency reorganization, there is an issue concerning the continued representational status of existing bargaining units, no election is required, in the absence of special circumstances, where one union is sufficiently predominant. This principle recognizes that "[i]f there is no reasonable assurance that the smaller group [of represented employees] could succeed in an election, the holding of such a contest would be a waste of time and resources, since the predominant group already has voted for its representative. The statutory requirement of section 7111(a) that an exclusive representative be selected in a secret ballot election by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit is thus fulfilled." 56 FLRA at 131. <span class="Italic">See also Dep't of the Interior, Bur. of Land Management, Sacramento, </span>Calif., 53 FLRA 1417, 1420-21 n.4 (1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Defense Supply Agency, Defense Property Disposal Office, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen, Md.</span>, 3 FLRC 789, 802 (1975) ("if successorship requirements are satisfied, then there 'is no requirement that a new secret ballot election be conducted, since the election requirement...was already satisfied at the time the previous recognition was accorded'")). <span class="Italic">Cf. Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Supply Center Columbus, Columbus, </span>O<span class="Italic">h</span>io, 53 FLRA 1114, 1134 (1998) (where accretion and successorship are not established, the Authority's practice is to order a self-determination election where more than one bargaining unit is appropriate).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, there is no requirement--and the applicant points to none--that employees must always be given an opportunity to vote on which exclusive representative will represent them. To the contrary, the Authority has held in certain circumstances that employees do not have a choice in the identity of their exclusive representative. For example, in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Fleet and Industrial Supply Ctr., Norfolk, Va.,</span> 52 FLRA 950 (1997), the Authority affirmed a Regional Director's decision finding that, after a reorganization, employees in two different units represented by two different labor organizations had accreted to other units that were in existence prior to the reorganization and that were represented by other labor organizations. In like fashion, the Authority has held that new employees are automatically included in an existing unit where their positions fall within the express terms of a unit certification and their inclusion would not render the unit inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, Fort Dix, Fort Dix, New Jersey</span>, 53 FLRA 287 (1997), and cases therein at 294.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, nothing in the Statute or Authority or private sector case law required that an election be conducted. Insofar as certain unions were found to be sufficiently predominant in each of the affected bargaining units following the reorganization, it would have been a useless exercise to hold an election in the units because there would have been no "reasonable assurance of a meaningful contest." <span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>, 56 FLRA at 131. The fact that the applicant may not have voted for the union that was found to be sufficiently predominant does not establish that he was required to have been given an opportunity to vote on a new exclusive representative and does not establish that his &#x00A7; 7102 rights were violated.</p>
