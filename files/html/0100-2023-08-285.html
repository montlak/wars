<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-280"><span class="space">4.</span> Liberal Pleading Standard</h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 110 MSPR 191, 194-95 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10, 2008 MSPB 237 (2008), summarized decisions establishing MSPB USERRA jurisdiction on what amount to conclusory allegations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over a USERRA discrimination appeal, an appellant must allege that: (1) He performed duty or has an obligation to perform duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) the agency denied him initial employment, reemployment, retention, promotion, or any benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to the performance of duty or obligation to perform duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Department of the Interior</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 24 (2008); <span class="Italic">Dale v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 14, <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 199 Fed. Appx. 948 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A claim of discrimination under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether it is non-frivolous, particularly where, as here, the appellant is <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. <span class="Italic">Baney v. Department of Justice</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 14 (2008). Our reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has noted with approval the Board's "liberal approach in determining whether jurisdiction exists under USERRA." <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1998). The weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop his contentions, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Randall v. Department of Justice</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 5 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record shows, and the agency does not dispute, that the appellant performed duty in a uniformed service of the United States. The appellant asserted under penalty of perjury that he is "a preference-eligible veteran, performed uniformed military service from April 11, 1968 to December 10, 1976," and "received an honorable discharge." Further, the agency acknowledged that the appellant is a veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the appellant alleged that he applied under Job Announcement PHJB-6-104547-S1 for a position as a TCO in Las Vegas, San Jose, and San Rafael; that he was not selected; that several non-veterans were selected; and that the agency's actions were taken because of his prior military service. To support his allegations, he submitted evidence that he appeared on the list of eligibles for the positions and that non-veterans were selected instead of him. Indeed, the agency conceded that it "made a mistake in the San Rafael selection." Contrary to the AJ's unsupported statement, evidence that the agency hired a non-veteran instead of the appellant <span class="Italic">does</span> constitute a non-frivolous allegation of discrimination sufficient to establish USERRA jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6 (2007); <span class="Italic">Dale</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 646, &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">From <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-4324-16-0662-I-1 (NP 8/25/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two types of cases arise under USERRA: (1) reemployment cases, in which the appellant claims that an agency has not met its obligations under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4312-4318 following the appellant's absence from civilian employment to perform uniformed service; and (2) "discrimination" cases, in which the appellant claims that an agency has taken an action prohibited by 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) or (b). <span class="Italic">Clavin v.

Under this approach, the relative weakness of the specific factual allegations initially made by an appellant in his USERRA claim should not serve as the basis for dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if he fails to develop those allegations, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Beck</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 504, &#x00B6; 8. Thus, to establish jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, the appellant need only allege the following: (1) he served in the military; (2) he was denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or a benefit of employment; and (3) the denial was due to his service in the military. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to establish Board jurisdiction over his USERRA claim. However, in light of the liberal pleading standard applied in such cases, we find that the appellant's contentions that the agency denied him initial employment on the basis of his status as a veteran are sufficient to establish jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Beck</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 504, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Searcy v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board has found that an appellant's mere assertions that he is a veteran and he has been denied employment are not sufficient to raise a USERRA claim. <span class="Italic">See McBride v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 411, 415 (1998) (the fact that the appellant's injury occurred while performing military service is incidental to her disability discrimination claim and does not bring the claim within USERRA's jurisdiction). An appellant must also allege that the agency refused to hire him based on his military service or his status as a veteran. <span class="Italic">See Hammond v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 8 (2005). In other words, an appellant must allege that the agency discriminated against him because of his prior military service or his current obligation to perform service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has asserted, and the agency does not dispute, that he is a preference eligible disabled veteran. He further alleged that he previously worked for a component of the agency, the U.S. Census Bureau, as a crew leader for the 1990 decennial census and as a Field Operations Supervisor during the 2000 census. The appellant re-applied for a position for the 2010 census in August 2008, and he received notice from the agency on June 10, 2009, that he was no longer being considered for employment because a criminal background check in August 2008 resulted in a tentative match showing that he has an arrest record, he had been notified of the opportunity to respond to the background check in August 2008, and he had failed to respond within the 30-day window provided to him. The appellant appealed alleging that he was denied employment because he is a disabled veteran and because he was part of a "group law suit for overtime in the 2000 census." On review, the appellant asserts that the AJ erred in denying him his <span id="Page_465"></span>requested hearing and in denying him a telephone conference to clarify the issues in his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted below that the Census Bureau conducts standard criminal history background checks on all decennial census job applicants, and that its determination that it would not consider the appellant for a position was simply in accordance with its standard procedure when an applicant fails to meet the 30-day deadline for responding to a tentative match during the background check. The agency contended that it did not discriminate against the appellant based upon his prior uniformed service. The agency further asserted that its Census Hiring and Employment Check staff, which determined that the appellant would no longer be considered for employment, is only given enough information about applicants to perform the background check. Therefore, they would have been unaware of the appellant's past uniformed service. The agency, thus, argued that the appellant cannot make a non-frivolous allegation that his uniformed service was a substantial or motivating factor in its determination to deny him employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant established jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal. Specifically, he has made a non-frivolous allegation that he performed duty in a uniform service of the United States, that the agency was aware of his prior uniformed service, and that it denied him employment in a temporary decennial census position. In addition, he has made a non-frivolous allegation that the agency denied his application to be re-employed in a position that he previously held, in part, because of his prior uniformed service. This is sufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a USERRA violation. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Army,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 5 (2008). With regard to the agency's arguments below regarding the weakness of the appellant's assertions in support of his USERRA claim, these are matters which should be decided on the merits and are not the basis to dismiss the USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Randall,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 524, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because jurisdiction has been established, on remand, the appellant must prove by preponderant evidence that his military status was at least a motivating or substantial factor in the agency's decision to deny him employment. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The appellant may meet this burden by using direct or indirect evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1014. Discriminatory motivation under USERRA may be reasonably inferred from such circumstantial evidence as temporal proximity between the appellant's military activity and the adverse employment action, "inconsistencies between the proffered reason and other actions of the employer, an employer's expressed hostility towards members protected by the statute together with knowledge of the [individual's] military activity, and disparate treatment of certain [individuals] compared to other [individuals] with similar work records or offenses." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> If the appellant meets his burden, the burden shifts to the agency to prove that legitimate reasons, standing alone, would have induced it to take the same action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The minimalist approach to USERRA pleading was accepted in <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. USDA</span>, DC-4324-15-0636-I-1 (NP 11/23/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found, and the agency does not dispute, that the appellant alleged that her second-line supervisor was motivated by her military service in terminating her employment. Although the administrative judge found that the appellant did not "explain the basis for her belief," she was not required to do so at the jurisdictional stage of her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1155, 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (reversing a finding that the appellant's "vague and generalized statements" were insufficient to establish jurisdiction under USERRA); <span class="Italic">Searcy v.

Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 10 (2009) (finding that a claim by an appellant that "agency officials didn't like the fact" of his military service was sufficient to establish jurisdiction over his USERRA appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, as the appellant argues on review, she raised specific allegations below that her second-line supervisor was motivated by her military service in terminating her employment. We recognize that the appellant's pleadings below were not a model of clarity and that she raised numerous arguments that were not pertinent to the issue of the Board's jurisdiction over her USERRA appeal. However, in her submissions below, the appellant alleged that, in terminating her employment, her second-line supervisor was improperly influenced by a coworker with anti-military <span class="Italic">animus</span>. She claimed that her second-line supervisor "showed a particular preference" for this coworker, and "took her feelings into consideration." The appellant further alleged that her coworker had voiced anti-military <span class="Italic">animus</span> to her second-line supervisor and that the second-line supervisor was "trying to please" her coworker.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency contends that the appellant's claims that her uniformed service was a motivating factor in the decision to terminate her employment lack merit. However, the weakness of the assertions in support of a claim is not a basis to dismiss a USERRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if the appellant fails to develop her contentions, her USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Searcy</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Again emphasizing the USERRA liberal pleading standing, <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. DOD</span>, DC-4324-13-0061-I-1 (NP 8/21/2013), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant made more than a bare allegation that his non-selection was because of his veteran's status. Specifically, he asserted that he had been discriminated against when he was not selected for the Joint Education Specialist position on the basis of his "race, education, age, <span class="Italic">veteran status</span>, and because [he had] settled a previous [MSPB] case." He made specific factual allegations that he had been found qualified for the position, made the certificate of eligibles and been referred to the selecting official, but was not been considered for the position. He alleged that he was "very qualified" for the position, but that the selecting official "failed to interview" him when he reapplied for the position, and that the agency selected someone "who had not previously done the job...nor did this person have the educational level" that he held. The appellant further contended that his prior performance in the position had been rated "meets expectations" and he had "excelled within the position." The appellant also stated that he sought but did not receive an agency explanation for his non-selection. He attached evidence to the appeal form documenting that he served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps, is a 20 percent disabled veteran, and received commendations for previous performance in the position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Yager v. USPS</span>, CH-4324-14-0514-I-1 (NP 10/15/2014), the appellant's claim that less qualified nonveterans were selected required USERRA analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In general, a claim under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed. <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6 (1999). As a result, an argument that a nonveteran was selected over the appellant, who is a veteran, is sufficient to meet the third prong of USERRA's jurisdictional requirement. <span class="Italic">See Durand v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 8 (2007); <span class="Italic">see also Gaston v.

Department of the Navy</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 421, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12 (1999) (finding that the appellant met the third prong of the USERRA jurisdictional requirement by alleging that he was a veteran, the agency denied him permanent appointment to a vacant position, and the agency offered the appointments to similarly-situated nonveterans). Here, in light of the liberal construction standard and the appellant's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, his contentions that less qualified nonveterans were selected over him, constitute an allegation that his nonselection was due to his prior uniformed service, <span class="Italic">see Durand</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see also Gaston</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 411, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Martir</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 421, &#x00B6; 9. Thus, the appellant has established that his appeal is covered under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a) and therefore, is within the Board's jurisdiction under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b).

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that he was removed because Martin "doesn't like...Vets" and that the agency "has a history of firing Vets in permanent positions." The appellant may be raising a Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act of 1994 (USERRA) claim, although he did not do so below.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Patterson also challenges the Board's dismissal of his USERRA claim. He contends that he asserted a non-frivolous USERRA claim based on his allegation that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his prior military service. USERRA states, in relevant part, that "[a] person who...has performed in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment...by an employer on the basis of that...performance of service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). It is undisputed that Mr. Patterson served in the U.S. military and that he was not selected by the agency for the attorney-advisor position. Therefore, the only issue before us is whether Mr. Patterson also made a non-frivolous allegation that the agency's decision not to select him was made on the basis of his prior military service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously recognized and endorsed the Board's "liberal approach in determining whether jurisdiction exists under USERRA." <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Sys.

Under that approach, the "relative weakness of the specific factual allegations initially made by an appellant in his USERRA claim...should not serve as the basis for dismissing [his appeal] for lack of jurisdiction," but "if he fails to develop those allegations, his USERRA claim[ ] should simply be denied on the merits." <span class="Italic">Duncan v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 86, 92 (1997), <span class="Italic">cited in Yates</span>, 145 F.3d at 1484. Thus, the Board has held that it has jurisdiction over a USERRA claim where the appellant alleges that (1) he or she served or serves in the military, (2) suffered a loss of a benefit of employment, and (3) the loss of the benefit was due to his or her service in the military. <span class="Italic">See Yates; see also Perkins v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 545, 547 (2000) (finding Board jurisdiction where the appellant alleged "that, while he performed well during his first casual appointment, he was not reinstated for a second appointment, although three others who were not veterans were reinstated"); <span class="Italic">Jasper v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Patterson alleged that the agency did not select him on the basis of his prior military service. He further alleged that the agency's reason for not selecting him--i.e., that he was not as qualified as the selected individual--was a pretext, as evident from a comparison of his qualifications to those of the selectee, a non-veteran.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We hold that these allegations were sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the Board's liberal pleading standard for USERRA claims that we endorsed in <span class="Italic">Yates</span>. <span class="Italic">See Perkins</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. at 547; <span class="Italic">Jasper</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 368-71; <span class="Italic">Duncan</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. at 92.

Under this approach, the relative weakness of the specific factual allegations initially made by an appellant in his USERRA claim should not serve as the basis for dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction; rather, if he fails to develop those allegations, his USERRA claim should be denied on the merits. <span class="Italic">Searcy v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 260, &#x00B6; 7 (2010). Thus, in order to establish jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, the appellant need only allege that (1) he served in the military, (2) he was denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or a benefit of employment, and (3) the denial was due to his service in the military. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (finding that, although the appellant's allegations were vague and lacking in specificity, he established jurisdiction by alleging that the agency was aware of his prior uniformed service and denied him employment in a position because of his prior uniformed service and denied him a benefit of employment when it withdrew funds from his civil service retirement account); <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 10 (2009) (finding that the appellant established jurisdiction by alleging that he was serving in the Army National Guard and was terminated during his probationary period because "agency officials didn't like the fact" of his service).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant is a veteran and was not selected for the Event Forum Project Chief position. The appellant has further alleged that his nonselection was due to his prior military service and that his qualifications were superior to the selectee, who was a nonveteran. That allegation is sufficient to establish jurisdiction under the Board's liberal pleading standard for USERRA claims. <span class="Italic">See Patterson v. Department of the Interior</span>, 424 F.3d 1151, 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding that the appellant established jurisdiction by alleging that "the agency's reason for not selecting him--i.e., that he was not as qualified as the selecting individual--was pretext, as evident from a comparison of his qualifications to those of the selectee, a non-veteran"); <span class="Italic">see also Perkins v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 545, 547 (2000) (finding jurisdiction where the appellant alleged that, while he performed well during his first casual appointment, he was not reinstated for a second appointment, although three others who were not veterans were reinstated).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the Board has recently held that, contrary to the initial decision in <span class="Italic">Roberts</span>, USERRA prohibits discrimination based not only on the fact of military service but also on the particulars of that service. <span class="Italic">See McMillan v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18 (2013) (remanding for consideration of the appellant's claim that the agency denied him a tour extension based in part on his performance of specific military orders that required him to prepare a report and participate in a videoconference concerning agency business). Consequently, our jurisdiction is not defeated by the appellant's claim that the selecting official discriminated against him based specifically on his former status as an enlisted man. Because the appellant has established Board jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, he is entitled to the hearing he requested. <span class="Italic">See Kirkendall v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit emphasized that cases are liberally construed as to any claimed right under USERRA, not to be preliminarily dismissed for lack of specific factual allegations.

The Board's approach finds support in <span id="Page_467"></span>the broad language of the statute and the legislative history. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-65, at 23 (1993), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 2449, 2456 ("The Committee intends that these anti-discrimination provisions be broadly construed and strictly enforced."). Viewing the record before us against the standard that the Board has adopted--with which we agree--we have no difficulty concluding that, in her appeal to the Board, Ms. Yates asserted a claim under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Duncan</span> and <span class="Italic">Petersen</span>, the appellants expressly mentioned USERRA in their complaints. <span class="Italic">See Duncan,</span> 73 MSPR at 90; <span class="Italic">Petersen,</span> 71 MSPR The appellant in <span class="Italic">Jasper</span> however, did not expressly mention USERRA in his complaint<span class="Italic">. See Jasper,</span> 73 MSPR at 368-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that in her appeal Ms. Yates failed to mention USERRA or to make any allegation of discrimination against her by the Postal Service on account of her Army Reserve duty. We nevertheless believe that Ms. Yates asserted a claim under USERRA so as to bring her appeal within the jurisdiction of the Board. The reason is that in her appeal form and in the letter attached to the form, Ms. Yates alleged facts sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Board under USERRA. Specifically, Ms. Yates asserted (i) that she served on Reserve duty for two weeks in July of 1996; (ii) that while on Reserve duty she missed her 30-day evaluation in connection with the Data Conversion Operator training program; and (iii) that after she returned from her Reserve duty, the Postal Service failed to extend her training period to make up for the two weeks that she had lost while she was with her Reserve unit. We agree with Ms. Yates that, in view of the liberal standard applicable to USERRA claims, she asserted before the Board that she had been deprived of benefits of employment because of her Reserve duty: namely, two weeks of training and her 30-day evaluation. Each of these is properly viewed as a "benefit of employment" because each was an "advantage" or "status" of her probationary employment with the Postal service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 USC &#x00A7; 4303(2). At the same time, Ms. Yates expressly alleged that she lost those benefits as a result of her Army Reserve duty. In short, all that was missing from Ms. Yates' appeal was an express invocation of USERRA and an express assertion of discrimination by the Postal Service. Their absence was not fatal. Based upon the record before us, we hold that through her appeal form and the letter attached to it, Ms. Yates articulated facts sufficient to assert a claim within the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The government cites <span class="Italic">Meglio v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 1576, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1984), for the proposition that "[w]here petitioner fails to frame an issue before the presiding official and belatedly attempts to raise that same issue before the full board, and the board properly denies review of the initial decision, petitioner will not be heard for the first time on that issue in the Federal Circuit." This case is very different from <span class="Italic">Meglio</span>. In <span class="Italic">Meglio</span>, the presiding official dismissed Meglio's appeal for lack of jurisdiction and the full Board denied Meglio's petition for further review under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.115. On appeal to this court, Meglio for the first time asserted that the Board had jurisdiction pursuant to a 1977 agreement between him and the agency. Because Meglio had not raised the 1977 agreement before the Board, we held that it was too late to assert jurisdiction based on the agreement and that Meglio had waived the argument. In contrast, Ms. Yates has not presented new factual evidence on appeal. As we have held, Ms. Yates' appeal form and attached letter filed with the Board alleged facts sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the Board under USERRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the court once required some specificity in allegations. <span class="Italic">See Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 119 Fed. Appx. 277, 278 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 101 MSPR 13, 16-17 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2005), restates the relaxed USERRA pleading scheme:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, it appears that the appellant is attempting to raise a claim under USERRA. USERRA states in part that "[a] person who...has performed...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any benefit of employment...on the basis of that...performance of service." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a). Under USERRA, a person may submit an appeal against a federal agency alleging a violation of section 4311 directly to the Board, or he may submit such an appeal to the Board after he has filed a complaint with the Department of Labor and proceedings there have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An allegation that an employer took or failed to take certain actions based on an individual's military status or obligations constitutes a non-frivolous allegation entitling the appellant to Board consideration of his claim.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Further, claims under USERRA should be broadly and liberally construed in determining whether they are non-frivolous. <span class="Italic">Lazard v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 8 (2003). Indeed, a USERRA case may be raised without specific reference to the statute, so long as the appellant articulates facts sufficient to assert a claim. <span class="Italic">Young v. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 99, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). The relative weakness of the factual allegations in a USERRA claim is not a ground for dismissing the claim summarily; instead, the claim should be denied on the merits if the appellant fails to develop his allegations under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 359, &#x00B6; 7 (2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted in his petition for appeal that he was a disabled veteran and that he was not converted to a permanent appointment because of that status. The Board has found that claims of discrimination based on an appellant's status as a disabled veteran may be cognizable under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 454, &#x00B6; 6. However, a claim of disability discrimination alone, even a disability arising out of military service, is not cognizable under USERRA. <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 17 (2002). In this case, although he did not specifically identify USERRA as the basis for Board jurisdiction, the appellant claimed that he was terminated because of his status as a disabled veteran. Therefore, we find that his allegations regarding his termination from employment, disparate treatment, and veteran's status were sufficient to raise a claim under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2004).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the appellant was not placed on specific notice of what he needed to show or allege to establish jurisdiction over his USERRA claim, we nonetheless find that he has made a sufficient allegation to establish such a claim. USERRA provides in relevant part that "[a] person who...has performed...service in a uniformed service shall not be denied promotion...on the basis of that...performance of service...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4311(a); <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Thus, in order to establish a USERRA claim under the circumstances of this case, the appellant need only allege that: (1) He performed or has an obligation to perform uniformed service; (2) he was denied promotion; and (3) the denial of promotion was "on the basis of" his military service. <span class="Italic">See Tindall</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant performed uniformed service, the agency denied him a promotion to one of the Maintenance Mechanic Leader positions, and he alleged that the agency denied him the promotion on the basis of his military service.

<p class="Block-Quote2">I also feel that my disability was part of the reason for my termination. I am a 40 percent service connected veteran.

The AJ is not to issue what amounts to a judgment on the pleadings against the appellant because the AJ concludes that the appellant did not adequately allege in his appeal or prehearing submissions either a causal connection between the agency's action and his military service or an intent by the agency to discriminate based on that service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal in which he alleged that the agency had violated his rights under the Veterans Preference Act and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (VEOA) when it failed to select him for a second casual appointment after his first casual appointment ended. He requested a hearing. The agency filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the appellant was not an employee entitled to appeal to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii) and 7513(d) because he lacked 1 year of current continuous service. The administrative judge (AJ) granted the agency's motion to the extent that the appellant was attempting to appeal his termination from employment, agreeing that the Veterans Preference Act provides no right of appeal for an employee without 1 year of current continuous service at the time of his termination. However, she otherwise denied the motion to dismiss. She stated that the appellant's appeal fell under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) because of his claim that the agency discriminated against him because of his military service by retaining for a second casual appointment other employees who were not veterans. The AJ further stated that, to establish the Board's jurisdiction under the VEOA, the appellant had to identify a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference that he believed the agency had violated with regard to the complained of matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following receipt of the parties' submissions, and the convening of a status conference, the AJ issued an ID based on the written record. She found, with regard to the appellant's claim under USERRA, that he had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because he had not alleged any causal connection between the agency's action and his military service, that is, that he had not alleged that the agency had any intent to discriminate against him because of his military service. As to the appellant's claim under the VEOA, the AJ found that he had not identified any statute or regulation providing that veterans would be hired before non-veterans for casual appointments in the Postal Service, and that, contrary to his assertions, he had been allowed to apply for the second casual appointment. Accordingly, the AJ found that, as to the VEOA as well, the appellant had failed to state a claim for which the Board could grant relief.</p>

In <span class="Italic">Yates,</span> the Federal Circuit accepted the appellant's argument that there are only three requirements for Board jurisdiction under USERRA: (1) performance of duty in a uniformed service of the United States; (2) an allegation of a loss of a benefit of employment; and (3) an allegation that the benefit was lost due to the performance of duty in the uniformed service. <span class="Italic">Yates,</span> 145 F.3d at 1483-84.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant has alleged, and the agency does not dispute, that he has prior military service, and the AJ acknowledged that service. The appellant has also alleged, and again the agency does not deny, that, although he timely applied, he was not reinstated to a second casual appointment in July 1999. As such, he has alleged that he was denied a benefit of employment. <span class="Italic">See Melvin v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 MSPR 372 &#x00B6; 1 (1998). And, he has alleged that, while he performed well during his first casual appointment, he was not reinstated for a second appointment, although three others who were not veterans were reinstated. Under the circumstances, the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under USERRA because he alleged facts which, if proven, could establish that he was not reinstated because of his military service. Therefore, the AJ erred in denying the appellant's claim without conducting a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 MSPR 230 &#x00B6; 8 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ denied the appellant's claim on the basis that he failed to allege that the agency had any intent to discriminate against him because of his military service.

Department of the Interior,</span> 71 MSPR 227, 240 (1996) (to prevail on a USERRA claim, an appellant must show that his prior service was a substantial or motivating factor, unless the agency can show that it would have taken the same action even if, hypothetically, it had not been motivated by a desire to punish the employee because of his prior military service). The AJ made this finding, resulting in her denying the appellant's claim on the merits, without convening the hearing he requested. Because material facts are in dispute, such an evidentiary hearing was required, and in failing to convene one, the AJ erred. <span class="Italic">See Conway v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Yates</span>, the appellant did not mention USERRA or explicitly allege below that the agency discriminated against him on account of his Reserve duty. He did allege below that he was denied leave and instead was charged with AWOL for periods during which he served on Reserve duty and that he was suspended based on the charge of AWOL. We find that such allegations are sufficient to invoke the Board's jurisdiction under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See Martir v. Department of the Navy</span>, 81 MSPR 421 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (the appellant's allegations were sufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination under USERRA, where he alleged that the agency refused to appoint him to any of four vacant permanent positions and instead appointed similarly situated nonveterans to the positions). We therefore conclude that this appeal should not have been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and must be remanded for further adjudication....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board occasionally signals an interest in more specific initial pleadings in USERRA cases--at least cases seeking recovery for past improper denial of military leave. <span class="Italic">Dombrowski v. VA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DOMBROWSKI_DENNIS_CH_3443_05_0348_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_247265.pdf">102 MSPR 160</a>, 164 &#x00B6; 11, 2006 MSPB 142 (2006) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Haskins v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e address the administrative judge's show-cause order, which we specifically approve of and endorse. As noted above, the administrative judge informed the appellant that in order to state a claim for relief, he was required to specify the dates on which he was forced to use annual leave (or some other form of leave) to cover an absence for military duty as a result of the agency's improper charging of military leave for non-workdays. The Board's decision on remand from the court in <span class="Italic">Butterbaugh</span> could be interpreted to suggest a different rule, namely, that an individual states a USERRA claim simply by making an allegation that his employing agency charged military leave for non-workdays. <span class="Italic">E.g., Butterbaugh v. Department of Justice</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 202, &#x00B6; 5 (2004). The administrative judge's approach in the present case, however, is more in tune with the plain text of USERRA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Eberhart v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 101 MSPR 483, 485 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9, 2006 MSPB 78 (2006), while endorsing reasonably specific pleadings concerning claims for denials of military leave, also suggested that appellants not be penalized by AJs while they attempt to develop the specifics of their USERRA claims:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the administrative judge found that the appellant did not amend his claim to cite specific dates that he was forced to use either annual leave or leave without pay or that he was forced to use military leave for nonduty dates or submit documents in support of his claim. Certainly, this appeal cannot proceed without such specific information. <span class="Italic">See Garcia v. Department of State</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 172 &#x00B6; 18 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are indications in the record, however, that the appellant was unable, before the initial decision was issued, to obtain information regarding the leave he took and the exact dates and duration of his absences for military duty. He requested an extension of time to amend his claim and submit supporting documentation, stating that he had served a discovery request upon the agency. The record, however, does not indicate that the appellant had received the requested documents from the agency before the administrative judge issued the initial decision. These circumstances weigh in favor of dismissing the appeal without prejudice so that the appellant can have additional time in which to obtain the evidence he seeks in support of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that dismissal of the appellant's appeal without prejudice to its refiling is appropriate at this time. <span class="Italic">See Burton v. Department of the Army</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 350, &#x00B6; 4 (2004) (the Board found no error in the administrative judge's dismissal of the appeal without prejudice in order to allow the appellant time to obtain new counsel); <span class="Italic">Milner v. Department of Justice</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 660, &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (indicating that a case may be dismissed without prejudice in order to avoid a lengthy or indefinite continuance). We also find that imposition of a deadline by which the appeal must be refiled is not warranted in this case. Not only is there no deadline for filing a USERRA appeal in the first instance, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.12, but an appropriate deadline would be difficult to establish here in light of the uncertainty as to the length of time that would be needed to obtain documents and other information from the agency and the DFAS. Moreover, the appellant may conclude, on review of the evidence he eventually obtains, that he no longer wishes to pursue his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although other decisions suggest that an allegation of a connection between a challenged personnel action and military status states a claim sufficient to move a case to a hearing, in <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 94 MSPR 206, 211 &#x00B6; 9 (2003), the Board considered the evidence submitted by the appellant to support his allegations of a USERRA violation to be insufficient to obtain a hearing. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hudson v. DHS</span>, 104 MSPR 223, 227 &#x00B6; 8, 2006 MSPB 350 (2006) ("the Board's remedial power under USERRA is limited to entering an order that requires an agency to comply with the statute's provisions and to compensate an appellant for any loss of wages or benefits. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2); <span class="Italic">Dombrowski</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant is no longer an agency employee, having resigned in 2000. Therefore, even if he could prove that the agency violated USERRA by discriminating against him on the basis of his military status when it scheduled his days off to coincide with his military obligation, ordering the agency to comply with USERRA would have no effect. Also, he has not alleged that he suffered a loss of wages as a result of the agency's action. Nor has he identified any other compensation that the Board could order the agency to provide for not giving him the days off he wanted.").</p>
