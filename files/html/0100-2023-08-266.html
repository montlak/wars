<p class="Body-Text">A comprehensive explanation of grade and pay retention rights and their impact on Board appellate jurisdiction was provided by <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 484, 486-90, 3 MSPB 8 (1980), considering appeals by employees whose positions were reclassified and downgraded, albeit with grade retention for two years and indefinite retention of their salary levels. The employees characterized their appeals as reductions in grade. OPM argued that the employees were not subjected to an adverse action; rather, their only appeal of the classification actions was to OPM under 5 USC 5366(b). The Board noted that under 5 USC 5362(b)(1), employees who would otherwise have been reduced in grade as a result of position reclassification are entitled to a two-year period of grade retention and indefinite pay retention under 5 USC 5363(a). Examining the legislative history of the grade retention provisions of the Reform Act, the Board concluded that there was no distinction between action against the position (reclassification) and action affecting the employee (downgrading): both elements of the reclassification action were outside the Board's appeals jurisdiction, for Congress provided pay retention in exchange for a Board appeal. The route of appeal for adversely affected employees was through the OPM classification appeals process. <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each of the appellants was employed by the respondent agency at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, in a position which was the subject of the application of a new classification standard, directed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which accounted for the reclassification of their positions. Appellants were notified that, while they would otherwise have been subject to a change to a lower grade because of the reclassification and the agency's inability to reassign them at their grade level, they were now entitled, by law, to retain their present grade for a two-year period and their present salary levels indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Through their union representative, appellants appealed to the Board's Philadelphia Field Office, protesting the propriety of the reclassification action. Decisions dated September 28, 1979, were issued by the presiding official, which dismissed the appeals as not within the jurisdiction of the Board. The presiding official found that 5 U.S.C. 5366 precludes appeals by employees from position reclassifications when grade and pay retention provisions are applicable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Each appellant filed a petition for review of the initial decisions which asserted that 5 U.S.C. 5366(b)(1) does not preclude appeals in these cases because they are appealing the reduction in grade, under 5 U.S.C. 7512, not the reclassification action. They also contend that the actions taken against them are adverse actions because the grade retention benefits of the law are only temporary and partial; that there was no Congressional intent to take away the previously existing right of appeal from reduction in grade; that 5 U.S.C. 7512, which sets forth applicable adverse actions, does not contain an exception for employees who receive grade and pay retention; and that the reclassification had resulted in their loss of a property interest in their jobs, which would entitle them to an appeal. The agency was informed of the petitions for review and was furnished with copies for its response, but has submitted no representation in connection with the petitions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, OPM intervened in the case, contending that appellants' cases do not raise an appealable matter since they seek to appeal their continued assignment to a reclassified position. OPM maintains that appellants have not been subjected to an adverse action because they have suffered no loss of grade or pay within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 7512; that reading 5 U.S.C. 5366(b) so as to provide a right of appeal to the Board would be redundant, since the classification of a position is appealable to OPM; and that it was reasonable for Congress to provide a right of appeal to the Board only to persons who were not eligible for grade retention.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board has not previously addressed the issue here presented, the petition for review is granted in order to examine the extent to which Section 5366 limits rights of appeal that would otherwise be available under Section 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. 5362(b)(1), as amended by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, employees who would otherwise have been reduced in grade as a result of position reclassification are entitled to a two-year period of grade retention. In addition, an employee who ceases to be entitled to those benefits continues indefinitely to be entitled to pay retention benefits. 5 U.S.C. 5363(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to appeal rights, 5 U.S.C. 5366(a) and (b) provide in pertinent part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect the right of any employee to appeal--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants contend that the non-appealable "action" to which subsection 5366(b)(1) refers is the reclassification of a position, but that the reduction in grade itself is the basis for an appeal under 5 U.S.C. 7512. The Board disagrees, based on both the plain wording of the statute (<span class="Italic">supra</span>) and the legislative history of the relevant portions of the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the latter basis for decision, appellants take the position that reliance on the legislative history is misplaced because they believe that changes in the law as first proposed and as later passed render it obsolete. This contention is based on the fact that the grade and pay retention provisions which were eventually merged into the Civil Service Reform Act were, at first, considered in Congress as a separate bill, in which the grade retention period for reclassification actions first proposed was not time limited.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In examining this contention, we consider, first, the original bill, H.R. 9279. When it was reported out of Committee, the accompanying House Report, No. 95-994 (March 21, 1978), noted that the difference in proposed periods of grade retention between reduction-in-force downgrades (2 years) and reclassification actions (unlimited) was due only to the fact that reductions in force are taken to improve the economy and efficiency of Government, while reclassification actions correct administrative error (Report No. 95-994 at 5). It also noted that under the system then in effect, upon the reclassification of a position, an employee could file a classification appeal "not related to the employee's status in the position," and that after a reduction in force, an appeal could be filed which "is limited to determining whether the employee's agency correctly applied the reduction-in-force procedures" (<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 6). The Committee then stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (b) of section 5367 provides that any action which is the basis of an individual's entitlement to benefits under subchapter VI or any termination of such benefits shall not be treated as an adverse action for purposes of any appeal procedures. This subsection is not intended to prohibit the filing of classification appeals (such as under part 511 of the Commission's regulations) or reduction-in-force appeals (part 351 of the Commission's regulations). Rather, subsection (b) is intended to prohibit the filing of adverse action appeals based on downgrading actions or termination of retained grade or pay benefits. (<span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When H.R. 9279 was later considered as part of the overall Civil Service Reform, the House committee stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (b) of section 5362 provides that, with certain exceptions, the retained grade of the employee shall be treated as the grade of the employee's position for all purposes during the 2-year period. Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, H. Rep. 95-1403, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 63 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_427"></span>With specific reference to classification actions, the report states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under subsection (a) of section 5363, an employee whose position has been reduced in grade is entitled to have the grade of the position, before the reduction, be treated as his retained grade so long as he continues to occupy such position. <span class="Italic">The higher retained grade will be treated as the employee's grade for all purposes except for the application of reduction-in-force procedures.</span> (Emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 65.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Committee stated that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Subsection (b) of section 5367 provides that any action which is the basis of an individual's entitlement to benefits <span class="Italic">shall not be treated as an appealable action for purposes of any appeal procedure</span> other than the appeal procedures described in paragraph (2) of subsection (a). Under subsection (b), the following actions would not be appealable (except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (a)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">1.&#x2003;Reduction of employee to lower grade as a result of reclassification of position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">6.&#x2003;Termination of retained grade because of expiration of 2-year period of entitlement under section 5362;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">8.&#x2003;Receipt of only one-half of general pay increases under section 5364(a). (Emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of the above, the Board concludes that appellants' distinction between actions taken against the position and those against the employee does not provide a basis for finding that a right of appeal exists in connection with the instant actions. Clearly, Congress considered that the provisions of the grade and pay retention legislation would relate both to positions and employees, and appeals from actions affecting both were ruled out, except as specified in the act. Just as clearly, they intended to provide greater grade and pay retention protections to employees, in return for which no appeal was to be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find that the differences in the legislation as it was proposed when the Committee wrote its reports and as it appears now in the law have any effect on the clear statement of intent evident in the above quoted portions of the reports since most of the changes made were not relevant to the question of appealability. While, as stated above, appellants take issue with reliance upon this portion of the legislative history because the grade retention period for reclassification actions first proposed was not time limited, the two-year limit was applicable to reduction-in-force actions, and Congress provided no special right of appeal (beyond that provided in section 5367(a)(2)) when the retention period began or ended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Absent a clear indication on the part of Congress that the change in language of section 5362 was intended to provide employees with an adverse action appeal, of which we have found no evidence, the Board concludes that no such appeal right was intended by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants next argue that they were deprived of a property right because of the reclassification. They also assert that establishing two classes of employees, one with appeal rights to the Board and one without, is constitutionally impermissible without a rational basis for the classifications. We find, however, that the grade and pay retention provisions of the law clearly provide a substantial benefit to those employees to whom they are applied which does not inure to employees who are not eligible for grade and pay retention. We conclude, therefore, that the statute's creation of two groups of employees with distinct rights is an appropriate, rational classification, in light of this difference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note appellants' assertion that regulations issued by the Office of Personnel Management pursuant to its authority under 5 U.S.C. 5365, specifically 5 C.F.R. 752.401(c), provide a right of appeal from reductions in pay and reductions in grade such as those they contend they have suffered. This contention is clearly in error. The cited section of the regulations specifically excludes from the coverage of that subpart "Action under part 536 resulting from downgrading decision which entitled employee to retained grade for two years." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 210.101(d)(106).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, having reconsidered the case, the Board concludes that employees who continue to be assigned to positions which are reclassified downward, and who receive the benefits of 5 U.S.C. 5362 and 5363, may not appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from either the reclassification of the position or the reduction in grade and/or pay which, but for the grade and pay retention provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act, might otherwise have been appealable. Employees under such circumstances may still vindicate their statutorily granted rights through a classification appeal directed to OPM. Hence, we conclude that the decisions of the presiding official did not involve an erroneous interpretation of law or regulation and it is hereby Ordered that those decisions be Affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing the Board decision, <span class="Italic">Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272, 275 (D.C. Cir. 1981), provided some background concerning saved pay/grade cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he position classification determinations of an agency are the touchstones by which compensation, responsibility, and related personnel decisions are made. Thus, where the grade of a civil servant's position is lowered, reductions in pay and fringe benefits would ordinarily be the norm, and loss of promotion prospects might also be expected. In recognition, however, of the fact that an employee whose position is reclassified may be harmed through no "fault" of his own, Congress, in structuring the civil service, mandated the provision of certain offsetting benefits where a position is lowered in grade.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing the legislative history of the Reform Act, the <span class="Italic">Atwell</span> court observed that before the CSRA, employees were actually reduced in salary after two years of grade retention following reclassification. They had a right to appeal the downgrading as an adverse action and could appeal the classification of the new position to the then Civil Service Commission. The CSRA, 670 F.2d at 278,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">continued the policy of compensating at least partially those whose positions were downgraded in a reclassification; indeed, the CSRA extended the compensatory benefits. Under the new Act, the affected employee continues to hold for a two-year period the<span class="Italic"> grade</span> of his former position. 5 USC 5362(b). During this period of grade retention, the higher grade is used to determine salary and other matters of remuneration and to establish retirement, life insurance, and promotion entitlements. 5 USC 5362(c). Further, the CSRA extended the immediate financial protection provided the downgraded employee; the new scheme of pay retention provides that, when the two-year period of grade retention terminates, the employee continues to receive, at a minimum, the basic pay of the pre-reclassification position. 5 USC 5363(a-b). Moreover, if comparability increases applicable to the new position are granted by Congress, the employee receives fifty percent of the increase given those receiving the maximum pay for the new position. 5 USC 5363(a). Although this new pay retention scheme is difficult to explain succinctly, the core notion is that the affected employee's pay is never lowered in absolute terms as a result of the reduction; rather, absent unusual circumstances, the employee loses the benefits of pay retention and is paid at the rate of the lower grade only when the new amount of compensation exceeds the retention pay rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Atwell</span> identified the conflict under the Reform Act between 5 USC 7512, granting an MSPB appeal for a downgrading, and 5 USC 5366(b), providing that any action supporting an individual's entitlement to grade and pay retention benefits is not an appealable action. After extensive consideration of the legislative history and statutory analysis, the court determined that, although an individual employee whose position is downgraded is negatively affected, a reclassification decision that leads, at the end of pay and grade retention, to a reduction in grade is not an appealable action under the terms of &#x00A7; 7512. No improper deprivation of property interests results from this procedure because an employee may still file a classification appeal to OPM, and an EEO complaint if the reclassification and downgrading are taken for discriminatory reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Atwell</span> was summarized by <span class="Italic">Francetich v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 377, 379 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7701(a), the Board's appellate jurisdiction is limited to any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule or regulation. These appellants were incumbents of positions which were reclassified, and thus they were entitled to and provided the grade and pay retention benefits of 5 USC 5361 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> However, employees who continue to be assigned to positions which are reclassified downward, and who receive the benefits of 5 USC 5362 and 5363, may not appeal to the Board from either the reclassification of the position or the reduction in grade and/or pay which, but for the grade and pay retention provisions of the Act might otherwise have been appealable. <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 3 MSPB 8, 2 MSPR 483 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that these reclassification actions are not appealable to the Board under 5 USC 7701(a), as the presiding officials held....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's holding that it lacks jurisdiction over downgradings resulting from reclassifications accompanied by grade and pay retention benefits was also upheld in <span class="Italic">Knepp v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 709 F.2d 37 (9th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">following Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981), and sustained in <span class="Italic">Schaffer v. MSPB</span>, 751 F.2d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In <span class="Italic">Schaffer</span>, the court noted that jurisdiction is not dependent upon how long an employee actually receives the saved grade and pay benefits. It is the initial entitlement that counts; jurisdiction does not attach if the retention period is cut short by a RIF (an action that may be separately appealable).</p>
