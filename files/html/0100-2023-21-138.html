<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-137"><span class="space">b.</span> Decisions Before 2000</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hobbs v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 628, 631-34 (1993), explained the statutory basis for law enforcement retirement of a BATF special investigator, emphasizing the need to be able to recruit "young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1), an employee is entitled to preferential retirement credit for service as a "law enforcement officer." A "law enforcement officer" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20), in relevant part, as "an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant's duties as a Special Inspector were "primarily investigative," and consisted of investigating unfair competition and unlawful trade practices by the alcoholic beverage industry including companies such as Seagrams, Hiram Walker, and Paul Masson, in violation of 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205. Further, it is undisputed that the purpose of such investigations was to encourage legitimate businesses to comply with 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205, rather than to criminally prosecute such businesses, and that, "with possibly one exception, no case which [the <span id="Page_4309"></span>appellant] investigated resulted in criminal prosecution." We reopen this appeal to address novel issues of statutory construction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A violation of 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205 is a misdemeanor for which the maximum penalty is a fine of $1,000. <span class="Italic">See</span> 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207. It is well-settled that an offense for which punishment, as distinguished from a civil remedy, is prescribed constitutes a criminal offense and that criminal laws encompass not only offenses classified as felonies but also lesser offenses classified as misdemeanors. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Krapf,</span> 180 F. Supp. 886, 890 (D.C.N.J. 1960), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 285 F.2d 647 (3d Cir. 1961); Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Title 18, U.S.C.; <span class="Italic">see also Black's Law Dictionary</span> 370-74 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "crime," "criminal law," and related terms). The fact that the sole and maximum prescribed punishment is a relatively small fine does not render the offense noncriminal in nature. <span class="Italic">See Krapf,</span> 180 F. Supp. at 890. Moreover, 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 207 states that a violation of 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205 results in "criminal proceedings." We therefore find that 27 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 205 is among the "criminal laws of the United States."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A longstanding rule of statutory construction provides that the plain language of a statute should control absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See Miller v. Department of the Army,</span> 987 F.2d 1552, 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1993). A literal reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) would appear to afford the appellant LEO retirement credit for his service as a Special Inspector because his duties in that position were "primarily the investigation...of individuals suspected...of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States." We find, however, that such a literal reading would be contrary to the clearly expressed legislative intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the legislative intent behind the preferential retirement provisions for firefighters and LEOs was to provide for their early retirement based on a determination that these positions should be "composed, insofar as possible, of young men and women physically capable of meeting the vigorous demands of occupations which are far more taxing physically than most in the Federal Service."<span class="Italic">Felzien v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 930 F.2d 898, 901 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (quoting S. Rep. No. 948, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1974 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 3698, 3699). The legislative history is ambiguous as to whether and to what extent the hazardous nature of an employee's duties should be considered in determining his entitlement to LEO retirement credit. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 948, 93d Cong., 2d Sess. 2; H.R. Rep. No. 840, 92nd Cong. 2d Sess. 2, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1972 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin.

Cir. 1983). However, the legislative history unambiguously reveals that one of the primary legislative reasons for enacting the preferential LEO retirement provisions was that the government's frontline law enforcement work required a youthful workforce capable of meeting the stringent physical requirements and performing at peak efficiency. <span class="Italic">See Felzien,</span> 930 F.2d at 901; <span class="Italic">see also Johnson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,</span> 472 U.S. 353, 364-65 (1985); <span class="Italic">Obremski,</span> 699 F.2d at 1272 n.33; <span class="Italic">see also Francke v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17), pertaining to the Federal Employees Retirement System, which defines "law enforcement officer" as an employee, the duties of whose position, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "are sufficiently rigorous that employment opportunities should be limited to young and physically vigorous individuals...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the legislative intent as discussed above, we find that the term "investigation" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) should be construed as "criminal investigation," viz., investigation of suspected or known criminals for the immediate purpose of criminally prosecuting them if warranted. <span class="Italic">See Little v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 22 MSPR 287, 289 (1984) (LEO credit denied because the appellant failed to show that his primary duties included "criminal investigations"), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 762 F.2d 962, 963 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Criminal investigations, as distinguished from other types of investigations, involve unusual physical hazards for the investigator, deriving from frequent contacts with criminals and suspected criminals, and their desire to avoid criminal prosecution. Although, as discussed above, the existence or degree of hazards, in itself, may not be an appropriate factor to consider in determining an employee's LEO status, it is beyond cavil that the hazards inherent in frontline LEO duties, such as conducting criminal investigations, are precisely why physical stamina and vigor are necessary to overcome or minimize such hazards. In addition, criminal investigations, unlike other types of investigations, may often require that the investigator work for long stretches of time without a break, be on call 24 hours a day, and/or carry weapons. Such rigorous working conditions are an additional reason that criminal investigations, as distinguished from other types of investigations, require physical stamina and vigor on the part of the investigator. We therefore conclude that including within the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) employees such as the appellant whose noncriminal investigative duties did not require unusual physical stamina or vigor[5] would be contrary to the legislative intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;It is undisputed that the appellant was not required to maintain a level of physical fitness, work overtime frequently, be on call 24 hours a day, carry a weapon or maintain proficiency in the use of a weapon, or give Miranda warnings to the witnesses whom he interviewed in the course of his investigations. Nor did he generally have contacts with suspected or known criminals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, a longstanding OPM regulation excludes from the coverage of section 8331(20) "an employee whose primary duties involve...[merely] guarding against or inspecting for violations of law...." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.902 (promulgated in 1974 as part of section 831.903(a)). Based on our discussion of the legislative intent above, we find that this regulation reasonably implements the legislation. <span class="Italic">See Morgan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 773 F.2d 282, 287 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Because the appellant's primary duties were more in the nature of "guarding against or inspecting for violations of law" than conducting criminal investigations, he is not entitled to LEO retirement credit under the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>

Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">post</span>), explained the basis for law enforcement retirement status and the role of agency determinations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, a Corporate Quality Assurance Manager, an administrative position in the central office of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc., appealed to the Board's Washington Regional Office from a reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). That decision denied appellant's request for a credibility-of-service determination that his past service with Federal Prison Industries, Inc., met the definition of a law enforcement officer as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1), an employee who is separated from the service after completing 20 years of service as a law enforcement officer is entitled an annuity. The presiding official found that the preponderance of evidence supported OPM's determination that an employee in a central office position of Federal Prison Industries, Inc., whose direct contact with persons in detention did not exceed 30% of his time was not a law enforcement officer as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c)(1), and affirmed OPM's denial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's petition for review alleged that the initial decision was based on an erroneous interpretation of statute. He contended that administrative personnel who have frequent direct contact with persons in detention meet the definition of law enforcement officer, and that the duties of his position met the "frequent" test outlined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). A response to the petition for review was filed by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Public Law 80-879, approved July 2, 1948, extended the early retirement option, previously available only to Federal Bureau of Investigation employees, to any employee whose duties were primarily the investigation, apprehension or detention of persons suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States. Thus, coverage was extended to all Federal criminal investigative personnel and prison custodial officers. They could on their own application and upon the recommendation of the head of their department or agency, with the approval of the Civil Service Commission, retire from the service under the provisions of this Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Public Law 84-854, approved July 31, 1956, broadened the definition of the word "detention" to include the duties of all employees of the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated, whose duties required frequent direct contact with individuals in detention, thus permitting non-custodial employees to qualify for early retirement. Employees made eligible by this definition could voluntarily retire from the service if the head of the department or agency recommended retirement and if the Civil Service Commission, after considering fully the degree of hazard to which the employee was subjected in the performance of such duties, approved the recommendation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Public Law 93-350, approved July 12, 1974, amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331 by <span id="Page_4310"></span>adding subsection (20). This subsection contained the definition of law enforcement officer, which definition was identical to that then contained in &#x00A7; 8336(c), but deleted from the law the requirement that the head of the employing agency and the Civil Service Commission consider the degree of hazard to which the employee had been exposed before approving the retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c) had explicitly defined the classes of employees who were eligible for preferential retirement benefits, and the definitions added by Public Law 93-350 were identical, thus any employee who was currently eligible for retirement under the existing provisions of &#x00A7; 8336(c) was covered by the term "law enforcement officer" as defined in Public Law 93-350 without consideration of the degree of hazard to which he had been exposed. It provided that the definition included employees transferred to a supervisory or administrative position if such transfer followed service in a law enforcement position. It further provided that the definition of law enforcement officer would include employees of Federal Prison Industries, Inc. whose duties in connection with individuals in detention required frequent (as determined by the appropriate administrative authority with the concurrence of OPM) direct contact with these individuals in their detention. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.903(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, subsequent to enactment of Public Law 93-350, the Department of Justice sought concurrence of the Civil Service Commission in its determination of what positions in Federal Prison Industries, Inc. were covered as law enforcement personnel. The request included a proviso that the Bureau of Prisons would request Commission concurrence of eligibility for coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c) for any employee hired with no prior correctional facility experience when it appeared that the employee, subsequent to assumption of full-time duties, met the "frequent and direct contact with prisoners" test. The Civil Service Commission concurred with the determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regulations contained at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.901 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> promulgated pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8331 and 8336, provide that an agency shall determine the applicability of the definitions in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20) to employees in that agency after concurrence of OPM with respect to positions not approved by OPM prior to the effective date of Public Law 93-350 (July 12, 1974).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear from the record that appellant is not covered by the definition of a law enforcement officer that includes an employee transferred to an administrative position when service in the position transferred to immediately follows service in a law enforcement position. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.903(c). Appellant's claim, however, is that the definition of detention duties in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20)(A)-(D) covers his position; that the appropriate administrative authority of his agency has determined that his position requires frequent direct contact with prisoners, and failure of OPM to concur with this determination is based on an erroneous interpretation of statute or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.903(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The primary source of controversy is the definition of the phrase "frequent direct contact." Appellant contends that the definition of frequent as "happening or occurring at short intervals" describes his position, and thus he has met the frequent test outlined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(20). OPM, in its denial of creditability of service, states that its application of the word frequent was consistent with the legislative intent of the law. The presiding official, in her initial decision, found that OPM's denial was not arbitrarily made since frequent means constant, habitual or regular.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is settled that administrative construction given statutes by an agency charged with its administration should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong. <span class="Italic">Kenneth v. Schmoll,</span> 482 F.2d 491 (10th Cir. 1970). No such compelling indications exist in the present case. The administrative interpretation should be accepted if it is reasonable, even though there might be another interpretation which itself is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Udall v. Tallman,</span> 380 U.S. 1 (1965). The administrative interpretation of the word frequent to mean constant, habitual, or regular is reasonable and consistent with its literal meaning.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an opinion critical of both OPM and MSPB, the D.C. Circuit reversed in <span class="Italic">Obremski</span>, based on close analysis of the facts, but also imparting its view of the law and process that should be followed in making determinations of law enforcement coverage by OPM and MSPB, <span class="Italic">Obremski v. MSPB</span>, 699 F.2d 1263, 1264-74 (D.C. Cir. 1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case we are asked to review a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board") upholding a determination by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") that petitioner, John J.M. Obremski, is not a "law enforcement officer" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20) (1976 &#x0026; Supp. V 1981), and therefore does not qualify for special retirement benefits provided by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1) (Supp. V 1981). The sole issue is whether petitioner's duties as Corporate Quality Assurance Manager for Federal Prison Industries ("FPI") require him to have "frequent...direct contact" with federal prisoners. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20). Because we believe that the MSPB has sustained a determination by the OPM that misconstrues and misapplies section 8331(20), we reverse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Petitioner's Position with FPI</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">FPI is a government corporation that provides current employment and job training to inmates of the federal prisons through a network of factories within the prison system. In November 1977, FPI hired petitioner as a Corporate Quality Assurance Manager. Petitioner was twenty-seven years old when he took the job, and had no prior experience working for the federal prison system. The formal Vacancy Announcement to which petitioner responded, and on which he represents that he relied, described the job as a "law enforcement officer" position. Furthermore, the official Position Description for the Corporate Quality Assurance Manager job specifically stated that "[t]he incumbent's duties require frequent trips to the correctional institutions within the Federal Prison System, during which direct contact with inmates is common." This "frequent direct contact" with prisoners is a key determinant of "law enforcement officer" status for FPI employees under section 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the record, it appears quite clear that petitioner's actual work experiences in the Corporate Quality Assurance Manager position bear out FPI's job description. The Government disputes neither petitioner's assertion that he spends thirty-percent of his time visiting FPI factories located within correctional institutions, nor petitioner's account of what he does on these trips:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I spend all my time in the factory with the inmates who are manufacturing FPI goods. I am primarily concerned with the Quality Assurance Program and the inmate Quality Assurance Assistants who perform various tasks such as contract review, receiving inspection, in-process inspection, final inspection, testing, blueprint reading, etc. There are approximately 400 inmate Quality Assurance Assistants in the system. I work along with these inmates to verify they have had proper instruction and are knowledgeable in such areas as statistical sampling plans, calibration, classification of defects and life cycle testing. This action is accomplished by accompanying these inmates during their normal work day and by asking questions and observing their actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Petitioner's Attempts to Obtain an Administrative Determination of His Status as a "Law Enforcement Officer"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's problems apparently commenced when he realized that, although his job was described as a "law enforcement officer" position, the amounts being contributed for his retirement fund were insufficient to afford him the special benefits conferred by 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1). In order to cure this problem, petitioner found that he would need further formal declarations regarding his job status. Unfortunately, although petitioner was already performing as a "law enforcement officer" pursuant to a written job description, he faced a bureaucratic stonewall when he sought confirmation of his status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In October 1979, petitioner began an unsuccessful series of attempts to obtain a dispositive determination that he is a "law enforcement officer" eligible for special retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1). Petitioner first sought a determination from his immediate supervisor at FPI, Associate Commissioner Gerald Farkas, who referred the request to FPI's personnel office. Although Farkas subsequently responded positively to the petitioner's request, for a time neither he nor the FPI personnel office acted to make an official determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When he was initially unable to obtain anything more than the Vacancy Announcement and the Position Description from FPI, petitioner went directly to the OPM on January 11, 1980, seeking concurrence in his own "findings" that he is a "law enforcement officer." The OPM refused to give its concurrence. Though the rationale for this decision is far from clear, the determination that petitioner is not a "law enforcement officer" appears to have been based principally on a 1975 letter of agreement between the Department of Justice and the Civil Service Commission that set joint policy on the status of employees of the Bureau of Prisons (but not FPI) under section 8336(c). The letter of agreement established two categories of employees for this purpose: first, all employees stationed inside prisons, and, second, all employees in administrative jobs with the Central or Regional office. The agreement gave blanket "law enforcement officer" coverage to employees in the first category on the presumption that such employees have "frequent direct contact" with inmates (primary coverage), and to all employees in the second category who transferred without break-in-service from a job station within a prison (secondary coverage). For any employee hired directly into an administrative position from a job outside the prison system, the letter of agreement provided that, depending on the nature of the position, the Justice Department would, on a case-by-case basis, seek concurrence from the OPM on whether the particular employee met the "frequent direct contact" test and thus qualified for primary coverage. These latter cases, the letter of agreement pointed out, would be rare. Based on the policy established by this agreement, the OPM, noting that petitioner is an administrative employee, rejected petitioner's claim for coverage because he did not transfer from a prison-based job, and because he spends the "major part" of his time at the Central Office and therefore fails the "frequent direct contact" test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4311"></span>Petitioner sought clarification of the OPM's decision on April 10, 1980. He pointed out that he is not an employee of the Bureau of Prisons, but rather of FPI. He also posed several specific questions to the OPM, including queries about the OPM's specific definition of "frequent direct contact," the individuals at FPI who may be "appropriate administrative authorit[ies] " for purposes of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20),[7] and the effect of the Job Vacancy Announcement advertising his job as a "law enforcement officer" position. The OPM issued a clarifying ruling on May 7, 1980, again denying petitioner's request for a determination of eligibility under section 8336(c)(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We have defined the term "frequent direct contact" as an employee who is primarily in direct contact with individuals in their detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training, care, transportation or rehabilitation. Accordingly, all employees working inside the prison walls with the Bureau of Prisons and the Federal Prison Industries, Inc., are considered as covered under section 8336(c)(1). Such employees working in penal and correctional institutions are constantly, [sic] interviewing, counseling, instructing and supervising the work of prisoners. This is in contrast with the employee who works in the central office whose duties require only occasional visits to the penal or correctional institutions. Therefore, the rights of these employees, such as yourself, will be determined on an individual basis and governed by the facts and circumstances in each particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Section 8331(20) provides that the determination whether an employee meets the "frequent direct contact" test shall be made by "the appropriate administrative authority with the concurrence of the [OPM]." <span class="Italic">See</span> Part II.B.2. <span class="Italic">infra.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argued that he satisfies the "frequent direct contact" test since his visits to prisons would total six years over the course of a twenty-year career. The OPM rejected this contention, explaining that "[i]f you had been able to show that for a sufficient period of time while employed with the Federal Prison Industrits, [sic] Inc., rather than for your entire career, you met the 'frequent and direct contact' requirement with prisoners, your subsequent service would be creditable under section 8336(c)(1) in the administrative category"; but "your service [is] not creditable...since the major part of your time [is] spent in the Central Office in Washington, D.C." In response to petitioner's question about who at FPI is an "appropriate administrative authority," the OPM noted that one or more of several FPI officials may "make...a recommendation" of eligibility. Finally, addressing the Vacancy Announcement, the OPM cited the 1975 letter of agreement as controlling on OPM's view of petitioner's job status despite the Announcement, and referred petitioner to FPI's personnel office for FPI's view of the effect of the Announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unsatisfied, petitioner sought formal reconsideration of the OPM's decision on June 6, 1980. This time petitioner submitted a letter from Associate Commissioner Farkas certifying that petitioner spends thirty-percent of his time visiting prison factories and therefore meets the "frequent direct contact" test. Nevertheless, on August 12, 1980, the OPM affirmed its earlier determinations, essentially summarizing the reasoning used in the first two decisions. It first explained that "'frequent direct contact' [means] an employee who is primarily in direct contact with individuals in their detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training, care, transportation or rehabilitation." Applying that test to the facts of petitioner's case, the OPM again ruled petitioner ineligible for credit as a "law enforcement officer." He did not "transfer[&#8197;] ...from a covered position at a penal institution," nor did he meet the "frequent direct contact" test "[s]ince only approximately 30% of [his] worktime [w]as spent on field visits." Thus, the decision concluded, in view of the time petitioner spends in the field and of the OPM's agreement with the Justice Department, petitioner's service as a "Quality Assurance Specialist, Federal Prison Industries, Inc....with the Bureau of Prisons" is not creditable under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.&#x2003;Proceedings Before the MSPB</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner appealed to the MSPB, asking the Board to determine that he qualifies as a "law enforcement officer" under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1). Acknowledging that FPI's job description includes within petitioner's duties "frequent trips to correctional institutions during which direct contact with inmates is common," that Associate Commissioner Farkas certified to the OPM petitioner's "frequent direct contact" with inmates, and that at the Board's hearing petitioner presented evidence tending to support such contact, the presiding official nonetheless upheld the OPM's refusal to concur. Since the dictionary defines "frequent" as "constant, habitual or regular," the presiding official explained, "the [OPM's] denial of concurrence does not seem to be arbitrarily made." She made this finding, citing deference to a "reasonable" administrative interpretation of the statute, despite the fact that the OPM actually interpreted "frequent" to mean "primarily." <span class="Italic">See</span> note 21 <span class="Italic">infra</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The full Board sustained the presiding official's decision, relying entirely on deference to an agency's interpretation of a statute under its administrative jurisdiction. The presiding official correctly upheld the OPM's determination, the MSPB ruled, because the "administrative construction given statutes by an agency charged with its [sic] administration should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong." Here, the Board explained, there are no such compelling indications, and "[t]he administrative interpretation of the word frequent to mean constant, habitual, or regular is reasonable and consistent with its literal meaning."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This petition for review followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;Scope of Review</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The standards for judicial review of MSPB decisions are familiar ones." <span class="Italic">Gipson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 682 F.2d 1004, 1008 (D.C. Cir. 1982). "[w]e are required to 'review the record and hold unlawful and set aside any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be--(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence....'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c) (Supp. IV 1980)). These statutory standards, drawn from the Administrative Procedure Act, accord with settled principles of administrative law. We thus have no quarrel with the Government's admonition that MSPB decisions generally deserve deference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue under review, however, is one of interpretation and application of a statutory term to settled facts. Under the Administrative Procedure Act "the reviewing court shall decide all relevant questions of law, [and] interpret constitutional and statutory provisions...." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 706 (1976). Thus, where statutory terms "are not defined by the statute and their exact meaning is in dispute[,] ...the courts...ultimately determine as a matter of law what they include." <span class="Italic">FTC v. Gratz,</span> 253 U.S. 421, 427, 40 S. Ct. 572, 574, 64 L. Ed. 993 (1920). Of course, we recognize the equally well established rule that in reviewing an agency's application of statutory terms with which it has administrative charge "[t]he judicial role is narrow." <span class="Italic">Beth Israel Hospital v. NLRB,</span> 437 U.S. 483, 501, 98 S. Ct. 2463, 2473, 57 L. Ed.2d 370 (1978). But this limited judicial role assumes an adequately articulated administrative decision interpreting the relevant statutory law within a range of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Federal Election Campaign Commission v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee,</span> 454 U.S. 27, 37, 102 S. Ct. 38, 44, 70 L. Ed.2d 23 (1981) ("the thoroughness, validity, and consistency of an agency's reasoning are factors that bear on the amount of deference to be given an agency's ruling"). The judicial role is not so limited where, as here, the agency interpretation under review is poorly reasoned and eminently out of accord with applicable law.[22] Unlike the MSPB in this case, we are thus unwilling simply [to] abdicate [our] responsibility by mumbling an indiscriminate litany of cases that extends "great deference to administrative conclusions." There is more to the judicial role. "Reviewing courts are not obliged to stand aside and rubber-stamp their affirmance of administrative decisions that they deem inconsistent with a statutory mandate or that frustrate the congressional policy underlying a statute." <span class="Italic">Hi-Craft Clothing Co. v. NLRB,</span> 660 F.2d 910, 914 (9th Cir. 1981) (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Brown,</span> 380 U.S. 278, 291, 85 S. Ct. 980, 988, 13 L. Ed.2d 839 (1965)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;Two other factors militate against deference to the OPM's interpretation of the statute in this case. First, under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20), Congress gave the principal role in interpreting the statutory term at issue to "the appropriate administrative authority," and left for the OPM the role of approving or disapproving that authority's determination. This implies a secondary decisionmaking role for the OPM, <span class="Italic">see</span> Part II.B.2. <span class="Italic">infra</span>, and, as a result, diminishes the weight that should be granted the OPM's construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. GAO v. GAO Personnel Appeals Board,</span> 698 F.2d 516 at 528 n.63 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (refusing to defer to GAO's construction of statute granting both GAO and GAO Personnel Appeals Board implementation authority, since Appeals Board given sole discretion to implement the particular provision at issue). Second, the OPM was not acting here in a broad policymaking or rulemaking mode. Although the OPM has rulemaking powers on many other matters, in this instance it was not acting in the role of an agency to which great deference is usually accorded. <span class="Italic">Cf. Federal Election Campaign Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm.,</span> 454 U.S. 27, 37, 102 S. Ct. 38, 44, 70 L. Ed.2d 23 (1981) ("deference should presumptively be afforded" to agency authorized to make rules and formulate broad policy in administering statute)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explain below, the OPM interpreted 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20) in a manner that is plainly at odds with the statute's meaning. And it did so conclusorily, without giving any consideration to the contrary view of FPI. This at once vitiates whatever deference would otherwise be due the administrative interpretation of the statute and requires us to reverse the MSPB's decision sustaining the OPM's determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4312"></span>B.&#x2003;The "Law Enforcement Officer" Definition in 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8331(20) of title 5, United States Code, provides, in part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"law enforcement officer" means an employee, the duties of whose position are primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention of individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States, including an employee engaged in this activity who is transferred to a supervisory or administrative position. For the purpose of this paragraph, "detention" includes the duties of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;employees of the Bureau of Prisons and Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;employees of the Public Health Service assigned to the field service of the Bureau of Prisons or of the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;employees in the field service at Army or Navy disciplinary barracks or at confinement and rehabilitation facilities operated by any of the armed forces; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(D)&#x2003;employees in the Department of Corrections of the District of Columbia, its industries and utilities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">whose duties in connection with individuals in detention suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States or of the District of Columbia or offenses against the punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (chapter 47 of title 10) require frequent (as determined by the appropriate administrative authority with the concurrence of the [OPM] direct contact with these individuals in their detention, direction, supervision, inspection, training employment, care, transportation, or rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proper interpretation of this somewhat inartfully drawn provision requires careful parsing. First, because petitioner is an employee working with the "Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated" (as opposed to a guard or an official stationed at a prison), we must determine whether his "duties in connection with [detained] individuals...require frequent...direct contact with these individuals." Second, we must determine whether the overall duties of petitioner's job "primarily" involve detention (as distinguished from "frequent...direct contact" with prisoners in detention). Following this approach, which gives full meaning to all relevant portions of the statute, there can be no doubt but that petitioner's job meets the specification of "law enforcement officer."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute defines "detention" to include the "duties" of any FPI employee, if those duties "in connection with [detained] individuals...require frequent...direct contact with [such] individuals." Petitioner's job description and his work routine make clear that all of his job duties relate to supervision of work performed by inmates; he cannot carry out the duties of that position without visiting prisons regularly. Thus, if petitioner's duties as Quality Assurance Manager require prison trips that are sufficiently regular and that involve sufficiently close dealings with inmates as to satisfy the "frequent direct contact" test, all of petitioner's duties as Quality Assurance Manager constitute "detention." Since petitioner's sole duties with FPI are as Quality Assurance Manager, there can be no question that--if the duties of the position constitute "detention"--petitioner's duties "primarily" involve detention. The whole analysis of petitioner's "law enforcement officer" status thus comes down to the "frequent direct contact" test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;The OPM's Erroneous Definition of "Frequent"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The most glaring error in this case is the OPM's misconstruction of the term "frequent." The definition of "frequent" ultimately adopted by the OPM is that "'frequent direct contact' [only includes] an employee who is primarily in direct contact" with inmates. Whatever else may be said about the meaning of section 8331(20), one thing that is clear is that the reference to "frequent" does not mean "primarily." As one congressional commentator attempted to explain to the OPM in correspondence on petitioner's case, "if the Congress had intended...'primar[ily] '..., the Congress would have used that term when defining 'detention' as it did in the basic definition of 'law enforcement officer.'" To read the two terms as synonymous renders the word "frequent" superfluous and collapses the statute into confusing circularity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It seems that the OPM adopted this definition to assign some quantifiable meaning to what is inherently a relative term. Thus, the OPM was able to tell petitioner that he does not come within the statute because he spends the "major part" of his time at the Central Office. And more recently the OPM was able to report to the Chair of the House Subcommittee on Compensation and Employee Benefits that "'frequent direct contact'...describ[es] the duties of an employee who is primarily (at least 51% of the time) in direct contact" with inmates.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The meaning of "frequent," however, is heavily dependent on the factual context. The term cannot be defined in any meaningful way by looking to dictionary definitions or by assigning a cut-off number to all cases. Any attempt to define the term without intimate knowledge of the particular employee's duties and the duties of others in comparable jobs must inevitably be arbitrary. That is precisely why Congress assigned the principal role in determining "frequent direct contact" to the "appropriate administrative authority," with the OPM left only to approve or disapprove an initial determination of coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;The OPM's Failure to Consider FPI's View of Petitioner's "Law Enforcement Officer" Status</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8331(20) provides that the determination of "frequent direct contact" is to be made by "the appropriate administrative authority with the concurrence of the [OPM]." "Appropriate administrative authority" refers to the employing agency, or, as the OPM has recognized, an "official[&#8197;] of [a] major division[&#8197;] " of that agency delegated authority to make the determination. The phrasing of the statute--"frequent...as determined by the appropriate administrative authority with the concurrence of the [OPM] "--clearly suggests that the employing agency determines coverage under section 8331(20) in the first instance, and that the OPM's role is limited to approving the initial determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We think this ordering of decisionmaking roles requires that the determination of the employing agency be given a fair degree of deference by the OPM, since that agency and its officials are likely to be the most familiar with the nature of a particular employee's job. The employing agency, moreover, has the greatest interest in and should have the greatest control over structuring the jobs within its own workforce. The OPM remains free to withhold its concurrence if the employing agency's determination is demonstrably incorrect or adversely affects administration of the early retirement system as a whole, but any such refusal must be soundly justified, adequately articulated, and based upon a proper construction of section 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the OPM totally failed to consider the unrefuted evidence supporting FPI's view that petitioner has "frequent direct contact" with prisoners, its refusal to concur in this case was wholly arbitrary and cannot stand. All of the evidence shows that FPI took the view that petitioner's job falls within the scope of section 8336(c)(1). The Vacancy Announcement advertised the job as a "law enforcement officer" position. FPI's official job description indicates that petitioner must "frequently" travel to prisons and that on such trips he has "direct contact" with prisoners. And Associate Commissioner Farkas, petitioner's supervisor at FPI, certified to the OPM that petitioner has "frequent direct contact" with prisoners. Particularly given the absence of any contrary indications, these factors unmistakably demonstrate that FPI's consistent official view was that petitioner has "frequent direct contact" with prisoners.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM ignored this evidence. Its decision never mentioned Associate Commissioner Farkas' letter certifying that petitioner has "frequent direct contacts," apparently treating that letter as a "recommendation" carrying no weight as against the OPM's contrary view. The OPM also wholly failed to address the official documentation indicating that FPI viewed petitioner's job as a covered "law enforcement officer" position. In response to petitioner's question about the Job Vacancy Announcement, the OPM essentially took the position that, whatever the view of the FPI's personnel office, established OPM policy on "law enforcement officer" status for Bureau of Prison employees supersedes the Announcement. And despite OPM regulations making clear that job descriptions are crucial evidence to any determination of "law enforcement officer" status, the OPM never once mentioned the language in FPI's job description tracking virtually verbatim the "frequent direct contact" phrase in section 8331(20). Although we fail to see how there could have been any uncertainty in this case, if OPM officials were somehow unsure of FPI's view of petitioner's job, an inquiry could have been made of FPI officials. Such an inquiry was never made; rather, the OPM simply ignored the determination of the "appropriate administrative authority" and openly disregarded the critical, undisputed facts concerning the petitioner's job. As demonstrated above, officials at the OPM were apparently blinded by their own blatant misconstruction of section 8331(20).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Were the facts here disputed, we might be inclined to remand for further consideration by the OPM. But there is no factual dispute, and the OPM--after thrice considering the case--has repeatedly applied, in the most conclusory fashion, an incorrect interpretation of the controlling statutory term. Accordingly, we hold that, as clearly set forth in FPI's official documentation on petitioner's position, petitioner has "frequent direct contact" with federal prisoners, and is therefore entitled to credit for special retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the OPM erred as a matter of law in determining that petitioner is not a "law enforcement officer" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331(20). We accordingly reverse the MSPB's affirmance of that determination. We instruct the MSPB to enter an appropriate order declaring petitioner to be eligible for early retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8336(c)(1) based on the complete term of his service with FPI, i.e., retroactive to the date when petitioner commenced working at FPI. The MSPB shall, in implementing <span id="Page_4313"></span>this decision, afford petitioner whatever particularized relief may be necessary and appropriate to give full effect to the judgment here rendered.</p>
