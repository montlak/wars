<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 731.203 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;OPM may require that an appointee or an employee be removed on the basis of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment; refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter; or a statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the person's lawful employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The grounds for OPM-directed suitability actions are limited to those described in the regulations. OPM exceeds its authority if it bases a suitability action on a charge of misconduct or negligence in employment. <span class="Italic">Hunt-O'Neal v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 286, 291 &#x00B6; 11, 2011 MSPB 33 (2011).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2015, Congress apparently modified the result reached in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, and removed from statutory adverse action protections OPM-directed suitability actions against tenured employees. 5 USC 7512 now provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subchapter applies to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">but does not apply to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a suitability action taken by the Office under regulations prescribed by the Office, subject to the rules prescribed by the President under this title for the administration of the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Odoh v. OPM</span>, 2022 MSPB 5, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2022), explained of the statutory amendment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court analyzed the interplay between the statutory appeal rights of tenured Federal employees for adverse actions and OPM's suitability regulations in <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Hopper</span>, 786 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The court concluded that an "employee," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), had the right to appeal an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) even if that adverse action stemmed from a negative suitability determination by OPM. <span class="Italic">Archuleta</span>, 786 F.3d at 1347-51; <span class="Italic">see Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-31 (2011) (reaching the same result). In such cases, the court found that the Board must conduct an independent review of OPM's penalty in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Archuleta</span>, 786 F.3d at 1352-53; <span class="Italic">see Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 33-34; <span class="Italic">see also Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981) (listing factors relevant to a determination of the appropriateness of a penalty). In reaching these conclusions, the court reasoned that <span id="Page_795"></span>Congress could have, but had not, excluded suitability-based removals from the coverage of chapter 75. <span class="Italic">Archuleta</span>, 786 F.3d at 1348, 1351. However, Congress has since amended the relevant statute to do just that.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016), Pub. L. No. 114-92, section 1086(f)(9), 129 Stat. 726, 1010 (2015), an appealable adverse action does not include "a suitability action taken by [OPM] under regulations prescribed by [OPM], subject to the rules prescribed by the President under this title for the administration of the competitive service."[2] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(F). Accordingly, when OPM makes a suitability determination pursuant to its regulations, as it did here, the Board does not have the authority to adjudicate the matter as a chapter 75 adverse action, even if the appellant is a tenured Federal employee.[3] Instead, the Board's jurisdiction over a negative suitability determination is limited to that provided under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, which does not extend to reviewing or modifying the ultimate action taken as a result of a suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See Folio v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 402 F.3d 1350, 1353, 1355-56 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Because the administrative judge sustained only one of the two charges, she properly remanded the matter for OPM to decide whether the actions taken are still appropriate. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1355 (observing that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, the Board must remand the suitability action to OPM if it sustains one or more, but not all, of the charges).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Act refers to actions taken by the "Office," without identifying the office in question. We have reviewed the legislative history, but have similarly been unable to find any definition. <span class="Italic">See</span> Legislative Intent and Joint Explanatory Statement to Accompany S. 1356, Pub. L. No. 114-92, 114th Cong., 1st Sess., 750 (Comm. Print 2015). However, "Office" is used elsewhere in chapter 75 to refer to OPM. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(b)(2)(B), (c). Therefore, we assume that it has the same meaning here. <span class="Italic">See</span> Norman J.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Even if 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(F) did not explicitly preclude us from addressing OPM's negative suitability determination under chapter 75, the record demonstrates that the appellant was serving an initial 1-year probationary period in the competitive service. Thus, he was not an "employee" with chapter 75 Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). Therefore, we do not address any question concerning the retroactivity of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(F) to the circumstances at hand, in which the misconduct occurred prior to the November 25, 2015 enactment of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016, but OPM took its suitability action after its enactment. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 114-92, 129 Stat. 726 (reflecting the date of enactment).

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Background</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first addressed the question at hand in the case of <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276 (2009). Mr. Aguzie was employed in the competitive service as a Budget Analyst with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR). More than 2 years after his appointment, OPM informed Mr. Aguzie that it had found him unsuitable for any covered position[2] in the federal service on the grounds that he had made material, intentional false statements on several forms submitted in connection with his application and appointment. OPM further informed Mr. Aguzie that it had taken the following actions: (1) directed USCCR to remove him from the rolls within 5 days of receipt of its decision, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.304; (2) cancelled any reinstatement eligibility obtained from his appointment or any other eligibilities he may have had for covered positions; and (3) debarred him from competition for, or appointment to, any covered position for a period of 3 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101 defines a "covered position" as "a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Aguzie appealed the suitability actions to the Board pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501. Following a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that OPM's suitability determination was supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The administrative judge did not review the suitability actions themselves, <span class="Italic">citing Folio v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 402 F.3d 1350, 1353-55 (Fed. Cir. 2005), for the proposition that the Board's review of a suitability determination includes an evaluation of the criteria set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, but does not extend to the ultimate action taken by OPM.[3] The administrative judge further found that Mr. Aguzie failed to prove his affirmative defenses of harmful error and discrimination based on race and national origin.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;OPM's suitability regulations, as revised effective June 15, 2008, now state that it is the "suitability action" which may be appealed to the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a). In our original decisions in these appeals, we raised the question of whether that revision altered the scope of the Board's regulatory jurisdiction, thereby superseding <span class="Italic">Folio</span>. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1 n.1, 7; <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 273, &#x00B6; 6 (2009). On reconsideration, OPM states that the revision was not intended to expand the Board's review authority beyond the merits of the underlying suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> OPM Brief at 13, n.5. Because we find that the appellants' removals are reviewable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), we do not decide at present whether this is a permissible construction of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board denied Mr. Aguzie's petition for review but reopened the case on its own motion to address the question, not previously raised by the parties, of whether Mr. Aguzie was entitled to appeal his removal as an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. The Board noted that at the time of his removal Mr. Aguzie was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) and that removal actions generally fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Thus, the Board reasoned, it appeared Mr. Aguzie might have a statutory right to appeal his removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), in which case the Board would have the authority to review and potentially mitigate the removal action. The Board remanded the appeal to provide the parties an opportunity to brief the question of whether Mr. Aguzie is entitled to appeal his removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) and, if so, whether the other actions on appeal remain within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501. <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That same day, the Board issued a companion decision in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 273 (2009), remanding that appeal for consideration of the same issues. Ms. Barnes, a competitive service employee of the Department of Homeland Security, Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS), had completed her probationary period when OPM found her unsuitable for her position based on a charge of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. Pursuant to that determination, OPM took the following actions: (1) directed CIS to remove her from the rolls within 5 work days of its receipt of the decision; (2) cancelled any reinstatement eligibility obtained from her appointment or any other eligibilities she may have had on existing competitive registers; and (3) debarred her from competition for, or appointment to, any position in the competitive service for a period of 3 years. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 2. As in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the administrative judge sustained the suitability determination without reviewing the propriety of the suitability actions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM subsequently filed a request to reopen <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> and <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> for adjudication by the full Board. The Board granted OPM's request and consolidated the appeals pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(f)(1). The Board later added two additional cases, <span class="Italic">Scott v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. CH-0731-09-0578-I-1, and <span class="Italic">Hunt-O'Neal v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0731-09-0240-I-1, to the consolidated appeal, over the objections of Mr. Scott and OPM, respectively.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that the interpretation of a statute begins with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Where the language provides a clear answer, the inquiry ends, and the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the language of the statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) provides that, "[u]nder regulations prescribed by [OPM], an agency may take an action covered by this subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) in turn provides that "[a]n employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701." Section 7513 does not authorize or refer to any action that is not subject to the efficiency of the service standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Consequently, the right of appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) applies where an action falls under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), i.e., where the action is: (1) taken by an "agency"; (2) covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II; and (3) taken against an "employee" as defined for purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. We address these requirements in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The OPM-Directed Removal of an Employee Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731 Is an Action Taken By an "Agency"</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_796"></span>We first find that an OPM-directed removal for suitability reasons is an action taken by an "agency." OPM has disputed this point, arguing that the term "agency," as used in chapter 75 subchapter II, refers exclusively to an employing agency, and therefore does not refer to OPM outside its capacity as an employer. We need not decide the merits of that argument, for it is clear from the language of OPM's suitability regulations, as well as their underlying authority at Civil Service Rule V, that when OPM directs the removal of an employee for suitability reasons, it is the employing agency that ultimately takes the action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Civil Service Rule V, &#x00A7; 5.3(1), codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(1) (authorizing the Director of OPM to instruct an agency to "separate or take other action" against an employee found disqualified for federal employment); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.304 (providing that "the employing agency must remove the...employee" pursuant to OPM's decision); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(10) (referring to actions "taken or directed" under part 731). It is true that OPM makes the underlying decision and the role of the employing agency is essentially ministerial. However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 does not require that the agency taking the action be the same agency that makes the decision underlying the action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our original decisions in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> and <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, we speculated that if an OPM-directed removal were appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), the employing agency would be the proper respondent on the grounds that it effected the action. <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 273, &#x00B6; 5. Upon further consideration, we are now persuaded that this is not the case. While we are aware of no statute or regulation defining which agency is the proper respondent in an appeal before the Board, we observe that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c), it is the "decision of the agency" which the Board will sustain or not sustain. In the case of a directed suitability removal, the action, though effected by the employing agency, is the result of a decision by OPM--a decision with which the employing agency had no choice but to comply and which it may or may not care to defend. We therefore find that, regardless of whether a directed removal action for suitability reasons is appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), it is incumbent on OPM to support the underlying decision by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We recognize the peculiarity of finding that the term "agency" means the employing agency in the context of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), but OPM in the context of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c). That result, however, is a consequence of Civil Service Rule V and OPM's own regulations, which deprive the employing agency of the discretion to take or not take an OPM-directed removal. In its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, the Department of the Treasury suggests that the term "agency" as used in 5 U.S.C. chapter 77 applies exclusively to employing agencies, and therefore cannot refer to OPM outside its capacity as an employer. There is no merit to that argument, as it is well-established that appeals of OPM retirement decisions are governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. <span class="Italic">See Garza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 336, &#x00B6; 16 (1999), and cases cited therein. Therefore, OPM is an "agency" for purposes of chapter 77, regardless of the capacity in which it acts in a particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 Subchapter II Covers Suitability-Based Removals</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next question to be considered is whether an OPM-directed removal[6] for suitability reasons is an action covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 provides that, with certain enumerated exceptions, chapter 75 subchapter II covers the following actions: a removal, a suspension of more than 14 days, a reduction in grade, a reduction in pay, and a furlough of 30 days or less. The complete list of exceptions is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; a reduction-in-force action under section 3502 of this title;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3321(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming such a supervisor or manager;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; a reduction in grade or removal under section 4303 of this title; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; an action initiated under section 1215 or 7521 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">[6]&#x2003; It is well settled that a dismissal based on material misrepresentation in appointment constitutes a removal action, not a voiding of the appointment. <span class="Italic">See Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1563-64 (Fed. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">superseded by rule on other grounds as stated in Bloomer v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 966 F.2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notably, the list does not include suitability actions taken under 5 C.F.R. part 731 or any of its underlying authorities. Under canons of statutory interpretation, where a statute enumerates certain exceptions to a general rule, other unenumerated exceptions are excluded. <span class="Italic">Andrus v. Glover Const. Co</span>., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980). Applying that principle, we may readily infer that OPM-directed removals under 5 C.F.R. part 731 are among the actions covered by the subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the clear language of the statute, OPM has promulgated regulations that purport to exempt removals under 5 C.F.R. part 731 from coverage under 5 C.F.R. part 752, which incorporates 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. <span class="Italic">See</span> C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.301. Specifically, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(f) provides that "an action to remove...an employee for suitability reasons under...part 731 is not an action under part 752." Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(10) similarly provides that part 752 procedures do not apply to actions "taken or directed by [OPM] under part 731...of this chapter." These regulations, if valid, would preclude the Board from adjudicating an OPM-directed removal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731 under the procedures and standards applicable to adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. OPM concedes, as it must, that its regulations cannot override statute. We are therefore faced with the question of whether OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(10) can be reconciled with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In defense of its regulations, OPM appeals to the fact that the regulatory distinction between suitability actions and adverse actions predates the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.302(c), 752.103(b)(2) (1978) (excluding removals directed by the Civil Service Commission from coverage under part 752). OPM first contends that Congress preserved that distinction through the Savings Provision at &#x00A7; 902(a) of the CSRA, which provides that "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Act...all executive orders, rules, and regulations affecting the Federal service shall continue in effect, according to their terms, until modified, terminated, superseded, or repealed by the President [or OPM]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 note. However, OPM neglects to consider that it long ago rendered the Savings Provision moot by modifying its own regulations to implement the relevant portions of the CSRA, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See</span> 44 Fed. Reg. 47,029 (Aug. 10, 1979) (implementing subchapters I and II of chapter 75); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 44 Fed. Reg. 47,523 (Aug. 14, 1979) (modifying 5 C.F.R. part 731 to recognize transfer of function from Civil Service Commission to OPM). Having modified its regulations following enactment of the CSRA, OPM can no longer rely on the Savings Provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM goes on to cite <span class="Italic">Lackhouse v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 773 F.2d 313 (Fed. Cir. 1985), for the proposition that Congress is presumed to be aware of the existence of civil service rules in enacting statutes and, if it intends to amend or repeal them, will so indicate. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 316 n.6, 317 (finding that the Veterans Preference Act of 1944 did not alter the co-existence of the "rule of three" with recognition of veterans' preference). Congress, OPM rightly observes, has not expressed an intent to repeal Civil Service Rule V, which is the immediate source of OPM's authority to make suitability determinations and to direct employing agencies to remove employees found to be disqualified for federal service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5.2(a), 5.3(1). Rule V, however, is silent on the question of whether the OPM-directed suitability removal of a tenured employee is covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. The implementing regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.304(f) and 752.401(b)(10), which purport to exclude suitability actions from coverage under the subchapter, are not civil service rules, nor have they ever had that status. Furthermore, unlike the "rule of three" at issue in <span class="Italic">Lackhouse</span>, the regulations at issue here facially conflict with the relevant portions of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lackhouse</span>, 773 F.2d at 316 (relying on the absence of a facial conflict between the "rule of three" and the portions of the CSRA concerning veterans' preference).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM further appeals to the principle that the regulations of an agency exercising rulemaking authority delegated to it by Congress are generally entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984). It is true that Congress has expressly authorized OPM to prescribe regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II, except with respect to matters within the Board's rulemaking authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514. However, when reviewing an agency's construction of a statute, "[f]irst, always, is the question whether Congress has spoken directly to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43. Only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue will the inquiry proceed to the question of whether the agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Hence, in order to establish that its regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(1) are entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference, OPM must, as a threshold matter, establish that, notwithstanding the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, Congress has not directly addressed the question of whether chapter 75 subchapter II covers suitability-based removals of tenured employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of that effort, OPM cites <span class="Italic">Burns v. United States</span>, 501 U.S. 129 (1991), <span class="Italic">superseded by rule as stated in</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Carey</span>, 382 F.3d 387 (3d Cir. 2004), for the proposition that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, "not every silence is pregnant," and that "[a]n inference drawn from congressional silence cannot be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 136. Here, OPM contends, the contextual evidence establishes that <span id="Page_797"></span>Congress did not intend to place suitability actions within the scope of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. Congress, OPM explains, crafted the list of exceptions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 in order to conform the section with other provisions of Title 5, including the new removal and demotion provisions at 5 U.S.C. chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(D); S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 50, <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2772. By contrast, OPM argues, Congress had no occasion to specify that suitability removals were not covered, because suitability procedures were not codified under Title 5 and had already long coexisted with chapter 75 as a distinct basis for removal. Thus, OPM contends, the absence of suitability actions from the list of exclusions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 does not require a finding that suitability actions are covered under the subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded by OPM's analysis. In <span class="Italic">Burns</span>, the Court interpreted a federal rule of criminal procedure, which at that time provided a defendant the right to comment on a proposed departure from sentencing guidelines, but did not explicitly require the court to notify the defendant that it was considering such a departure. The majority read a notice requirement into the rule, reasoning that without a right to notice, the right to comment would be meaningless and thus not to infer a right to notice "would render what Congress has <span class="Italic">expressly</span> said absurd." <span class="Italic">Burns</span>, 501 U.S. at 135-36 (emphasis in original). That rationale does not apply here, however, for OPM has not shown that reading 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 to cover suitability removals would render it or any other express statutory provision meaningless or absurd. The statutes underlying OPM's authority to direct suitability removals, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1302, 3301, and 7301, are completely silent on the question of whether such actions are covered by 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. OPM also neglects to consider that in <span class="Italic">Burns</span>, the Court found that due process considerations favored a broad reading of the rule at issue: "Notwithstanding the absence of express statutory language, this Court has readily construed statutes that authorize deprivations of liberty or property to require that the Government give affected individuals <span class="Italic">both</span> notice <span class="Italic">and</span> a meaningful opportunity to be heard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 137-38 (emphasis in original). Here, due process concerns would, if anything, favor a broader interpretation of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, there is evidence that Congress did consider suitability removals when defining the scope of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. In the Senate Report accompanying the CSRA, the Senate's Committee of Government Affairs noted that in 1976, a total of 17,157 employees were dismissed from federal service. S. Rep. No. 95-969 at 9 (1978). The committee went on to specify the numbers of employees dismissed on various different grounds, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 418 employees "separated for suitability reasons." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The report later states: "The actions covered in [chapter 75] subchapter II may be appealed by the employee to the board. These provisions govern any such action where the basis of the action is conduct <span class="Italic">or any other cause</span> besides unacceptable performance." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 46 (emphasis added). In light of the report's prior reference to suitability as a cause for dismissal, it would be reasonable to conclude that Congress did contemplate that suitability removals of tenured employees would be covered under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. Moreover, to expand the subchapter to include the suitability removal of a tenured employee, thereby granting the employee a statutory right of appeal, would be consistent with the expressly stated intent of Congress that "Federal employees should receive appropriate protection through increasing the authority and powers of the Merit Systems Protection Board in processing hearing and appeals affecting Federal employees." CSRA, &#x00A7; 3(3), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 note.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of compelling evidence of contrary Congressional intent, we discern no reason to abandon a plain language reading of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Indeed, even if such evidence existed, we would have no choice but to abide by the unambiguous language of the statute. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151. To the extent OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(10) are inconsistent with our statutory obligation to hear appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), we decline to follow them. <span class="Italic">Cf. DoPadre v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 346, 351-52 (1996) (invalidating regulation intended to limit Board's authority to review OPM's application of regulations governing court orders affecting retirement benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has also argued that the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a), which lists the actions appealable before the Board, distinguishes between a removal "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service," pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II and 5 C.F.R. part 752, from "the disqualification of an employee or applicant because of a suitability determination," pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(2), (7). However, OPM has not shown that the appealable actions listed at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a) must be read as mutually exclusive. Indeed, they are not. In <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), our reviewing court held that an agency may take a mixed removal action, relying on chapter 43 for "unacceptable performance" with an alternative or additional charge under chapter 75 "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843. In such a case, the court explained, "the appropriate standard of review by MSPB should be applied according to the basis for each specific charge." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, we would adjudicate the removal as both an adverse action under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(1) and a performance-based action under &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(2). Similarly, our regulations do not preclude us from construing the appellants' removals as appealable actions under both 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(2) and (7).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellants Are Employees for Purposes of 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 Subchapter II</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final requirement for coverage under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) is that the individual against whom the action is taken be an "employee." For purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II, the term "employee" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), and includes an individual in the competitive service who is not serving a probationary or trial period under an initial appointment, or who has completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. <span class="Italic">See McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1343-44 (Fed. Cir. 2002). It is undisputed that both Mr. Aguzie and Ms. Barnes satisfy that definition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not to say, however, that their status as tenured employees renders them immune from suitability actions. The appellants contend that by taking suitability actions against tenured employees, OPM has exceeded its statutory authority, in particular, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301, which provides that the President may:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the executive branch as will best promote the efficiency of the service; [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;ascertain the fitness of applicants as to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellants rightly point out, these provisions are concerned with the admissions process and the fitness of applicants, and do not directly concern tenured employees. However, we find nothing in the language of the statute that would preclude OPM from making an after-the-fact determination that a tenured employee serving an appointment subject to investigation was improperly admitted or was unfit at the time he applied. Furthermore, Rule V provides that the Director of OPM may determine "after appointment" whether the civil service rules and regulations were met with respect to that appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2(a). Neither 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 nor Rule V set a deadline for making such a determination or for taking corrective action based on that determination.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Prior to the CSRA, the regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731 provided that appointments would remain subject to investigation for no longer than 1 year after the effective date of the appointment, except in cases involving intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.301(b) (1978). Although OPM's current regulations do not set a time limit for investigation, they contemplate that an investigation will not continue indefinitely, but must in each case conclude in a suitability determination, i.e., a decision that the individual is suitable or not suitable for employment in covered positions in the federal government or in a specific agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(b)(1), (3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with these underlying authorities, the regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731 allow for an appointment to remain subject to investigation after the probationary period is complete. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(b)(1). OPM has also reserved the authority to make suitability determinations and take or direct suitability actions against an "employee," defined for purposes of 5 C.F.R. part 731 as an individual who has completed the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.101(b), 731.105(d). Thus, individuals who qualify as tenured employees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), whether by virtue of having completed a probationary period or having met the 1 year current continuous service criterion, are not on that account exempt from OPM-initiated suitability actions. Our holding is rather that the appellants' removals, though authorized by 5 C.F.R. part 731, are also subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The OPM-Directed Removal of a Tenured Employee Is TTaken UnderT 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and Therefore Appealable Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons discussed above, we find that the directed removal of a tenured employee falls under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), and may therefore be taken only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service.[8] This would appear to resolve the question of whether the appellants have a right of appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), which provides that an employee "against whom an action is taken under this section" may appeal to the Board. OPM contends, however, that the appellants' removals were not "taken under" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 because it invoked 5 C.F.R. part 731 as the authority for directing the actions. Hence, OPM argues, the appellants are not entitled to appeal their removals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_798"></span>[8]&#x2003;We note in passing that all suitability actions are subject to an "efficiency of the service" standard, though not necessarily the same "efficiency of the service" standard prescribed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301(1) (providing that the President may "prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the executive branch as will best promote the efficiency of the service"). This fact is obscured somewhat by the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201, which states that the standard for a suitability action is that it "protect the integrity or promote the efficiency" of the service. The use of the word "or" would seem to permit suitability actions that protect the integrity of the service but do not promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151 ("the word 'or' unambiguously signifies alternatives"). OPM has stated, however, that it included the word "integrity" to clarify that integrity and honest conduct are part of the efficiency of the service standard as used in the suitability context:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">The current efficiency of the service language might inadvertently lead some to believe that efficiency and effectiveness are limited to their dictionary definitions, namely, the capacity to produce desired results with a minimum expenditure of energy, time or money, or the ability to produce results. In fact, the efficiency of the service standard as used by OPM in a suitability context always has been a broader concept that involves, among other things, the integrity of the competitive examination system.... Adding the word integrity makes it even clearer that integrity and honest conduct always have been an important part of the existing efficiency of the service standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">65 Fed. Reg. 82,239, 82,241 (Dec. 28, 2000); <span class="Italic">see Doerr v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 10 (2006). Hence, as OPM employs the terms, actions that protect the integrity of the service are a subset of those actions that promote the efficiency of the service. It is unclear why OPM believed it would be helpful to express a part-whole relationship with a disjunction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This argument is without merit. It is a well-established principle of Board law that the Board is not obliged to accept the assertion of a party as to the nature of a personnel action, but may make its own independent determination regarding the matter. <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5 (2006); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 698, 704 (1981). Thus, it is the nature of a personnel action, not the agency's characterization of the action, that determines the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Cruz-Packer</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 5; <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 107, &#x00B6; 20 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that an exception to this principle exists in the case of performance-based actions. In <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, our reviewing court held that an agency may, at its discretion, rely on either chapter 75 or chapter 43 to take a performance-based action, thereby requiring the Board to adjudicate the appeal under the chosen standard. 767 F.2d at 843. According to OPM, <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> stands for the general proposition that, where there exists a choice of adjudicatory procedures, it is up to the agency initiating the action to decide which one to follow. Hence, OPM argues, the Board cannot require that an action taken under the authority of 5 C.F.R. part 731 be adjudicated under the standards applicable to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, however, the holding of <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> is predicated on the fact that chapter 43 and chapter 75 procedures are, by statute, mutually exclusive with respect to particular charges. <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 4 n.2; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(D); <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 843. Because of that express statutory exclusion, an agency may prohibit the Board from applying chapter 75 standards by invoking chapter 43 as the sole authority for its performance based action. <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276, &#x00B6; 4 n.2. Here, there is no statutory provision that would preclude a removal action ostensibly taken under 5 C.F.R. part 731 from being adjudicated under chapter 75 standards. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Indeed, as discussed above, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 must be read to include suitability removals within its scope. OPM objects to this analysis, arguing that the Board "fails to take cognizance of the statutory and regulatory bases that exist for OPM-directed suitability removals, which do, in fact, explicitly preclude the use of chapter 75 standards for such suitability removals." In making that argument, however, OPM conflates the statutes underlying its suitability authority with the regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731. It is only the latter that purport to exclude suitability removals from coverage under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case further differs from <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> in that a tenured employee removed for performance reasons is guaranteed a statutory right of appeal, whether it be under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(e). By contrast, were we to find that the OPM-directed removal of a tenured employee is not "taken under" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, merely on the grounds that OPM did not cite that authority, the affected employee would be left with no appeal rights apart from those OPM deigns to provide. <span class="Italic">See Folio</span>, 402 F.3d at 1353 (finding that, with respect to a suitability action appealable only under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, "Congress granted OPM the authority to determine the scope of the Board's authority"). To permit such a result would undermine the stated intent of Congress to provide "appropriate protection" to tenured federal employees by increasing the powers of the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 note; <span class="Italic">Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (a statute should be construed to avoid an absurd result when it can be given a reasonable application consistent with its words and legislative purpose).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with its stated intent to provide appropriate protection to federal employees, Congress has placed limits on the authority of OPM in matters over which the Board has primary responsibility. Among the functions vested in the Director of OPM by Congress are the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[E]xecuting, administering, and enforcing--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A) the civil service rules and regulations of the President and the Office and the laws governing the civil service: and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B) the other activities of the Office including retirement and classification activities;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">except with respect to functions for which the Merit Systems Protection Board or the Special Counsel is primarily responsible [....]</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1103(a)(5) (emphasis added). Thus, although Congress clearly established that OPM is the primary authority in most matters involving the civil service, it also reserved certain matters for the Board or the Special Counsel, and it denied OPM authority over those matters. Congress explicitly gave the Board authority to adjudicate appeals involving the removal of employees under chapter 75. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d). We therefore find that although OPM has authority to prescribe regulations establishing how agencies may take an action under chapter 75, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), OPM lacks authority to prescribe regulations that remove such actions from the Board's jurisdiction or otherwise inhibit the Board's full adjudication of appeals arising from such actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that, because the removal actions on appeal were taken by an agency, covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, and taken against employees as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, they are subject to the efficiency of the service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) and appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Scope of the Board's Review</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) includes review of an agency's penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See generally Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). In order to find that a removal based on a sustained charge of misconduct satisfies the "efficiency of the service" criterion of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), the Board must make two distinct determinations: first, whether there is an nexus between the appellant's conduct and the efficiency of the service, and second, whether the penalty is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 302-03. That is, the Board must consider not only whether any disciplinary action is warranted, but whether the particular penalty in a given case takes reasonable account of the factors relevant to the promotion of service efficiency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 303. Accordingly, notwithstanding any contrary provision at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, we may sustain the appellants' removals only if we find both components of the efficiency of the service standard have been established by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513, 7701(c)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">see Devine</span>, 724 F.2d at 1564 (while obtaining an appointment through misrepresentation may properly form the basis for removal, it would be a "quantum leap of logic" to conclude that review of the penalty is thereby barred).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the typical case, the Board will defer to an agency's penalty determination and modify a penalty only when it finds the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or that it clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness in determining the penalty. <span class="Italic">Stuhlmacher v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272, &#x00B6; 20 (2001); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 306. The principle of deference derives from the "unassailable proposition" that penalty determinations are judgment calls within the discretion of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246, 1251 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">see Beard v. General Services Administration</span>, 801 F.2d 1318, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("the employing (and not the reviewing) agency is in the best position to judge the impact of employee misconduct upon the operations of the agency..."). This rationale does not apply, however, when OPM, rather than the employing agency, makes the penalty determination. The factors pertinent to determining the appropriateness of the penalty under the efficiency of the service standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) are not limited to the factors OPM may consider under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(c), but may also include matters which the employing agency is in a better position to evaluate. Such factors may include, for example, the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06. Accordingly, we find that in an appeal of an OPM-directed suitability removal, the Board must conduct an independent review of the penalty in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, which may include facts not in <span id="Page_799"></span>OPM's possession. In this regard, we stress that the ultimate burden is upon the deciding agency, in this case OPM, to persuade the Board of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 307.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that our statutory jurisdiction extends to review of the other suitability actions on appeal, i.e., debarment and cancellation of eligibilities. While those actions would not by themselves be covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, in conjunction with the removal actions they lie within our jurisdiction as components of a unitary penalty arising from the same underlying misconduct. <span class="Italic">See Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Commission</span>, 779 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (finding that the Board had jurisdiction to consider a reassignment imposed in connection with a demotion as part of a unified penalty arising out of the same set of circumstances); <span class="Italic">White v. Government Printing Office</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 355 (2008) (asserting jurisdiction over a unitary penalty including both a reduction in grade and a 14-day suspension); <span class="Italic">see also Campbell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 70, &#x00B6; 8 (2002) (remanding for a determination of whether a 14-day suspension was reviewable, in conjunction with a reduction in pay, as part of a unitary penalty). OPM has argued that the "unitary penalty" principle should not apply in these cases because debarment and cancellation of eligibilities are not intended to compound the severity of a removal action, but rather serve to prospectively regulate the conduct of examinations and admission into the federal service. However, the court in <span class="Italic">Brewer</span> did not address whether the penalties imposed by the agency served the same end, but rather relied on the fact that the penalties arose "out of the same set of circumstances of which Mr. Brewer was found culpable." <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 779 F.2d at 664. Here, with respect to both Mr. Aguzie and Ms. Barnes, OPM relied on the same incidents of misconduct as the basis for all of its suitability actions. We therefore find no basis for distinguishing these appeals from <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that a determination that the Board can review the suitability removal of a tenured employee, but not the debarment or cancellation of eligibilities that are part of the same OPM decision, could lead to an absurd result. If the Board were to reverse a removal but find that it lacked the authority to reverse the debarment or cancellation of eligibilities, it would be ordering the return to federal employment of an employee whom OPM still deems ineligible to hold a federal position. We therefore conclude that the Board's review of the removal of an employee for suitability reasons must also include review of any debarment or cancellation of eligibilities that arise out of the same circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Order</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the suitability actions on appeal are reviewable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), we REMAND both appeals for further adjudication. With respect to both Mr. Aguzie and Ms. Barnes, the administrative judge shall determine on remand whether the suitability actions on appeal satisfy the efficiency of the service standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). In addition, the administrative judge shall determine whether the appellants were provided the procedures described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b) and, if not, whether the error was likely to have caused OPM to reach a different conclusion from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 681, 685 (1991). Should the administrative judge reverse or mitigate one or both of the removal actions, the employing agency or agencies shall be responsible for providing back pay and benefits, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Brackins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 260, 263 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that further adjudication is necessary to resolve Mr. Aguzie's claim of race and national origin discrimination. In finding the discrimination claim unproven, the administrative judge relied on Mr. Aguzie's failure to identify a comparator employee outside his protected group. However, the Board has recently clarified that comparator evidence is not essential to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2010). While evidence of discrimination may include proof that similarly situated employees outside the protected class were treated differently, an appellant may also prevail on a discrimination claim by introducing evidence: (1) that the agency lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the agency's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of minority employees or those who engage in protected activity; or (5) of incriminating statements by the agency. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 8.

OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/AGUZIE_HYGINUS_U_DC_0731_09_0261_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_439874.pdf">112 MSPR 276</a>, 277-79 &#x00B6; 2-6, 2009 MSPB 177 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 17, 2006, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) hired the appellant as a GS-9 Budget Analyst, on a career conditional appointment subject to a 1-year probationary period. By letter dated December 15, 2008, OPM informed the appellant that it had found him unsuitable for his position and had taken the following actions: (1) directed USCCR to remove him from the rolls within 5 days of its receipt of the decision, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.304; (2) cancelled any reinstatement eligibility obtained from his appointment or any other eligibilities he may have had for positions covered under 5 C.F.R. part 731; and (3) debarred him from competition for, or appointment to, any covered position for a period of 3 years ending December 11, 2011. The record does not include an SF-50 recording the appellant's removal, but neither party disputes that USCCR complied with OPM's instruction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reopen this case to address the question, not raised below or on petition for review, of whether the appellant is entitled to appeal his removal to the Board as an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. At the time of his removal, the appellant occupied a competitive service position and had completed his 1-year probationary period. He therefore satisfies the definition of an "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A). Furthermore, with certain exceptions not applicable here, a removal falls within the scope of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Under regulations prescribed by OPM, an agency may take an action covered by that subchapter against an employee only for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). An employee against whom such an action is taken is entitled to certain procedural protections, listed at &#x00A7; 7513(b), and is also entitled to appeal the action to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Consequently, it appears the appellant in this case may have a statutory right to appeal his removal as an adverse action under chapter 75, subchapter II, notwithstanding OPM's characterization of the removal as an action under 5 C.F.R. part 731.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In the Federal Register notice announcing the June 16, 2008 revision of its suitability regulations, OPM contended that where there is a choice between taking an action under 5 C.F.R. part 731 or another authority, the Board "cannot hold an agency to standards relating to a legal authority the agency did not invoke." 73 Fed. Reg. 20149, 20153 (Apr. 15, 2008). For the Board to do so, OPM argued, would be contrary to <span class="Italic">Lovshin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 475 U.S. 1111 (1986), in which our reviewing court held that an agency may rely on either 5 U.S.C. chapter 43 or chapter 75 to take a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843. <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> differs from this case, however, in that chapter 43 and chapter 75 procedures are, by statute, mutually exclusive, at least with respect to specific charges. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(D); <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span>, 767 F.2d at 843 (agency may bring a mixed case, relying on chapter 43 for charge of unacceptable performance but also chapter 75 for alternative or additional charges). Thus, an agency may prevent the Board from applying chapter 75 standards by invoking chapter 43 as the sole authority for its performance-based action. By contrast, we are aware of no statutory provision that would preclude a removal action ostensibly taken under 5 C.F.R. part 731 from being adjudicated under chapter 75 standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The distinction is not merely academic. Our jurisdiction over adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II includes the authority to mitigate penalties. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 296 (1981). In addition, the respondent in an adverse action appeal would not be OPM, but rather USCCR, as it was the latter agency that effected the removal action, even if it did so at OPM's direction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.304 ("the employing agency must remove the appointee or employee from the rolls within 5 work days of receipt of OPM's final decision.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that under OPM's current regulations governing suitability determinations and actions, a removal action may not be taken under both 5 C.F.R. part 731 and part 752. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.204(f) ("[a]n action to remove an appointee or employee...under this part is not an action under part...752 of this chapter."). An action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, is <span class="Italic">ipso facto</span> an action under 5 C.F.R. part 752, which incorporates that subchapter in its entirety. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.301. Thus, if the appellant's removal was an action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, OPM's own regulations preclude it from being construed as a suitability action under 5 C.F.R. part 731, even though USCCR acted in compliance with an OPM directive issued under the purported authority of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.304. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cruz-Packer v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 6 (2006) (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.105(b) did not serve as authority for removal of excepted service employee, notwithstanding agency's characterization of the action as a "suitability determination."). To the extent &#x00A7; 731.204(f) may purport to carve out an exception to the Board's statutory jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), the validity of the regulation is in doubt. <span class="Italic">Cf. DoPadre v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 346, 351-52 (1996) (invalidating regulation intended to limit Board's authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) to review OPM's application of regulations governing court orders affecting retirement benefits); <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 624, 632 (1981) (invalidating regulation allowing for emergency suspensions in situations not within the "crime exception" of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_800"></span>During the Aguzie litigation, the Board reconfirmed its position in <span class="Italic">Scott v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SCOTT_JAMES_A_CH_0731_09_0578_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_602157.pdf">116 MSPR 356</a>, 359-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-20, 2011 MSPB 50 (2011) (reconsid. den., <span class="Italic">Scott v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 467, 2012 MSPB 25 (2012), <span class="Italic">post</span>), involving an OPM-directed suitability removal of a tenured employee for conduct characterized as falsification (involving another individual's application for employment), and determining that OPM may not direct a suitability action against a tenured employee based on conduct that postdates the employee's appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we find that the suitability actions on appeal lie within our jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). It is undisputed that, at the time of his removal, the appellant had served more than 1 year of current continuous service in his Human Resources Specialist position. Consequently, he was a tenured employee for purposes of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-42 (Fed. Cir. 2002). His removal, though ostensibly directed pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731, is therefore subject to the requirements of chapter 75, subchapter II, including the efficiency of the service standard under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) and the guarantee of appeal rights at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">See Aguzie II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 31. Furthermore, our jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) extends to the other actions resulting from OPM's negative suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 31-35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we need not decide whether the actions on appeal satisfy the efficiency of the service standard under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) because we agree with the appellant that OPM lacked any legal authority to take or direct the actions in the first instance. In particular, we find that OPM does not have the authority under 5 C.F.R. part 731 to make suitability determinations or to take or direct suitability actions against an individual based solely on conduct occurring after his admission into the competitive service.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because we reverse OPM's decision on this basis, we need not and do not decide whether the regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3), concerning the charge of "material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment," is limited in scope to an individual's own examination or appointment. We note, however, that OPM's reliance on <span class="Italic">Kissner v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 792 F.2d 133 (Fed. Cir. 1986), is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">Kissner</span>, our reviewing court found that the Board properly sustained a charge under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3) based on a finding that the appellant had, prior to the appointment under investigation, made false statements on his application forms for a different position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 134. It does not follow from this that OPM may base a suitability action against an individual based on his falsification of another individual's employment application. With regard to the appellant's third legal argument, the Board has found that the term "integrity of the service," as used in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202, is part of the "efficiency of the service" standard under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301(1), and is not a separate ground for taking a suitability action. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 25 n.8; <span class="Italic">Doerr v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 196, &#x00B6; 10 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has expressly defined the scope and purpose of its suitability regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a), which states in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The purpose of this part is to establish criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability and for taking suitability actions regarding employment in covered positions...pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301, E.O. 10577 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218), as amended, and 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2. Section 3301 of title 5, United States Code, directs consideration of "age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought." E.O. 10577 (codified in relevant part at 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2) directs OPM to examine "suitability" for competitive Federal employment.[3] This part concerns only determinations of "suitability," that is, those determinations based on a person's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (footnote added). Taken in isolation, the reference to "determinations based on a person's character or conduct" could be read to include conduct that takes place after an individual's appointment. However, the regulation must be read as a whole. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Acting Special Counsel v. Sullivan</span>, 6 M.S.P.R. 526, 550 (1981). It is evident from the preceding sentences of the regulation that OPM's authority under 5 C.F.R. part 731, though concerned with matters of character and conduct, extends only to those suitability determinations and actions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 and Executive Order 10,577, as amended, in particular those portions codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1.1, 2.1(a), and 5.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Curiously, the exact words "'suitability' for competitive Federal employment" do not appear in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1.1, 2.1(a), or 5.2, or elsewhere in Executive Order 10,577 as amended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We examine these authorities in turn. First, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 provides that the President may:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the executive branch as will best promote the efficiency of the service; [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;ascertain the fitness of applicants as to age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is axiomatic that the interpretation of a statute begins with the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 197 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Here, it is evident from the plain language of the statute that it is concerned solely with regulating the admission process and determining the fitness of applicants. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 23; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a) (noting that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 "directs consideration of 'age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the <span class="Italic">employment sought</span>'") (emphasis added). As we discussed in <span class="Italic">Aguzie II</span>, the statute does not preclude OPM from making an after-the-fact determination that a tenured employee was improperly admitted or was unfit at the time he applied. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2(a) (authorizing the Director of OPM to determine "after appointment" whether the civil service rules and regulations were met with respect to that appointment); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.105(d) (authorizing OPM to make suitability determinations and take or direct suitability actions against an "employee," defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b) as an individual who has completed the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment). It does not follow, however, that OPM may base a suitability determination solely on conduct occurring after an individual's admission into the competitive service,[4] and there is nothing in the language of the statute that would authorize such a determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that a probationary period is considered part of the examination process. <span class="Italic">See Brandt v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 671, &#x00B6; 20 n.7 (2006); <span class="Italic">Scalera v. Department of the Navy</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6; 10 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1.3(c), 212.301.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor do we find any language in the pertinent sections of Executive Order 10,577, as amended, authorizing OPM to base a suitability determination or action solely on conduct occurring after the appointment process is complete. Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.1 is not itself a grant of authority but rather a general limitation on the scope of the Civil Service Rules:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The rules in this subchapter shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the rule concerned, the rules in this subchapter shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1(a) constitutes a delegation of authority to OPM to conduct competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM shall be responsible for open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. OPM is authorized to establish standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, suitability, and physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements which applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(a) (providing that OPM, "subject to the rules prescribed by the President...shall prescribe regulations for, control, supervise, and preserve the records of, examinations for the competitive service"). While 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2.1(a), in conjunction with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302, authorizes OPM to establish standards for suitability, we find no indication that the scope of that authority extends beyond the examination process leading to admission into the competitive service.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Here, the appellant had completed his probationary period at the time he allegedly falsified his wife's employment application. We do not decide at present whether OPM may take a suitability action based on post-appointment conduct occurring during the probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2 provides that the Director of OPM may "secure effective implementation of the civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and all Executive orders imposing responsibilities on the Office," by means including the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Investigating the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service. The Director may require appointments to be made subject to investigation to enable the Director to determine, after appointment, that the requirements of law or the civil service rules and regulations have been met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, pursuant to this rule, OPM may investigate the suitability of applicants and investigate and determine the propriety of an appointment. The rule specifically allows for OPM to make the necessary determination after the appointment has taken place. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 23. However, the rule unambiguously provides that the subject matter of such an investigation or determination is the act of appointment itself. Conduct occurring after the appointment process is complete, such as the conduct at issue in this case, would not lie within the scope of such an investigation or determination.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;On several occasions, the Board has erroneously suggested <span id="Page_801"></span>in dicta that the scope of a suitability investigation may include post-appointment conduct. <span class="Italic">See Gamble v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 11 (2009) ("A suitability inquiry is directed toward whether the 'character or conduct' of a candidate <span class="Italic">or current employee</span> is such that employing or continuing to employee [him] would adversely affect the efficiency of the service."); <span class="Italic">Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236 (2009) (same); <span class="Italic">Patton v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 12 (2003) (same). <span class="Italic">See also Patton</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 562, &#x00B6; 12 (in "conducting an updated [background investigation], the agency is entitled to examine...the events that have occurred in the applicant's life since the completion of the last [background investigation]." We modify these decisions accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the authority citation for 5 C.F.R. part 731 also includes 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301, which provides in general terms that the President "may prescribe regulations for the conduct of employees in the executive branch." <span class="Italic">See also</span> 74 Fed. Reg. 30,459, 30,460 (June 26, 2009) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301). This statute, unlike the other authorities discussed above, refers generally to the conduct of employees, and it may be that the President could, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301, issue an Executive Order authorizing OPM to make suitability determinations and take or direct suitability actions based on post-admission or post-appointment conduct. However, the President has not issued such an order, and he has not delegated to OPM the authority to prescribe regulations other than those necessary to carry out existing statutes and rules imposing responsibilities on the office. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.1. In any event, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a), which expressly defines the scope and purpose of 5 C.F.R. part 731, makes no reference to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301, and refers only to suitability determinations and actions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1.1, 2.1(a), and 5.2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that its regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731 should nonetheless be interpreted to permit the suitability actions on appeal. However, as we explained in <span class="Italic">Garza v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 336 (1999), the Board does not owe deference to agency litigation positions unsupported by regulations, rulings, or administrative practice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (citing <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp.</span>, 488 U.S. 204, 212-13 (1988)).[7] As discussed above, the interpretation advanced by OPM is inconsistent with the expressly stated purpose of 5 C.F.R. part 731. Furthermore, OPM has not provided "substantial evidence of a consistent policy, either internally applied or publicly announced," that would permit suitability determinations or actions based on conduct occurring after admission into the competitive service. <span class="Italic">See Garza</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 336, &#x00B6; 12 (quoting <span class="Italic">Parker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 974 F.2d 164, 168 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). Accordingly, we decline to follow OPM's interpretation of the regulations at issue in this case. <span class="Italic">See Evans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 94, 104 (1993) (the Board will decline to give effect to OPM's interpretation of a regulation where there are compelling reasons to conclude that such interpretation is erroneous, unreasonable, or contrary to the law which it purports to interpret).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;OPM erroneously cites <span class="Italic">Folio v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 402 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2005), for the proposition that its interpretation of the suitability regulations, though expressed only in its brief, is entitled to deference. Because OPM was not a party in <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, its interpretation did not, as in this case, constitute a "<span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalization advanced by an agency seeking to defend past agency action against attack." <span class="Italic">See Auer v. Robbins</span>, 519 U.S. 452, 462 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Bowen</span>, 488 U.S. at 212, internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, the court granted "special deference" to OPM's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 on the grounds that it was "seeking broader review by its reviewing entity," i.e., the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That rationale does not apply in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that OPM had no legal authority to take the suitability actions on appeal, its decision cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C); <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 672, 683-84 (1991) (an action will be reversed as being "not in accordance with law" if the agency's action is unlawful in its entirety, i.e., if there is no legal authority for the action). Our holding in no way alters the fact that a tenured employee may be disciplined for falsification of employment documents. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cameron v. Department of Justice</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (falsification of employment documents amounts to serious misconduct and warrants removal). However, it is the prerogative of the employing agency to pursue or not pursue such action against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we reverse the actions on appeal, we find that further adjudication is necessary to resolve the appellant's claim of race and/or color discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Schibik v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 591, &#x00B6; 11 (2005) (an appellant has the right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a) to a decision on a claim of discrimination even when the Board has already determined that the action appealed must be reversed on other grounds). In finding the discrimination claim unproven, the administrative judge relied on the appellant's failure to identify a comparator employee outside his protected group. However, the Board has since clarified that comparator evidence is not essential to a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disparate treatment discrimination. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Interior</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2010). While evidence of discrimination may include proof that similarly situated employees outside the protected class were treated differently, an appellant may also prevail on a discrimination claim by introducing evidence: (1) that the agency lied about its reason for taking the action; (2) of inconsistency in the agency's explanation; (3) of failure to follow established procedures; (4) of general treatment of minority employees or those who engage in protected activity; or (5) of incriminating statements by the agency. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. Accordingly, we remand the appeal to afford the appellant the opportunity to present such evidence. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie II</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 37.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We REVERSE the initial decision and REMAND the appeal to the Central Regional Office for further adjudication of the appellant's discrimination claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER OPM to cancel its decision letter of April 8, 2009, and to direct the employing agency to restore the appellant effective April 13, 2009. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Brackins v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 260, 263 (1993); <span class="Italic">cf.

OPM must complete these actions no later than 20 days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also ORDER OPM to direct the employing agency to pay the appellant the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits under the Back Pay Act and/or Postal Service Regulations, as appropriate, no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this decision. <span class="Italic">See Brackins</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 263. We ORDER the appellant to cooperate in good faith in the employing agency's effort to calculate the amount of back pay, interest, and benefits due, and to provide all necessary information the agency requests to help it carry out the Board's Order. If there is a dispute about the amount of back pay, interest due, and/or other benefits, we ORDER the employing agency to pay the appellant the undisputed amount no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied OPM's reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">Scott v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 467, 469-74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2012 MSPB 25 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2006, the appellant received a conditional excepted service appointment to a Human Resources Specialist position with the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). His continued employment was subject to successful completion of a background security investigation and favorable adjudication, but DFAS did not conduct or request a suitability investigation. Instead, consistent with agency policy, DFAS granted reciprocity to a prior security clearance determination by the U.S. Army. The appellant was converted to a career appointment in the competitive service in January 2008. <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 2009, OPM informed the appellant that, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731, it had found him unsuitable for any covered position in the federal service based on a charge of deception or fraud in connection with his wife's February 2008 application for employment with DFAS. OPM further informed the appellant that it had directed DFAS to remove him, cancelled any reinstatement eligibility obtained from his appointment or any other eligibilities he may have had for covered positions, and debarred him from competition for, or appointment to, any covered position for a period of 3 years. DFAS removed the appellant on April 13, 2009. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal challenging his OPM-directed removal. He argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that OPM had not been delegated the authority to base a suitability action solely on post-appointment conduct. The administrative judge rejected the appellant's arguments and affirmed the removal, and the appellant filed a petition for review. While the petition for review was pending, the Board granted OPM's motion to reopen the appeals of <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> MSPB Docket No. DC-0731-09-0261-R-1, and <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> MSPB Docket No. DA-0731-09-0260-R-1, consolidated those appeals for briefing on the question of whether, when OPM directs the removal of a tenured employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) for suitability reasons pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731, the removal action is subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, including the statutory grant of appeal rights at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). The Board added the instant appeal to the consolidation. <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6. After receiving briefs and holding oral argument, the Board severed the instant appeal and issued a decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> in which it found that an OPM-directed suitability removal of a tenured employee is appealable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), and subject to the "efficiency of the service" standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-31 (2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an Opinion and Order issued on May 9, 2011, the Board reversed the appellant's OPM-directed removal on suitability grounds. <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-17. In accordance with its recent decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie,</span> the Board held that the appellant's removal on suitability grounds was within <span id="Page_802"></span>its appellate jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 8. The Board determined that it did not need to decide whether the action met the efficiency of the service standard because it found that OPM lacked authority under 5 C.F.R. part 731 to make suitability determinations or to take or direct suitability actions against an individual based solely on conduct occurring after his admission into the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 9. Although it reversed the appellant's removal, the Board remanded the appeal to the regional office for further adjudication of the appellant's discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After remand, the appellant informed the administrative judge that he wanted to withdraw his discrimination claim. Therefore, on May 24, 2011, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appellant's discrimination claim as withdrawn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 9, 2011, the Director of OPM notified the Clerk of the Board that he was exercising his statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d) to request reconsideration of the Board's Opinion and Order reversing the appellant's removal. The Director requested the administrative records in the appeal and 20 days from receipt of the record to submit a brief in support of its reconsideration request. After successfully requesting an extension of time, the Director filed a brief in support of his reconsideration request on August 1, 2011. The appellant filed a brief in opposition to the Director's petition on August 25, 2011.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of OPM may file a petition for reconsideration of a final decision of the Board if the Director determines: 1) that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation affecting personnel management; and 2) that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.119(a). The Board will consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the arguments raised by OPM on petition for reconsideration, even in cases where OPM was a party to the proceedings before the Board. <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 67, 72 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director argues that the Board erred in finding that the President has not delegated to OPM the authority to make suitability determinations based on post-appointment conduct. Specifically, the Director argues that the President delegated such authority to the Civil Service Commission, and that the codification of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3301 and 7301 did not modify or repeal the delegation of such authority. However, we affirm our determination in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> that the President never delegated, to either the Civil Service Commission or OPM, the authority to make suitability determinations based on post-appointment conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that the President delegated to OPM the authority to make suitability determinations based on post-appointment conduct, the Director primarily relies on Executive Order 10,577. However, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> that there is nothing in Executive Order 10,577 "authorizing OPM to base a suitability determination or action solely on conduct occurring after the appointment process is complete." <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 12. The Board recognized that Executive Order 10,577, codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2, granted the Director the authority to conduct suitability investigations after appointment, but found that the subject of such an investigation "is the act of appointment itself," and that "[c]onduct occurring after the appointment process is complete, such as the conduct at issue in this case, would not lie within the scope of such an investigation...." <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 13. Nothing in the Director's request convinces us that the Board's prior interpretation of Executive Order 10,577 was incorrect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director also relies on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a), which provides, in relevant part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Director is authorized to ensure enforcement of the civil service laws, rules, and regulations, and all applicable Executive orders, by: (1) Instructing an agency to separate or take other action against an employee serving an appointment subject to investigation when the Director finds that the employee is disqualified for Federal employment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director notes the use of the present tense (i.e., "is disqualified for Federal employment"), as well as the "more elaborate text" of Executive Order 10,577 that incorporates both pre-appointment and post-appointment conduct, and argues that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a)(1) provides authority for OPM to take or direct suitability-based removals based on post-appointment conduct. However, we do not read the enforcement authority provided at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a)(1) so broadly. By its own terms, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a)(1) applies only when the Director makes a finding of disqualification with respect to "an employee serving an appointment subject to investigation." Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2(a), appointments may be made subject to investigation "to enable the Director to determine, after appointment, that the requirements of law or the civil service rules and regulations have been met." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Reading the two regulatory provisions together, we find that the Director's authority to direct removals or other actions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a)(1) is limited to those findings of disqualification that result from the investigations authorized under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2(a). As noted above, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> that "[c]onduct occurring after the appointment process is complete, such as the conduct at issue in this case, would not lie within the scope of [an investigation authorized under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.2(a)] ...." <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 13. Accordingly, we find that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 5.3(a)(1) does not authorize OPM to direct suitability-based removals based on post-appointment conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are also not convinced that the Board should recognize a special exception to allow OPM to take or direct suitability-based removals in cases of "deception or fraud in examination or appointment" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b), as the Director argues in his request for reconsideration. The Director has not established why the rationale set forth in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> should cease to apply simply because of the particular grounds for OPM's negative suitability determination in a particular case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director takes issue with the Board's statement in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> that an OPM suitability investigation cannot extend to post-appointment conduct. Specifically, the Director argues that the Board's statement to that effect is dictum because a suitability investigation is not itself appealable to the Board. The Director is correct that the Board lacks jurisdiction over a suitability investigation that does not result in a removal or other action over which the Board has been granted jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary; it is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation). We therefore modify <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> to the extent it could be interpreted as an attempt by the Board to bar OPM from conducting suitability investigations or making suitability determinations when those actions are taken independent of any action within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Director argues that Executive Order 13,488, issued in January 2009, confirms that OPM's authority to conduct suitability investigations and make suitability determinations applies to post-appointment conduct, and that even if Executive Order 13,488 is read narrowly to only authorize consideration of post-appointment conduct in adjudicating a "reinvestigation," the action at issue in this case was based on a reinvestigation of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order 13,488 provides in relevant part that "[i]ndividuals in positions of public trust shall be subject to reinvestigation under standards (including but not limited to the frequency of such reinvestigation) as determined by the Director of [OPM], to ensure their suitability for continued employment." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 5. The Director argues that the requirement for reinvestigation and determination of a public trust employee's suitability for continued employment "necessarily requires consideration of the employee's conduct after he or she is appointed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Executive Order 13,488 does not affect our prior determination that the President has not delegated to OPM the authority to direct the removal of a tenured employee on suitability grounds based on post-appointment conduct. We note that the Executive Order itself does not grant OPM the authority to direct the removal of a public trust employee based on a suitability reinvestigation; it merely authorizes investigations. OPM could therefore fully comply with Executive Order 13,488 without taking or directing a suitability action based on post-appointment conduct. As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Scott I,</span> post-appointment conduct discovered during a suitability investigation can form the basis of an adverse action taken by the employing agency. <span class="Italic">See Scott I,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 16. Accordingly, we find no inconsistency between the provision in Executive Order 13,488 requiring suitability reinvestigations and the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Scott I</span> that OPM lacks the delegated authority to direct suitability-based removals based on post-appointment conduct.[2] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We also agree with the appellant that even if Executive Order 13,488 specifically authorized OPM to direct the removal of a public trust employee based on post-appointment conduct discovered during a suitability reinvestigation, it would not change the outcome in this appeal because the Director has not shown that the appellant in this case was designated as a public trust employee. It also appears that the Executive Order is inapplicable to the appellant because it only applies to "individuals newly appointed to excepted service positions or hired as contractor employees beginning 90 days from the effective date [January 16, 2009] of this order." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00A7; 8. The appellant does not fall into either category.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM sought and failed to revise the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> in <span class="Italic">Hopper v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 608, 609-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1-13, 2012 MSPB 122 (2012) (aff'd, sub nom. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. Hopper</span>, 773 F.3d 1289 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM or the agency) has petitioned for review of the initial decision that mitigated the appellant's removal due to a negative suitability determination under the reasoning set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64 (2011). The Director of OPM has requested to intervene in support of the petition for review. OPM argues that it was an error of law for the administrative judge to adjudicate this appeal as an adverse action appeal under chapter 75 of Title 5 of the United States Code instead of as a suitability <span id="Page_803"></span>action under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 and that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> should be overruled. We GRANT the Director's request to intervene, DENY the petition for review, and AFFIRM the initial decision for the reasons set forth below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed OPM's July 14, 2009 decision, which directed the Social Security Administration (SSA) to separate him from his position, canceled all eligibilities for reinstatement obtained from his current appointment, canceled his eligibility for positions with the federal government, and debarred him from competition for, or appointment to, such position for a period of 3 years based on material, intentional false statements on federal employment forms regarding his employment record. The appeal was dismissed without prejudice pending the resolution of the remanded appeals in <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276 (2009), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part on recons</span>., 116 M.S.P.R. 64 (2011), and <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 273 (2009), which raised the question of whether an individual meeting the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), who has been separated pursuant to a suitability action brought by OPM, has a statutory right to appeal his removal as an adverse action under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 1 &#x0026; n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, the administrative judge adjudicated the appellant's removal as an adverse action under chapter 75 and mitigated the removal to a letter of reprimand. The administrative judge found that, although the appeal originated as a suitability action under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.202-.204, 731.301-.304, because the appellant was undisputedly an employee under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, he was entitled to appeal his removal, cancellation of eligibilities, and debarment under chapter 75, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. He found that the agency proved the charge of "Material, Intentional False Statement, or Deception or Fraud in Examination or Appointment" by preponderant evidence. The administrative judge conducted an independent review of the reasonableness of the penalty in light of the relevant factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), pursuant to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, and concluded that the agency's action should be mitigated because the appellant provided the unchallenged testimony of his second-line supervisor, who expressed continued confidence in the appellant and testified that he would have issued a lesser penalty, such as a letter of reprimand, rather than impose the penalty of removal. Because the appellant's employer expressed its preference for a penalty falling well short of removal, the administrative judge concluded that there was no sound basis for imposing a harsher result, and he mitigated the removal to a letter of reprimand. He noted that OPM attended the hearing but refused to participate, in objection to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. The administrative judge ordered the SSA to cancel the appellant's removal, substitute in its place a letter of reprimand, and provide the appropriate amount of back pay and benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has filed a petition for review. In it, OPM argues that the administrative judge failed to apply the correct standard of review for suitability actions set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 and argues that the Board should overrule <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. The appellant has filed an opposition to OPM's petition for review. The Director of OPM has filed a request to intervene.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of OPM has exercised his statutory authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(d) to intervene in this case because he is of the opinion that an erroneous decision would have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, or regulation under OPM's jurisdiction. In his brief supporting his request to intervene, the Director adopts and incorporates OPM's petition for review and submits that, for the reasons stated in the petition for review, the Board should overrule <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, reverse the initial decision, and remand this appeal for adjudication "under the correct legal standard in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501.Because the Director argues that the Board's decision could have a substantial impact on civil service law, rule, or regulation under OPM's jurisdiction, we find that he is entitled to intervene as a matter of right. Therefore, we GRANT the Director's unopposed request to intervene. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(d)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(b)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM has not objected to any of the administrative judge's factual findings, and we discern no reason to disturb them. The administrative judge correctly applied <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> to the facts of this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the Board held that, when OPM directs an agency to remove a tenured employee pursuant to its authority under 5 C.F.R. part 731, the removal action is subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, including the Board appeal rights guaranteed under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 1. The Board found that the OPM-directed removal of a tenured employee pursuant to 5 C.F.R. part 731 is an action taken by an "agency," that 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II covers suitability-based removals of tenured employees, that the relevant question is whether the individuals who suffered suitability-based removals are "employees" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, and that, if so, the OPM-directed removal of a tenured employee is "taken under" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 and is therefore appealable to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12, 22, 25-26, 31. The Board further found that, in an appeal of an OPM-directed suitability removal, the Board must conduct an independent review of the penalty in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, which may include facts not in OPM's possession. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 33. Finally, the Board concluded that its statutory jurisdiction extends to review of the other suitability actions on appeal, i.e., debarment and cancellation of eligibilities, because they are components of a unitary penalty arising from the same underlying misconduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was an employee under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. Thus, consistent with the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's removal, as well as the cancellation of his appointment eligibilities and his debarment, as an adverse action under chapter 75. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 22-24, 34-35. Further, consistent with <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the administrative judge conducted an independent analysis of the penalty. The administrative judge considered the unchallenged testimony of the appellant's second-line supervisor, who expressed unwavering confidence and trust in the appellant's performance and testified that, had he conducted an investigation that yielded the same results as OPM's investigation and resulted in a conclusion that the appellant falsified his application in the manner set forth in OPM's action, he would have imposed a far lesser penalty than removal, such as a letter of reprimand. Although OPM attended the hearing, it refused to participate. Thus, in light of the evidence before him and the continued confidence in the appellant expressed by the employing agency, the administrative judge found no sound basis for imposing a harsher result and mitigated the penalty to a letter of reprimand. We discern no reason to disturb his finding, and OPM has not challenged it other than to attack the legal framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, which we address below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to OPM's attacks on <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, we decline to disturb the <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> decision for the following reasons. First, OPM argues that the Board's decision directly contravenes the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Folio v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 402 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2005). The Board rejected this argument by OPM during the <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> appeal and specifically referenced <span class="Italic">Folio</span> in holding that tenured employees are guaranteed a statutory right of appeal. In <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, the Immigration and Naturalization Service determined that the appellant was not suitable for employment and withdrew its tentative offer of employment. <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, 402 F.3d at 1352. In contrast, Aguzie was a tenured employee. Such distinction is central to the Board's finding regarding its chapter 75 review of an OPM-directed removal as a result of a negative suitability determination. <span class="Italic">See Hunt-O'Neal v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 9 (2011). Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, the court focused solely on the question of whether, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 (2004), the Board had jurisdiction to review the relationship between the "specific factors" set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b) (2004) and the "additional considerations" set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(c) (2004) and concluded that it did. 402 F.3d at 1353-55. This inquiry is distinct from the inquiry before the Board in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, and we find unpersuasive OPM's attempt to argue that the holding in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> conflicts with <span class="Italic">Folio</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that its suitability regulations are a valid exercise of its authority to define ambiguous terms in 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 and that the Board should have deferred to its rulemaking. In <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, however, the Board explicitly found that OPM's regulations were contrary to the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and declined to follow them. 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-20. OPM's arguments on review do not persuasively challenge this finding, which renders any further analysis of OPM's rulemaking authority unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13, 30. OPM cites to <span class="Italic">Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571, 576 (Fed. Cir. 1987), for the proposition that "[t]he provisions of sections 7512 and 7513 are...not without ambiguity." In that case, however, the court was considering whether the emergency furlough regulation established by OPM was valid. <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, 811 F.2d at 574. The court concluded that there was an ambiguity in the statute that was properly resolved by OPM's regulations because it could reasonably be said that an agency did not "take an action" covered by chapter 75 because an agency has no choice in the case of an emergency furlough. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 576. OPM analogizes <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski</span> to the instant appeal by arguing that the agency taking the removal action, the SSA, also had no choice and, therefore, it did not "take an action" covered by chapter 75. We do not find this reasoning persuasive, however, nor do we discern an ambiguity here. As set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, OPM is the agency choosing to take the action to remove the employee and must be the agency that defends the action before the Board. <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6; 11 &#x0026; n.5. Moreover, unlike the emergency furlough at issue <span class="Italic">Andrzjewski</span>, a removal is clearly an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Therefore, there is no question here that an agency took an action against an employee within the meaning of chapter 75. Thus, we affirm our finding that there is no ambiguity in the statute, for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, and we decline OPM's invitation to review the reasonableness of its suitability regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_804"></span>We further decline to revisit our holding that the Board should conduct its own independent review of the penalty in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors for the reasons set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 32-33. OPM argues that, "[t]aken to its logical outcome," <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> would allow the Board to mitigate the removal of an employee "based on the favorable recommendation of the very supervisor with whom the employee has colluded to engage in discrimination, personal or political favoritism, or a violation of veterans preference." It is unclear how OPM reached this conclusion; furthermore, through the adjudicative process, the administrative judge would review the record as a whole, weigh the evidence, consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, and make appropriate credibility determinations to resolve arguments concerning the reasonableness of the penalty. Therefore, we affirm our analysis in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> and find that the administrative judge applied the appropriate analysis to mitigate the removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also asserts that it was error for the administrative judge to order, as interim relief, that the SSA, a nonparty to the appeal, reinstate the appellant. We do not reach this issue here because OPM demonstrated that it and the SSA complied with the interim relief order, the appellant did not object to the interim relief ordered, and we have considered OPM's arguments on the merits. In ordering relief, we follow the language set forth in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22 (2011), <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons</span>., 117 M.S.P.R. 467 (2012), concerning the various obligations of OPM and the employing agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER OPM to cancel its decision letter of July 14, 2009, and to direct the employing agency to cancel the appellant's removal and substitute in its place a letter of reprimand. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 19. OPM must complete this action no later than 20 days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also ORDER OPM to direct the employing agency to pay the appellant the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits under the Back Pay Act and/or Postal Service Regulations, as appropriate, no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this decision. <span class="Italic">See Scott</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 356, &#x00B6; 20. We ORDER the appellant to cooperate in good faith in the employing agency's efforts to calculate the amount of back pay, interest, and benefits due, and to provide all necessary information the agency requests to help it carry out the Board's Order. If there is a dispute about the amount of back pay, interest due, and/or other benefits, we ORDER the employing agency to pay the appellant the undisputed amount no later than 60 calendar days after the date of this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review <span class="Italic">Hopper</span> was affirmed, following an OPM motion petition for judicial review granted in <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Hopper</span>, 533 Fed.

The 2015 opinion determined: "(1) under the CSRA, a tenured employee is entitled to appeal a suitability-based removal as an adverse action under chapter 75; and (2) the Board was entitled to conduct an independent review of the penalty imposed in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Katherine Archuleta, Director of the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"), petitions for review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("the Board") holding that an individual who meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) has a statutory right to appeal his OPM-directed suitability removal as an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II. <span class="Italic">Hopper v.

Mgmt</span>., No. CH-0731-09-0798-I-3, 2012 MSPB LEXIS 1353 (Initial Decision, Mar. 8, 2012). OPM argues that the Board erred in approaching this case as an adverse action appeal under chapter 75 of title 5, rather than as a suitability action under OPM's regulations. Specifically, OPM argues that the Board improperly expanded its jurisdiction when it held that it can review OPM's suitability actions and can modify the ultimate action taken when OPM has found that an employee is not suitable for federal employment. We previously granted OPM's petition for review under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d), which allows OPM to seek review of a Board decision when it determines that the Board erred in interpreting a civil service law, rule, or regulation and that the Board's decision will have a substantial impact on the administration of the civil service system. <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Hopper</span>, 533 F. App'x 997, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Because the statutory language is clear, and because no provision of the Civil Service Reform Act ("CSRA"), Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (1978), exempts suitability removals from the Board's jurisdiction under chapter 75, we affirm the Board's decision to review Respondent Tony Hopper's removal as an adverse action appeal, which includes review of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed. We further affirm the Board's decision mitigating Hopper's removal to a letter of reprimand.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 2008, Tony Hopper ("Hopper") was appointed to the position of Contract Representative with the Social Security Administration ("the SSA") in Florence, Kentucky. The SSA subsequently requested that OPM conduct a background investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Roughly 15 months after his appointment, OPM informed Hopper that it found "a serious question" regarding his suitability for federal employment due to false statements he made in connection with his application and appointment. When asked on his application whether, during the past five years, he had been fired from any job or had quit after being told he would be fired, Hopper responded "no." To the contrary, OPM alleged that Hopper had been fired from a forklift driver position in October 2007, and from a truck driver position with a different company in December 2006. OPM further charged that, in response to a question requesting a list of all employment activities for the past five years, Hopper failed to report his employment in the truck driver position from which he was terminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM notified Hopper that it would instruct the SSA to remove him based on the charge of "Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment." Hopper responded in writing and submitted supporting documents. He claimed that: (1) he was not fired from either position; and (2) if he failed to report his employment as a truck driver, "it was an honest mistake."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a letter dated July 14, 2009, OPM informed Hopper that it directed the SSA to remove him, to cancel his eligibility for reinstatement, and to debar him from federal employment for three years, or until July 14, 2012. OPM explained that these actions were based on Hopper's failure to report his two prior employment terminations. OPM rejected Hopper's assertions that his resignations were voluntary, citing his employment records and statements from his former employers. OPM advised Hopper that he could appeal its decision to the Board under the appeal rights provided in OPM's suitability regulations: 5 C.F.R. part 731. Pursuant to OPM's directive, the SSA removed Hopper effective July 31, 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hopper timely appealed OPM's July 14, 2009 negative suitability decision to the Board. While Hopper's appeal was pending, the Board issued a pair of decisions--<span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 276 (2009) and <span class="Italic">Barnes v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 273 (2009)--which questioned whether an individual who meets the definition of an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) and is separated pursuant to an OPM suitability action retains a statutory right to appeal his removal as an "adverse action" under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 subchapter II. <span class="Italic">See Aguzie</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. at 279 ("On remand, the parties shall be provided an opportunity to brief the question of whether the appellant is entitled to appeal his removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d)...."); <span class="Italic">see Barnes</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. at 275 ("[W]e reopen this case to address the question, not raised below or on petition for review, of whether the appellant is entitled to appeal her removal to the Board as an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II."). Because Hopper met the definition of an "employee," the administrative judge dismissed his appeal without prejudice to refiling depending upon resolution of the issue in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In January 2011, the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, holding that, when OPM directs an agency to remove a tenured employee, the removal action is subject to the requirements of chapter 75, including the right to appeal to the Board guaranteed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Aguzie v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 64, 66 (2011). The Board further found that its "statutory jurisdiction extends to review of the other suitability actions on appeal, i.e., debarment and cancellation of eligibilities" on grounds that they were "components of a unitary penalty arising from the same underlying misconduct" as the removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 80 (citing <span class="Italic">Brewer v. American Battle Monuments Commission</span>, 779 F.2d 663 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (finding that the Board had jurisdiction to consider a reassignment imposed in connection with a demotion as part of a unified penalty arising out of the same set of circumstances).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Post-<span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the administrative judge automatically refiled Hopper's appeal, and conducted a hearing via videoconference on October 26, 2011. During the hearing, representatives for OPM gave an opening statement criticizing the <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> decision but otherwise refused to participate. Specifically, OPM's representative stated that: (1) "OPM is simply incapable of adjudicating suitability actions under chapter 75"; and (2) OPM considered suitability factors in connection with this case, but did not consider mitigating or aggravating factors which are relevant under chapter 75. Hopper presented testimony from his second-line supervisor at the SSA: Assistant District Manager Sidney Egleston. In relevant part, Egleston "expressed continued confidence in [Hopper] and testified that he would have issued a lesser penalty, such as a letter of reprimand, rather than impose the penalty of removal." <span class="Italic">Hopper</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. at 610.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an Initial Decision dated March 8, 2012, the administrative judge explained that, although this case originated as a suitability action, because Hopper qualifies as an employee, he is entitled to appeal his removal as an "adverse action" under chapter 75 pursuant to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. The administrative judge sustained OPM's charge that Hopper provided false statements during his Federal appointment <span id="Page_805"></span>process. The judge then found that OPM did not engage in harmful procedural error in failing to consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in its suitability action because <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> changed the applicable standard. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Admin</span>., 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). Even if OPM had considered those factors, however, the administrative judge found that OPM would have made the same decision to direct Hopper's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, the administrative judge conducted an independent review of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Specifically, the judge noted that Hopper had served 15 months with the SSA, had no prior discipline, and had received a successful rating on his performance review. Given Egleston's unchallenged testimony expressing confidence in Hopper's performance and a preference for a lesser penalty, the administrative judge mitigated OPM's action from removal to a letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM petitioned the full Board for review, and the Director of OPM intervened. The parties did not dispute any of the administrative judge's factual findings or his conclusion that Hopper failed to demonstrate a harmful procedural error. Importantly, it was undisputed that Hopper was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) at the time of his removal due to his status as a preference eligible veteran. Because OPM did not object to any of the administrative judge's factual findings, the Board found no basis to disturb them. OPM focused its arguments on attacking the legal framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. The Board found OPM's arguments unpersuasive, and concluded that the administrative judge applied the appropriate analysis to mitigate Hopper's removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of OPM petitioned this court to review the Board's final decision pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d). In an order dated September 18, 2013, we granted that petition, concluding that OPM "has shown the necessary impact and that our jurisdiction is warranted." <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Hopper</span>, 533 F. App'x 997, 999 (Fed. Cir. 2013). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, OPM argues that this court should reverse the Board's decision "upending the long standing and well-established separation between suitability actions by OPM and adverse actions by employing agencies." OPM maintains that: (1) Hopper's appeal should have been adjudicated as a suitability action under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, rather than as an adverse action appeal under chapter 75; and (2) the Board erred in considering and applying mitigating factors to Hopper's suitability appeal. In the alternative, OPM submits that the governing statutes create an ambiguity with respect to whether suitability actions are included within the definition of a "removal" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, and thus the Board "should have deferred to OPM's reasonable interpretation of chapter 75 as being inapplicable to suitability actions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board responds that the CSRA defines who qualifies as an "employee" for purposes of Board review under chapter 75, and it is undisputed that Hopper meets that definition. And, although the CSRA specifies the types of removals that are excepted from Board review, it does not include an exception for removals based on suitability determinations. Accordingly, the Board maintains that Hopper's removal is an appealable adverse action under chapter 75. Because the statutory text is clear, the Board submits that we need not address OPM's deference arguments. Finally, the Board argues that OPM intentionally failed to meet its burden of showing that the penalty imposed on Hopper was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Hopper similarly argues that: (1) the Board's decision is consistent with the CSRA, which places removal appeals within the Board's jurisdiction and contains no exemption for suitability-based removals; and (2) even if there is some ambiguity as to what constitutes a "removal" for purposes of chapter 75, it is the Board's interpretation that is entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), not that of OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review in an appeal from the Board is limited by statute. We must affirm the Board's decision unless it was: "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). We review the Board's legal determinations, including its interpretation of a statute, <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">McCollum v. Nat'l Credit Union</span> <span class="Italic">Admin</span>., 417 F.3d 1332, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2005). We review the Board's findings of fact for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained below, we agree with the Board that Hopper's removal is an appealable adverse action under chapter 75, which by its terms provides a tenured employee with the right to appeal a removal without any exception for removals based on a negative suitability determination. Because we find the statutory text unambiguous, we do not decide which agency's interpretation of that text is due deference or whether their respective interpretations would be worthy of deference. We further find that the Board applied the appropriate analysis in assessing the penalty and mitigating Hopper's removal to a letter of remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The CSRA Grants the Board Jurisdiction Over Removal Appeals Involving Employees</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of this appeal involves the interpretation of and interplay between several provisions of the CSRA on the one hand, and OPM's suitability regulations on the other. It also involves the relationship between OPM and the Board, including their respective roles in the civil service system. It is well established that "statutory construction begins with the language of the statute itself." <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 197 F.3d 1144, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1999). "If the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, then it controls, and we may not look to the agency regulation for further guidance." <span class="Italic">Info. Tech. &#x0026; Applications Corp. v. United States</span>, 316 F.3d 1312, 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the statutory text, the CSRA grants the Board the power to adjudicate matters falling within its jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a). Under the CSRA, "employees"--as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)--are entitled to appeal to the Board from: (1) a removal; (2) a suspension for more than 14 days; (3) a reduction in grade; (4) a reduction in pay; and (5) a furlough of 30 days or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(1)-(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7512 then lists the following actions as falling outside the coverage of the statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; a reduction-in-force action under section 3502 of this title,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; the reduction in grade of a supervisor or manager who has not completed the probationary period under section 3321(a)(2) of this title if such reduction is to the grade held immediately before becoming a supervisor or manager,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; a reduction in grade or removal under section 4303 of this title, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; an action initiated under section 1215 or 7521 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(A)-(E).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7513(d) of the CSRA provides that an employee who is subject to an action listed in &#x00A7; 7512 is "entitled to appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 7701." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Section 7701, in turn, grants an employee the right to submit an appeal to the Board of "any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation," and provides that "appeals shall be processed in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Taken together, these statutory provisions make clear that tenured employees--those individuals who meet the definition of an "employee" set forth in &#x00A7; 7511--can seek Board review of adverse actions as defined in &#x00A7; 7512, including removals. Nothing in the text of the CSRA excludes suitability-based removals from the coverage of chapter 75. In fact, when Congress delineated the types of actions that are outside the scope of &#x00A7; 7512, it did not include an exemption for suitability removals. Applying the canon of <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>, no exceptions should be read into &#x00A7; 7512 beyond the five that Congress specifically created. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Smith,</span> 499 U.S. 160, 167 (1991) ("'Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent."') (quoting <span class="Italic">Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co</span>., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980)); <span class="Italic">see also Ventas, Inc. v. United States</span>, 381 F.3d 1156, 1161 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("Where Congress includes certain exceptions in a statute, the maxim <span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span> presumes that those are the only exceptions Congress intended."). Accordingly, we can infer that suitability-based removals are included within the scope of &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that Hopper qualifies as an "employee" because he is a preference eligible veteran in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). It is also undisputed that Hopper was removed from his position with the SSA. OPM argues, however, that a removal is not a "removal" within the meaning of chapter 75 when it is based on a suitability determination. OPM fails to cite a single statutory provision supporting this position. Instead, OPM points to general statutory grants of authority and to its own regulations. As explained below: (1) none of the statutes upon which OPM relies exempts suitability-based removals from the Board's jurisdiction under chapter 75; and (2) OPM's regulations cannot override the unambiguous language of &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM maintains that the CSRA preserved OPM's pre-CSRA control over suitability matters. Specifically, OPM including removals. Nothing in the text of the CSRA cites 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1101, 1103, and 1104 for the proposition that Congress intended OPM to have control over suitability actions and that it recognized a distinction between suitability actions and adverse actions taken by employing agencies. None of these provisions supports OPM's position, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Section 1101 provides that OPM "is an independent establishment in the executive branch." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101. Section 1103 establishes the functions of the Director of OPM and provides, in relevant part, that <span id="Page_806"></span>the Director shall be responsible for "executing, administering, and enforcing" the civil service rules and regulations and other activities of the office, "<span class="Italic">except with respect to functions for which the Merit Systems Protection Board or the Special Counsel is primarily responsible</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1103(a)(5) (emphasis added). Likewise, &#x00A7; 1104 provides that the Director has authority to "prescribe regulations and to ensure compliance with the civil service laws, rules, and regulations." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1104(b)(3). OPM cites several additional statutes which give it the general authority to prescribe regulations for the admission of applicants into the civil service.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1302(a) (providing that OPM "shall prescribe regulations for, control, supervise, and preserve the records of, examinations for the competitive service"); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301(a) (stating that the President may "prescribe such regulations for the admission of individuals into the civil service in the executive branch as will best promote the efficiency of that service"); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3302 (stating that the President "may prescribe rules governing the competitive service" and the rules shall provide for "necessary exceptions of positions").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While these authorities stand for the proposition that OPM can promulgate suitability regulations, they do not alter the Board's statutory jurisdiction to adjudicate removal appeals. Indeed, &#x00A7; 7514 grants OPM authority to prescribe regulations "except as it concerns any matter with respect to which the Merit Systems Protection Board may prescribe regulations." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514. The CSRA specifically provides that removals are adverse actions appealable to the Board, and we decline OPM's invitation to rewrite the statute to add suitability removals to the list of those matters not subject to appeal in &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the unambiguous statutory text, OPM argues that its regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(10), which purport to exclude suitability actions from coverage under chapter 75, are controlling.[4] OPM cannot introduce ambiguity into the statute through its regulations, however. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1148 ("If the language is clear, the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive."). Indeed, Congress made clear that it did not intend for OPM to have that authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 51 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2773 ("OPM does not have authority, however, to issue regulations which would undermine the authority of the Board directly or indirectly to regulate the procedures under which it reviews matters appealed to it, or the authority of the Board to decide matters in accordance with its interpretation of applicable law.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(f) provides that "an action to remove...an employee for suitability reasons under...part 731 is not an action under part 752," which includes chapter 75. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(10) similarly provides that part 752 procedures do not apply to actions "taken or directed by [OPM] under part 731...of this chapter."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM submits that its regulations are valid under the savings provision of the CSRA, &#x00A7; 902(a). Specifically, OPM maintains that &#x00A7; 902(a) preserved a "distinction between suitability actions and adverse actions by employing agencies." OPM's reliance on the savings provision is misplaced. That provision states, in part, that, "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Act, all executive orders, rules, and regulations affecting the Federal service shall continue in effect, according to their terms, until modified, terminated, superseded, or repealed" by the President or OPM. CSRA &#x00A7; 902(a), 92 Stat. at 1223.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, because OPM modified its regulations after the CSRA was enacted, it can no longer rely on the savings provision which specifically states that preexisting rules shall continue in effect "until modified." More importantly, however, &#x00A7; 902(a) demonstrates that, although certain rules may have been preserved, no rules that conflict with the CSRA survive under the Act. Accordingly, to the extent OPM alleges that its suitability action appeal rules were part of the pre-CSRA scheme, they were not preserved under the savings provision because they are inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that &#x00A7; 7512 is, at best, ambiguous as to whether OPM-directed suitability actions are included within the definition of a "removal." It maintains, however, that the term "removal" does not include debarment or cancellation of eligibilities. The Board cited <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> for the proposition that its statutory jurisdiction extends to review such actions taken in connection with a removal because they are "components of a unitary penalty arising from the same underlying misconduct." <span class="Italic">Hopper</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. at 612 (citing <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. at 80). We agree. Indeed, this court has recognized that the Board has jurisdiction to review a "unitary penalty" arising out of the same set of circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Brewer</span>, 779 F.2d at 664-65 (finding that the Board had jurisdiction to review a reassignment because it was imposed in connection with a demotion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM argues that the "unitary penalty" principle does not apply here because removal is backward-looking while debarment and cancellation of eligibilities are forwardlooking and designed to ensure that an individual cannot return to Federal service for a specified period of time. As the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, however, our decision in <span class="Italic">Brewer</span> did not focus on whether the penalties imposed served the same purpose, but rather on the fact that they arose "out of the same set of circumstances of which Mr. Brewer was found culpable." <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. at 80-81 (quoting <span class="Italic">Brewer</span>, 779 F.2d at 664). Here, the debarment and cancellation of eligibilities are a unified penalty arising out of the same set of facts as Hopper's removal. As Hopper points out, moreover, in the case of an employee, debarment and cancellation of eligibilities "cannot exist in isolation from the appealable, directed action" because an "individual cannot simultaneously be an employee, on the one hand, and debarred from seeking employment with the government, on the other."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also argues that &#x00A7; 7512 is ambiguous because, "by its plain terms," it "does not cover all removals." But the statute provides that it applies to "a removal" and then lists specific exceptions. That there is no exception for suitability-based removals does not render the statute ambiguous. Instead, it supports the inference that Congress did not intend to create such an exception. This is especially true given that the language used in &#x00A7; 7512 is not open ended, and does not invite additional exceptions. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 499 U.S. at 167 ("Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also cites <span class="Italic">Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571 (Fed. Cir. 1987), for the broad proposition that &#x00A7; 7512 is ambiguous. At issue in <span class="Italic">Horner</span> was an OPM regulation which exempted emergency furloughs from the statutory thirty day notice requirement for adverse actions. The Board found the regulation invalid on grounds that: (1) &#x00A7; 7512 defines a furlough of thirty days or less as an adverse action; and (2) &#x00A7; 7513(b) requires thirty days advance written notice for any adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 574. On appeal, this court concluded that there was an ambiguity in the statute and that OPM's regulation "merely resolve[d] that ambiguity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 576. We explained that, "[i]f an emergency furlough action is taken because an agency has no choice, rather than for the 'efficiency of the service'...it can reasonably be said that the agency did not 'take an action' covered by chapter 75. Thus, the notice provision of section 7513(b) would be inapplicable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 576. Unlike the emergency furlough at issue in <span class="Italic">Horner</span>, however, a removal <span class="Italic">is</span> an adverse action under &#x00A7; 7512, and it is undisputed that the SSA removed Hopper. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Horner</span> is readily distinguishable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concedes that "OPM can direct a suitability-based removal action after an employee has been on the job for 10, 15, or even 30 years." That said, a tenured employee has a statutory right to Board review of that removal under chapter 75. OPM cites <span class="Italic">Folio v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 402 F.3d 1350, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2005), as evidence that this court "has held that OPM's regulations properly prevent the board from reviewing its suitability actions." <span class="Italic">Folio</span> did not involve a tenured employee with chapter 75 appeal rights, however. Instead, it involved a job applicant whose tentative offer for employment was rescinded following a background check. <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, 402 F.3d at 1355. Because Folio was not an employee, he was not entitled to appeal to the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Nor was the agency's withdrawal of his tentative offer of employment an action covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. Folio's only avenue of appeal to the Board was provided under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501, which states that the Board may consider all aspects of a suitability determination, but may not review or modify the actions taken pursuant to that determination. Because Hopper is a tenured employee, the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Folio</span> does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to OPM, its suitability regulations do not treat tenured employees differently because "mere completion of 12 months of service cannot shield a person from the consequences of, for example, making material, intentional false statements in order to obtain a position with the Federal Government." Petitioner Br. 32 (citing 73 Fed. Reg. 20149, 20151 (Apr. 15, 2008)). OPM maintains that the Board's decision creates an inconsistency wherein the Board cannot review or mitigate OPM's selected suitability action in cases involving individuals without chapter 75 appeal rights, but where the individual qualifies as an "employee," the Board can substitute its judgment for that of OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While OPM strongly urges that its authority should not be circumscribed, it is not irrational to think Congress intended to do just that; giving broad authority to OPM unless and until an individual attains "employee" status. To the extent OPM believes that &#x00A7; 7512 should include an exception for actions taken against tenured employees based on suitability determinations, it must make its case to Congress rather than this court. If Congress determines that an individual in Hopper's position should not have the right to appeal a negative suitability decision as an adverse action under chapter 75, it can amend the CSRA to include suitability actions in the list of those matters not subject to appeal. <span class="Italic">See Reid v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 793 F.2d 277, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986) ("'The remedy for any dissatisfaction with the results in particular cases lies with Congress' and not this court. 'Congress may amend the statute; we may not.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors</span>, <span class="Italic">Inc</span>., 458 U.S. 564, 576 (1982)). Until it does so, however, we must apply the statute as written. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 <span id="Page_807"></span>F.3d at 1152 ("[W]hen a statute expresses its purpose in short, clear terms, the duty of the court is to apply the statute as written.") (citation omitted).[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;To the extent OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.203(f) and 752.401(b)(10) are inconsistent with the Board's statutory obligation to adjudicate appeals under &#x00A7; 7513(d), they are invalid. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersch</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151 n.7 ("By the same token, to the extent that OPM's regulations are contrary to the proposition that an individual is an 'employee' if he or she meets the requirements of either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii), they are invalid."); <span class="Italic">see also Fed. Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm</span>., 454 U.S. 27, 32 (1981) ("[T]he courts are the final authorities on issues of statutory construction. They must reject administrative constructions of the statute, whether reached by adjudication or by rulemaking, that are inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrate the policy that Congress sought to implement.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Mitigation of the Penalty</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Hopper is a tenured employee, he has a statutory right to appeal his removal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). It is well established that the Board's jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7513(d) includes the authority to review the agency's penalty determination using the factors articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305 (1981). <span class="Italic">See U.S. Postal Serv. v. Gregory</span>, 534 U.S. 1, 5 (2001) (noting that "the agency bears the burden of proving its charge by a preponderance of the evidence" and that, "[u]nder the Board's settled procedures, this requires proving not only that the misconduct actually occurred, but also that the penalty assessed was reasonable in relation to it") (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 304-05).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM objects to the Board's application of chapter 75 to Hopper's case, and argues that the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors do not apply in suitability appeals. According to OPM, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501 and this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, the Board "may consider all aspects of a suitability determination, <span class="Italic">except</span> the actions taken pursuant to it." Petitioner Br. 17 (citing <span class="Italic">Folio</span>, 402 F.3d at 1355); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(b)(1) ("If the Board finds that one or more of the charges brought by OPM or an agency against the person is supported by a preponderance of the evidence...it must affirm the suitability determination. The Board must consider the record as a whole and make a finding on each charge and specification in making its decision."). OPM maintains that: (1) no penalty mitigation factors can offset the fact that Hopper falsified documents in connection with his appointment; (2) when an employee is found unsuitable for federal employment, "removal <span class="Italic">must</span> be part of the outcome"; and (3) the Board erred when it held that, "unlike penalty selections by employing agencies, OPM's selection of a suitability action is not entitled to any deference."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While it is certainly true that "obtaining an appointment through material misrepresentation is a very serious offense" that may form the basis for removal, we have said that it "involves a quantum leap of logic" to conclude that review of the penalty is somehow barred. <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1564 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Instead, Hopper is entitled to "the same procedural safeguards and review as any other employee subject to an adverse action under the CSRA, including review of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed by the agency." <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"'Determination of an appropriate penalty is a matter committed primarily to the sound discretion of the employing agency.'" <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 528 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Beard v. Gen. Servs. Admin</span>., 801 F.2d 1318, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). This court defers to the agency's choice of penalty "unless the penalty exceeds the range of permissible punishment specified by statute or regulation, or unless the penalty is so harsh and unconscionably disproportionate to the offense that it amounts to an abuse of discretion." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation and quotation marks omitted). We have explained that this principle of deference "reflects the important policy consideration that the employing (and not the reviewing) agency is in the best position to judge the impact of the employee misconduct upon the operations of the agency...." <span class="Italic">Beard</span>, 801 F.2d at 1321.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with that rationale, the Board in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span> found that deference is not warranted "when OPM, rather than the employing agency, makes the penalty determination." 116 M.S.P.R. at 80 (noting that the "factors pertinent to determining the appropriateness of the penalty under the efficiency of the service standard of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) are not limited to the factors OPM may consider under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(c), but may also include matters which the employing agency is in a better position to evaluate"). Because the employing agency is better positioned to evaluate the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, including "the effect of the offense upon the employee's ability to perform at a satisfactory level and its effect upon supervisors' confidence," we agree. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Accordingly, in an appeal of an OPM-directed suitability removal of a tenured employee, the Board must review the penalty in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. In these circumstances, OPM, as the deciding agency, bears the burden to persuade the Board of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 307 ("[T]he ultimate burden is upon the agency to persuade the Board of the appropriateness of the penalty imposed").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, the administrative judge sustained OPM's falsification charge against Hopper, but mitigated the penalty after applying the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. In doing so, the administrative judge noted that OPM was present at the hearing, but refused to participate beyond challenging the decision in <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>. Accordingly, OPM did not provide any testimony or other evidence in support of its removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Independently applying the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, the administrative judge found that Hopper served 15 months with the SSA, had no prior discipline, and had received a successful performance review. Given that Hopper's second-line supervisor expressed continued confidence in him and a preference for a lesser penalty, the administrative judge found that mitigation was appropriate. The Board found that the administrative judge applied the appropriate analysis in mitigating Hopper's removal and affirmed the administrative judge's findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no error in the Board's analysis. Because Hopper was a tenured employee, he was entitled to appeal to the Board under Section 7513(d), and the Board had jurisdiction to assess whether the penalty was appropriate. Where, as here, OPM presents no evidence to support the reasonableness of the penalty, we have no alternative but to accept the Board's assessment of it. We therefore find no error in the Board's decision that it had the authority to mitigate Hopper's suitability removal to a letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that: (1) under the CSRA, a tenured employee is entitled to appeal a suitability-based removal as an adverse action under chapter 75; and (2) the Board was entitled to conduct an independent review of the penalty imposed in light of the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. Accordingly, we affirm the Board's decision mitigating Hopper's suitability-based removal to a letter of reprimand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's review authority, as established under <span class="Italic">Aguzie,</span> applied when the Board sustained all of the charges and when it sustains fewer than all the charges. <span class="Italic">Hunt-O'Neal v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 286, 290 n.4, 2011 MSPB 33 (2011). The Board's review authority, as established under <span class="Italic">Aguzie</span>, was shifted away from adverse action protections by 2015 legislative amendments explained in <span class="Italic">Odoh v.
