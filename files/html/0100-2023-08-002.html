<p class="Body-Text">The 1978 Civil Service Reform Act was enacted in response to the belief of Congress and the President that the civil service was awash with employees who were not removed for incompetence or misconduct because the existing disciplinary system was too cumbersome. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">The Other Side of the Merit Coin: Removals for Incompetence in the Federal Service</span> (MSPB 1982). A Senate report described prior civil service legislation as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[a]n outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century. Federal management practices are antiquated in comparison with the current state of the managerial art. Research and experimentation concerning the management practices is virtually nonexistent. (1978 USCCAN pp. 2723, 2725.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kean v. Stone</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/19911202926f2d27611159">926 F.2d 276</a>, 282 (3rd Cir. 1991), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was responsive to the joint perception of Congress and the executive branch that the Civil Service Commission--which had since 1932 exercised statutory dominion over the personnel practices of the burgeoning federal establishment--had such a broad panoply of frequently disharmonious responsibilities that it was not fulfilling any of them in optimal fashion. A particular concern was the conflation, under a single Commission, of (1) the duty to advise and supervise federal agencies in the performance of their personnel functions, and (2) the duty to adjudicate grievances of federal employees challenging agency personnel actions. The proposed legislative solution--accomplished in the Civil Service Reform Act--was to "abolish the Civil Service Commission," and to establish in its place "two new agencies...(1) The Office of Personnel Management, charged with personnel management and agency advisory functions, and (2) the Merit Systems Protection Board, charged with insuring adherence to merit system principles and laws." S. Rep. No. 95-969, 95th Cong.2d Sess. 5, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> [1978] U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 272.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The MSPB's Strategic Plan for FY 2020-2024 (Feb. 10, 2020) provides some history of the Reform Act and formation of the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Historical significance</span>. Understanding the origin of MSPB and the role it plays in ensuring effective human capital management in the Federal Government requires a brief review of the history of our Nation's Federal civil service. From the earliest days of our Government through the early 1880s, the Federal civil service operated under a patronage or "spoils system."[1] Federal employees were appointed based on their support of a President's election campaign and political beliefs. There were no requirements that such appointees be suitable for Federal service or have the qualifications to perform particular Federal jobs. As administrations changed, large numbers of Federal employees were replaced with new employees appointed by the new administrations. At various times, the Capital was besieged with thousands of office seekers who believed they were owed a Federal job based on their political support of the President. Over time, this practice contributed to an unstable workforce lacking the necessary qualifications to perform its work, which in turn adversely affected the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government and its ability to serve the American people.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Bogdanow, M., and Lanphear, T., <span class="Italic">History of the Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, Journal of the Federal Circuit Historical Society, Vol. 4, 2010, pp. 109-110.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The inherent weaknesses of the patronage system and its impact on Government effectiveness were recognized by concerned individuals and groups resulting in various reform movements. However, there was little momentum for change until President James A. Garfield was assassinated in 1881 by a disgruntled Federal job seeker. A large public outcry for civil service reform ensued, which led to the enactment of the Pendleton Act in 1883. The Pendleton Act created the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and tasked it with monitoring a merit-based civil service which used competitive examinations to support the appointment of qualified individuals to Federal positions. This contributed to improvements in Government efficiency and effectiveness by helping to ensure that a stable, highly qualified Federal workforce, free from partisan political pressure, was available to serve the American people.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following passage of the Pendleton Act, laws were enacted and actions undertaken that established the principle of "promoting the efficiency of the civil service" as the standard for removing a Federal employee. These laws and actions also granted preference for hiring military veterans, established a more transparent process for removing veterans from Federal jobs, and extended the veterans' job protections to other civil servants.[2] The CSC was given additional authority to oversee the removal of Federal employees and to adjudicate employees' appeals of their removal.[3] Although the CSC made several internal changes to better manage the appeals process, it became clear over time that the CSC could not properly, adequately, and simultaneously set managerial policy, protect the merit systems, and adjudicate appeals of actions Federal agencies took against employees. Concern over the inherent or perceived conflicts of interest in the CSC's role as both rule-maker and adjudicator of appeals was a principal motivating factor behind the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA).[4] The CSRA replaced the CSC with three new agencies: MSPB as the successor to the Commission, with an Office of Special Counsel (OSC) situated within MSPB to investigate and prosecute alleged PPPs; [5] the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to serve as the President's agent for Federal workforce management policy and procedure; and the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to oversee Federal labor-management relations.[6]</p>

During congressional hearings on the CSRA before its passage in 1978, the role and functions of MSPB were described during testimony by various members of Congress: "[MSPB] will assume principal responsibility for safeguarding merit principles and employee rights" and be "charged with ensuring adherence to merit principles and laws" and with "safeguarding the effective operation of the merit principles in practice."[7] MSPB inherited the CSC's adjudication functions and provides due process to employees as an independent, third-party adjudicatory authority for employee appeals of adverse actions (e.g., removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, and furloughs) and retirement decisions. For matters within its jurisdiction, the CSRA gave MSPB the statutory authority to develop its adjudicatory processes and procedures, issue subpoenas, call witnesses, and enforce compliance with MSPB decisions. The CSRA also gave MSPB broad authority to conduct independent, objective studies of the Federal merit systems and Federal human capital management issues, to ensure that Federal employees are managed in accordance with MSPs and in a manner free from PPPs. In addition, MSPB was given the authority and responsibility to review the rules, regulations, and significant actions of OPM. MSPB may, on its own motion or at the request of other parties, review and potentially overturn OPM regulations if such regulations, or the implementation of such regulations, would require an employee to commit a PPP. MSPB also is responsible for annually reviewing and reporting on OPM's significant actions and the degree to which the actions may affect adherence to MSPs and avoidance of PPPs.[8] In summary, the CSRA granted MSPB the statutory authority and responsibility to adjudicate employee appeals, enforce compliance with MSPB decisions, conduct objective studies of Federal merit systems and human capital management issues, and review and take appropriate action on OPM's rules, regulations, and significant actions.

<p class="Body-Text">Of the 1978 Reform Act, <span class="Italic">Romero v. Dept. of Army</span>, 708 F.2d 1561, 1563 (10th Cir. 1983), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 undertook to rewrite, revise and simplify the conglomeration of statutes under which the vast and unwieldy civil service system of the United States was managed.... [T]he complex rules and procedures often afforded a refuge for incompetent and inefficient employees and made it "almost impossible to remove those who were not performing."... The 1978 Act sought to remedy this condition by providing procedures whereby the agencies could more efficiently manage their operations, including the discipline or removal of employees who were found to be inefficient, incompetent, or otherwise unfit for continuing service in the agency. To protect employees from an abuse of agency action, the MSPB, a neutral body, was created. Pursuant <span id="Page_2"></span>to established rules and regulations, the MSPB was authorized to conduct hearings to determine the validity of an agency's action affecting the tenure of a civil servant's employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Supreme Court intoned, <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 444-46, 108 S. Ct. 668 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A leading purpose of the CSRA was to replace the haphazard arrangements for administrative and judicial review of personnel action, part of the "outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century" that was the civil service system, S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 3 (1978), U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2723. Under that pre-existing system, only veterans enjoyed a statutory right to appeal adverse personnel action to the Civil Service Commission (CSC), the predecessor of the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (1976 ed.). Other employees were afforded this type of administrative review by Executive Order. Exec. Order No. 11491, &#x00A7; 22, 3 CFR 874 (1966-1970 Comp.), note following 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7301 (1976 ed.) (extending CSC review to competitive service employees). Still others, like employees in respondent's classification, had no right to such review. As for appeal to the courts: Since there was no special statutory review proceeding relevant to personnel action, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 703, employees sought to appeal the decisions of the CSC, or the agency decision unreviewed by the CSC, to the district courts through the various forms of action traditionally used for so-called nonstatutory review of agency action, including suits for mandamus, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Taylor v. United States Civil Service Comm'n</span>, 374 F.2d 466 (CA9 1967), injunction, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Hargett v. Summerfield</span>, 100 U.S. App. D.C. 85, 243 F.2d 29 (1957), and declaratory judgment, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Camero v. McNamara</span>, 222 F. Supp. 742 (ED Pa.1963). <span class="Italic">See generally</span> R. Vaughn, <span class="Italic">Principles of Civil Service Law</span> &#x00A7; 5.4, p. 5-21, and nn. 13-17 (1976) (collecting cases). For certain kinds of personnel decisions, federal employees could maintain an action in the Court of Claims of the sort respondent seeks to maintain here. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ainsworth v. United States</span>, 185 Ct. Cl. 110, 399 F.2d 176 (1968).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Criticism of this "system" of administrative and judicial review was widespread. The general perception was that "appeals processes [were] so lengthy and complicated that managers [in the civil service] often avoid[ed] taking disciplinary action" against employees even when it was clearly warranted. S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 9, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2731. With respect to judicial review in particular, there was dissatisfaction with the "wide variations in the kinds of decisions...issued on the same or similar matters," <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 63, U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 1978, p. 2785, which were the product of concurrent jurisdiction, under various bases of jurisdiction, of the district courts in all Circuits and the Court of Claims. Moreover, as the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit repeatedly noted, beginning the judicial process at the district court level, with repetition of essentially the same review on appeal in the court of appeals, was wasteful and irrational. <span class="Italic">See Polcover v. Secretary of Treasury</span>, 155 U.S. App. D.C. 338, 341-342, 477 F.2d 1223, 1226-1228 (1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress responded to this situation by enacting the CSRA, which replaced the patchwork system with an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 4. Three main sections of the CSRA govern personnel action taken against members of the civil service. In each of these sections, Congress deals explicitly with the situation of nonpreference members of the excepted service, granting them limited, and in some cases conditional, rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 43 of the CSRA governs personnel actions based on unacceptable job performance. It applies to both competitive service employees and members of the excepted service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4301. It provides that before an employee can be removed or reduced in grade for unacceptable job performance certain procedural protections must be afforded, including 30 days' advance written notice of the proposed action, the right to be represented by an attorney or other representative, a reasonable period of time in which to respond to the charges, and a written decision specifying the instances of unacceptable performance. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1). Although Congress extended these protections to nonpreference members of the excepted service, it denied them the right to seek either administrative or judicial review of the agency's final action. Chapter 43 gives only competitive service employees and preference eligible members of the excepted service the right to appeal the agency's decision to the MSPB and then to the Federal Circuit. &#x00A7; 4303(e).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 23 of the CSRA establishes the principles of the merit system of employment, &#x00A7; 2301, and forbids an agency to engage in certain "prohibited personnel practices," including unlawful discrimination, coercion of political activity, nepotism, and reprisal against so-called whistleblowers. &#x00A7; 2302. Nonpreference excepted service employees who are not in positions of a confidential or policymaking nature are protected by this chapter, &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B), and are given the right to file charges of "prohibited personnel practices" with the Office of Special Counsel of the MSPB, whose responsibility it is to investigate the charges and, where appropriate, to seek remedial action from the agency and the MSPB. &#x00A7; 1206.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 75 of the Act governs adverse action taken against employees for the "efficiency of the service," which includes action of the type taken here, based on misconduct. Subchapter I governs minor adverse action (suspension for 14 days or less), &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501-7504, and Subchapter II governs major adverse action (removal, suspension for more than 14 days, reduction in grade or pay, or furlough for 30 days or less), &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7514. In each subchapter, covered employees are given procedural protections similar to those contained in Chapter 43, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7503(b), 7513(b), and in Subchapter II covered employees are accorded administrative review by the MSPB, followed by judicial review in the Federal Circuit. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7703. The definition of "employee[s]" covered by Subchapter II (major adverse action) specifically includes preference eligibles in the excepted service, &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), but does not include other members of the excepted service. The Office of Personnel Management is, however, given authority to extend coverage of Subchapter II to positions in the excepted service that have that status because they have been excluded from the competitive service by OPM regulation. &#x00A7; 7511(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In words as eloquent as the topic allows, D.C. Circuit Judge Bazelon summarized the statute and its administrative structure, <span class="Italic">Frazier v. MSPB</span>, 672 F.2d 150, 153-56 (D.C. Cir. 1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA constituted the first comprehensive reform of the federal civil service system since passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883. A product of the nineteenth century progressive movement, the Pendleton Act had sought to replace the 'spoils system,' under which the President could dispense federal jobs as rewards for political patronage, with a 'merit system' that would base selection and promotion of most civil servants on competence. The Pendleton Act also established a Civil Service Commission charged both with protecting the merit principle and with managing the federal bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In subsequent years, an increasing proportion of the federal workforce was classified in the competitive service. As the Commission's management functions grew more complex, it was also compelled to elaborate a wide variety of merit system rules without guidance from Congress. Delay and inefficiency increasingly characterized the procedures required to discipline unsatisfactory employees. At the same time, several celebrated episodes suggested that efforts by employees to call attention to government waste and fraud were often inhibited by the threat of retaliatory personnel actions. The dual responsibility of the Civil Service Commission for management and merit protection seemed to pose a barrier against mitigating these problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1978, these and other concerns led President Carter to propose legislation that would significantly restructure the civil service. Among the legislative objectives identified by the President in his message to Congress were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To strengthen the protection of legitimate employee rights;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To provide incentives and opportunities for managers to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the Federal Government; [and]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To reduce the redtape and costly delay in the present personnel system[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another important purpose of the proposals, as noted by the legislation's Senate manager, Senator Ribicoff, was to '[p]rovide[ ] new protections for employees who disclose illegal or improper Government conduct.'</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As enacted, the CSRA includes several basic features intended to achieve these goals. Title I of the Act consists of the first statutory expression of the merit system principles that have evolved since the creation of the Civil Service Commission. In addition to detailing the requirement that personnel decisions rest on evaluations of competence, Title I announces a statutory policy of protecting whistleblowers....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title I also defines a variety of 'prohibited personnel practices' including actions taken in retaliation for whistleblowing, section 2302(b)(8), and those taken as a reprisal 'for the exercise of any appeal right granted by any law, rule, or regulation,' section 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title II of the CSRA abolishes the Civil Service Commission and replaces it with two new agencies, the MSPB and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM, headed by a single director responsible to the President, supervises the administration of the civil service. The MSPB, an independent agency consisting of three members, is charged with protecting the merit system principles and adjudicating conflicts between federal workers and their employing agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> sections 1201-05. The Act also establishes...an independent Special Counsel responsible for investigating and prosecuting prohibited personnel practices, employment discrimination, unlawful political activities, arbitrary withholding of information requested under the Freedom of Information Act, and any other violations of law within the federal civil service....</p>

Fish, <span class="Italic">The Civil Service and the Patronage</span> (1904). The modern civil service was born with the passage of the Civil Service Act of 1883 (Pendleton Act), ch. 27, 22 Stat. 403 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5, 18 &#x0026; 40 USC). That Act was precipitated by public disapproval of the "spoils system," a civil service policy intended to facilitate the removal of inefficient government personnel, but which instead resulted in wholesale turnovers of personnel in many parts of the government after every election defeat. <span class="Italic">See</span> Note<span class="Italic">, Federal Employment The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978--Removing Incompetents and Protecting "Whistle Blowers,"</span> 26 Wayne L. Rev. 97, 98 (1979). The Pendleton Act set up a Civil Service Commission empowered to limit political pressures on jobholders and to promulgate rules on various personnel matters, including competitive examinations for positions. As originally passed, however, the Act covered only about 10% of government employees, created few limits on removal powers, and gave no procedural protections to employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> Note, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 99. Over the next several decades, attempts to remedy these defects rendered the procedures allowed federal employees to appeal adverse actions time-consuming and complex. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 99-105. The CSRA attempted to solve these problems without sacrificing the procedural protections developed in the twentieth century.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Manivannan v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 42 F.4th 163 (3rd Cir. 2022) (describing scope of judicial review of actions affecting federal employees before and after the Reform Act).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board described its evolution in its "Congressional Budget Justification For Fiscal Year 2013":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MSPB has its origin in the Pendleton Act of 1883, which was passed following the assassination of President James A. Garfield by a disgruntled Federal job seeker. The Pendleton Act created the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which implemented the use of competitive examinations to support the appointment of qualified individuals to Federal positions in a manner based on merit and free from partisan political pressure. This improved Government effectiveness and efficiency by helping to ensure that a stable, highly qualified Federal workforce was available to provide effective service to the American people. Over time, it became clear that the CSC could not properly, adequately, and simultaneously set managerial policy, protect the merit systems, and adjudicate appeals. Concern over this conflict of interest in the CSC's role as both rule-maker and judge was a principal motivating factor behind enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA). The CSRA replaced the CSC with three new agencies: MSPB as the successor to the Commission; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to serve as the President's agent for Federal workforce management policy and procedure; and the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to oversee Federal labor-management relations. The CSRA also codified for the first time the values of the merit systems as MSPs [Merit System Principles] and defined PPPs [prohibited personnel practices].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Structural reforms accomplished by the Act were also described in <span class="Italic">Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272, 278-79 (D.C.

Kennedy</span>, 94 S. Ct. 1633 (1974).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (WPA) significantly amended the Reform Act by requiring more aggressive prosecution by the Office of Special Counsel of cases involving the prohibited personnel practice of whistleblowing reprisal and by creating an "Individual Right of Action" appeal to MSPB for employees victimized by whistleblowing reprisal. Whistleblower protections were extended and redefined by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act, discussed in Chapter 13. [Refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-004.html#sec13-5">Whistleblowing Reprisal</a>" for detailed discussion of the WPA and later whistleblowing legislation.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Krafsur v. Davenport</span>, 736 F.3d 1032, 1034-35 (6th Cir. 2013), described adverse actions and prohibited personnel practices--frequent subjects of MSPB litigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before Congress enacted the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978, a jumble of statutes and executive orders governed the resolution of federal employees' complaints about the workplace. The Act replaced this patchwork with a coherent system of administrative and judicial review. The new system handles all "personnel actions," a capacious term defined to include appointments, transfers, any "disciplinary or corrective action," "any...significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions," and much else besides. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2). The extent of available review turns on the severity of the personnel action and the rank of the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally speaking, the Act divides covered actions into two categories: adverse actions and prohibited personnel practices. <span class="Italic">See Carducci v. Regan</span>, 714 F.2d 171, 175 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Scalia, J.). Adverse actions are the most serious the government may take against its employees. For administrative law judges, these include removal, suspension, reduction in grade, reduction in pay and some furloughs. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. The Act entitles an employee facing an adverse action to a formal hearing before the Merit Systems Protection Board and if necessary an appeal to the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7521, 7703.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prohibited personnel practices are less serious than adverse actions. The Act defines this category broadly. It includes violations of "any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning,...merit system principles," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), which in turn entitle employees to "fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management," to insist upon "proper regard for...constitutional rights," and to prohibit "arbitrary action," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2301(b). An employee faced with a prohibited personnel practice must first complain to the Office of Special Counsel. If the Special Counsel concludes that "there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred," he <span class="Italic">must</span> report his conclusion to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B). If the agency fails to take corrective action, the Special Counsel <span class="Italic">may</span> refer the case to the Merit Systems Protection Board (from which the employee may appeal to the Federal Circuit). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(C), 1214(c). But if the Special Counsel concludes that the complaint lacks merit, or if he declines to refer the case to the Board, the employee is out of luck. A court may not review the Special Counsel's decisions unless the Counsel "has declined to investigate a complaint at all." <span class="Italic">Carson v. U.S. Office of Special Counsel</span>, 633 F.3d 487, 493 (6th Cir. 2011).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This description does not begin to capture the Act's many intricacies. Anyone who reads through the Act will encounter more types of covered actions and more channels of administrative or judicial review. Even within the category of prohibited personnel practices, the Act makes some exceptions. If an employee alleges discrimination because of race or sex, for example, the Act allows him to bypass the Special Counsel procedure and to sue in district court under the civil rights laws. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(d). Or if an employee alleges retaliation for whistleblowing or "for refusing to obey an order that would require [him] to violate a law," the Act allows him to bypass the Special Counsel procedure and to go straight to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(a), 2302(b)(9).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After more than four decades of its existence, opinions on Board operations are mixed. Agencies find the Board supportive of their decisions but not sufficiently supportive to avoid statutory initiatives--including those involving the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, and, most recently, Veterans Affairs--that, at least for a time, either pull a whole range of actions away from Board review or considerably reduce the Board's discretion to affect actions appealed by employees of those agencies. Uncomfortable with the Board's traditional deference to managerial choices of penalties in adverse actions, unions avoid the Board when possible, entrusting cases of significance to labor arbitrators who traditionally require greater justification than the Board for severe disciplinary penalties. Those employees who cannot avoid the Board use it, but the Board has no supportive constituency among federal employees. Some appellants believe the Board favors procedural defaults against them. Few agencies suffer the same fate, but agencies do not seek relief from the Board and agencies are almost always represented by counsel. Appellants are unrepresented by counsel in about 60% of the Board's docket.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To its credit, the Board, at the urging of the Federal Circuit, now requires its administrative judges (AJs) to inform appellants (most of whom are unrepresented) of what they are supposed to demonstrate to establish that a case was timely filed, that a case is within the Board's jurisdiction and, for cases timely filed and properly before the Board, what proof is required to establish elements of the case. The Board expedites litigation through electronic filing procedures and through settlement and mediation programs discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Over the many years of its existence, the Board may focus on one area of the law, then another. Disability discrimination issues, complexities of government reorganizations, analysis of reprisal claims, the impact of government fiscal measures on the civil service, due process, penalty analysis, and national <span id="Page_4"></span>security concerns, have all had their months or years of development through case law--that focus magnified on occasion by a leading decision of the Federal Circuit or Supreme Court that changes the direction of the law. And, too, because Board members are political appointees, have limited terms, and varying backgrounds, the perspective of Board members, as reflected by their decisions, changes over time. Dissenting opinions from one year may become the majority position in another. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board: A Legal Overview</span> (Congressional Research Service, March 25, 2019).
