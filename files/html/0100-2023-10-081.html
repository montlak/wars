<h5 class="h5" id="sec3-81"><span class="space">c.</span> Raising Issue <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Sua Sponte</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ may address, on his own initiative, an error implicating an employee's basic procedural rights if treatment of the error is necessary to prevent manifest injustice. The AJ may also raise and consider a prohibited personnel practice issue. There is greater leeway for the AJ to do so if the appellant is not assisted by counsel. However, the AJ is not prevented from considering these issues when the appellant is represented by counsel, <span class="Italic">Chance v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 583, 588-89 (1983):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency argues that the presiding official erred both procedurally and on the merits of the constructive suspension. First, the agency contends that the presiding official is precluded from raising an error <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> where, as here, appellant was literate and represented by counsel. The Board has not so limited the basic powers of a presiding official. The Board has stated that it may be appropriate for a presiding official to address <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> an error that implicates an employee's basic procedural rights, when cognizance of the error is necessary to prevent manifest injustice<span class="Italic">. See Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 496 n.9 (1980). The Board noted that slightly greater leeway may be justified where appellant is unassisted by counsel<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The Board has also approved under appropriate circumstances a presiding official's <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> action in raising and considering a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See Fekete v. Department of Justice,</span> 8 MSPB 130 at 130 (1981); <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 MSPB 459, 463 n.10 (1980). In <span class="Italic">Speaker v. Department of Education</span>, 11 MSPB 430 at 431 (1982), the Board noted that under the circumstances of the case the presiding official could have raised a substantive right of appellant on his own motion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The determinative factor in deciding whether a presiding official abused his discretion in raising an action <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> is whether such action was necessary to prevent injustice. In this case, the presiding official found that appellant had not participated in the strike and was not AWOL. Therefore, the agency erred in placing appellant in a non-pay, non-duty status. The Board finds that the presiding official's raising of the constructive suspension <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> was a proper exercise of his remedial powers to make appellant whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board has not issued an encompassing definition of "manifest injustice" as to the AJ's authority to raise issues on her own volition, <span class="Italic">Mouser v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 619, 622 (1986), made plain that manifest injustice includes avoidance of an unwarranted discharge:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he agency challenges the presiding official's finding of harmful procedural error, arguing initially that the appellant had never raised the specific procedural error upon which the presiding official decided the case, and that the presiding official should not have raised it <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> in this instance. The agency acknowledges that it is appropriate for a presiding official to address, on his own motion, an error that affects an employee's basic procedural rights, if it would be necessary to do so to prevent manifest injustice, <span class="Italic">see Chance v. Department of Transportation,</span> 16 MSPR 583, 588-589 (1983); <span class="Italic">Knab v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 13 MSPR 509, 514 n.1 (1982), but argues that the presiding official failed to explain what manifest injustice would have ensued here had he not raised this issue. In fact, the presiding official clearly set forth his belief that the agency's alleged procedural error violated the appellant's basic right to be allowed to make an informed response to specific charges against him. Thus, while we may, and herein do, consider the propriety of the presiding official's finding of harmful procedural error, we do not believe he erred in raising and considering the possibility of its existence in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board also states that "the presiding official is not bound to address possible agency errors <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> as an appellant bears the burden of establishing an affirmative defense," <span class="Italic">Eng v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 220, 222 (1983), and although an AJ may raise, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, issues implicating basic procedural rights, apparently it is not proper to do so as to substantive rights, e.g., whether an appellant's position was actually abolished by a RIF. <span class="Italic">Caselli v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">..."In our adversary system, in both civil and criminal cases, in the first instance and on appeal, we follow the principle of party presentation.

United States</span>, 554 U.S. 237, 243 (2008). The Veterans Court's regular practice of addressing, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, the question of whether a veteran's appeal is timely filed is contrary to the Supreme Court's admonition that a court should independently consider a statute of limitations defense only "in exceptional cases." <span class="Italic">Wood v. Milyard</span>, 132 S. Ct. 1826, 1834 (2012). Regularly raising an affirmative defense on behalf of the Secretary creates the appearance that the court functions not as a "neutral arbiter," <span class="Italic">Greenlaw</span>, 554 U.S. at 243, but instead as a mere appendage of the Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), as even the Veterans Court once recognized. <span class="Italic">See MacWhorter v. Derwinski</span>, 2 Vet. App. 133, 135 (1992) ("[F]erreting out...implicit or possible contentions" on behalf of the Secretary "would be the antithesis of the adversarial judicial appellate process."); <span class="Italic">see also Hodge v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">..."[A] federal court does not have <span class="Italic">carte blanche</span> to depart from the principle of party presentation basic to our adversary system." <span class="Italic">Wood</span>, 132 S.

Instead, the Supreme Court has repeatedly cautioned that a court can <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> address an affirmative defense only in a narrow set of circumstances. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1834 (concluding that an appellate court abused its discretion by raising a timeliness defense on its own initiative); <span class="Italic">Greenlaw</span>, 554 U.S. at 244 (Because our justice "system is designed around the premise that the parties know what is best for them, and are responsible for advancing the facts and arguments entitling them to relief," courts "normally decide only questions presented by the parties."

<p class="Block-Quote1">Many veterans who seek redress from the Veterans Court suffer from significant service-connected physical and psychiatric disabilities. <span class="Italic">See Dixon v. Shinseki</span>, 741 F.3d 1367, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2014). Such veterans, moreover, are often unrepresented when they file their notices of appeal. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The Secretary, by contrast, is represented by a regiment of skilled and experienced attorneys. Given that the Secretary generally has a clear advantage--in terms of resources and experience--it defies understanding why the Veterans Court believes it necessary to routinely raise the timeliness defense on his behalf. <span class="Italic">See Greenlaw</span>, 554 U.S. at 244 ("Counsel almost always know a great deal more about their cases than we do, and this must be particularly true of counsel for the United States, the richest, most powerful, and best represented litigant to appear before us."

<p class="Block-Quote1">"The rule that points not argued will not be considered is more than just a prudential rule of convenience; its observance, at least in the vast majority of cases, distinguishes our adversary system of justice from the inquisitorial one." <span class="Italic">United States v. Burke</span>, 504 U.S. 229, 246(1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Nevertheless, if the AJ makes it reasonably clear that he is considering a defense, e.g., disability discrimination, that the appellant may not have clearly articulated, the agency cannot raise for the first time on PFR the AJ's the treatment of the issue at the hearing. The agency should object to treatment of the defense when the AJ suggests he will consider it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harbo v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 450, 458-64 (1992) (majority opinion joined by Chairman Levinson, who offered an extensive concurring opinion collecting related cases and suggesting that the Board should clarify law as to when AJs may determine unpleaded issues without the parties' consent).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant should not be required, at the hearing or in his PFR, to rebut arguments and evidence never advanced by either the agency or competing employees in a RIF, either expressly or by implication; it was error for the AJ to raise and address an appellant's right to displace other employees in the course of a RIF. <span class="Italic">Putnam v. DHHS</span>, 31 MSPR 427, 430 (1986) (citing <span class="Italic">Caselli v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 196, 199 (1985) (it was inappropriate for the AJ to raise and address, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, similarity between pre- and post-RIF positions when the appellant never advanced those allegations and the issue did not implicate the appellant's basic procedural rights)). Conversely, if the appellant, represented by counsel, expressly waives a defense, that defense should not be resurrected by the AJ when the opposing party believed it would not need to defend against it, <span class="Italic">McKowen v. DLA</span>, 10 MSPR 98, 100-01 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we held in <span class="Italic">Clancy v. Department of the Navy,</span> 6 MSPB 173, 175, 6 MSPR 196, 200 (1981), an allegation of discrimination on the basis of a handicapping condition is an affirmative defense which must be pled and proved by the appellant who asserts it. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)] . In this case, the appellant's attorney argued at the hearing that the appellant had a psychiatric condition related to the misconduct with which he was charged, and that the agency had an obligation to assist the appellant to a greater degree than it did, proffering both documentary and testimonial evidence on those issues. However, when the presiding official specifically inquired, "Is the appellant alleging discrimination because of a handicapping condition," the appellant's attorney responded, "We're not alleging today that [the appellant] was discriminated against based on a handicap....<span class="Italic">"</span> Disregarding this exchange, the presiding official found in his initial decision that, while handicap discrimination was not expressly alleged in the petition for appeal, it was the "essence" of the testimonial and documentary evidence. He then based his disposition of the case on his finding of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued in his response to the petition for review that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 1 MSPB 489, 1 MSPR 505 (1980), supports the presiding official's exercise of discretion to consider an affirmative defense that had not been raised by the appellant. We did hold in <span class="Italic">Parker</span> at 496 n.9, 1 MSPR at 517 n.9 that, although a procedural error should not generally be considered harmful unless the appellant so alleges, "[I]t may be appropriate for a presiding official to address on his or her own initiative an error that implicates an employee's basic procedural rights, when cognizance of the error is necessary to prevent manifest injustice." A procedural error is an affirmative defense by statutory and regulatory definition, as is handicap discrimination. 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(D) and 7701(c)(2)(A) and (B); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(1) and (2) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(1) and (2)] . It follows, therefore, that the principle of <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> consideration of the affirmative defense of harmful error under circumstances that would otherwise work manifest injustice against the appellant, applies equally to the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, however, the appellant was represented by an attorney with the National Association of Government Employees who acknowledged that he had considered raising the defense but decided not to do so. <span class="Italic">Cf. Parker</span> at 496 n.9, 1 MSPR at 517 n.9 (noting that slightly greater leeway may be justified in raising a defense <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> where the appellant is unassisted by counsel). As pointed out by OPM in its brief, because the appellant's attorney expressly waived reliance on the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination, neither the presiding official nor the agency invoked the regulation of the Board which provides that "[W]hen an appellant alleges prohibited discrimination for the first time during the course of a proceeding,...the agency shall be given a reasonable opportunity to refute the allegation through a responsive pleading, testimony, production of documents or as otherwise permitted by the presiding official." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.155(d). Under these circumstances, we find that the presiding official erred in finding that the agency failed to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of handicap discrimination when the agency was never put on notice that the matter was in issue....</p>
