<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-97"><span class="space">5.</span> USERRA; VEOA</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act and the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act contain provisions for fee awards. USERRA, 38 USC 4324(c), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;If the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication <span id="Page_4635"></span>conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board pursuant to subsection (b) that such person is entitled to an order referred to in paragraph (2), the Board may, in its discretion, award such person reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">VEOA, 5 USC 3330c(b), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A preference eligible who prevails in an action under section 3330a or 3330b shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">USERRA provides independent authority for a fee award that depends on whether the appellant secured relief under the statute and does not require satisfaction of a "prevailing party" or "interest of justice" standard, <span class="Italic">Glassman v. Dept. of Labor</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GLASSMAN_HAROLD_D_DC_3443_05_0255_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_246809.pdf">101 MSPR 373</a>, 374-75 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7, 2006 MSPB 59 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board may require payment by the agency of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the prevailing party and the Board determines that payment is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or in any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit. <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1980). In contrast, under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), when the Board grants corrective action based on a USERRA violation, it may, in its discretion, award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. <span class="Italic">See Jacobsen v. Department of Justice</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 5 (2006). As noted above, the AJ denied the appellant's request for attorney fees, finding that the appellant failed to satisfy the "prevailing party" and "interest of justice" criteria under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching her conclusion, the AJ found that the language of section 4324(c)(4) did not appear to supersede the requirements of section 7701(g)(1). It is well-settled, however, that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 25 (2005) (applying the specific remedial provision under USERRA rather than the Back Pay Act, which is generally applicable to Board appeals). We can discern no reason to ignore the criteria for an award of attorney fees under section 4324(c)(4), which applies specifically to USERRA cases, and to apply instead the generally applicable language of section 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Jacobsen</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the AJ's finding that the appellant was not a "prevailing party" under section 7701(g)(1), we note that section 4324(c)(4) does not explicitly include a "prevailing party" requirement. Rather, it requires that the Board must have issued an "order" requiring the agency to correct its violation of USERRA. The appellant satisfied this requirement under section 4324(c)(4) because the AJ ordered corrective action in the appellant's USERRA appeal.[*] We further note that section 4324(c)(4), unlike section 7701(g)(1), contains no requirement that the award of attorney fees be in the "interest of justice." Instead, section 4324(c)(4) leaves to the Board's discretion whether to award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant...filed a motion for attorney fees under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), the USERRA attorney fee provision. The administrative judge issued an addendum initial decision denying the appellant's motion for attorney fees. The administrative judge applied the attorney fee criteria under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), and found that the appellant failed to satisfy the "prevailing party" and the "interests of justice" criteria under section 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney fee provisions at issue here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) and 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), are similar in some respects and dissimilar in other respects. Section 7701(g)(1), 5 U.S.C., provides in relevant part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4324(c)(4), 38 U.S.C., provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board pursuant to subsection (b) that such person is entitled to an order referred to in paragraph (2) [which authorizes the Board, upon finding a USERRA violation, to "enter an order" requiring the agency or Office of Personnel Management to comply with the provision violated and to compensate the employee for any loss of wages or benefits], the Board may, in its discretion, award such person reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), the Board may require payment by the agency of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee if the employee is the "prevailing party" and the Board determines that payment is warranted in the "interest of justice," including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or in any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit. <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1980). As noted above, the administrative judge denied the appellant's request for attorney fees, finding that the appellant failed to satisfy the "prevailing party" and the "interest of justice" criteria under section 7701(g)(1). For the reasons discussed below, we find that the administrative judge erred by applying the attorney fee criteria under 7701(g)(1), which are generally applicable to Board appeals, rather than the attorney fee criteria under section 4324(c)(4), which are specifically applicable to USERRA cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying section 7701(g)(1), the administrative judge found that the language of section 4324(c)(4) did not appear to supersede the requirements of section 7701(g)(1). It is well-settled, however, that specific statutory language aimed at a particular situation ordinarily controls over general statutory language. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Department of Justice</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 256, &#x00B6; 25 (2005) (the Board applied the specific remedial provision under USERRA rather than the Back Pay Act, which is generally applicable to Board appeals); <span class="Italic">Carney v. Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System,</span> 64 M.S.P.R. 394, 396 (1994) (statutory provisions dealing with a "narrow, precise, and specific subject" were applied instead of "general" provisions enacted at a different time); <span class="Italic">Hastie v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 64, 75 (1984) (based on accepted principles of statutory construction, the Board declined to apply "broad" and "general" statutory provisions where there was "specific statutory language that bears on the particular issues under consideration"). We can discern no reason to ignore the specifically applicable statutory criteria under section 4324(c)(4) for USERRA cases, and to apply instead the generally applicable statutory criteria under section 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was not a "prevailing party" under section 7701(g)(1), we note that section 4324(c)(4) does not explicitly include a "prevailing party" requirement but, instead, requires that the Board must have issued an "order" requiring the agency to correct its violation of USERRA. The appellant satisfies this requirement under section 4324(c)(4) because the administrative judge ordered corrective action in the appellant's USERRA appeal, as mentioned above. The administrative judge also found that the appellant failed to meet the "interest of justice" requirement under section 7701(g)(1). Section 4324(c)(4) contains no "interest of justice" requirement, however, and we can discern no basis for reading such a requirement into section 4324(c)(4). Instead, section 4324(c)(4) leaves to the Board's discretion whether to award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses. We therefore conclude that the administrative judge erred by denying the appellant's request for attorney fees based on the criteria under section 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Erickson v. USPS</span>, 759 F.3d 1341, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2014), determined that the Federal Circuit lacks authority under USERRA to award fees for time spent in court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Erickson next argues that if the Board lacks authority under USERRA to grant his fee request, this court should grant the award pursuant to USERRA because USERRA is to be construed liberally and because "veterans' statutes are to be resolved" in favor of veterans. Mr. Erickson admits that his "interpretation arguably conflicts with a purely literal reading of [38 <span id="Page_4636"></span>U.S.C.] section 4324(c)(4)'s language that 'the Board' is authorized to award fees." He argues, however, that it would be "untenable" for the court to interpret the statute in such a way that provides "no avenue for a veteran to recover legal fees at the appellate level."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with Mr. Erickson's argument is that this court is not authorized to award attorney fees when it lacks statutory authorization to do so. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. Cir. R. 47.7; <span class="Italic">Gallo v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 725 F.3d 1306, 1308 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("Under Rule 47.7, this court must itself be authorized by law to award attorney fees."). Furthermore, "this court does not derive its authority to award attorney fees from the Board's authority to do so." <span class="Italic">Gallo</span>, 725 F.3d at 1309; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 1308-09 ("[M]erely because this court is authorized to review a tribunal that is statutorily authorized to award attorney fees, does not mean that this court itself is authorized by that same statute to award attorney fees in the first instance....&#8197;For example, the Board in certain circumstances may award attorney fees for work before it when attorney fees are not available under the same statute for work done before this court."). Instead, there must be an independent statutory authorization for the court to award fees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1309. Because no such independent statutory authorization exists under USERRA, the court cannot award attorney fees under USERRA in this case.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">VEOA, 5 USC 3330c(b), provides for a mandatory fee award to a prevailing party:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A preference eligible who prevails in an action under section 3330a or 3330b shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Augustine v. VA</span>, 503 F.3d 1362, 1365-67 (Fed. Cir. 2007), emphasized that a favorable result in a VEOA case mandates counsel fees, subject to a test of reasonableness of their amount:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The AJ further explained that "there are many reasons why the agency may have decided to withdraw its petition for review, and grant the relief provided in the initial decision. For example, it may simply have decided to stop spending scarce resources on lengthy, multi-party litigation that had come to focus on policy issues in which it had no direct interest[.]" The AJ also concluded that the reasonableness of Mr. Chang's fees was adversely impacted by the fact that he did not enter his appearance until five months after he began rendering services to Ms. Augustine. Ms. Augustine did not petition for Board review and the AJ's decision became final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"A preference eligible who prevails in an action under section 3330a or 3330b shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b). In the proceedings below, the AJ interpreted this statute to mean that attorney fees and expenses are unreasonable if (1) success before the Board was not in some way attributable to the efforts of the successful party's attorney, or (2) services were rendered prior to the attorney's entry of appearance before the Board. We reject both of these propositions out of hand as being completely unsupported by the plain language of the statute, which only requires that the fees and expenses be reasonable. Accordingly, we reverse the Board insofar as its decision was based on the AJ's erroneous reading of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to quantum, "[t]he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983);[1] <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a) (requiring that a request for attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b) be supported by "[a]ccurate and current time records," and "[a] statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work"). It goes without saying, of course, that "the number of hours reasonably expended," and therefore the number of hours compensable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b), may only include time spent in furtherance of the claim. Thus, we agree with the government that Mr. Chang's representation of Ms. Augustine on any matters other than her preference-eligible claim is not compensable under this statute. Moreover, "[c]ounsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission." <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Although <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> involved an award of attorney fees to a "prevailing party" under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988(b), the Court explicitly stated that "[t]he standards set forth in this opinion are generally applicable in all cases in which Congress has authorized an award of fees to a 'prevailing party.'" <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433 n.7. The case at bar involves an award of attorney fees to "[a] preference eligible who prevails," which for present purposes is the same as a "prevailing party." Thus, the "standards set forth in [<span class="Italic">Hensley</span>]" are applicable here as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court is ill-suited to the task of determining from Mr. Chang's billing records the amount of time spent in furtherance of the claim or the amount of that time, if any, that might have been "excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary." Nevertheless, we deem it appropriate to provide some general observations about the reasonableness of the request in this case. As a threshold matter, Ms. Augustine's decision to seek assistance of counsel was entirely reasonable regardless of the complexity of the VA's petition for review and the Board's assessment that the VA had presented "strong arguments that the remedy ordered [by the AJ] exceeds the Board's authority." We further note that neither Ms. Augustine nor Mr. Chang could have had any idea that the VA might eventually "decide[&#8197;] to stop spending scarce resources on lengthy, multi-party litigation that had come to focus on policy issues in which it had no direct interest." Thus, irrespective of whether Mr. Chang's efforts--viewed in hindsight--had any actual impact on Ms. Augustine's ultimate success on appeal, it is self-evident that at least a portion (and possibly a substantial portion) of his work was done in furtherance of her claim and was not "excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary." Further, we note that until the Board actually reinstated the AJ's March 14, 2000 decision, Ms. Augustine's case was at risk and her need for counsel was both real and reasonable. As 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(b), unlike many other fee-shifting statutes, makes an award of reasonable fees to a prevailing party mandatory rather than discretionary, the only question on remand is the amount of those fees. The AJ's bases for denying fees, like the government's arguments on appeal in support of the AJ's categorical denial, were not properly grounded in an inquiry of reasonableness. Instead, the AJ made a determination as to whether Ms. Augustine was entitled to any fees at all. The mandatory nature of section 3330c(b) renders that inquiry inappropriate. With these observations, we vacate the order denying fees and expenses, and remand for the AJ to render a quantum decision consistent with this opinion.</p>
