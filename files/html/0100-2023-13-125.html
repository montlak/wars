<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-124"><span class="space">7.</span> Remedy</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Resolving some lower-level and inter-circuit disagreements, the Federal Circuit addressed the problem of what remedy was appropriate when there was an acquittal following an indefinite suspension in <span class="Italic">Wiemers v. MSPB</span>, 792 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The employee was indicted, indefinitely suspended, convicted, and removed for misconduct (not solely for the conviction). The conviction was reversed. The employee unsuccessfully sought to have the Board order back pay for the period of the suspension. The Federal Circuit declined to set aside the Board order:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner contends that "under the holding" of <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), within which he says he "falls squarely," the reversal of his criminal conviction entitles him to reinstatement with back pay. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, two employees were suspended indefinitely following their indictment, the Board upheld the suspension, and the employees sought review of that ruling in the court of appeals. One of the employees was convicted, and following the conviction, he was removed. The other employee was acquitted, and the agency reinstated him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court of appeals held that the agency properly suspended the employees following their indictment on work-related charges, that the acquitted and reinstated employee was entitled to back pay and benefits for the period of suspension, and that the convicted employee was not so entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Brown</span> is distinguishable from the present case on two grounds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, unlike the petitioner in this case, the employees in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> had not been removed on the basis of the underlying conduct upon which the indictment was based. The convicted employee there was removed only after his conviction. Only the acquitted employee who had not been removed was held entitled to reinstatement with back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondly, in holding that the acquitted employee was entitled to back pay for the period of suspension, the court of appeals recognized that in <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 (Ct. Cl. 1976), "the Court of Claims held that an employee lawfully suspended on the basis of his indictment on job-related charges was not entitled to back pay upon his acquittal and reinstatement by the agency," but declined to follow that decision. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 715 F.2d at 669. In this court, however, <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, and not <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, is the controlling precedent. <span class="Italic">South Corp. v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982). Under <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, the reversal of the petitioner's conviction did not entitle him to back pay for any part of the period of suspension.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 607, 609 (1991) (when an employee indefinitely suspended for having his security clearance investigated and who subsequently had the clearance reinstated, the Board held: "An indefinite suspension based on an indictment that was proper when effected but was later dismissed, or that ultimately resulted in the acquittal of the appellant on the criminal charges, does not require the reversal of the appellant's indefinite suspension and the award of back pay for the period of the suspension[.]"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (recognizing but accepting the "harsh" result of the deprivation of back pay during a period of indefinite suspension); <span class="Italic">Shaffer v. DLA</span>, 35 MSPR 664, 667-68 (1987) (no entitlement to back pay for the period of a suspension while an indictment, later dismissed, was pending against the appellant); <span class="Italic">Torres v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 655, 661 (1987) (although a portion of the indefinite suspension was properly imposed, and no back pay would be awarded for that time, the suspension was improperly continued and back pay was required for the period of that continuation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wiemers</span> was reaffirmed, <span class="Italic">Callahan v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1990 NP No. 89-3231):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the issue of back pay for the period of suspension, it was established in <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, 533 F.2d at 544, that acquittal following trial of the criminal charge did not give rise to an entitlement to back pay during the period of suspension. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Wiemers v. MSPB</span>, 792 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (reversal of a conviction did not give rise to a right to back pay). Callahan points out that withdrawal of the indictment reinforces his position that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. However, having established that the action of suspension was warranted, the ensuing withdrawal of the indictment by the United States Attorney, independent of the Postal Service, did not give rise to an obligation of the Postal Service for back pay during the period in which the indictment was in effect. The decision of the Board is in accordance with precedent: for having established that the Postal Service was justified in suspending Mr. Callahan because of the indictment, there arises no controlling distinction between termination of the suspension by acquittal and termination by withdrawal of the indictment. In neither case is the suspension, proper when entered into, converted into an "unjustified" personnel action....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Initially, the Board, like the Court of Claims, had difficulty deciding what to do for the employee whose indefinite suspension terminated as a result of an acquittal. Under <span class="Italic">Martin v. Customs Serv.</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 17, 10 MSPB 568 (1982), indefinite suspensions are not based on provable misconduct, but on examination into the misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 260, 262 n.1 (1984). An indefinite suspension could be found to have been reasonably imposed even though facts developed later caused the Board to find that an agency acted unreasonably in failing or refusing to vacate the action. A subsequent acquittal would not demonstrate that an indefinite suspension was unjustified if, after a full review of the facts and circumstances, the indefinite suspension was found to have been reasonably imposed and maintained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Brown v. DOJ</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">Novak v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 135, 136 (1984), determined that the appellant was entitled to back pay for the period of an indefinite suspension when the appellant was acquitted of the criminal charges against him. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 521, 530 n.4 (1984), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has determined that an employee's indefinite suspension based solely on the fact of his or her indictment on duty-related charges is a conditional adverse action which must be justified by institution of a removal action based on misconduct provable by the agency following the employee's acquittal of the criminal charges. If such a removal action is not effected subsequent to the employee's acquittal, the suspension action will be proved to be unjustified and the employee is entitled to correction of the suspension action. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">but</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States</span>, 533 F.2d 538 (Ct.

<p class="Body-Text">Under earlier law, the Board clarified the appellant's status in <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 458, 461 (1984), concluding that if the indictment is dismissed, the agency must either pursue an adverse action or vacate the indefinite suspension and provide the employee his back pay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Morse v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 25 MSPR 346, 348 (1984) (following <span class="Italic">Covarrubias</span>: an employee was entitled to back pay when he was acquitted of a charge leading to an indefinite suspension and the agency neither offered independent proof of misconduct nor sought to remove appellant or take other disciplinary action); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Berrios v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 458, 459 (1984) (result was the same as <span class="Italic">Morse</span>). To allow a reinstated employee to recover back pay for the period of the suspension was not to hold that the suspension was unlawful from the beginning; rather, the suspension proved to be unjustified by the agency's later failure to institute adverse action proceedings based on the alleged underlying misconduct. <span class="Italic">Torres v. Customs Serv.</span>, 30 MSPR 315, 319 (1986). The law changed and assumed its present state with the 1986 <span class="Italic">Wiemers</span> decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under more recent law, if the condition of termination of the indefinite suspension is only the resolution of criminal charges and not resolution of adverse action charges, back pay runs from the date of the termination of the criminal proceedings (although under <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990), and similar decisions, the agency has a reasonable period of time following the termination of the criminal proceedings to determine whether to pursue adverse action). <span class="Italic">Newbold v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 58 MSPR 532, 535-36 (1993), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Where an agency has relied solely on an indictment to establish its original reasonable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and the only condition subsequent is the resolution of the criminal charges, it is unreasonable to continue an indefinite suspension as of the date of the indictment's dismissal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lund v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 41 MSPR 115, 119 (1989). By contrast, in cases where there are two conditions subsequent, i.e., the resolution of the criminal charges and the resolution of any further proposed adverse action deemed appropriate, the Board has recognized that an indefinite suspension may be continued where the employing agency moves expeditiously to initiate an adverse action as of the date of the indictment's dismissal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 35 MSPR 669, 671-72 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has not alleged that the two-day delay in reinstating the appellant after the date of his acquittal was due to any considerations involving the initiation of an additional adverse action. Rather, the agency contends that, since the judge dismissed the indictment on January 19, 1993, without advance notice to the agency, the agency acted reasonably when it reinstated the appellant as of January 22, 1993, the date that it received his notification that the charges against him had been dismissed. The issue, however, is not one of notice. As found in <span class="Italic">Lund</span> and <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, where the only cause of action disappears once the indictment is dismissed, the suspension must end as of that day.[3] Therefore, we find that the indefinite suspension should have been terminated as of the date of the dismissal of the indictment and that the appellant is thus entitled to back pay from January 19, 1993, the day of dismissal, through January 22, 1993. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In some of our prior cases, we have ordered the termination of the indefinite suspension, and the appellant's return to duty, as of the day following the dismissal of the indictment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hofmann v.

We now find, however, that the proper rule is that the indefinite suspension should be terminated, and the employee reinstated, as of the date of the indictment's dismissal because, as discussed herein, there is simply no basis for continuation of the suspension as of that time, in the absence of any decision by the agency to initiate an additional adverse action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jarvis v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 104, 112 (1990); <span class="Italic">Lund v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 41 MSPR 115, 119 (1989); <span class="Italic">Hernandez v.

<p class="Body-Text">That back pay is not mandated for the period between the onset of a suspension and an acquittal does not mean that an agency may not allow back pay. When an employee who was summarily suspended was acquitted and reinstated, the agency was neither required to make, nor precluded from making, the reinstatement with back pay retroactive to the date of the suspension. The decision is for the agency, in the first instance, based on all the facts and circumstances. If back pay is denied, the denial is then subject to judicial review by the Court of Federal Claims or by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">Richardson v. Customs Serv.</span>, 47 F.3d 415, 417-22 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (<span class="Italic">but see Read v. United States,</span> <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts are not in dispute. In 1990, petitioners Edward Richardson and Lorenzo Mosely, Customs Inspectors for the United States Customs Service (the Agency), shared an apartment in Miami. Apparently thinking a postman was an intruder, Richardson went to the door of the apartment with a gun. Both petitioners were later arrested and both were <span id="Page_2179"></span>subsequently indicted under 18 USC &#x00A7; 111 for assault on a federal officer. The Agency suspended them for an indefinite period without pay based upon the fact of their indictment. Both petitioners were tried before a jury and acquitted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency thereafter reinstated petitioners with pay, effective beginning with the date of their acquittal. The Agency denied their claim "to be re-instated with back pay, overtime and benefits which would have accrued from the time of the indefinite suspension." With the support of the National Treasury Employees Union, petitioners sought arbitration of their dispute with the Agency as provided under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(e). Petitioners claimed reinstatement with pay for the entire period of their suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator recognized that there was an apparent split among the circuits over the question of whether an employee is entitled to reinstatement with pay under these circumstances. Reading the law of this circuit as against such relief, the arbitrator denied the grievance. Petitioners bring their grievance here. As the parties do not dispute the facts of this case, only a question of law is before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners' grievance is based on the theory that the suspension imposed by the Agency was invalid, and that they were entitled to full reinstatement with pay. Their point is that an indefinite suspension without pay, based on the issuance of an indictment, is a "conditional" suspension. In order ultimately to be justified, say petitioners, the suspension must ripen into a termination action. Absent that, the suspension itself becomes unjustified and a violation of the employee's rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Chapter 75, Title 5, United States Code, specifies a range of adverse personnel actions which a federal agency may take against an employee. Subchapter II, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-14, lists certain adverse actions by an agency that trigger particular procedural protections available to the employee. Included in that group is suspension for more than 14 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A related section, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701, provides, on petition by an employee, for review of agency adverse action decisions by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), and section &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) authorizes review by an arbitrator if the union's negotiated grievance procedure so provides. In either case, the exclusive forum for appeal is this court<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703 (for MSPB cases); 5 USC &#x00A7; 7121(f) (for arbitration cases). Both the petitioners and the Government base the jurisdiction of this court to hear this appeal on 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7703 and 7121(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners' theory regarding the "conditional" nature of the suspension in this case finds authority in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice</span>, 715 F.2d 662 (D.C. Cir. 1983), which provides the legal underpinning upon which petitioners framed their claim. It was also the theory the arbitrator accepted to characterize the issue before him. The arbitrator viewed the case as "a common arbitration scenario," raising the question "whether the employer had 'just cause' to suspend the employee even though he was later found not guilty." <span class="Italic">In re United States Customs Serv.,</span> available on Westlaw LRR-LA database, LEXIS Labor library, LRRLA file at *4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we will explain, there are now conflicting views among the courts regarding how these summary suspension cases should be analyzed, of which <span class="Italic">Brown</span> is one. Although we analyze the case somewhat differently than do either of the parties, and ultimately we reject the theory of <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, petitioners stated a cause of action that unquestionably brings their case within the ambit of Subchapter II. The arbitrator had jurisdiction under &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1) to entertain their complaint; this court has jurisdiction to hear and decide an appeal from the decision of the arbitrator under the present circumstances.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;As a result of this opinion, which rejects the theory of the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> case, it will no longer be possible in cases of this type to lay jurisdiction under Subchapter II based on that theory. <span class="Italic">Accord, Richardson v. United States,</span> 468 U.S. 317, 326 n.6, 104 S. Ct. 3081, 3086 n.6, 82 L. Ed.2d 242 (1984), holding that, contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals in that case, the trial court had jurisdiction to entertain the cause, but that, as a result of the Court's decision on the merits, jurisdiction would no longer lie for future claims brought in the same manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under ordinary circumstances, a federal employee against whom an agency proposes to take an adverse personnel action under Subchapter II is entitled to: (i) 30 days' advance written notice of the proposed action; (ii) an opportunity to contest the action; (iii) opportunity to be represented by counsel; and (iv) a written, reasoned decision. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b). There is, however, a special provision applicable when suspicion of a crime is at issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;An employee against whom an action is proposed is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;at least 30 days' advance written notice, unless there is reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, stating the specific reasons for the proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That is all the statute has to say on the subject of suspensions based solely on allegations of serious crime. The statute does not say what constitutes "reasonable cause"; it does not say how long a suspension may stay in place; it does not say what triggers its termination. And it does not say what actions must be taken when such a suspension is terminated. Indeed, the statute provides mostly negative inferences, its affirmative role being simply to provide an exception to only one of the rights--30 days' advance written notice--available to an employee before an adverse action under Subchapter II may be taken.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the paucity of Congressional direction, courts of necessity have filled in some of the missing parts. The clause is read as establishing an independent standard for a limited adverse action: an indictment for a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed will, as a general rule, provide reasonable cause for an agency to believe that the employee has committed such a crime, and, when the nature of the crime alleged relates to the employee's ability to perform his or her duties, an agency may summarily suspend the employee, without pay, pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pararas-Carayannis v. Department of Commerce</span>, 9 F.3d 955 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Department of the Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572 (Fed. Cir. 1990)<span class="Italic">. See also Thomas v. General Servs. Admin.</span>, 756 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 474 U.S. 843, 106 S. Ct. 129, 88 L. Ed.2d 106 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While such a summary suspension may be indefinite, it is not unlimited. When the criminal justice system has arrived at its conclusion, the agency must terminate the suspension within a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156 (summary suspension "must be terminated within a reasonable time following resolution of the criminal charges"); <span class="Italic">Engdahl</span>, 900 F.2d at 1578 (delay in terminating summary suspension was reasonable under the circumstances).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus it can be seen that, while the statute is silent on many of the consequences related to a summary suspension under the special clause found in &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), the courts have filled in some of the blanks. One of the blanks, the issue involved here, namely under what circumstances, if any, may an employee be entitled to reinstatement with pay to a date earlier than the date of acquittal, has been filled in with somewhat inconsistent, if not conflicting, results.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two cases are cited by the parties as dispositive of the issue before us: <span class="Italic">Jankowitz v. United States,</span> 533 F.2d 538, 209 Ct. Cl. 489 (1976), decided in 1976 by our predecessor court, the Court of Claims, and upon which the Government bases its position; and <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice,</span> 715 F.2d 662, mentioned earlier, decided in 1983 by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit), upon which petitioners stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, the petitioner, an employee of the Federal Housing Administration was indicted for bribery and suspended by the agency. He was later acquitted of all charges in a jury trial, and restored to duty. The Government agreed he was entitled to reinstatement with back pay for the period between his acquittal and his restoration to duty, but denied reinstatement with back pay for the time he was suspended prior to acquittal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jankowitz then brought suit for the withheld back pay in the Court of Claims, basing his suit on the Back Pay Act of 1966, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596 (1970). The Court of Claims denied his claim. "[T]he Back Pay Act of 1966 authorizes us to make such an award only where it appears that the plaintiff has undergone 'an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action.'" <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, 533 F.2d at 541-42, quoting 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596(b) (1970). "Since we find that the Government in fact followed applicable procedural recommendations and safeguards..., we do not agree that plaintiff's indefinite suspension without pay was either unjustified or unwarranted. This much of plaintiff's claim for back pay must fail." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 544.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> is read by the Government as establishing the rule that reinstatement with back pay for the period of the suspension that was prior to an acquittal <span class="Italic">never</span> can be made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of Justice,</span> one of two indicted and suspended individuals was subsequently acquitted, and was then reinstated by the agency. The employee challenged the agency's right to suspend on the basis of an indictment alone. The MSPB upheld the agency. The employee appealed to the D.C. Circuit. That court held that the initial suspension on the basis of an indictment was proper, but went on to order that, following the acquittal, back pay must be paid to the date the suspension is imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court described a summary suspension based solely on the fact of an employee's indictment as <span class="Italic">sui generis,</span> and a "conditional" adverse action. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 715 F.2d at 669. "[I]n order to be ultimately 'justified' for purposes of applying the Back Pay Act, the suspension must ripen into a termination action based on misconduct provable by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court noted the contrary result reached by the Court of Claims in <span id="Page_2180"></span><span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, but concluded that "the Court of Claims failed to appreciate the realities of the situation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners read <span class="Italic">Brown</span> as establishing the rule that reinstatement with pay to the date of the summary suspension must <span class="Italic">always</span> be granted when the employee has been acquitted of the charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the Government in its reading of <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> and petitioners in their reading of <span class="Italic">Brown</span> strive to find a clear decisional rule in a situation in which Congress has given no guidance. Either absolute rule, denying in every case retroactive reinstatement with pay to the date of the summary suspension, or granting it in every case, seems equally arbitrary. Although choosing arbitrary rules is a privilege available to Congress, and in some circumstances to administrative agencies, courts seek to find a principled basis for preferring one rule over the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not find persuasive the notion of making the special summary suspension under &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) a "conditional" adverse action. We find no basis in the statute for that theory, and it seems to add yet another complication to an already convoluted field. But neither do we find acceptable the Government's view of <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, since it denies, without Congressional sanction, an employee's entitlement to remuneration in circumstances in which it may be warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Five years after deciding <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>, the Court of Claims decided <span class="Italic">Summers v. United States,</span> 648 F.2d 1324, 227 Ct. Cl. 353 (1981). The court in <span class="Italic">Summers</span> rejected this all-or-nothing approach. The agency had chosen to reinstate and to pay the suspended-and-later-acquitted employee effective with the date of the initial suspension, not just to the date of acquittal. The agency paid the employee the base pay that had been withheld, but denied him the premium overtime pay he claimed he would otherwise have earned. When the employee sued on a Back Pay Act claim for the overtime pay, the Government changed its mind about reinstatement with pay back to the date of the suspension, and counterclaimed for the base pay that had been paid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government relied on <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> for the proposition that a suspension based solely on the fact of indictment does not constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action and so does not permit reinstatement with an award of back pay to the date of suspension. The Court of Claims rejected that narrow a reading of its <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> opinion. The court stated: "[The Government] misreads our opinion [in <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span>] .... It does <span class="Italic">not</span> mean that if the agency <span class="Italic">had</span> given Jankowitz back pay for the suspension period that <span class="Italic">that</span> action would necessarily have been reversible.... [A]gencies have a certain amount of discretion to determine that an employee has undergone an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action even though a court would not require such a determination." <span class="Italic">Summers</span>, 648 F.2d at 1329-30 (emphasis in original). The court denied the Government's counterclaim, holding that the exercise of discretion by the agency in making the payment "was made reasonably and without reversible error." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 648 F.2d at 1330.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, petitioners' suit must fail in so far as it seeks relief through a challenge to the initial summary suspension. Petitioners alleged, not that the agency failed initially to have reasonable grounds to suspend under the summary suspension provision, but that the grounds for suspension disappeared as a result of the later acquittal. This is the theory of the <span class="Italic">Brown</span> case, and, as indicated above, we expressly reject that theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> establishes that an employee suspended under the special summary suspension provision of &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1), but later acquitted and reinstated, is not entitled <span class="Italic">as a matter</span> <span class="Italic">of right</span> to full back pay for the period of the suspension. The summary suspension, if properly invoked, is not made invalid by a later determination that the alleged criminal conduct was not conclusively established. However, the argument that <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> <span class="Italic">precludes</span> an agency from granting back pay for the entire period of the suspension is incorrect in light of the decision in <span class="Italic">Summers</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Summers</span> establishes that, in appropriate circumstances, an agency <span class="Italic">may</span> grant back pay for the period during which the summary suspension was in effect. Reading this court's precedents in <span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> and <span class="Italic">Summers</span> together, we conclude that the rule is, when an employee who has been suspended under the summary suspension provision is acquitted and subsequently reinstated, the agency is neither required to nor precluded from making the reinstatement with back pay retroactive to the date of the suspension. That decision is a matter for the agency, in the first instance, to make, based on all the facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jankowitz/Summers</span> and basic administrative law principles tell us something further. The agency's decision is cabined by a reviewable standard. Section 701 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 701, provides that federal agency actions are subject to judicial review except where there is a statutory prohibition on review or where "agency action is committed to agency discretion by law." There is nothing to suggest that Congress sought to prohibit judicial review, and nothing to indicate that this case falls within the very narrow exception for action "committed to agency discretion." <span class="Italic">See Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe</span>, 401 U.S. 402, 91 S. Ct. 814, 28 L. Ed.2d 136 (1971); <span class="Italic">accord</span>, <span class="Italic">Summers</span>, 648 F.2d at 1330.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue in this case, then, is whether the agency, in the exercise of its discretion, properly declined to reinstate these employees with pay effective with a date prior to the date of their acquittal. When, as here, the summary suspension is based on an indictment for a crime of which the employee is acquitted, the date of the acquittal clearly marks a date at which the agency no longer can maintain that it has reasonable grounds for summary suspension. The reason for the summary suspension disappears at that point, and, absent separate administrative proceedings on which to base an independent adverse action, the employees are entitled to reinstatement with pay as of that time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision the agency must make is whether the reinstatement with pay is to be made effective on the date of acquittal or on a date earlier than that. That administrative decision is a discretionary one, based on all the facts and circumstances. It is subject, as are discretionary administrative decisions generally, to the statutory standard that agency action may not be "unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed," and that agency action may not be "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." Administrative Procedure Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 706; <span class="Italic">see also,</span> <span class="Italic">Securities and Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 318 U.S. 80, 94, 63 S. Ct. 454, 462, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943) ("the orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustained").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Jankowitz</span> and <span class="Italic">Summers</span> establish that, in an appropriate case, a proper forum for testing the agency decision is the Court of Federal Claims in a Tucker Act suit based on the Back Pay Act, 5 USC &#x00A7; 5596. An agency decision regarding reinstatement that was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law would appear to be also "an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). The appropriate forum in some cases may be arbitration under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs,</span> 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whatever the case, the relief to which these petitioners may be entitled is back pay, relief that in absence of a statutory adverse action cannot be awarded in a Subchapter II proceeding. Accordingly, the decision of the arbitrator is vacated, and the cause is remanded to the arbitrator for such further proceedings as are consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richardson</span> was summarized by the Board in <span class="Italic">Czubinski v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 76 MSPR 552, 557 n.2 (1997) (reversing a removal based on criminal conviction subsequently overturned in courts):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that an agency is not precluded from granting back pay for the period of the indefinite suspension under these circumstances. However, "[t]hat decision is a matter for the agency, in the first instance, to make, based on all the facts and circumstances." <span class="Italic">Richardson v. U.S. Customs Service,</span> 47 F.3d 415, 421 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The proper forum for testing the agency's decision on back pay is the United States Court of Federal Claims in a Tucker Act suit based on the Back Pay Act, or in some cases arbitration under the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 422.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Read v. United States</span>, 254 F.3d 1064, 1066-68 (Fed. Cir. 2001), not citing <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, determined that the jurisdiction of the Board over the removal of federal employees, despite a lack of authority to override a security clearance loss, precluded Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction to consider a back pay remedy upon an agency-initiated restoration of a clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596, upon which Read grounds his suit, provides in pertinent part that "[a]n employee...who, on the basis of a timely appeal or an administrative determination...is found by appropriate authority...to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action which has resulted in the withdrawal...of...pay...is entitled, on the correction of the personnel action, to receive [back pay.] " 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5596(b)(1). The parties vigorously dispute whether under that language (1) the revocation of a security clearance may constitute a "personnel action" and (2) the Personal Security Review Board or the district court constitutes "appropriate authority." It is unnecessary for us to decide those issues, however, since there is a more basic reason why the Court of Federal Claims did not have jurisdiction over Read's back pay claim: under <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto,</span> 484 U.S. 439 (1988), only the Merit Systems Protection Board, and not the Court of Federal Claims, is authorized to review removals of federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fausto,</span> the United States Claims Court (as the Court of Federal Claims formerly was named), held that it did not have jurisdiction over a suit under the Back Pay Act by a federal employee seeking back pay for the period he was allegedly improperly suspended by his agency for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. This court upheld the Claims Court's jurisdiction, but the Supreme Court reversed. It pointed out that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (Reform Act) "creat[ed] an elaborate 'new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against [federal employees].' It prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies <span id="Page_2181"></span>applicable to such action, including the availability of administrative and judicial review. No provision of the CSRA gives nonpreference members of the excepted service [as Fausto was] the right to administrative or judicial review of suspension for misconduct. The question we face is whether that withholding of remedy was meant to preclude judicial review for those employees, or rather merely to leave them free to pursue the remedies that had been available before enactment of the CSRA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 443-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court, disagreeing with this court's conclusion, ruled that the "exclusion of nonpreference members of the excepted service from the definitional sections of Chapter 75" that specify the employees entitled to challenge before the Board adverse actions against them taken for the "efficiency of the service," "displays a clear congressional intent to deny the excluded employees the protections of Chapter 75--including judicial review--for personnel action covered by that chapter." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 446-47. The Court concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The CSRA established a comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees. Its deliberate exclusion of employees in respondent's service category from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action of the sort at issue here prevents respondent from seeking review in the Claims Court under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fausto</span> thus established that if the Reform Act gave the Board jurisdiction over a claim involving a specified subject matter or category of employee, the Claims Court had no jurisdiction over that claim under the Back Pay Act--even though in the particular case the employee could not assert the claim before the Board. The same principle covers the present case and requires the same conclusion: the Court of Federal Claims did not have jurisdiction over Read's back pay suit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Read's claim for back pay is based upon his removal from his job, since it was that action that resulted in the termination of his pay. Although the removal was based upon the revocation of Read's security clearance, that does not change the basic nature of his back pay claim as based upon his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Reform Act covers the "removal" of an employee, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), and such an employee may appeal his removal to the Board, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v. United States,</span> 50 F.3d 1025, 1029 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Under the Reform Act, "qualifying employees who are removed based on unacceptable performance or for the efficiency of the service" may appeal to the Board.); <span class="Italic">Bosco v. United States,</span> 931 F.2d 879, 883 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (the adverse actions the Reform Act covers include "removal"). Here, as in <span class="Italic">Fausto,</span> the Reform Act's "comprehensive system for reviewing personnel action taken against federal employees," 484 U.S. at 455,--including "administrative review by the MSPB," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 447--"displays a clear congressional intent," <span class="Italic">id.,</span> to make Board review the exclusive statutory procedure by which employees may challenge their removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> the Court concluded that Congress had "deliberate[ly] exclud[ed] ...employees in respondent's service category from the provisions establishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action of the sort at issue here [which] prevents respondent from seeking review in the Claims Court under the Back Pay Act."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 455. Here, however, Read was not excluded from challenging his removal before the Board. In fact, he did so challenge it, the Board reviewed his removal and upheld it, and we affirmed that ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, in reviewing that removal the Board could not, and did not, consider the merits of the revocation of his security clearance (upon which his removal was based), although it considered other issues related to the revocation. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518. This limitation on the issues the Board could consider, however, is not inconsistent with the power Congress gave the Board in the Reform Act to review removal of government employees for the good of the service (as the Board noted Read's removal was). <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> establishes that the existence of the Board's jurisdiction to take such action precludes the Court of Federal Claims from entertaining Read's back pay suit based upon his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our analysis here is consistent with--indeed, is supported by--<span class="Italic">Worthington v. United States,</span> 168 F.3d 24 (Fed. Cir. 1999). There we held that the Court of Federal Claims erroneously had dismissed Worthington's claim for overtime pay under the Back Pay Act. The claim was based on his being required to work a compressed work schedule of more than eight hours on certain days. The reason for our conclusion was that the Reform Act did not give the Board jurisdiction over Worthington's underlying claim that he had improperly been required to follow a compressed work schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so ruling, however, we noted that "Fausto deprives the Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction over personnel actions covered by the CSRA." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 26. Here, as we have shown, the Reform Act gave the Board jurisdiction over Read's challenge to his removal resulting from revocation of his security clearance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Salinas v. United States</span>, 323 F.3d 1047, 1049-50 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Richardson</span>, determined that the Court of Federal Claims properly declined to review and overturn the agency decision against a discretionary award of back pay to an employee who was indefinitely suspended as a result of an indictment and who was then acquitted and restored to duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Salinas did not seek relief from the Board, we do not know whether the Board would have entertained his complaint for back pay. Although Salinas states that he "is not contesting whether or not the Agency had authority to suspend Appellant upon his indictment," he could have challenged before the Board his suspension to the extent it permitted his reinstatement without back pay. We cannot say whether the Board would have accepted that theory of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> and <span class="Italic">Read</span> establish that "if the Reform Act gave the Board jurisdiction over a claim involving a specified subject matter or category of employee, the Claims Court had no jurisdiction over that claim under the Back Pay Act--even though in the particular case the employee could not assert the claim before the Board." <span class="Italic">Read</span>, 254 F.3d at 1067. Under the statutory scheme of the Civil Service Reform Act, it may be that the decision whether to award back pay lies in the agency's sole discretion and that there is no forum in which Salinas can challenge that decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Richardson v. U.S. Customs Serv.,</span> 47 F.3d 415, 421 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("[I]n appropriate circumstances, an agency may grant back pay for the period during which the summary suspension was in effect.... That decision is a matter for the agency, in the first instance, to make, based on all the facts and circumstances." (footnote omitted)). In any event, even assuming the Board could review and overturn the decision against a discretionary award of back pay, we are sure the Court of Federal Claims may not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency's discretion to award back pay for a period of an indefinite suspension, following the employee's return to duty, may be exercised through a collective bargaining contract. In <span class="Italic">Ricketts v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 257, 260-61 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (2003), the Board ordered a remand for application of a provision of a negotiated agreement that required the employer to provide back pay to an employee for the period that an indefinite suspension exceeded 70 days, if the employer decided to return the employee to pay status after resolution of criminal charges and if the employee was otherwise available for duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an agency cancel an indefinite suspension following an employee's appeal, the employee should be restored to the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>, that is, the employee should be returned to pay status. If, however, the employee has not been available for work due to incarceration during a portion of the suspension, the employee will not be entitled to back pay for that period of time. <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 453, 456-57 (1996) (overruled as to the ability of a party to file a petition for enforcement after an appeal has been dismissed as moot, <span class="Italic">Haskins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HASKINS_BETTY_J_AT_3443_06_0730_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_289996.pdf">106 MSPR 616</a>, 2007 MSPB 234 (2007)), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n order to be entitled to back pay, it is the appellant's burden to prove that he was ready, willing, and able to perform the duties of his position at all relevant times. If the appellant was unavailable for duty for reasons unrelated to the agency's personnel action, the agency is relieved of its obligation to provide back pay for that period. <span class="Italic">Winslow v. Department of the Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 246, 250 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 935 F.2d 280 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant was unavailable for duty during the time he was incarcerated, and the agency is not required to provide him back pay for that time. <span class="Italic">See id.; Marshall v. Government</span> <span class="Italic">Printing Office,</span> 37 MSPR 349, 351 (1988); <span class="Italic">Poe v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 22 MSPR 506, 509 (1984). The appellant's incarceration resulted not from any reason related to the agency's suspension action, but rather from his criminal activity. <span class="Italic">Winslow,</span> 46 MSPR at 250; <span class="Italic">Poe,</span> 22 MSPR at 509. While he could have secured his release from custody by posting a bond, he chose not to do so. The appellant's mother's testimony that she would have posted a bond for his release if he had not been suspended is purely speculative. It changes neither the fact that the appellant remained incarcerated, nor the fact that his incarceration resulted from his criminal misconduct rather than from the agency's suspension action. <span class="Italic">See Huettner v. Department of the Army</span>, 54 MSPR 472, 474 (1992) (agency's refusal to participate in work release program did not make it responsible for the appellant's unavailability for duty while he was incarcerated); <span class="Italic">Poe</span>, 22 MSPR at 509 (same); <span class="Italic">Abrams v.

Accordingly, the appellant was not ready, willing, and able to work during that time<span class="Italic">. Marshall,</span> 37 MSPR at 351; <span class="Italic">cf.
