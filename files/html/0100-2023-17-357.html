<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-355"><span class="space">d.</span> Protection of Union Officials' Conduct</h5>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may direct the agency to cease and desist from improperly disciplining or otherwise harassing or retaliating against union lead counsel and her technical assistants. The award does not attempt to protect unknown and unnamed employees who have not filed grievances. <span class="Italic">AFGE and SSA</span>, 29 FLRA 1568, 1573 (1987). But an individual's status as a union representative does not shield him from the consequences of his conduct prior to (or during) meetings with management. "The Statute does not protect all conduct by employees acting as union representatives, nor does it preclude an agency from taking disciplinary actions in appropriate circumstances against employees who are acting in their union capacity." <span class="Italic">VAMC and AFGE Local 2207</span>, 32 FLRA 777, 780-81 (1988). FLRA set aside an award canceling disciplinary action against a union official who, in FLRA's judgment, exceeded the bounds of permissible conduct as a union representative. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Tinker AFB and AFGE 916</span>, 35 FLRA 1146, 1151 (1990) (union official on 100% official time was not immune from discipline).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA set aside an award that sustained discipline resulting from statutorily protected activities, <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker AFB and AFGE Local 916</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 388-91 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Management's right to take disciplinary action under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute includes the right to discipline a union representative for activities which "are not specifically on behalf of the exclusive representative or which exceed boundaries of protected activities such as flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California and Long Beach Naval Station, Long Beach, California</span>, 25 FLRA 1002, 1005 (1987). An arbitration award which sustains discipline for conduct which is protected under the Statute is deficient because the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Overseas Federation of Teachers and Department of Defense Dependents Schools, Mediterranean Region</span>, 21 FLRA 757 (1986)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The conduct for which the grievant was disciplined occurred while the grievant was serving copies of unfair labor practice charges filed by the Union on the Activity supervisors who were named in the charges....&#8197;[T]he Agency argues that the grievant's failure to comply with a clear order of a police officer while the grievant was attempting to serve copies of the unfair labor practice charges constituted insubordination and, therefore, was not protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A refusal to comply with a management directive constitutes insubordination....&#8197;A refusal to comply with an order may also be referred to as "self-help."...&#8197;The Authority does not condone an employee's refusal to comply with orders....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's assertion that because the grievant's actions constituted insubordination, the actions cannot be protected under the Statute. Because the grievant was disciplined for activities he performed on behalf of the Union, the issue is not merely whether the grievant was insubordinate. It must be determined whether the grievant's actions constituted flagrant misconduct: whether the actions were "of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature to remove them from the protection of the Statute[.]"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the grievant's actions were not of such an outrageous and insubordinate nature so as to remove him from the protection of the Statute. The grievant explained to the supervisors and security officers who questioned him that he was...serving...charges, an activity protected by the Statute. There is no basis in the record on which to conclude that the grievant was impolite, antagonistic, or disrespectful in his refusal to leave the work area. Although we do not condone the grievant's conduct, we are not persuaded that the grievant's refusal to immediately obey the order to depart was so insubordinate as to constitute flagrant misconduct....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant's activity was protected by the Statute. Therefore, the grievant may not be disciplined for that activity....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2595 and DHS, C&#x0026;BP Yuma</span>, 68 FLRA 293, 295-97 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), vacated an award as contrary to law that sustained suspension of a union official who, during a conversation with a supervisor over official time, tossed or threw a timesheet on the floor of the supervisor's office. The activity--speaking about official time--was union business and protected activity. The action--tossing the timesheet--was not flagrant misconduct. The discipline violated the union official's right to engage in protected activity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that an agency may discipline a union representative for conduct occurring during protected activity if the conduct exceeds the boundaries of protected activity.[36] In <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span>, the Authority set forth four factors "to be considered in striking the balance" between protected activity that "allow[s] leeway for impulsive behavior," and flagrant misconduct that "imping[es] upon the [Agency's] right to maintain order."[37] These factors include: (1) the place and subject matter of the discussion; (2) whether the employee's conduct was impulsive or designed; 3) whether the conduct was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct; and (4) the nature of the intemperate language or conduct.[38] Additionally, the Authority determines whether conduct exceeds the boundaries of protected activity on a case-by-case basis and based on the totality of the circumstances.[39]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with our finding that the grievant was engaged in protected activity when he met with his supervisor, it is necessary to apply the <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factors to his conduct at the meeting.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The place and subject matter of the discussion between the grievant and his supervisor support finding that the grievant's conduct is protected.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the first <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers the place and subject matter of the discussion.[40] Regarding "place," the Authority has repeatedly held that conduct that disrupts the work unit jeopardizes "the employer's right to maintain order and respect for its supervisory staff on the jobsite."[41] Here, the "one-on-one" meeting occurred in the supervisor's office. Although voices were raised, no other employees witnessed or overheard the dialogue between the supervisor and the grievant.[42] To borrow words from the dissent, the meeting occurred "behind closed doors" and was "removed from the immediate workplace."As a result, the event "did not have any direct impact on workplace discipline."[44]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Regarding "subject matter," because the purpose of the meeting was to review the grievant's official-time form, the "subject matter of the discussion was within the scope of the [grievant's] legitimate concerns."[45] Specifically, the discussion concerned not only the grievant's right to official time under the parties' agreement but also his pursuit of that right.[46] Thus, the subject matter implicated both statutory and contractual rights.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that application of the first <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor supports a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The impulsive character of the grievant's conduct supports finding the conduct protected.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the second <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers whether the grievant's conduct was impulsive or designed.[47] The Arbitrator's factual findings support the conclusion that the grievant's conduct was impulsive. The Arbitrator found that the grievant tossed or threw the timesheet on the floor in response to his supervisor's request for the timesheet. Thus, the exchange that culminated in the timesheet incident was part of a conversation initiated by the supervisor. In these circumstances, the grievant's ability to plan--or design--his conduct during the timesheet-incident was limited.[49] Rather, the Arbitrator's findings support the conclusion that the grievant's conduct was impulsive. Accordingly, we find that application of the second <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor supports a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2367"></span>Applying the third <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers whether the conduct at issue was in any way provoked by the employer's conduct.[50] Because the Arbitrator's findings are not particularly helpful in applying this factor to the timesheet incident, this factor does not offer significant assistance in determining whether the grievant's conduct during the timesheet incident exceeded the boundaries of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[50]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Defense Mapping</span>,17 FLRA at 81.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The nature of the grievant's conduct supports finding that the conduct is protected.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the fourth <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factor, the Authority considers the nature of the language or conduct.[51] One of the Authority's considerations is whether the conduct in question was brief or prolonged.[52] In this case, the grievant's conduct was brief. Whether the grievant "tossed" or "flick[ed]" his timesheet, the Arbitrator found that the grievant retrieved the timesheet "[p]erhaps a minute later." The incident, therefore, was brief.[54]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 64 FLRA at 414.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also examines tone of voice, physical contact, and threats of violence.[55] As applicable here, the Arbitrator made no finding that the grievant raised his voice, made physical contact, or made any type of real or perceived threat to his supervisor.[56] Moreover, even if the grievant's conduct could be described as unprofessional, disrespectful, or insubordinate, Authority precedent permits the use of intemperate, abusive, or even insulting language by union officials when performing representation duties.[57] And the NLRB also distinguishes between true insubordination and behavior that is only "disrespectful, rude, and defiant."[58] In similar situations, employees who initially refuse a supervisory instruction, but ultimately comply, are still found to be engaged in protected activity.[59]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the grievant's conduct is unlike other conduct that the Authority has found to be unprotected--"such as racially inflammatory comments and physical contact."[60] Evaluating the range of actions that the Authority has found to be protected by &#x00A7; 7102, we find that the nature of the grievant's conduct supports a conclusion that the grievant's conduct did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed above, and after considering the totality of the circumstances and weighing the <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping</span> factors, we find that the grievant was engaged in a protected activity when he met with his supervisor to review his official-time form, and that his conduct during the meeting did not exceed the boundaries of protected activity. Therefore, he may not be disciplined for that conduct.[61] Accordingly, we find that the Arbitrator's award upholding the Agency's suspension of the grievant is contrary to law and must be vacated.</p>

<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella offered a dissent and detailed legal analysis centered on his belief that, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 298-300:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Using the "flagrant-misconduct" framework, the Authority has sanctioned all sorts of outrageous, and (in some cases) criminal behavior of union representatives simply because those representatives are now convinced (perhaps by the paternalistic decisions of the Authority) that the rules of common workplace civility do not apply to them while they are engaged in business for the union....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In what should come as no surprise, the unmistakable message of these cases was not lost on some federal unions which have used that precedent to recruit and rally their members. The National Border Patrol Council wasted no time cluing its stewards in on how to tell a management official "you can't be that f----g stupid" or how to call their supervisor an "a--hole" or "space cadet" and get away with it. In 2007, the General Counsel of NFFE prepared a widely disseminated Power-Point presentation that advised its representatives that the "use of profanity [by a union official when acting in a representational role] <span class="Italic">will not be</span> considered to be flagrant misconduct[&#8197;]" by the FLRA.37 And, not wanting its representatives to lose out on the fun, NATCA cautioned its bargaining unit that the Authority's sanction of "harsh/robust language...<span class="Italic">only applies</span> to representatives of the [u]nion" but "<span class="Italic">does not apply</span>...to employees" who do not belong to the union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The message has not been lost on federal managers either and many are justifiably concerned.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Government Executive</span> magazine noted that the Authority's "flagrant misconduct" precedent leaves federal managers wondering just "<span class="Italic">how much</span> verbal abuse [they] have to take from union officials?"...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The majority seems to believe that union representatives are "incapable of organizing a union or exercising their...statutory rights...without resort to abusive or threatening language." In my experience, union representatives are sufficiently competent to act as professionals without resorting to abusive or threatening behavior. But, conversely, any employee who is unable to comport themselves in a professional and civil manner when they perform their job--whether as a senior leader, supervisor, division chief, union steward, team lead, or line worker--should be held to the <span class="Italic">same standards</span> that are required of all federal employees. It is "self-evident" that "Congress did not intend to immunize against discipline [any] federal employee" who acts in a disrespectful and boorish manner towards any other employee, in particular, one's supervisor.[43] Therefore, I reach the simple conclusion that "misconduct of any kind..., by definition, 'exceed[s] the boundaries of protected activity.'"[44]</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council and DOJ, INS, El Paso</span>, 44 FLRA 1395, 1400-03 (1992), shows the scrutiny applied by FLRA to arbitration awards challenged as providing insufficient statutory protection to the conduct of union officials (an official who called a supervisor a "space cadet" during a conversation over official time and leave):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the award is deficient because it is contrary to section 7102 of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exceptions, the Union contends that the grievant's requests for official time and LWOP to conduct Union business constitute protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute. The Authority has held that when exceptions to an arbitration award raise the question of whether a grievant was disciplined for conduct while engaging in protected activity, <span id="page_2368"></span>the Authority will review the record in the case to determine whether the conduct for which the grievant was disciplined was committed while the grievant was engaged in activities protected by the Statute and whether that conduct exceeded the boundaries of the protection of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916</span>, 32 FLRA 252, 254 (1988). An award sustaining discipline for conduct committed while an employee is engaged in protected activity is contrary to the Statute unless the conduct exceeded the bounds of the protection of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant requested official time and LWOP to perform Union duties in his capacity as a subordinate employee, rather than in his capacity as a Union representative. On this basis, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant was not engaged in protected activity at the time he made the requests because he was not involved in labor-management activities and, therefore, that the remarks made to the supervisor were not protected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was acting solely in his capacity as an employee when the requests were made. In our view, the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was acting solely as an employee when he requested LWOP and official time was premised on an erroneous view that the Agency could approve an employee's request for LWOP and official time only when the request was made by the employee <span class="Italic">qua</span> employee. While drawing a distinction between an employee of the Agency and "a paid [union] professional," the Arbitrator failed to recognize that an employee serving as a Union official can request and be granted LWOP and official time while serving in that capacity. An employee who is representing a labor organization is no less an employee of an agency simply because that individual serves in a representative capacity....&#8197;Nonetheless, when an employee who is serving in a representative capacity requests leave to engage in union activities, that employee is requesting such leave in his or her representative capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, neither party disputes the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant was an employee of the Agency at the time he requested official time and LWOP. However, both parties disagree with the Arbitrator's characterization of the grievant as being only a "subordinate employee" at the time he made the requests. Instead, the Union contends, and the Agency agrees, that the grievant was also an appointed Union official and was acting in that capacity when he made the official time and LWOP requests. In fact, despite his finding to the contrary, the Arbitrator also acknowledged that "only an employee who is also a Union official would request Agency approval of use of official time for Union business (see Article 32, Section D)." Under these circumstances, we conclude that the grievant was acting in his capacity as a Union official when the official time and LWOP requests were made.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, it is undisputed that the grievant's requests for official time and LWOP were made for the purpose of engaging in "[U]nion duties." The record indicates that the parties' agreement contains provisions authorizing the Agency to relieve Union officials of their official duties while they are serving as Union officials and to approve official time for Union business. Although it is unclear from the record under which agreement provisions the grievant sought official time and LWOP, it is clear that the grievant was acting as a Union official when he made the requests for official time and LWOP and that the purpose of such time was to conduct Union business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7102 of the Statute guarantees employees the right to engage in activities on behalf of an exclusive representative without fear of penalty or reprisal.&#x2003;We are persuaded, based on our analysis of the record, that the grievant was engaged in protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute when he sought approval of the official time and LWOP requests in order to perform Union duties. Consequently, the remarks made by the grievant to the supervisor that led to the grievant's discipline were made during the course of protected activity and were themselves protected unless the remarks exceeded the boundaries of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to exceed the protection of the Statute, the grievant's remarks must have constituted "flagrant misconduct." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Air Force Logistics Command, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 916, AFL-CIO</span>, 34 FLRA 385, 390 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Tinker II</span>). In our view, the grievant's remarks were not of such an outrageous or insubordinate nature so as to remove them from the protection of the Statute. We note that the remarks were made in private telephone conversations, occurred while the grievant was off-duty, and did not involve any defamatory utterances. While we do not condone the grievant's conduct, we are not persuaded that, given the circumstances of this case, the remarks constituted flagrant misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California, and Long Beach Naval Station, Long Beach, California</span>, 25 FLRA 1002 (1987) (no flagrant misconduct found where union official made remarks to police officer during altercation with employee); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington</span>, 2 FLRA 54, 75 (1979) (union official was improperly suspended for remarking to a supervisor, "I am going to get your ass[,]" among other things, when seeking permission to meet with another union official). <span class="Italic">See also Thor Power Tool Co.</span>, 148 NLRB 1379, 1380 (1964) (National Labor Relations Board found that union grievance committee member was engaged in protected activity during grievance discussion and was unlawfully discharged for muttering term "'horse's ass[&#8197;]'" to plant superintendent), <span class="Italic">enforced</span>, 351 F.2d 584 (7th Cir. 1965). <span class="Italic">Compare Veterans Administration Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 35 FLRA 553 (1990) (flagrant misconduct found where the grievant disregarded an order to terminate a telephone conversation concerning union business when a life threatening situation required his attention). Consequently, we conclude that the remarks made by the grievant fell within the ambit of protected activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having made this finding, we also find that the grievant could not be disciplined for that conduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tinker II</span>, 34 FLRA at 391. Because the award sustains discipline for protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute, the award is contrary to law and must be modified. An appropriate remedy is to sustain the grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Additionally, we will order that all references to the suspension be expunged from the grievant's personnel file and that the grievant be reimbursed for any lost pay, allowances, or differentials resulting from the 4-day suspension. In so ordering, we find that the Agency's action of improperly disciplining the grievant for engaging in protected activity under section 7102 of the Statute constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596. We further find that the discipline directly resulted in the loss of pay, allowances, or differentials and that, but for such action, the grievant would not have suffered the loss. In our view, such an order is mandated under the Back Pay Act and will fully remedy the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award that required a union to use contract grievance procedures and eschew communications to the President and Congress was set aside. 5 USC 7211 unequivocally protects the right of federal employees to petition Congress, to communicate with heads of agencies and with other officials of the executive branch of the government. The award infringed protected employee rights. <span class="Italic">Overseas Fed'n of Teachers and DODDS</span>, 21 FLRA 757, 759 (1986). Without delving into law concerning mixed-motive disciplinary cases, FLRA declined to set aside an award that sustained a suspension when the arbitrator concluded that some of the actions involved discrimination based on the grievant's status as a union official. <span class="Italic">FCI and AFGE Local 1286</span>, 3 FLRA 688, 689-90 (1980).</p>
