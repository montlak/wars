<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-55"><span class="space">1.</span> General Rule</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although a reassignment not involving a change in pay, grade, or competitive level is not appealable as an adverse action, the removal of an employee upon his refusal to accept a reassignment requires the agency to establish by preponderant evidence that the removal will promote the service efficiency. This burden requires the agency to establish at least a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of the propriety of the reassignment by showing that there was a legitimate management purpose for the reassignment, that the employee was given adequate notice of the reassignment, and that the employee refused to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Ramos v. FAA</span>, 4 MSPR 388, 391, 4 MSPB 446 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Boykin v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3357) (endorsing <span class="Italic">Ramos</span>); <span class="Italic">Curran v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 11 MSPR 597, 598, 600 (1982) (agency was required to prove by preponderant evidence that the reassignment was based on a legitimate management consideration; although the agency emphasized voluntary reassignments, there was no evidence that the agency policy prohibited involuntary reassignments); <span class="Italic">Else v. DOJ</span>, 3 MSPR 397, 399, 3 MSPB 475 (1980) ("agency must show more than a rational basis for the transfer, i.e., 'job requirements'"). Although litigation most often results from geographical reassignments, the same analysis applies to reassignment from one position to another at the same grade at the same geographical location. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. Dept. of Army</span>, 10 MSPR 29, 31 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The safest route for the reassigned employee is take the reassignment, then protest through the forum of choice, <span class="Italic">Leija v. VA</span>, 530 Fed. Appx. 945, 953-54 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We and the Board have explained that such employees generally should not disregard an order with which they disagree--including one related to reassignment; they should instead follow the order and then challenge it through appropriate administrative channels.[6]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g, New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("[A]n employee is required to comply with instructions from her agency acting within its authority, unless obedience would place her in a clearly dangerous circumstance."); <span class="Italic">Bigelow v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 750 F.2d 962, 965-66 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("Unless [a] transfer is, in effect, a discharge, [an] employee has no right simply to walk out; he must accept the orders of his superior, even if felt to be unjust, until relieved of them by judicial or administrative action."); <span class="Italic">Cooke</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 407-08 (agreeing that "even if the assignment was improper, the appellant's recourse was to obey by performing the duties of his new position and then appeal the propriety of the assignment," even if the Board's ultimately found the reassignment improper, because "[t]he appellant's conduct was not protected by either privilege or a legitimate concern that it would cause him irreparable harm"); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 40 M.S.P.R. 106, 112 (M.S.P.B. 1989) ("If the appellant believed that her reassignment was improper, her recourse was to report for duty and grieve while working."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-15-059.html#sec8-60">Return From Overseas Assignment</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although in 2015 the Board's position would be set aside by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Cobert v. Miller</span>, 800 F.3d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (Judge Wallach concurring), <span class="Italic">post</span>, in 2013, the Board revised the analysis of cases involving employees removed for refusal to accept geographical reassignments, concluding under the facts of the case that an agency must prove "that the reassignment was required because the agency had eliminated or had no need for the appellant's continued performance in her former position or because it needed to address the appellant's performance problems in her former position." <span class="Italic">Miller</span> did not limit the justification for reassignments. It altered the analysis procedurally to require consideration of all circumstances. Ms. Miller's discharge was reversed because "the record evidence simply does not support a finding that the agency directed the appellant's geographic reassignment due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations and that her ensuing removal promoted the efficiency of the service.&#8197;...it failed to provide a 'rational basis' for requiring the appellant to accept a geographic reassignment into the position."

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 294, 298 (1980), the Board adopted a framework of shifting burdens of proof to analyze an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 premised on an employee's refusal to accept a geographic reassignment. Under this framework, the agency had the initial burden of showing that its decision to reassign the employee was based on legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service. <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 299. Such a showing, along with evidence that the employee had adequate notice of the decision to transfer and refused to accept the reassignment, was sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Once the agency made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden shifted to the appellant to produce rebuttal evidence to demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle. <span class="Italic">See Umshler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1990). Absent preponderant evidence relating the reassignment to the efficiency of the service, the Board could conclude that the reassignment was not a valid exercise of managerial discretion, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to resign or was at least an arbitrary and capricious action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Ketter</span>er, 2 M.S.P.R. at 300; <span class="Italic">see Frey v. Department of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (endorsing the Board's framework and adopting it as the law of the circuit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon careful consideration, we have concluded that the burden-shifting apparatus outlined in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> does not meaningfully add to the Board's adjudication of an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a directed geographic reassignment. In all chapter 75 adverse action appeals, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence both that the underlying misconduct occurred and that the action promotes the efficiency of the service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). Where, as here, the record is complete, determining whether the agency met a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is irrelevant. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Wingate v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 4 (2012) (eschewing the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> burden-shifting analysis in an age discrimination case where the record is complete); <span class="Italic">Godesky v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 280, &#x00B6; 10 (2006); <span class="Italic">Simien v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-28 (2005). Instead, the Board should simply weigh all the evidence and make a finding on the ultimate issue of whether the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the misconduct occurred and that its action promotes the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In abandoning the cumbersome and unnecessary burden-shifting approach, we in no way depart from any of the jurisprudential principles otherwise governing our review of an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a geographic reassignment. For example, we have long held, and today reaffirm, that an agency must do more than merely establish a "rational basis" for the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Else v. Department of Justice</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 397, 399 (1980). The agency must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the geographic reassignment was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting <span id="Page_2499"></span>the efficiency of the service and in accordance with agency discretion under 5 C.F.R. part 335. <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 298 &#x0026; n.8; <span class="Italic">see McClelland v. Andrus</span>, 606 F.2d 1278, 1290-91 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ("An action supportable on 'any rational basis' is not necessarily one that will promote the efficiency of the service."). This may be done by showing that the reassignment was required because the agency had eliminated or had no need for the appellant's continued performance in her former position or because it needed to address the appellant's performance problems in her former position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1358, 1360 (the reassignment was proper to address recent mine fires and accidents because the appellant was not the best suited to address the issues in his field office, and he would face less complicated enforcement problems in a different office); <span class="Italic">Cooke v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 401, 406 (finding the reassignment proper because it was due to a nationwide restructuring), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 73 F.3d 380 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Wear v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 597, 599 (1984) (holding that the reasons justifying a reduction-in-force, such as cutbacks in the appellant's region, were also a legitimate reason for a reassignment); <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Department of the Interior</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 687, 689-90 (1984) (finding that the reassignment was legitimate because the agency had undergone a nationwide reorganization).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record evidence simply does not support a finding that the agency directed the appellant's geographic reassignment due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations and that her ensuing removal promoted the efficiency of the service. The appellant transferred to the agency on March 16, 2008, as the Superintendent for the Sitka National Historical Park in Sitka, Alaska. The record and testimony of agency witnesses indicate that the appellant was successful in her position. According to the agency, it determined that it had a need for a Liaison position based in Anchorage, Alaska, and that the appellant was well-suited for the position. On April 27, 2010, Mr. Knox offered the appellant a voluntary reassignment to the position. When the appellant declined the offered position due to geographic and other hardships, Mr. Knox presented her with a memorandum directing her reassignment to the position and stating that, if she declined the position, removal procedures would commence against her. The appellant declined the position, and the agency effected her removal on August 6, 2010, for failure to accept a management directed reassignment to the Liaison position in Anchorage, Alaska. After the appellant's removal, the agency filled both the Superintendent and Liaison position vacancies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency presented evidence to show that it had a legitimate reason to create the Alaska Native Affairs Liaison position, it failed to provide a "rational basis" for requiring the appellant to accept a geographic reassignment into the position. For example, the agency made no showing that the appellant's reassignment was necessary because the Superintendent position had been eliminated or the agency had no need for her continued performance in that position. <span class="Italic">Cf. Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1358, 1360. Nor is there any indication that the agency needed to reassign her because of any performance problems in the Superintendent position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1358. In the same vein, the agency did not proffer any evidence suggesting that the appellant's reassignment to Anchorage was necessary because of a reduction-in-force or reorganization. <span class="Italic">Cf. Wear</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. at 599. In sum, the agency failed to present any evidence showing that its reasons for directing the appellant's geographic reassignment to Anchorage were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> such as to support a finding that her removal for refusing to take the reassignment promoted the efficiency of the service. Furthermore, the appellant has submitted sufficient credible evidence to cast doubt on the agency's motivations in effecting her removal. The record shows that the appellant was not serving in a position with a mobility requirement. She also has shown that her declination of the Liaison position did not impair the performance of that position's functions. Indeed, besides offering to perform the position's functions while she performed her duties as Superintendent at Sitka, the appellant also offered evidence that the agency had no trouble filling the position--it received 120 applications--and ultimately filled the position with a Native Alaskan attorney with experience in tribal liaison work. Under these circumstances, where the agency has failed to provide any evidence that the appellant's geographic reassignment was necessary and where the ensuing removal action does not appear to be rationally related to the efficiency of the service, we find--consistent with our longstanding precedent--that the agency invoked its discretion to reassign the appellant "as a veil to effect" her separation. <span class="Italic">See Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 299 n.8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the agency, it had a high regard for the appellant's performance as the Superintendent in Sitka. Indeed, agency witnesses testified that the agency relied upon the appellant's strengths and accomplishments as a Superintendent as the basis for directing her reassignment to the Liaison position in Anchorage, over 500 miles away. Accepting as true that testimony, along with the agency's representations that it had an independent and legitimate management reason both for creating the Liaison position and for locating it in Anchorage, more than 500 miles from Sitka, we find that it did not promote the efficiency of the service to direct the appellant to take the position in Anchorage against her will and to remove her from employment altogether when she declined the position. As a result of the agency's actions, it lost an apparently valued and successful employee and created two vacancies that the agency had to fill after her removal. Accordingly, the appellant's removal is reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board denied OPM's reconsideration petition, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 120 MSPR 426, 431-38 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-24, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/netsearch/viewdocs.aspx?docnumber=940398&version=944151">2013 MSPB 94</a> (2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board has not imposed a new requirement that the agency prove that its geographic reassignment was "necessary."</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that the Board has improperly replaced the statutorily prescribed standard for upholding an agency's action with a higher one that requires an agency to demonstrate, to the Board's subjective satisfaction, that its directed reassignments are "necessary." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As quoted above, <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6; 7, there is language in the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> noting that, as examples of the agency's failure to provide a "rational basis" for requiring the appellant to accept the geographic reassignment, the agency made no showing that the appellant's reassignment was necessary because the Superintendent position had been eliminated or the agency had no need for her continued performance in that position, there was no indication that the agency needed to reassign her because of any performance problems in the Superintendent position, and the agency did not proffer any evidence suggesting that the appellant's reassignment to Anchorage was necessary because of a RIF or reorganization. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. ("[W]here the agency has failed to provide any evidence that the appellant's geographic reassignment was necessary and where the ensuing removal action does not appear to be rationally related to the efficiency of the service, we find--consistent with our longstanding precedent--that the agency invoked its discretion to reassign the appellant 'as a veil to effect' her separation.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board ended this discussion, however, by stating that, "[i]n sum, the agency failed to present any evidence showing that its reasons for directing the appellant's geographic reassignment to Anchorage were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> such as to support a finding that her removal for refusing to take the reassignment promoted the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the emphasis in this case has always been on the agency's failure to show that its reasons for the reassignment were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and that its action promoted the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7 ("In all chapter 75 adverse action appeals, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence both that the underlying misconduct occurred and that the action promotes the efficiency of the service....&#8197;[T]the Board should simply weigh all the evidence and make a finding on the ultimate issue of whether the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the misconduct occurred and that its action promotes the efficiency of the service."), &#x00B6; 8 ("The agency must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the geographic reassignment was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service...."), &#x00B6; 9 ("[T]he record evidence simply does not support a finding that the agency directed the appellant's geographic reassignment due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations and that her ensuing removal promoted the efficiency of the service."), &#x00B6; 10 ("[T]he agency failed to present any evidence showing that its reasons for directing the appellant's geographic reassignment to Anchorage were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> such as to support a finding that her removal for refusing to take the reassignment promoted the efficiency of the service."), &#x00B6; 11 ("[I]t did not promote the efficiency of the service to direct the appellant to take the position in Anchorage against her will and to remove her from employment altogether when she declined the position."). These findings are entirely consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.403(a), which provide that an agency may remove an employee "for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service." The Board must sustain such a removal if the agency's action is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). In any event, the Board has held that an agency must do more than merely establish a rational basis for a geographic reassignment. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">see McClelland v. Andrus</span>, 606 F.2d 1278, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1979) ("An action supportable on 'any rational basis' is not necessarily one that will promote the efficiency of the service."). Here, the agency not only failed to establish a rational basis for the geographic reassignment, but also failed to show by preponderant evidence that the reassignment was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further emphasized in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> that, although it was abandoning the cumbersome and unnecessary burden-shifting approach, it was in no way departing from any of the jurisprudential principles otherwise governing its review of an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a geographic reassignment. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 8. Accordingly, to the extent that some of the language in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> may have suggested that <span id="Page_2500"></span>the Board was departing from the statutory standard and the existing jurisprudential principles involved in proving an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a geographic reassignment, we hereby clarify that an agency need not prove that a geographic reassignment is "necessary." Thus, we modify our decision in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> by finding that the agency in this case failed to provide a "rational basis" for requiring the appellant to accept the geographic reassignment because, for example, it did not show that the Superintendent position had been eliminated or that the agency had no need for her continued performance in that position, there was no indication that the appellant had performance problems in the Superintendent position, and the agency did not proffer any evidence of a RIF or reorganization.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also asserts that in <span class="Italic">LaChance v. Devall</span>, 178 F.3d 1246 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the court reversed a Board decision in which the Board asserted the power to exercise <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of an agency's penalty determination when fewer than all of the charges were sustained. OPM contends that the court characterized the purpose of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 as giving agencies greater flexibility to remove or discipline employees who engage in misconduct or whose work performance is unacceptable. OPM claims that the court held that the Board may not infringe upon an agency's exclusive domain as workforce manager and amplify the Board's review power into the realm of independent management. OPM asserts that the court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Devall</span> concerning an agency's penalty determination applies with equal force to the core agency decision of whether to discipline an employee at all. Thus, OPM claims that, if the Board must defer to an agency's determination that a penalty is for such cause as to promote the efficiency of the service, then it must also defer to the agency's determination that the underlying adverse action was for such cause as to promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1251, OPM petitioned the court to review the Board's standard for determining the appropriate penalty due when fewer than all of the agency's charges are sustained. Thus, the focus of the court's decision was on whether the Board had the authority to determine penalties independently when fewer than all agency charges were sustained, and how the Board's mitigation authority should be exercised. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Nevertheless, the court did recognize that "[w]hether such agency action indeed promotes efficiency of the service is within the province of the Board." <span class="Italic">Devall</span>, 178 F.3d at 1255. As set forth above, the Board in <span class="Italic">Miller</span> applied the same efficiency of the service standard that had been applied by both the Board and the court over the years, but simply abandoned the burden-shifting framework for analysis, a framework that is not set forth in the statute or regulation regarding an adverse action appeal such as this. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7701; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.403(a). Thus, we find that OPM has not shown any error in the Board's interpretation or application of the relevant statutes, regulations, and case law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Board is not bound by the burden-shifting approach outlined in Ketterer</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that the Board has effectively overruled its decisions in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 294, and <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Department of the Interior</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 628 (1990), which it asserts are consistent with the meaning of the statutory standard, and instead has adopted a "necessity" standard that is contrary to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Frey v. Department of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2004), which "endorsed" the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span> and "adopt[ed] it as the law of the circuit," and which is binding on the Board. In this regard, OPM contends that the Board may only review a directed reassignment to assure itself that the reassignment, which is not appealable, is not a pretext for forcing an employee to retire or quit and that, in these types of cases, illicit motivation is the only means by which an appellant may defeat an otherwise legitimate action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, we have hereby modified our prior decision in this case to clarify that there is no "necessity" standard and to reiterate that the jurisprudential principles otherwise governing Board review in these types of cases has not changed. In any event, we are not persuaded by OPM's claim that the Board may not abandon the burden-shifting approach set forth in such cases as <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span> because the court "endorsed" that approach in <span class="Italic">Frey</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1357, the court affirmed the Board's decision sustaining a removal for refusing to accept a geographic reassignment. The court first set forth the following analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Reassignments of federal employees are authorized by regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102 (2000). In that regard, the Board has held that discipline is warranted for refusing to accept a legitimate directed reassignment and that removal is not an unreasonably harsh penalty for such a refusal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Nalbandian v. Department of the Interior</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 691, 695 (1985). However, where a removal action is based on a refusal to accept a directed geographical reassignment, the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that its reassignment decision "was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, and based upon legitimate management considerations in the interest of the service." <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>..., 44 M.S.P.R. [at] 630...(citing <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>..., 2 M.S.P.R. [at] 298...). "If the employee can demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire, or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Rayfield v.</span> [<span class="Italic">Department of Agriculture</span>], 26 M.S.P.R. 244, 246 (1985)). Once it is established or unchallenged that a reassignment was properly ordered in an exercise of agency discretion under 5 C.F.R. part 335, the Board will not review the management considerations underlying that exercise of discretion. <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 299 n.8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1357-58; <span class="Italic">see id</span>. at 1360 &#x0026; n.1 (finding that the above principles were "in accordance with the analysis employed by our predecessor court"). The Board has applied these general principles in adjudicating this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the facts involved in the case, the court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> noted that the Board in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span> held that, once a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the validity of the reassignment is established, the burden of going forward with the evidence would then shift to the employee. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1360. If the employee could show that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board could conclude that the reassignment was not a valid exercise of managerial discretion, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire or was at least an arbitrary and capricious action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court then held, "[w]e endorse the Board's approach in these cases, as set forth above, and adopt it as the law of the circuit." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear whether the court, in endorsing and adopting the Board's approach "as set forth above," was referring to the more general principles set forth in the block quotation above, the burden-shifting framework, or both. To the extent that the court was referring to the former, we have applied that approach in this case. In fact, when it applied the above principles in the case before it, the court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> found that substantial evidence fully supported the Board's conclusion that the agency established a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, legitimate management reason for Mr. Frey's geographical reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1360. The court also found that Mr. Frey's argument that the agency did not establish the legitimacy of his reassignment was essentially an unsuccessful attack on the administrative judge's credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1360-61. Thus, the court simply upheld the fact finder's determination that there was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, legitimate management reason for the geographical reassignment and found that Mr. Frey did not provide any basis to undermine such a finding. The process used by the court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> to adjudicate the case is fundamentally the same as that used by the Board here, where we have found that the agency <span class="Italic">did not</span> establish a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>, legitimate management reason for the appellant's geographical reassignment and that the agency instead invoked its discretion to reassign the appellant as a "veil" to effect her separation. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-11. As explained in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 7, the burden-shifting apparatus is irrelevant once the record is complete, and the ultimate issue is whether the agency proved by preponderant evidence that the misconduct occurred and that its action promoted the efficiency of the service. Thus, our abandonment of the burden-shifting framework is entirely consistent with the approach taken by the court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, we find that the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> was not a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> interpretation of any statute applicable in that case. Rather, the court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> held that the Board's manner of adjudicating the case was reasonable and therefore deferred to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1360; <span class="Italic">cf. Tunik v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 407 F.3d 1326, 1336-38 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (finding that the court had deferred, in two prior decisions, to the Board's interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521). In this regard, we note that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(a)(1), the Board shall "adjudicate" all matters within its jurisdiction and take final action on any such matter. When, as here, the Board applies a standard of proof that is consistent with the applicable statute, regulation, and case law, the Board may determine the manner in which it adjudicates the appeal, especially when any change in the manner of adjudication involves only the abandonment of an evidentiary burden-shifting approach in a case in which the record is complete. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dick v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 290 F.3d 1356, 1363-64 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board has great discretion to determine which issues to consider first), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Garcia v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Wingate v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When an earlier panel decision is based on deference to an agency's statutory interpretation, a later panel is free to consider whether a new agency interpretation is reasonable without <span class="Italic">en banc</span> reconsideration of the earlier panel decision. <span class="Italic">See Tunik</span>, 407 F.3d at 1338. Because we find that the decision in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> was based on the court's deference to the Board, <span id="Page_2501"></span>the Board is not bound to apply the burden-shifting framework in the same manner as that framework appeared to have been applied in <span class="Italic">Frey</span>. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1338-39, 1341.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The burden-shifting approach in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> that OPM contends is superior to the single-standard analysis that we adopted in this case led to the same result as the one we reached in this case, on similar facts. In <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, as in this case, the agency removed an employee for declining a directed geographic reassignment, even though the employee was performing satisfactorily prior to his removal and the agency did not abolish the position from which he was removed. 2 M.S.P.R. at 297-98. In <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, as in this case, the Board concluded that removal did not promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 300.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM also questions the Board's determination that the removal did not promote the efficiency of the service because the agency lost a valuable and successful employee and created two vacancies that needed to be filled. OPM argues that the Board's determination reflects an exceedingly narrow understanding of the meaning of the term "efficiency of the service" because it equates the term with "productive efficiency or the efficient allocation of resources," rather than with a broader range of circumstances that are not limited to successful performance and economical administration. OPM contends that there is no more fundamental management right than the right for an agency to deploy its employees in what it deems to be an efficient and effective manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, our determination in this case is not based solely upon the agency's loss of a valuable employee and the creation of two vacancies that needed to be filled. Rather, the agency failed to establish by preponderant evidence that the geographic reassignment was properly ordered due to <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management considerations in the interest of promoting the efficiency of the service. While agencies have the authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.102 to reassign their employees, any adverse action based on a failure to accept a geographic reassignment must meet the efficiency of the service standard. <span class="Italic">See Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1357-58, 1360; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that there was an abundance of legitimate management reasons for the appellant's directed reassignment, including the determination of her direct supervisor and the regional director that she was the best candidate for the position among a pool of candidates from the staff and management's assessment that she had the strongest skills for the position, including experience working as a liaison with native communities, personal relationships with the superintendents from other parks in the state, an understanding of parks operations, and her successful modeling of what the agency wanted to accomplish in the new position. The Board recognized in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 11, that agency witnesses testified that the agency relied upon the appellant's strengths and accomplishments as a Superintendent as the basis for directing her reassignment to the Liaison position in Anchorage, over 500 miles away. Nevertheless, we further found that the agency did not show that its reasons for the directed geographic reassignment were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> and that the agency instead invoked its discretion to reassign the appellant as a "veil" to effect her separation. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;OPM contends that the Board's prior decision in this case robs agencies of the flexibility they need in times of tight budgets to "geographically transfer personnel from underfunded to funded activities." In the present case, however, there is no indication that the agency reassigned the appellant from Sitka to Anchorage as part of an effort to move her from an underfunded activity to a funded activity. Rather, the agency created a <span class="Italic">new</span> position in Anchorage <span class="Italic">and</span> filled the appellant's position in Sitka after it removed her from it. <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 438, &#x00B6; 9. How application of the single efficiency of the service standard would play out when an employee was removed for declining a directed reassignment that was part of an agency's drive to economize is not before the Board in this case, and, accordingly, that hypothetical concern provides no basis for modifying the Board's earlier decision herein. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chandler v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 163, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2013) (a majority of the Board held that an agency has broad discretion in deciding how to cope with budgetary shortfalls; the Board's review of a furlough under the efficiency of the service standard generally does not encompass agency spending decisions on personnel matters, but instead focuses on whether the furlough was imposed in a uniform and consistent manner and whether any differential treatment of employees was justified by a legitimate management reason).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, the agency still was required to establish the legitimacy of a reassignment, but the process was done through a burden-shifting test that the 2013 <span class="Italic">Miller</span> decision abandoned. The Federal Circuit then decided the Board incorrectly deviated from Federal Circuit precedent and returned the Board to the <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> analysis in <span class="Italic">Cobert v. Miller</span>, 800 F.3d 1340, 1344-51 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (Judge Wallach concurring) (following remand, "instating" the initial decision as the Board's final decision, <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-11-0766-M-1 (NP 12/31/2015)), allowing agencies to remove employees who refuse reassignments if the agency establishes a legitimate basis for the reassignment and if the employee does not demonstrate that management failed to act on the basis of <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> management reasons:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding Ms. Miller's appeal, the AJ employed the analytical framework set forth in <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 294 (1980). <span class="Italic">See Initial Decision</span> at 5-6 (citing <span class="Italic">Frey v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 359 F.3d 1355, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2004)). In <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, the Board established a two-step approach for deciding an appeal of a removal action based upon refusal to accept a reassignment. "In a removal for cause following a refusal to accept a reassignment," the Board stated, "the agency must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the removal will promote the efficiency of the service. This necessarily includes a demonstration that the agency's decision to reassign the employee was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination based on legitimate management considerations in the interests of the service." <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 298. The Board continued: "As part of its initial burden, the agency must come forward with evidence showing a legitimate management reason for the reassignment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 299. The Board explained that "[t]ogether with evidence that the employee had adequate notice of the decision to transfer and that he refused to accept the reassignment, this would ordinarily be sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board stated that, "[o]nce the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the employee but the burden of persuasion...never shifts from the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 195, 201-02 (1980)). Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Department of the Interior</span>, the Board reiterated that, once the agency establishes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the employee, even though the ultimate burden of proof never shifts from the agency. 44 M.S.P.R. 628, 630 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 298-99). And the Board elaborated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the employee can demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination, but was instead either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire, or was at least an arbitrary and capricious adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 3, 2013, the Board issued an Opinion and Order vacating the AJ's decision and reversing Ms. Miller's removal. In its decision, the Board revisited and abandoned <span class="Italic">Ketterer's</span> two-step analytical framework for reviewing adverse actions based on refusal to accept a directed reassignment. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, No. SF-0752-11-0766-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 3, 2013) (vacated). In its place, the Board adopted a single efficiency of the service standard for analyzing together both the reassignment and the adverse action. Having done so, it ruled that Ms. Miller's reassignment and removal did not promote the efficiency of the service. Several weeks later, however, on May 13, 2013, the Board reopened the case on its own pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118. After doing so, it vacated its April 3 opinion and issued a substitute opinion, still reversing Ms. Miller's removal. <span class="Italic">Miller I</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. at 440.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its substitute opinion, the Board again stated that it was abandoning the two-step framework of <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>. In the Board's view, "the burden-shifting apparatus outlined in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> does not meaningfully add to the Board's adjudication of an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a directed geographic reassignment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 441-42. The Board stated that, in "abandoning the cumbersome and unnecessary burden-shifting approach," it was not departing "from any of the jurisprudential principles otherwise governing [the] review of an adverse action based on a refusal to accept a geographic reassignment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 442. The Board stated that henceforth it would "simply weigh all the evidence and make a finding on the ultimate issue of whether the agency proved...that the misconduct occurred and that its action promotes the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to our analysis, we first hold that the Board erred as a matter of law in abandoning the <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> two-step burden-shifting approach described above. In <span class="Italic">Frey</span>, we examined <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, and we set forth the burden-shifting approach that they articulate. 359 F.3d at 1360. Then, referring to <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, we stated: "We endorse the Board's approach in these cases, as set forth above, and <span class="Italic">adopt it as the law of the circuit</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Thus, contrary to what the Board said in <span class="Italic">Miller II</span>, we did not merely "endorse" the <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> framework. Rather, in clear and certain terms, we made it the "law of the circuit." <span class="Italic">Ketterer's</span> approach thereby became law that must be followed by the Board and panels of this court until overruled by either the Supreme Court or by this court <span class="Italic">en banc. E.g., Tex. Am. Oil Corp. v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 44 F.3d 1557, 1561 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("This court applies the rule that earlier decisions prevail <span id="Page_2502"></span>unless overruled by the court <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, or by other controlling authority such as intervening statutory change or Supreme Court decision."); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Org. of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Sec'y of Veterans Affairs</span>, 260 F.3d 1365, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Mendenhall v. Cedarapids, Inc</span>., 5 F.3d 1557, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1993)) (stating that "<span class="Italic">stare decisis</span> is a doctrine that binds courts to follow their own earlier decisions or the decisions of a superior tribunal"); <span class="Italic">see also Soc. Sec. Admin. v. Mills</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 463, 470 (1996) (decisional law "adopted" by the Federal Circuit is "binding on the Board"), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 124 F.3d 228 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (table). The Board here was not empowered to reject controlling law. In short, <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> was, and continues to be, the law of the circuit. It therefore must be followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> the proper starting point, our task is straightforward: to determine whether substantial evidence supports the AJ's holdings (1) that the agency established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had legitimate management reasons for Ms. Miller's reassignment; and (2) that Ms. Miller failed to rebut the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed, the AJ found that the agency, through the testimony of Mr. Knox and Ms. Masica, had met its initial burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it had legitimate management reasons for Ms. Miller's reassignment. The AJ credited Mr. Knox's testimony that the decision to create the liaison position was made in the fall of 2009 based on a recognized need for the position. In addition, the AJ found that Anchorage was "credibly" identified as the duty station for the position. Further, the AJ accepted the testimony of Mr. Knox and Ms. Masica that the liaison position was not created to effect Ms. Miller's reassignment. With respect to Ms. Miller's qualifications, the AJ credited the testimony of Mr. Knox and Ms. Masica. As seen, they testified that, as Ms. Miller's supervisors, they believed she had the unique strengths to fill the Alaska Native Affairs Liaison position. The AJ, in fact, found it noteworthy that Ms. Miller told Mr. Knox she would consider the position if it was graded higher, at a GS-14 level. Thus, the AJ found that the agency had acted to reassign Ms. Miller based on legitimate management considerations. Substantial evidence supports that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ further determined that Ms. Miller did not rebut the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case for reassignment. The AJ explained in detail that Ms. Miller's conflicting testimony "put the appellant's credibility in question." She found "unpersuasive" Ms. Miller's testimony about applying for the Department of the Army liaison position in Washington State and found "no merit in the appellant's assertion that she is not qualified for the [Alaska Native Affairs Liaison] position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 20; <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 17-18 (explaining that Supervisory Human Resource Specialist, Helen Stewart, testified that Ms. Miller was qualified for the liaison position). While the AJ was sympathetic to Ms. Miller's reservations about leaving Sitka for Anchorage, she found that no evidence presented by Ms. Miller undermined the agency's basis for reassignment, especially in view of the agency's broad discretion to reassign employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21; <span class="Italic">see also Gava v. United States</span>, 699 F.2d 1367, 1370 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("[T]he government has broad discretion to reassign its employees to different locations, and to discharge them for refusal to accept a new assignment."). The AJ thus found that Ms. Miller did not rebut the agency's legitimate management decision. Substantial evidence supports that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's statement that "the agency failed to present any evidence showing that its reasons for directing [Ms. Miller's] reassignment to Anchorage were <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> such as to support a finding that her removal for refusing to take the reassignment promoted the efficiency of the service," <span class="Italic">Miller I</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. at 443-444, is not supported by the record and is contrary to the AJ's unchallenged findings of fact discussed above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the Board's reasoning, the fact that the agency lost a skilled employee in Ms. Miller and had two position vacancies after her removal does not demonstrate that the efficiency of the service was not served by her removal, or suggest an improper effort to force her separation. <span class="Italic">See Miller II</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. at 437; <span class="Italic">Miller I</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. at 444. It is the case in every legitimate removal of an employee for failure to accept a directed reassignment that the agency will be confronted with the loss of an employee with expertise that the agency considered valuable and that the agency will have two vacancies to fill. Quite simply, no evidence cited by the Board supports either its conclusion that credible evidence "cast doubt on the agency's motivations" or its conclusion that Ms. Miller's reassignment was a "veil" to effect her removal. Indeed, the AJ's undisturbed and unchallenged findings of facts are squarely to the contrary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Miller and the MSPB argue that the Board's ultimate decisions in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span> support affirmance in this case. We disagree. In both <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, the Board set aside removal actions that followed an employee's refusal to accept a reassignment. This case is unlike <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, however. In <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>, credible evidence was presented that the basis for the appellant's reassignment was mistaken, that his removal was based on an effort to promote another employee, and that the reassignment location was used "as a place to send employees in order to encourage them to leave the agency by retirement or resignation." 2 M.S.P.R. at 299-300. Accordingly, the Board ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's reassignment and removal. In <span class="Italic">Umshler</span>, the Board found that the agency had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case supporting the validity of the appellant's reassignment. 44 M.S.P.R. at 630-31. It also found, however, that the AJ had erred by improperly limiting the appellant's attempt to rebut that case by casting doubt upon the existence of a legitimate management reason for his reassignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 631-32 ("[T]he administrative judge erred by denying both of the witnesses the appellant requested to establish that the agency engaged in a pattern and practice of using directed reassignments for improper purposes."). The Board therefore remanded the case for further proceedings. In short, the ultimate decisions in <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> and <span class="Italic">Umshler</span> are inapposite here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, it is beyond dispute that "[f]ailure to follow instructions or abide by requirements affects the agency's ability to carry out its mission." <span class="Italic">Blevins v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 101, 104 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 790 F.2d 95 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (table). Ms. Miller's refusal to accept reassignment thus bore directly on the efficiency of the service. In addition, "[t]o say that an agency must select a penalty other than removal when an employee unjustifiably refuses a reassignment is in effect to say that the agency cannot insist on compliance with a lawful reassignment order." <span class="Italic">Wieser</span>, 280 F. App'x at 962; <span class="Italic">see also Frey</span>, 359 F.3d at 1360 ("Our predecessor court consistently upheld the discretion of an agency to terminate an employee who refused a geographical reassignment."). It was not improper for the agency to remove Ms. Miller after she refused to accept reassignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span>, the AJ properly utilized the <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span> two-step, burden-shifting framework adopted by this court in <span class="Italic">Frey</span> as law of the circuit. The AJ determined--based on credibility determinations and findings of fact undisturbed by the Board and unchallenged on appeal--that the agency had made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the decision to reassign Ms. Miller was supported by legitimate management reasons and that Ms. Miller had failed to rebut that <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. We, accordingly, reverse the decision of the Board vacating the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> and reversing Ms. Miller's removal. The case is remanded to the Board, which is instructed to instate the <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> as the final decision of the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Board's shift in <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, and presumably after the Federal Circuit's 2015 decision, the burdens of proof in a disciplinary case stemming from a refusal to accept a reassignment are, <span class="Italic">Leija v. VA</span>, DA-0752-11-0588-I-1 (NP 12/10/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a removal based upon a refusal to accept a reassignment, the agency has the initial burden of coming forward with evidence showing a legitimate management reason for the reassignment, that the employee had adequate notice of the reassignment, and that the employee refused to accept the reassignment. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 106, 110, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">see also Curran v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 714 F.2d 913, 915 (9th Cir. 1983). Such showing is generally sufficient to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the reassignment was for legitimate management considerations. If the appellant produces sufficient evidence to rebut the agency's evidence, the agency must come forward with further evidence relating the reassignment to the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To defeat the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of the legitimacy of a reassignment, the employee could attempt to demonstrate that the underlying reassignment was an abuse of management discretion or taken for invalid reasons designed to result in the removal of the employee without proper adverse action procedures. <span class="Italic">Ketterer v. USDA</span>, 2 MSPR 294, 299 n.8, 2 MSPB 459 (1980) (citing <span class="Italic">McClelland v. Andrus</span>, 606 F.2d 1278 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (holding, 606 F.2d at 1291, that the Civil Service Commission "must be able to conclude that appellant's transfer to Omaha would promote the efficiency of the service more than would his retention in Glacier")). If the employee could demonstrate that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle, the Board may conclude that it was not a valid discretionary management determination but instead was either an improper effort to pressure the appellant to retire or an arbitrary and capricious adverse action. <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 628, 630-32 (1990) (employer's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case was based on evidence showing a legitimate reason for reassignment, along with evidence that the employee had adequate notice of the transfer decision; the burden then shifted to the employee to show that the reassignment had no solid or substantial basis in personnel practice or principle; the AJ erred by refusing to hear evidence of the agency's routine practice of using reassignments to accomplish improper ends), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 55 MSPR 593 (1992). Evidence of gross procedural error in the reassignment would be evidence of management's bad faith in ordering it and relevant to <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> under <span class="Italic">Ketterer</span>. <span class="Italic">Wetsch v. USDA</span>, 9 MSPR 45, 47 (1981).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...A transfer decision is based upon complex considerations of agency requirements as well as the ability and personal characteristics of the employee....&#8197;Because this is not a decision that, balancing the need for review against the burden it imposes, should be examined by the courts, we hold that the district court erred and must accordingly be reversed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, in an appeal not directly challenging the motivation for a reassignment, likened refusal to accept a reassignment to insubordination, as the court determined that the appellant essentially complied with an agency instruction concerning a job assignment and remanded the case for further analysis to determine if, under the particular facts, service efficiency was enhanced by the appellant's removal, <span class="Italic">Leija v.

Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 40 M.S.P.R. 106, 112 (M.S.P.B. 1989) ("If the appellant believed that her reassignment was improper, her recourse was to report for duty and grieve while working."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 299 (Fed. Cir. 1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As in any other adverse action, the appellant who is fired or otherwise subjected to an appealable adverse action for failing to accept a reassignment may tack on an affirmative defense, to be proved by preponderant evidence, as in <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUSIN_MARK_S_CH_1221_00_0028_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250380.pdf">92 MSPR 298</a>, 302 &#x00B6; 8 (2002), involving a reassignment, reprimand, and other personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]n order to prevail on the merits, <span class="Italic">Geyer</span> [<span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 13 (1994)] requires the appellant to prove by the preponderance of the evidence the causal connection between his protected whistleblowing and the personnel action subsequently taken by the agency. At that point in the proceedings, in order for the agency to prevail on the merits, it must show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the personnel action regardless of the appellant's whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Kaeseman v. Department of Veterans</span> <span class="Italic">Affairs,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. at 239; <span class="Italic">Gilmore v.

<p class="Body-Text">As to the reassignment and transfer of an executive, ostensibly motivated by political considerations, serving as a Schedule A state director for the Farmers Home Administration of USDA, an early case, <span class="Italic">Delong v. United States</span>, 621 F.2d 618, 624 (4th Cir. 1980), established a balancing test that was not closely followed by the Board or the Federal Circuit, although the factors considered by the Fourth Circuit merit evaluation in a reassignment decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Critical to the factual determination required should be both objective and subjective factors pertaining to the office-holder's expectations and reliance upon the continuation of particular assignments and geographical locations in his employment. Only reasonable expectations and reliance should be weighed in the balance. In general terms, a government employee should not be thought reasonably entitled to any higher expectations and reliance in these respects than would persons comparably situated in private employment. The exigencies of reassignment and transfer normally incident to comparable levels of executive employment in the private sector of business and industry should generally be assumed normal incidents of government employment, without regard to the specific motivation behind a challenged transfer or reassignment. At the same time, in gauging the impact of a challenged patronage transfer or reassignment, it would be appropriate to take into account any special circumstances, including subjective expectations and reliance on the officeholder's part in relation to the particular position held, that were actually or constructively known to the official making or threatening the transfer or reassignment, and that might reasonably be thought to increase the difficulty of the choice imposed upon the employee. For the same reason, any prior employment history of the officeholder that might bear upon the actual severity of impact of the challenged reassignment or transfer would be relevant to the inquiry. The ultimate issue, as indicated, is whether, all things considered, the challenged reassignment and transfer can reasonably be thought to have imposed so unfair a choice between continued employment and the exercise of protected beliefs and associations as to be tantamount to the choice imposed by threatened dismissal.</p>

Cl. 632, 636 (1969) ("If the order of reassignment was issued to serve political purposes and not to promote the good of the service, it was an unlawful order....&#8197;Being unlawful, it did not have to be obeyed. Hence, a refusal to obey was not insubordination.").</p>
