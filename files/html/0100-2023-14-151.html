<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-152"><span class="space">H.</span> ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE</h3>
<p class="noindent">Administrative leave is described generally in the now-repealed FPM Chapters 610 and 630. In <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2119 and Dept. of Army, Rock Island Arsenal</span>, 49 FLRA 151 (1994), FLRA excerpted, in an appendix, a provision of FPM Chapter 630. FLRA's reprint follows, 49 FLRA at 163-64:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11 provides, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">11-6 <span class="Italic">Procedures</span> The following guidelines are offered for agencies to use when administering the granting of excused absence. These guidelines do not apply to group dismissals or closures of activities. (See FPM Chapter 610, subchapter 3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Registration and Voting. It is long-established executive policy to grant excused absence to employees for a reasonable time, without seriously interfering with operations, to register or vote in Federal, State, county or municipal elections or in referendums on any civic matter in their community....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;Military Funerals. Employees who are veterans of declared wars or who served in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been Authorized, or who are members of an honor or ceremonial group of those veterans may be granted excused absence....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">c.&#x2003;Agency Determinations. Agencies generally determine the situations in which they will excuse employees from duty. The following are examples of recurring situations which may warrant excused absence and for which agencies may have a written policy or may delegate decisions to supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;Blood Donation. Employees who make blood donations may be granted excused absence to travel to the donation site and/or to recover.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;Taking Examinations. Employees who take examinations required by their present positions, including reexaminations, may be granted excused absence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;Tardiness and Brief Absences. Unless an agency establishes a minimum charge of less than 1 hour, or establishes a different minimum charge through negotiations, the minimum charge for leave is 1 hour and additional charges are in multiples thereof....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(4)&#x2003;Conferences or Conventions. Employees may be granted excused absence to attend conferences or conventions when attendance will serve the best interests of the Federal service....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(5)&#x2003;Special Events. Individual employees may be granted excused absence to participate in civil activities which the Government is interested in recognizing or encouraging. Agency heads should make these decisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(6)&#x2003;Physical Fitness. Excused absence may be granted for short periods for participating in officially sponsored and administered physical fitness programs....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(7)&#x2003;Volunteer Activities. Employees may be granted excused absence for short periods of time to participate in volunteer activities....</p>
<p class="noindent">The FPM, although often cited in FLRA guidance on administrative leave, is no longer extant. OPM government-wide regulations at 5 CFR Part 610 (2022) provide guidance on what are described as administrative excusals from work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">610.301 <span class="Italic">Purpose</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The purpose of this subpart is to provide uniform and equitable standards under which regular employees paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates may be relieved from duty with pay by administrative order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">610.302 <span class="Italic">Policy statement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authority in this subpart may be used only to the extent warranted by good administration for short periods of time not generally exceeding 3 consecutive work days in a single period of excused absence.&#x2003;This authority may not be used in situations of extensive duration or for periods of interrupted or suspended operations such as ordinarily would be covered by the scheduling of leave, furlough, or the assignment of other work. Insofar as practicable, each administrative order issued under this subpart shall provide benefits for regular employees paid at daily, hourly, or piecework rates similar to those provided for employees paid at annual rates.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">610.303 <span class="Italic">Definitions</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this subpart:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Administrative order </span>means an order issued by an authorized official of an agency relieving regular employees from active duty without charge to leave or loss of pay.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">(b)&#x2003;For managerial reasons, the closing of an establishment or portions thereof is required for short periods; or</p>

<p class="noindent-1">610.306 <span class="Italic">Supplemental regulations</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each agency is authorized to issue supplemental regulations not inconsistent with this subpart.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2902 and Dept. of Army, Army Garrison, Ft. A.P. Hill</span>, 44 FLRA 3, 7-12 (1992), determined negotiable a proposal that management grant a minimum of two hours of pay, essentially through administrative leave, to certain employees who report for work but who are then prevented from performing their duties by circumstances beyond their control:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that Provision 1 is negotiable.&#x2003;This provision would require the Agency to compensate temporary, intermittent or seasonal employees who report for work as scheduled but are prevented from performing their duties because of circumstances beyond their control. Initially, we note that the Union defines the term "circumstances beyond [an employee's] control" as referring to employees being told, on their arrival at work, that there is no work for them to perform. The Union further explains, in its response to the Agency's statement of position, that the circumstances are those interrupting normal operations and are "events beyond the control of management or employees such as rain, equipment failure, etc." As so explained, the Union has modified the intent of the provision. For purposes of our decision, we adopt the Union's explanation contained in its response. We interpret the provision as applying in circumstances where there is work to be performed if "normal operations" were maintained, but where employees are prevented from performing their duties because of uncontrollable events.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the provision is nonnegotiable because it would require payment to employees who are not working and who are not entitled to payment under law and regulations.&#x2003;The Agency's argument fails for two reasons. First, under the terms of the provision, at least 2 hours pay would be required, but only when employees are scheduled for work, arrive at their prescribed times and are prevented from performing that work due to circumstances beyond their control. Significantly, the provision would not require compensation for employees who are not scheduled and ready for work and for whom there is no available work to be performed. Thus, in contrast to the Agency's contention that the provision would require indiscriminate payments to employees who are not working, it would be operative only when the Agency has already determined that the employees' services are necessary because work is available to be performed and has scheduled the employees to work at particular times. Accordingly, the provision is consistent in this regard with the Comptroller General decision cited by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_721"></span>Second, although stating that the employees "are not entitled to payment under law and government wide regulations[,]" the Agency has not cited any laws or regulations, other than the references to call-back overtime and standby discussed below, that it claims would prevent the Agency from compensating employees in the manner described in the provision. In this connection, the Agency has not set forth the applicable legal and regulatory provisions governing pay for temporary, seasonal and intermittent employees and has not stated in what manner Provision 1 is inconsistent with such provisions. The Agency's mere allegation that payment may not be made does not satisfy the obligation of parties to create a record on which the Authority can make a negotiability determination....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that, although the provision references pay for employees, the effect of the provision is comparable to placing employees on administrative leave during periods of agency closings. In fact, the Union variously refers to the provision as requiring either pay or the application of administrative leave. The Agency also views the provision as requiring paid dismissal for employees. When so viewed, the Agency argues that the provision does not comport with the provisions of the FPM pertaining to administrative leave. The Agency further argues that paid dismissal without regard to the employees' entitlement to leave is inconsistent with other provisions of the FPM. These assertions must be rejected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Administrative leave is defined as "an absence from duty administratively authorized without loss of pay and without charge to leave." FPM chapter 630, subchapter 11-7. Group dismissals are authorized for employees "when conditions are severe or where normal agency operations would be significantly disrupted." FPM chapter 610, subchapter 3-3. The FPM includes as reasons permitting group dismissals "interruption of transportation or building services[,]" supplying such examples as "malfunctioning equipment" and "renovation of facilities, etc." FPM chapter 610, subchapter 3-6. Also contained in FPM chapter 610, subchapter 3-2, are examples of situations in which agency operations may be curtailed. Included are extreme weather conditions, interruptions of transportation or building services and better utilization of funds or resources. In finding that Provision 1 is intended to apply when there are interruptions to the Agency's operations due to "events beyond the control of management or employees such as rain, equipment failure, etc[,]" we conclude that the use of administrative leave in such circumstances is consistent with the applicable provisions of the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, we find nothing in the FPM provisions that would preclude the granting of administrative leave to the categories of employees specified in Provision 1. In fact, with respect to intermittent employees, the decision in Comp. Gen. B-233656 establishes that administrative leave may be authorized for such employees when there is sufficient work to perform but circumstances beyond the control of management or the employees prevents the employees from performing their duties. We further find no basis on which to limit the availability of administrative leave for intermittent employees only to the type of situation present in that Comptroller General decision, namely, the closing of an office due to a waterline break. Rather, the FPM provisions outlining the appropriate use of administrative leave are not limited to that particular type of "emergency" but, rather, are more encompassing. As stated above, we view the circumstances under which administrative leave would be granted under the provision to intermittent employees, as well as temporary and seasonal employees, to be consistent with the types of situations for which administrative leave may be authorized under the FPM.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that under the relevant provisions of the FPM the Agency has the discretion to negotiate over the authorization of administrative leave.&#x2003;In this regard, the Authority previously has addressed the negotiability of proposals authorizing administrative leave for various activities, including those encompassed by Provision 1. In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 2119 and U.S. Department of the Army, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock</span> <span class="Italic">Island, Illinois</span>, 42 FLRA 993 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Rock Island Arsenal</span>), for example, we found negotiable a proposal that required the agency to place employees on 40 hours of administrative leave for the period of a holiday shutdown. We found that the FPM vests agencies with the discretion to grant administrative leave in certain situations for brief periods of time and that such discretion is subject to negotiations. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C.</span>, 43 FLRA 414, 430-31 (1991) (proposal requiring agency to permit employee to remain on duty or grant administrative leave when agency decides employee's services are not needed on a particular day found negotiable).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency claims that the provision interferes with the right to determine the number of employees under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute because it would require the Agency to find work for employees who choose to remain at the worksite after being released from duty. According to the Agency, this would have the effect of requiring the Agency to employ a greater number of employees than would otherwise be necessary. Contrary to this contention, we find nothing in the provision that would require the Agency to keep on duty employees who are prevented from performing their work. The provision is concerned only with compensation and not with assigning work. Therefore, it would not require the Agency to find other work for employees to perform.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's assertion that the provision directly interferes with management's rights to layoff and direct employees similarly is predicated on the view that the provision would require the Agency to find work for employees who choose to remain at the worksite after being released from duty. The Agency further argues that the provision would prevent the Agency from curtailing its operations. Finally, and more specifically as to the right to direct employees, the Agency maintains that the provision would allow employees, rather than management, to determine who will remain on duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we found above, nothing in the provision would require the Agency to keep on duty employees who are prevented from performing their work or to find other work for the employees to perform. Additionally, we find that nothing in the provision suggests that employees, rather than management, would determine when duties could not be performed. The portion of the provision referring to circumstances beyond an employee's control simply serves to define the occasions on which administrative leave may be authorized and does not lead to the conclusion that employees would decide when they will remain on duty. We also find that the provision would not prevent the Agency from curtailing its operations. Rather, the provision is designed to take effect only after management has determined that there are circumstances preventing employees from performing their work....</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the now defunct FPM provisions provided examples of situations where a grant of administrative leave is appropriate, nothing in the provisions prevented an agency from determining in its internal regulations that there may be other situations supporting a grant of an employee's request for administrative leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and Nat'l INS Serv. Council, Local 46 AFGE</span>, 48 FLRA 1269, 1276 (1993) (on exceptions to arbitration award). Collective bargaining proposals attempt to expand upon the regulatory conditions supporting a grant of administrative leave. Management rights defenses are argued to block those proposals. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, IRS</span>, 39 FLRA 27, 43 (1991), ruled nonnegotiable Provision 5, requiring grants of administrative leave for employees to sit for bar or CPA examinations: "The Authority has held consistently that proposals concerning leave which eliminate management's discretion to determine whether an employee is to remain on duty to perform necessary work are nonnegotiable because they directly interfere with the right to assign work...." The same result was reached in <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 722 (1992) (Provision 11). A proposal for release from work without being charged leave to attend various Boy Scout and Girl Scout activities was a nonnegotiable interference with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2022 and Dept. of Army, Hq., 101st Airborne Div., Ft. Campbell</span>, 40 FLRA 371, 378-380 (1991) (Proposal 2).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although not determinative of negotiability issues, the Merit Systems Protection Board provided its views of administrative leave authority for agencies in the context of settlement of a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOD</span>, 45 MSPR 263, 266-67 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Such an excused absence is commonly referred to as "administrative leave."<span class="Italic"> See </span>FPM Chapter 630, Subchapter 11, 11-1 and FPM Supp. 990-2, Subchapter 11, at 11-1. There is no general statutory provision authorizing such excused absences, although there are certain very specific statutory provisions authorizing leave from official duty status without loss of pay, benefits or charge to leave to which an employee is otherwise entitled.[5] In addition, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has noted that agencies have discretion to determine situations in which they will excuse employees from duty without charge to leave and may by administrative regulations place any limitations or restrictions they feel are needed on the use of such leave.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6322 authorizing leave for jury or witness service; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6326 authorizing absence in connection with funeral of an immediate relative in the Armed Forces. In addition, as a matter of executive policy, brief excused absences are authorized for purposes of registration and voting, and under E.O. 10529 of April, 1954, a reasonable amount of excused time is provided for participation in Federally recognized civil defense programs.<span class="Italic"> See </span>FPM Chapter 630, S11-2-3, FPM Supp. 990-2, S11-2-3.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Common situations in which agencies generally excuse absence are blood donation, tardiness and brief absences, taking examinations, attending conferences or conventions, representing employee organizations and group dismissals when agencies are closed.<span class="Italic"> See </span>FPM Supp. 990-2, S11-5-6.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Comptroller General has recognized that "in the absence of specific statutory authority, the head of an agency may, in certain situations, excuse an employee for brief periods of time without a charge to leave <span id="page_722"></span>or loss of pay."<span class="Italic"> See </span>67 Comp. Gen. 126, 127 (1987). The Comptroller General, however, has repeatedly stated that its decisions and OPM guidelines "limit an agency's discretion to grant administrative leave to brief absences." (Emphasis added.) In addition, the Comptroller General has held that where an absence is for a lengthy period of time, excused absence is not appropriate "unless the absence is in connection with furthering a function of the agency."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 128.<span class="Italic"> See also</span> 64 Comp. Gen. 542, 544 (1984); Elmer DeRitter, Jr., 61 Comp. Gen. 652, 653 (1982). Thus, the Comptroller General has explicitly held that in the absence of statutory authority, "it would not approve a proposal under which absences would be granted for extended periods of time." 67 Comp. Gen. at 128; 53 Comp. Gen. 1054 (1974).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its advisory opinion to the Board, the Comptroller General referred to General Accounting Office (GAO) precedent on the issue of extended grants of excused absence reiterating that in the absence of statutory authority for such leave, an agency's discretion in granting such leave is limited to brief periods of time. Extended periods of administrative leave are only warranted when in furtherance of any agency's mission.<span class="Italic"> See </span>B-236124, January 2, 1990, PFR File, Tab 22. With reference to the administrative leave at issue in the instant case, the Comptroller General opined that the award would not further any purpose or function of the Department of Defense, because the agency "would be expending appropriate funds without receiving any benefit in kind since Mr. Miller would be paid to stay at home."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 2. The opinion further states that the fact that the administrative leave was granted in an agreement in settlement of a personnel action does not change the result because even though agencies have broad settlement authority, "such settlements cannot include benefits which the agency does not have authority to provide."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 3, citing to Albert D. Parker, 64 Com. Gen. 349, 354 (1985). Thus, the opinion concludes that the proposed award of administrative leave is unauthorized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of any authority that agencies are empowered to grant administrative leave for extended periods of time, unless in furtherance of an agency's mission, and in light of The Comptroller General's specific advice to the Board that it does not find the settlement provision in furtherance of the agency's mission, we find that provision 4 of the settlement agreement is unlawful....</p>
<p class="noindent">Excessive reliance on administrative leave to rid the workplace of a problem employee while maintaining the taxpayers' burden of paying an employee to do nothing was addressed through legislation enacted in 2016, as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, restricting administrative leave to no more than 10 work days annually, with periods of leave for 30 days, subject to extension, for employees who are under OIG investigation or pending notice for an adverse or performance-based action whose retention at work during that period would pose a threat to the government interests or public safety and whose alternate placement cannot be arranged. The statutory provisions become effective after issuance of OPM regulations and implementing agency policies. Refer to 5 USC 6329a-c, enacted at the end of 2016, governing administrative leave, investigative leave and notice leave, and weather and safety leave.
