<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-183"><span class="space">c.</span> Balancing Official Time and Work Needs</h5>
<p class="noindent">The removal of an employee from assigned duties because of the employee's protected union activity ordinarily is a ULP. FLRA recognizes, however, that conflicts may arise between the rights of employees and the rights and duties of management. Section 7101 of the Statute provides both for the right of employees to participate in the collective bargaining process and for the safeguarding of the public interest in maintaining an effective and efficient government. Irreconcilable conflicts may arise between management's right to insist on the performance of a job that cannot be deferred and an employee's right to engage in protected union activity, e.g., representation. If those conflicts arise, management must be free to assign the employee, without loss of pay, to other duties that will not impair any essential function of the agency but that will permit the employee to perform those other duties and engage in protected union activities. It is the burden of management when exercising that right, however, to show that a different assignment is warranted. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard, Portsmouth and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 15 FLRA 867, 867-68 (1984). [Refer in Chapter 3 to "<a href="0100-2023-11-039.html#sec3-40">Full-Time Representatives</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-11-040.html#sec3-41">Unrestricted Block Grants of Time</a>," of decisions involving full-time union representatives and the negotiation of unrestricted block grants of official time; refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-165.html#sec8-165">Performance Appraisal; Balancing Workload</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Reassignment of a union steward or officer from one building of a complex to another to avoid excessive official time used to travel between the two sites for representational duties was not discriminatory. The steward was treated the same as other employees involved in a transfer to eliminate unnecessary loss of production time to travel between two buildings; there was no discriminatory motive. It was no more than a "fortuitous circumstance" that a union-related matter was what precipitated the action taken. The union has the right to assign stewards where it deems them necessary, and the steward has the right to accept the assignment, but management also has the right to run an efficient and economic operation. A transfer of the steward to accommodate those interests was not interference. It was based on legitimate considerations and involved no loss of pay, status, or job change. Although supervision changed, and there was also a change in free parking, the public interest was better served by management's actions. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 18 FLRA 55, 67 (1985) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency properly denied official time to a person designated as a union negotiator whose regularly assigned duties were performed under time constraints dictated by a congressional mandate. He was one of five designated members of the union team. It was not shown that he was essential to the functioning of the union team so that his absence required the union to discontinue negotiations or that the right to name another representative in his place was requested or denied. The right to choose employees as members of a union bargaining team is not absolute. <span class="Italic">Fed. R.R. Admin. and AFGE Local 2814</span>, 21 FLRA 508, 511 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">Management's statement to a union official that he might be disciplined if he did not take agency work needs into account when demanding official time for union activities was not a violation of the Statute. Management had a legitimate dispute with the union official as to whether a contract grant of reasonable official time entitled him to spend nearly full time on union activities. Management needed the employee to perform agency work that was not being accomplished as a result of the use of official time. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 14 FLRA 289 (1984), <span class="Italic">remanded</span>, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 v. FLRA</span>, 770 F.2d 1223, 1224-27 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Remanding, the D.C. Circuit advised:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Under the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the union and the base, Denton was entitled to a "reasonable" amount of official time to conduct union representational activities. These activities took up a substantial portion of his work week--between 47 percent and 92 percent....&#8197;The remainder of his 40-hour work week was spent at his computer-analyst duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n his capacity as union president, Denton began negotiations with the base to conclude a collective bargaining agreement....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...He then submitted...his projected work schedule...showing that 100 percent of his time would be spent on union business....&#8197;Denton's second-line supervisor...said "...if you don't start doing more work for me, I'm going to take disciplinary measures against you."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...He asked Denton to postpone contract negotiations....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>

<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...After reviewing the circumstances of these incidents, the ALJ made the following crucial finding: "Taking all of the evidence into consideration, I conclude that Mr. Denton's supervisors were threatening disciplinary action only based upon his work performance during the time he was actually on the job." We cannot comprehend how the ALJ arrived at this conclusion. It follows on the heels of his finding that [the supervisors] were trying "to persuade Mr. Denton to moderate his demands [for union time]....&#8197;These preliminary findings simply do not support, and indeed positively contradict, the conclusion that [the supervisors] were threatening disciplinary action only based upon [Denton's] work performance."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...While the base could not lawfully threaten disciplinary action against an employee for spending authorized time--even if an unreasonable amount of time had been authorized--on union activities, it assuredly <span class="Italic">could</span> refuse to authorize an unreasonable amount of time. In the context of the present case, the complaints about excessive time spent by Denton on union duties in the past and the accompanying threats of disciplinary action if that continued might conceivably be interpreted as the equivalent of notice that future requests for authorization of unreasonable time would be denied, and that the expenditure of unauthorized time would be punished. We deem it inappropriate, therefore, to conclude at this stage that the agency was wrong in finding no violation of the Act; but hold only that it was assuredly not right for the reasons stated. Accordingly, we remand...for further consideration....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reaffirmed its first decision. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 20 FLRA 761, 764-66 (1985). The second <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> decision determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t appears that the events complained of arose out of a conflict between the employee's need for official time for representational functions and the respondent's need for his time and work on the CAPS project, which conflict reached an acute stage when the CAPS audits were in progress. As the Authority has explained in other contexts, such conflicts between employees' entitlements to official time for representational functions under section 7131 of the Statute and the entitlements of management under section 7106 of the Statute to manage consistent with an effective and efficient Government can be expected, and when such conflicts arise, the parties must recognize the need for and seek a reasonable accommodation....&#8197;[M]anagement cannot deny official time for representational functions to a representative of the exclusive representative unless it can show that the use of official time will interfere with the accomplishment of the agency's work. Nor may management reassign an employee unless it can demonstrate that the employee's use of official time for representational functions interferes with the employee's performance of assigned work. On the other hand, the Authority has also explained that an exclusive representative cannot claim that it is entitled to negotiate or administer a contract provision regarding the allocation of official time for representational functions by a particular employee without regard to management's needs and requirements regarding the performance of its assigned work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having restated the foregoing principles, the Authority notes that the question of whether employee Denton or the Respondent's supervisors should have yielded concerning their mutual difficulties regarding Denton's use of official time is not directly presented in this case. However, the Authority concludes, based on the entire record, that it was this issue which gave rise to and wholly underlies the dispute. The CAPS project had reached a point where its further development depended on the success of the audits. The work which had been assigned to Denton was crucial for the audits, and that work was not being done. At about the same time that the completion of his assigned work on the project was becoming more important, Denton was devoting increasing amounts of his time to the performance of representational functions, and correspondingly less time to the project. Acutely aware of their problems, the supervisors sought an accommodation. Based on our reading of the record, the supervisors were merely seeking an accommodation with Denton in discussing the matter with him. They needed Denton to perform a certain amount of work during the brief period remaining before the next audit of the CAPS project, which he alone was qualified to perform, and therefore twice attempted to talk him into it. Denton did not cooperate, however. At the first late afternoon meeting, he simply smiled and walked out. At the second meeting the next day, he was silent and unresponsive. On both occasions Serksnas, the second-level supervisor, appears to have become exasperated. <span id="Page_1421"></span>Interchangeably he referred to his need for some work, his need for some time, how much time the employee was spending on representational functions, and the possibility of disciplinary action. In the context of the instant case, the Authority concludes that Serksnas was solely and wholly interested in reaching a meaningful accommodation with Denton regarding completion of Denton's work on the CAPS project, and that Denton reasonably should have understood that and that the supervisor's comments were, in large part, provoked by Denton's own unresponsiveness and seeming lack of cooperation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this factual context, we are unable to conclude that Serksnas' comment that it was unfair for Denton to schedule all of his time for union activities constituted a violation of the Statute, particularly where this comment amounted to no more than the converse of the supervisor's additional statement that the employee was not completing his assigned work. Regarding Serksnas' related comments on potential disciplinary action, the court stated in its remand decision that it was not clear to the court what the supervisor meant, suggesting that he may have meant only that he would begin to deny the employee's unreasonable requests for official time to perform representational functions in the future. As the court further indicated, such a denial might accord with the Respondent's rights, and a threat of such action would therefore not constitute a violation of the Statute. Upon reevaluation of the entire record, we conclude that these remarks, as explained above, were not, in their entire context, unlawful threats against an employee for his exercise of rights protected by the Statute, but rather an attempt by management to impress upon the employee how important it was for him to perform his work assignments during the period immediately ahead. Moreover, in the absence of any record evidence of union animus by the Respondent, and from the entire context of the conversations, we further conclude that the supervisor's remarks should reasonably have been understood by Denton as pertaining to the need for him to complete his work on the CAPS project. Further, the record does not show that Denton was in fact disciplined, or that any further requests for official time to engage in protected activities (reasonable or otherwise) were denied, or indeed that the Respondent denied the very requests that gave rise to the incidents here in question. We are thus also unable to conclude that Denton, or any other employee, was restrained, coerced, or threatened in the exercise of any right accorded them under the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, having reconsidered all the facts and circumstances of this case in light of the court's concerns in remanding the case to us, we reaffirm our original Order that the consolidated complaint in these cases be dismissed</p>

<p class="noindent">An activity interfered with protected rights when, during an interview used to select an individual for a vacancy, a representative of the labor organization was asked about his position in the union, how many hours he spent in activities for the union, and how he would resolve hypothetical conflicts between work and his union activities. The context of the questioning established a connection between the protected activity and the employee's chance to be selected for the position. If conflicts between official-time use and work arise, the parties must seek reasonable accommodation. In the context of a job interview, no conflicts had arisen. <span class="Italic">VAMC, Reg'l Office, Sioux Falls and AFGE Local 1509</span>, 23 FLRA 122, 124 (1986); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3446 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 43 FLRA 467, 475 (1991) (applying <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> analysis in context of arbitration award directing management to honor grievant's request for reassignment to position that was denied to the grievant because of time involved in his union activities).
