<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-243"><span class="space">6.</span> Collective Bargaining Contract Exclusivity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A collective bargaining agreement cannot confer jurisdiction on the Board if the employee would not otherwise have the right to appeal. <span class="Italic">Allen v. DHUD</span>, 5 MSPR 259, 259-60, 5 MSPB 297 (1981); <span class="Italic">Gordon v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 206, 208, 5 MSPB 257 (1981) (probationary employee). Assuming the right to appeal, however, &#x00A7; 7121 may defeat Board jurisdiction either through the subject matter of the case, if the contract is exclusive and no EEO allegation is raised, or through an employee's choice of remedies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the case involves something other than an adverse action or unacceptable performance action, contract exclusivity may defeat Board jurisdiction because no election of remedies may be possible. The statute makes contract remedies exclusive with the exceptions already noted: first, for adverse actions and performance actions, and for other appealable actions involving EEO allegations, the employee may choose between the negotiated and statutory appeals procedures; second, if an EEO allegation is raised and decided as to a grievance of a matter otherwise within the Board's jurisdiction, the Board may review the case following the final decision of the arbitrator. There is a third exception, involving contracts that specifically exclude certain cases from the negotiated procedure; those cases are within the Board's jurisdiction assuming other statutory requirements are met. 5 USC 7121(a)(2). However, assuming no contract exclusion, no adverse action or performance case, and no EEO allegation concerning an otherwise appealable matter, the contract may, by the exclusivity of its grievance procedure, defeat Board jurisdiction. That contract would defeat Board jurisdiction in cases involving within-grade increase denials or reductions in force. Analysis is required of the nature of the contract and the coverage of the grievance procedure should the bargaining unit employee attempt a Board appeal arguably covered by the negotiated grievance procedure. Analysis may also be required of the personnel action appealed. A separation by RIF may be appealable only through the processes, discussed below, of the negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure. But if an individual resigns in lieu of separation by RIF, the resignation may be appealable as a constructive adverse action through a Board appeal or through the grievance process, at the election of the employee. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 76 MSPR 43, 44-45 (1997). [Refer to Chapter 10 on RIF, "Jurisdictional Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract," to Chapter 9, "Effect of Collective Bargaining Contract" involving within-grade increase appeals, to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-248.html#sec5-247">Review of Arbitration Awards</a>," and to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-012.html#sec6-13">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."] [Individual Right of Action appeals, discussed in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, add Board jurisdiction for many personnel actions alleged to resulted from whistleblower reprisal, and statutory elections are discussed in "Grievance or MSPB Appeal."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional maze was explored in a reduction in force case. The Board has appellate jurisdiction under 5 USC 7513(d) to hear the appeals of employees against whom RIF action was taken under 5 CFR 351.901 (2022). The appellate jurisdiction of the Board may be limited, however, if a negotiated grievance procedure is established by the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the agency and its employees. Explaining the impact on Board jurisdiction of 5 USC 7121, <span class="Italic">Sirkin v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 16 MSPR 432, 435-36 (1983), not involving an allegation of discrimination, informs us:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of 5 USC 7121 indicates that Congress intended the exclusivity of the negotiated grievance procedure to be quite broad. Under the original House of Representatives draft...all employees were specifically afforded the choice of having their grievance processed under the negotiated grievance procedure or any applicable appeals procedure pursuant to law. If the subject matter of the grievance came under 5 USC 7116, relating to unfair labor practices, the employee could, in addition, elect to pursue proceedings in accordance with 5 USC 7118. Therefore, under the House draft the employee conceivably had a choice of three procedures: appeal procedures to the Board, unfair labor practices proceedings, and negotiated grievance procedures....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This original House draft...was replaced by a Senate draft which greatly restricted the employee's choice of procedures. While the House draft did not limit the employee to negotiated grievance procedures in any type of grievance, with the exception of certain adverse actions and discrimination complaints, the Senate draft dictated that where the grievance fell within the coverage of negotiated grievance procedures both union and non-union members of the bargaining unit must use the negotiated procedures to resolve the grievance.... This latter, more restrictive draft was eventually enacted into law, with only minor changes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7121(a), as finally enacted, except as otherwise provided in 7121, an action which fell within the coverage of the agreement, which is not specifically excluded from grievance procedures, was deemed to be included and could be grieved only under negotiated grievance procedures.... Such an action is not appealable to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board rejected Sirkin's argument that her RIF was an adverse action because it involved a downgrading. A reduction in grade taken as a RIF, rather than one taken for disciplinary reasons, is not an adverse action. The negotiated grievance procedure defined "grievance" as encompassing any complaint by an employee concerning any matter relating to employment. The Board, concluding that a reduction in grade under a RIF fell within the definition of a grievance and within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure, and determining that 5 USC 7121 did not statutorily or optionally exempt RIF actions from grievance coverage, decided that the appeal was not within the Board's jurisdiction; it was dismissed. The Board's approach is consistent: if the negotiated grievance procedure covers the RIF, it is the exclusive means for resolution of the RIF challenge. <span class="Italic">Sotak v. DHUD</span>, 19 MSPR 569, 570-71 (1984). The basic rule was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Patterson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 413, 415-16 (1989): the negotiated grievance procedure divests the Board of original jurisdiction over a RIF. Under <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, the Board might consider an appeal based on the allegation that an employee involuntarily retired as a result of an improper RIF; in that appeal the retirement issue would have to be properly pleaded, i.e., a nonfrivolous allegation would be required to vest jurisdiction in the Board. <span class="Italic">See Lankford v.

<p class="Body-Text">For a contract to protect an employee's access to the Board in a case not involving an elective statutory right of appeal, the contract must affirmatively exclude from the grievance procedure the subject matter of the case. Board jurisdiction is not preserved if the contract provides a choice to the employee between arbitration and the MSPB as to matters not accompanied by a statutory appeal election, <span class="Italic">Dunklebarger v. MSPB</span>, 130 F.3d 1476, 1477-80 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (restoration rights):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The collective bargaining agreement between the agency and the American Federation of Government Employees establishes grievance <span id="Page_397"></span>procedures by which employees may seek relief from employment-related complaints falling within the scope of the grievance mechanism. The collective bargaining agreement provides that the grievance procedure "does not deny any employee the right to select any statutory procedure available under any existing law which has not been excluded under [the grievance] procedure. The employee may use either procedure but not both." In its letter to Mr. Dunklebarger advising him that he was being removed for disability, the agency interpreted that provision of the collective bargaining agreement as giving him the choice of either contractual or statutory remedies. The letter informed him that if he wished to seek review of the decision to remove him, he could either invoke the grievance mechanism or take an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Mr. Dunklebarger did not appeal his removal, but instead appealed the agency's refusal to reinstate him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121 of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 USC 7121, addresses the allocation of jurisdiction over employment-related complaints by federal employees who are represented by a union. Section 7121 (a) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any collective bargaining agreement shall provide procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability. Except as provided in subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, the procedures shall be the exclusive administrative procedures for resolving grievances which fall within its coverage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Any collective bargaining agreement may exclude any matter from the application of the grievance procedures which are provided for in the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the text indicates, section 7121(a)(1) requires that collective bargaining agreements with federal agencies contain negotiated grievance procedures, and it contemplates that in most cases the negotiated grievance procedures will be the exclusive means of resolving employment disputes. In three specified instances involving certain prohibited personnel practices and certain agency actions for unacceptable performance, the employee is given the choice of proceeding by way of the grievance mechanism, if it is available, or by an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, but not both. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(d), (e), (g); 5 CFR 1201.3(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7121(a)(2), which permits the parties to exclude "any matter" from the grievance procedures, was designed to give the union and the agency flexibility to reduce the scope of the grievance procedures if they so choose. <span class="Italic">See</span> 124 Cong. Rec. 38,717 (1978) (statement of Rep. Ford). The decision of the agency and the union to remove particular matters from the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedures results in eliminating the employees' right to grieve such matters and leaving the employees with the sole option of appealing to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dunklebarger argues that section 7121(a)(2) permits the union and the agency to allow an employee to choose between the grievance mechanism and an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board on any potentially grievable matter. We disagree with that interpretation of the statute. In our view, section 7121(a)(2) permits the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to exclude particular types of claims from the grievance mechanism, and thus remit employees with such claims to their rights before the Merit Systems Protection Board. We do not agree with Mr. Dunklebarger that the statute permits an employee to elect between the grievance mechanism and an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, except with respect to the specific matters excluded from the operation of section 7121(a) by other subsections of section 7121.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dunklebarger's interpretation of section 7121(a)(2) would undermine a basic purpose of section 7121(a)(1), which is to provide for the exclusive use of the grievance process in all matters to which the grievance process applies, with the explicit exceptions of those categories set forth in the other subsections of section 7121. <span class="Italic">See Muniz v. United States</span>, 972 F.2d 1304, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("the Congressionally unambiguous and unmistakable preference for exclusivity of arbitration is a central part of the comprehensive overhaul of the civil service system provided by the CSRA"). If section 7121(a)(2) were given the broad construction urged by Mr. Dunklebarger, it would permit collective bargaining agreements that would dramatically expand the number of matters in which an employee could choose between alternative remedies, in derogation of section 7121's basic purpose--to channel more employee complaints into the negotiated grievance process. We therefore agree with the Board that in referring to those "matters" that could be excluded from the grievance process pursuant to section 7121 (a)(2), Congress intended to refer to general subject matters, not to any complaint that a particular employee wishes to pursue through an appeal to the Board rather than through the grievance mechanism.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court has not previously had occasion to decide the issue presented by this case, but our ruling today is consistent with the analysis in the court's <span class="Italic">in banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span>, 909 F.2d 1452, 1455 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In that case, the court noted that the issue of overtime compensation falls within the grievance procedures, and is thus not subject to a Board appeal, "unless the parties otherwise agree." The context of that statement makes it clear that the court was referring to an agreement to exclude overtime compensation from the grievance process altogether, not to an agreement to allow some employees to choose a Board appeal for overtime compensation disputes and other employees to choose the grievance mechanism. Thus, <span class="Italic">Carter v. Gibbs</span> stands for the proposition that under section 7121, a collective bargaining agreement that includes particular matters within the grievance process has the effect of depriving employees of recourse to alternative remedies to which they otherwise would have access. Nothing in the <span class="Italic">Carter</span> decision, or in any other decision of this court, supports the proposition that Congress intended to permit collective bargaining agreements to enlarge the rights of employees to choose among alternative remedies for disputes falling outside the specific subject matters designated in sections 7121(d), (e), and (g). To the contrary, the language and legislative history of the statute indicate that Congress intended simply to permit the parties to collective bargaining agreements to elect whether to exclude particular subject matters from the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dunklebarger argues that even if he is wrong in his proposed construction of section 7121, this court should nonetheless reverse the Board, for several reasons. First, he contends that the agency, having advised him that he had the choice of proceeding by way of the grievance mechanism or by way of an appeal to the Board, should not be heard to argue that the Board lacks jurisdiction over his appeal. While the agency's position has indeed been inconsistent, an agency cannot by acquiescence confer jurisdiction on the Merit Systems Protection Board to hear an appeal that Congress has not authorized the Board to entertain. It is well settled that no action of the parties can confer subject-matter jurisdiction on a tribunal and that the principles of estoppel do not apply to vest subject-matter jurisdiction where Congress has not done so<span class="Italic">. See Insurance Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee</span>, 456 U.S. 694, 702, 102 S. Ct. 2099, 2104, 72 L. Ed.2d 492 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Dunklebarger makes the related argument that the Board's first decision in this case, remanding the case to the administrative judge for a hearing on the merits, was law of the case and prohibited the administrative judge from dismissing the appeal on jurisdictional grounds. In its first order, however, the Board did not address the jurisdictional issue presented here. In any event, this court would have an independent obligation to address the Board's jurisdiction, even if the Board had concluded that it had jurisdiction to decide Mr. Dunklebarger's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Mr. Dunklebarger argues that because he was no longer an employee of the agency at the time he sought reinstatement, he was not eligible to use the grievance procedures in the collective bargaining agreement, and his exclusive remedy was therefore an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board. Mr. Dunklebarger does not point to any provision of the collective bargaining agreement that would deny him access to the grievance mechanism, and this court has held that, absent specific provision to the contrary in the collective bargaining agreement, a former federal employee whose claims were grievable when they arose continues to have access to the negotiated grievance procedures. <span class="Italic">See Sample v. United States</span>, 65 F.3d 939, 940-41 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Aamodt v. United States</span>, 976 F.2d 691, 692-93 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Muniz v. United States</span>, 972 F.2d at 1311-12, 1318.</p>
