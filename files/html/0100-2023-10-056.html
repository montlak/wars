<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-56"><span class="space">4.</span> Prehearing Conference</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">As the Board attempts to reduce the duration of hearings, prehearing conferences become more significant in defining issues and determining relevant bounds of evidence. In most appeals, several conferences occur among the parties, their representatives and the AJ. Conversations with the parties, an important part of the prehearing process, are a normal part of an AJ's work. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 45 MSPR 595, 598 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bergman v. DOJ</span>, 56 MSPR 42, 45 (1992) (dismissing a complaint by the appellant that he was phoned at work concerning his compliance petition with the observation that "absent evidence that the appellant has asked not to be phoned at work, we must infer that, once the appellant filed his petition for enforcement, he exhibited a willingness to be phoned by the AJ or the agency in order that the petition might be adjudicated.")<span class="Italic">. But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 87 MSPR 313, 318 n.2 (2000) ("We do not find that there must be a prehearing conference in every case, or that it must always be held on a date different from the date of hearing.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">During the course of the appeal progressing to a hearing, one prehearing conference will be devoted to an analysis of the issues of the case and the identification of witnesses who will testify at the hearing and documents that will be introduced as hearing evidence. Should one party refuse to participate in a prehearing conference, the AJ may inform that party that its failure to participate will be construed as a waiver of the rule against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications with the other party. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Buckley v. OPM</span>, 46 MSPR 172, 176 (1990) (noting, however, that the waiver of a party's right to participate in the conference did not extend to a waiver of participation in other components of the case). [Refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-294.html#sec2-291">Sanctions</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prehearing conferences assume particular significance under current MSPB rules, 5 CFR 1201.24(b) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may raise a claim or defense not included in the appeal at any time before the end of the conference(s) held to define the issues in the case. An appellant may not raise a new claim or defense after that time, except for good cause shown. However, a claim or defense not included in the appeal may be excluded if a party shows that including it would result in undue prejudice.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The ability of the parties to address issues raised at the point of the prehearing conference was stressed in <span class="Italic">Ramey v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 463, 467 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding in the initial decision, the appellant's allegation that the agency violated the FMLA was timely raised. An appellant may raise a claim or defense not included in the appeal at any time before the end of the conferences held to define the issues in the case, unless including it would result in undue prejudice to a party. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.24(b). The appellant's counsel raised the FMLA issue upon entering his appearance, arguing specifically that the case may involve "violations of the Family Medical Leave Act [sic] 29 USC 2601 and 5 USC 6381." Two telephonic conferences with the parties were held thereafter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board described the necessity for and the proper conduct of prehearing and status conferences in Chapter 9 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PURPOSES OF CONFERENCES</span>. The purposes of the prehearing and status conferences are to do the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Explain Board procedures to the parties;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Facilitate discovery;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;Identify, narrow, and define the issues;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;Obtain stipulations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;Discuss the possibility of settlement;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">f.&#x2003;Rule on witnesses; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">g.&#x2003;Rule on exhibits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ISSUANCE OF STANDARD ORDERS--"BURGESS" NOTICE</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;HotDocs includes many inserts and stand-alone documents that are intended to inform the parties of the requirements for proof of jurisdiction and/or the merits on the type of appeal filed and the affirmative defenses associated with it. Such notices satisfy the parties' right to a fair process and are known as <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> orders because of the decision in <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641 (Fed. Cir. 1985), which requires such notice before an adverse ruling may be made. To the extent necessary or appropriate, AJs may and should modify these standard orders to more precisely fit the circumstances of any individual appeal, but should not delete information from standard documents that is designed to meet <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice requirements. In many situations where it appears that an appellant has not raised an issue, subsequent events may indicate that he believed that he had done so. If the standard document was sent out, then the issue can be addressed without further delay later in the appeal and the Board, on review, will see that the record shows that the appellant was fully informed of the burdens and standards of proof of the claim, thereby perhaps avoiding a remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Video-conference hearing</span>. If a hearing is to be held by video-conference, the agency may be directed to locate and make available a video conference site. For guidance regarding video-conference hearings, see chapters 4 and 10 of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bench decision</span>. An AJ must notify the parties of the possibility of and the procedures for requesting a bench decision in the <span id="Page_1346"></span>hearing order. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 4, section 3, and chapter 12, section 5a of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NUMBER OF CONFERENCES REQUIRED</span>. At least one prehearing conference or one status conference must be held in every case. Exceptions to this policy are the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Cases that are obviously untimely or not within the Board's jurisdiction;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Cases in which appellants have not provided their telephone numbers and the numbers cannot readily be obtained; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;Certain overseas cases--such as Filipino retirement cases--when an attempt to hold such conferences would be impractical.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;Addendum cases which, in the discretion of the AJ, do not require a conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">METHOD OF CONFERENCES</span>. Prehearing or status conferences may be held by telephone, video-conference, or in person. The agency, with the possible exception of OPM in retirement cases, may be required to make arrangements for a telephonic or video conference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RECORD OF CONFERENCES</span>. The AJ must prepare, or have a party prepare, prehearing or status conference summary when any rulings were made or agreements reached on issues (including affirmative defenses), witnesses, exhibits, stipulations, etc. In the alternative, the AJ may memorialize the prehearing conference by using the telephone system to record the conversation, from which a CD can be made and placed into the electronic record as an audio file. Otherwise, an audio tape or CD may be made of the conference and included in the record or, before the hearing begins, a summary of the prehearing or status conference may be read into the hearing record. However accomplished, the goal is to assure that all issues raised and all rulings made are preserved for the record. Prehearing may be recorded either by audio taping or video taping only after the AJ informs all parties that the conference is being recorded, and that all parties' consent to electronic recording may be required under some state privacy statutes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Cal. Pen. C. &#x00A7; 632. The former is a matter of policy that the Board may properly determine, but whether the Board is subject to the various state laws concerning consent to electronic recording is less clear. The matter has not been addressed in a published Board decision. Until it is, or until more definitive guidance is provided, the AJ should direct that a party (who raises a claim that the conference may not be recorded) fully brief the issue, including whether the Board is subject to any state-imposed restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board, of course, must rely on the record when a PFR is filed. In the absence of a complete summary of all conference rulings etc., it may find no support for a statement or action of the AJ that is reflected in the ID or the proceedings leading to it. Thus, inadequate documentation of prehearing rulings may lead to unnecessary reversals or remands. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Conant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 148 (1998) (AJ's statement that the appellant withdrew her hearing request found inadequate proof of waiver where circumstances of the withdrawal were not fully described and record was not documented to show that she had been informed of her options). For this reason, and to help avoid the possibility that memories will differ between the parties and the AJ, even when there were no rulings made or agreements reached it is preferred practice to issue a summary so stating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conference record must identify all issues that the AJ has accepted for adjudication, and the parties must be informed that they will be limited to those issues cited (unless a party can establish that the issue belatedly being raised could not have been previously known despite due diligence). When the AJ rejects an issue, any objection to the AJ's ruling should be addressed in the conference record. If there are no material differences in the parties' statements of facts and issues, the conference record may incorporate the parties' statements by reference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except when the prehearing conference is recorded or read into the hearing record, the AJ should advise the parties that, if they believe the conference record inaccurately summarizes the prehearing conference, they should call the AJ to arrange a conference call to resolve the alleged inaccuracies before the hearing or submit exceptions to the conference record in writing. When a written memorandum summarizing the conference is prepared, the AJ (or the party given the task of preparing the summary) must serve the memorandum on the parties and provide a specific number of days, normally at least 5 days, for filing corrections or objections to the memorandum. <span class="Italic">See Miles v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 418 (1999) (citing this Handbook for its holding); <span class="Italic">but see</span> chapter 1 of this Handbook, cautioning that "adjudicatory error is not established solely by failure to comply with a provision of this handbook." If a party is designated to prepare the summary, the AJ must annotate the party's memorandum or otherwise show his or her agreement with its accuracy before it is placed in the record. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If no rulings are made or agreements reached, a summary is not required. Memorializing that fact, however, with notice to the parties, will help prevent a later claim that matter was ruled on at the otherwise undocumented conference. Rulings such as the changed date of a status conference do not require documentation in a separate order; rather, the change in date should be identified in the summary of the conference when it is held.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">TREATMENT OF AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES DURING PREHEARING AND STATUS CONFERENCES</span>. An AJ must observe the following procedures whenever an appellant raises an affirmative defense in a case in which such a defense may be advanced. This excludes IRA, USERRA, and VEOA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638-39 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table), and modified on other ground by <span class="Italic">Robinson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 63 M.S.P.R. 307, 323 n.13 (1994) (IRA); <span class="Italic">Metzenbaum v. Department of Justice</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 285, 291-92 &#x00B6; 15 (2001) (USERRA); <span class="Italic">Ruffin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 396, 401 &#x00B6; 12 (2001) (VEOA). The Board lacks authority to hear affirmative defenses under both USERRA and VEOA. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 604 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Enforcement of the Prehearing Order</span>. The AJ will enforce the prehearing order, which directs the parties to submit separate statements of facts and issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an appellant fails to submit a statement of facts and issues, the AJ must require the appellant to state all defenses, including affirmative defenses, during the prehearing conference. The AJ must inform the appellant that he or she is limited to those issues raised, except for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Those defenses and the AJ's admonition must then be incorporated in the prehearing conference record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Addition or Waiver of Affirmative Defenses</span>. The AJ will review the appeal for any affirmative defense that appears to be alleged but is not included in an appellant's statement of facts and issues, and bring the omission to appellant's attention. The AJ must give the appellant the opportunity to add the omitted defense to the statement of facts and issues, or obtain an explicit waiver of the omitted defense. The result must be memorialized in the prehearing conference record, as the Board will not assume that the AJ's failure to address it in the ID means that the appellant waived or abandoned the issue. Further, if a pleading filed by or on behalf of the appellant makes a claim that, if fully developed, may constitute an affirmative defense, the AJ must provide the appellant an opportunity to affirm or disavow that such an issue is part of the appeal. Before determining whether the appellant intended to raise such a claim, the AJ must assure that the record shows that the appellant was informed of the showing necessary to the presentation and proof of such an issue. As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Wynn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 146 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">We now make clear that when an appellant raises an affirmative defense in an appeal either by checking the appropriate box in an appeal form, identifying an affirmative defense by name such as "race discrimination," "harmful procedural error," etc., or by alleging facts that reasonably raise such an affirmative defense, the AJ must address the affirmative defense(s) in any close of record order or prehearing conference summary and order. If an appellant expresses the intention to withdraw such an affirmative defense, in the close of record order or prehearing conference order the AJ must, at a minimum, identify the affirmative defense, explain that the Board will no longer consider it when deciding the appeal, and give an appellant an opportunity to object to withdrawal of the affirmative defense. The record in this appeal simply does not establish that the appellant abandoned or withdrew the affirmative defenses he had raised in his appeal. As explained below, in the absence of evidence establishing the appellant had withdrawn or abandoned his affirmative defenses, it was incumbent on the AJ to advise the appellant of applicable burdens of proving a particular affirmative defense, as well as the kind of evidence the appellant is required to produce to meet his burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An appellant is entitled to a decision on the merits of his discrimination claim under the procedures set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701; this is true regardless of whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous claim or established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Currier v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 177, 180-82 (1998); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. National Gallery of Art,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 285, 289-95 (1998) (then-Member Marshall dissenting). The allegation must be one of "prohibited" discrimination. Thus, where an appellant's alleged disorder was statutorily excluded from the definition of disability, the AJ's striking the appellant's claim was not harmful error because the appellant failed to allege prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. Browder v. Department of the Navy,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 71, 76 (1999), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 250 F.3d 763 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Table). The appellant is entitled to a hearing <span id="Page_1347"></span>at which he or she may submit evidence pertaining to the claim of prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. See Owens v. Department of the Army,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 279 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). However, the AJ retains the authority to rule on the admissibility of evidence and its relevance<span class="Italic">. Brown v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 16, 21, n.4 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The appellant also has the right to be heard on the affirmative defenses even when the agency cancelled the action after the appellant filed the appeal, unless the Board could not grant any additional relief. This requires the AJ to notify the appellant that he or she may claim compensatory or consequential damages where no such claim has yet been raised, and the if the appellant does so, the AJ will hear and rule on the affirmative defense so that the damages claim can also be decided, if appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roach v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 464 (1999) (consequential damages)<span class="Italic">; Hodge v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 470 (1996) (compensatory damages). To the contrary, however, the Board has held that an outstanding claim for attorney fees does not prevent an appeal from being dismissed as moot. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Uhlig v. Department of Justice</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 29 (1999). Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 37 (2001), the Board followed the rule of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health &#x0026; Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), which precludes a fee award under the catalyst theory based on the cancellation of an appealed matter. Thus, in these circumstances, a request for fees will not prevent an appeal from being dismissed as moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Whistleblower claims are analyzed differently. Although an outstanding claim for attorney fees does not preclude dismissing an appeal brought under chapter 75 as moot as in <span class="Italic">Currier</span>, the Board has held that a request for attorney fees in an IRA appeal is a claim for corrective action. <span class="Italic">Vick v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 68, 69-70, &#x00B6; 5 (2012); <span class="Italic">Santos v. Department of Energy</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 475, &#x00B6; 7 (2005). In OAA appeals where whistleblower retaliation is raised as an affirmative defense, the appellant can proceed with a claim of retaliation for whistleblowing activity when he can articulate some possible, effective relief that can be granted by the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(b), which, in relevant part, gives an employee the right to seek corrective action from the Board when the employee can appeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 648, 654-55, &#x00B6; 14 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limitation of Issues</span>. The parties will be bound to the issues defined in the AJ's conference record, except in cases of good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This means, for example, that when an appellant waits until the hearing to raise discrimination as a defense, the AJ must require the appellant to explain the delay, and if justified, must afford the agency or intervenors, if any, an opportunity to show that considering that issue would prejudice its rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to Introduce Evidence</span>. Any failure to introduce evidence in support of an affirmative defense will be treated like any other matter before the trier of fact. That is, if the appellant fails to introduce evidence on an affirmative defense, then he or she would fail to meet the burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. 500, 508 (1996); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 369 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">7.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">RETIREMENT CASES</span>. In retirement cases, the AJ must inform appellants of their burden of proof and of the kind of evidence they need to provide the Board for the adjudication of their appeals. The Board has found that because the appellant has the burden of proof in a retirement appeal, both OPM and the AJ have a special burden to assure that the appellant is not disadvantaged, especially when <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. This extends to requiring that when the AJ knows that the appellant's proof is insufficient, the AJ must so inform the appellant and assure that he or she is made aware of the type of evidence that must be submitted to support the claim.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Goodnight v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 184, 188 (1991) (AJ's burden); <span class="Italic">Lubag v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 484, 488 &#x00B6; 10 (2001) (finding that OPM had a "special duty" to the appellant to determine why, under the circumstances presented, the annuitant had elected a specific option). When such appellants are unrepresented, or their representatives are not attorneys, the AJ must assure that this information is presented in a form that is appropriate to the listener's level of knowledge and expertise. If the appellant is, or appears to be, incompetent, the AJ must follow the requirements set out in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 496, 499 (1988). <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 2, section 8, of this Handbook for further information. <span class="Italic">See also Dixon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 148 (2001), concerning the application of <span class="Italic">French-</span>like procedures in removal appeals in which the appellant appears to be incompetent. The decision sets out the specific authorities of the AJ in such a situation. While it is rare that an agency is required to file a disability retirement on the appellant's behalf, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.1205, 844.202, when such circumstances are present, the AJ must assure that the regulatory requirements and those in the Board's case law are met. The right to such procedures does not extend to adverse action appeals, <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 72 (1990); not is there a right to appointment of counsel in IRA appeals. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 527 F. App'x 970 (Fed. Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, certain affirmative defenses may be raised in some retirement appeals. In this regard, the Board has held that when OPM's decision involved an exercise of discretion, defenses such as discrimination could be raised, but that if OPM is bound by the law to make a specific determination, they could not. <span class="Italic">See Wrighten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 163, 167 &#x00B6; 11 (2001). Thus, the rules discussed above concerning the AJ's authority and obligations as to affirmative defenses apply to appropriate retirement appeals, as well.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of workload or related issues, OPM at times has been slow in providing records needed for proper adjudication. Because a default judgment cannot be issued in such cases since benefits that are not properly earned cannot be granted, the AJ must be tenacious in requesting the agency file and other related information needed for adjudication. In an effort to accommodate OPM, however, AJs may hold conferences with the appellant alone, after notice to OPM that such a conference will occur with or without its participation, and will not require OPM to arrange such conferences. Especially difficult problems with responsiveness on the part of OPM should be reported to ORO, which will attempt to resolve the issue through discussions with management in OPM's retirement division. After OPM's repeated failure to respond, in appropriate circumstances it may be proper to base a decision on the record, which will be entirely, or almost entirely, made up of the appellant's evidence. In such a case, OPM must be warned that a decision on the record will be made. If the appellant contends that evidence in OPM's possession to which he has no access, will meet his burden of proof, however, a decision without that evidence should not be made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8. <span class="Italic">MOTIONS FOR ATTORNEY FEES, COMPENSATORY, LIQUIDATED AND/OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND PETITIONS FOR ENFORCEMENT</span>. The provisions of this chapter also apply to cases involving motions for attorney fees and compensatory damages, and to petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 13 for further guidance on processing such cases.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">It is good practice for a AJ to document prehearing and status conferences. If the AJ does not, the Board may end up without a record to determine whether the AJ acted properly developing the appeal (e.g., limiting the issues or testimony to be considered at the hearing), and the failure to document prehearing rulings deprives the appellant of an opportunity to object to the rulings on the record. <span class="Italic">McCarty v.

Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 186, 188 (1987) (finding no requirement that verbatim records of prehearing conferences be kept as part of the official record); MSPB <span class="Italic">Judge's Handbook</span>, ch. 9, &#x00A7; 5."); Yet rulings and decisions made during the prehearing conference must be documented. The ordinary means of documentation will be a AJ's prehearing conference memorandum. When that duty seems too arduous for the AJ, it has occurred that one or another representative will be asked to make a memo summarizing events and to distribute the memo to the parties and the AJ. Some AJs record conferences, believing the audio record substitutes for a written record of the conference. Whatever the form, a record, provided to the parties, should be made by the AJ of what occurs during the prehearing conference, <span class="Italic">McBurney v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 126, 131 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge erred when he failed to serve a copy of the [prehearing summary] memorandum on the parties. Any memorandum summarizing important, substantive conferences between the administrative judge and the parties--particularly where the waiver of a statutory [hearing] right is involved--must be placed in the record and served on the parties. The administrative judge should also allow the parties an opportunity to comment on the accuracy and/or completeness of the summary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs may express their opinions about a case before all the evidence is in. References by the AJ in prehearing conferences to possible errors on the part of the agency, or problems with the appellant's case, are not rulings binding the AJ when the initial decision is written. It is the initial decision and not a statement made during the prehearing process that forms the basis of appeal on a PFR; on matters of law or fact, it is the analysis in the initial decision that controls the case rather than preliminary statements made by the AJ.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">Korowin v. DOJ</span>, 4 MSPR 50, 51-52 n.1, 4 MSPB 140 (1980). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-10-156.html#sec3-156">Treatment of Bias Allegations</a>."]</p>
