<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-85"><span class="space">4.</span> Tacking of Prior Service: Competitive Service Probation</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">We move to whether service immediately before initiation of a competitive service (one year, except two years for certain DOD personnel before the end of 2022) probationary period counts toward completion of the probationary period. Consideration commences with the OPM regulation providing government-wide guidance on tacking of prior service for the competitive service probationer, 5 CFR 315.802 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Length of probationary period; crediting service.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The probationary period required by &#x00A7; 315.801 is 1 year and may not be extended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Prior Federal civilian service (including nonappropriated fund service) counts toward completion of probation when the prior service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is in the same agency, e.g., Department of the Army;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is in the same line of work (determined by the employee's actual duties and responsibilities); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Contains or is followed by no more than a single break in service that does not exceed 30 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Periods of absence while in a pay status count toward completion of probation. Absence in nonpay status while on the rolls (other than for compensable injury or military duty) is creditable up to a total of 22 workdays. Absence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury or military duty is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service. Nonpay time in excess of 22 workdays extends the probationary period by an equal amount. An employee serving probation who leaves Federal service to become a volunteer with the Peace Corps or the Corporation for National and Community Service serves the remainder of the probationary period upon reinstatement provided the employee is reinstated within 90 days of termination of service as a volunteer or training for such service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;The probationary period for part-time employees is computed on the basis of calendar time, in the same manner as for full-time employees. For intermittent employees, i.e., those who do not have regularly scheduled tours of duty, each day or part of a day in pay status counts as 1 day of credit toward the 260 days in a pay status required for completion of probation. (However, the probationary period cannot be completed in less than 1 year of calendar time.)</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question of whether probation was completed differs from whether an individual is an "employee" under 5 USC 7511 based on continuous (no break in service) prior employment in other than temporary positions of less than one year. Noting the distinctions in the calculus, <span class="Italic">Ney v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 115 MSPR 204, 209-10 &#x00B6; 14, 2010 MSPB 219 (2010), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who has not served a full year under her appointment can show that she has completed the probationary period, and so is no longer a probationer, by tacking on prior service if: (1) the prior service was rendered immediately preceding the probationary appointment; (2) it was performed in the same agency; (3) it was performed in the same line of work; and (4) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days. <span class="Italic">Hurston</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 34, &#x00B6; 9. Alternatively, an employee can show that, while she may be a probationer, she is an "employee" with Chapter 75 appeal rights because, immediately preceding the adverse action, she had completed at least 1 year of current continuous service in the competitive service without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Given the appellant's prior federal service, the administrative judge erred in failing to provide an appropriate <span class="Italic">Burgess</span> notice informing the appellant how she could establish that she was an employee with adverse action appeal rights to the Board. <span class="Italic">See generally Smart v. Department of Justice</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 393, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-43 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Simons v. USDA</span>, DC-0752-15-1179-I-2 (NP 10/21/2022) (restating the alternative approach).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Higgins v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-315H-14-0609-I-1 (NP 10/10/2014), explained the difference in approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here served only 11 weeks of his 1-year probationary period. His prior federal civilian service was with Department of the Air Force, not in the same agency from which he was terminated. Thus, his prior federal service does not count towards the completion of his probationary period. Similarly, because his last period of prior federal employment ended on February 17, 2014, he had a break in service of more than a workday between the end of his employment with <span id="Page_119"></span>Department of the Air Force and his appointment to the position in question and, therefore, he does not have 1 year of current, continuous service.

On April 13, 2005, the agency terminated his employment for reasons arising post-appointment: unauthorized absence; failure to follow leave-requesting procedures; and failure to follow instructions. The agency processed the action as a termination occurring prior to the expiration of the required one-year probationary period. The appellant filed a petition for appeal and requested a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge (AJ) informed the appellant that the Board may lack jurisdiction over his appeal of his termination during a probationary period, the appellant asserted that he should be deemed to have completed his one-year probationary period because he had continuously been "in the same line of work" during his 14 months of service with DECA, despite the change in his appointment from WG-4 Store Worker to WG-5 Meatcutting Worker. The AJ informed the parties of Board precedent concerning the "tacking" of prior service in the "same line of work" toward completion of a probationary period in a new position, and he ordered the parties to file the appellant's position descriptions and any other relevant documentation on that issue. (Citing <span class="Italic">Aizin v. Department of Defense</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 146 (1991)).

Department of the Army,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 14 (2005); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b) (defining "[c]urrent continuous employment" as a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions[4] without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday.)[5]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In 1988, the Office of Personnel Management, interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A), issued a final rule defining the term "current continuous employment." 53 Fed. Reg. 21,619, 21,623 (1988). The term "current continuous <span class="Italic">employment</span>" in the applicable statute, however, was changed without comment in 1990, to "current continuous <span class="Italic">service</span>" under the Civil Service Due Process Amendments. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) (1988) <span class="Italic">with</span> Pub.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Defense,</span> 96 M.S.P.R. 335, &#x00B6; 12 (2004), the Board noted that the question of whether service in the excepted service could count toward the 1-year current continuous service requirement of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), appeared to be an issue of first impression. The Board noted that, although Mr. Williams' prior service in the excepted service may or may not count toward the completion of the 1-year current continuous service requirement, it did not need to decide that issue because an intervening temporary appointment Mr. Williams had received meant that he did not have 1 year of current continuous service "under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 12-13; <span class="Italic">cf. Beets v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (finding it unnecessary to address whether prior service in the competitive service counted toward 2 years of current continuous service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because the positions in question were not "the same or similar"). Unlike Mr. Williams, the appellant's appointment to the excepted service position of WG-8852-10 Aircraft Mechanic with the District of Columbia Adjutant General at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, was not a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. Thus, the first question before us is whether prior service in the excepted service can count toward the 1-year current continuous service requirement for individuals in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point for any case involving statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself, which must be examined to determine Congress' intent on the question at issue. <span class="Italic">Adkins v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 233, &#x00B6; 12 (2006). Statutory provisions should not be read in isolation; rather, each section of a statute should be construed in connection with other sections so as to produce a harmonious whole. <span class="Italic">Styslinger v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 17 (2007). It is a normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning. <span class="Italic">Butler v. Social Security Administration,</span> 331 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Styslinger,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as reflected in the structure of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), Congress was aware that the executive branch of government under title 5 of the United States Code included positions that generally fell within two categories: Competitive service and excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102-03 (describing the competitive and excepted service). Nevertheless, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), as well as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), all refer to current continuous "service" without specifying that such "service" must be in the competitive or excepted service, respectively. In fact, because the same phrase, "current continuous service," is used in sections 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), 7511(a)(1)(B), and 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), we apply the above presumption that Congress intended the phrase to have the same meaning in each of those sections. This is especially true given the close proximity of these provisions to each other. <span class="Italic">See Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Lundy,</span> 516 U.S. 235, 250 (1996) (finding that the interrelationship and close proximity of certain provisions presented a "classic case" for application of the normal rule that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning). Thus, although each of the above sections defines the term "employee" by reference to an individual or preference eligible presently "in" or occupying a position in the competitive or excepted service, we find that the phrase "current continuous service" in those sections means service, in either the competitive or excepted service, that immediately precedes an adverse action without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">See Dade v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 12 (2005) (finding that prior service as an Audiologist in the competitive service with the Department of the Army may be counted, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(i), toward the completion of 1-year of current continuous service in an Audiologist position with the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA), even if the DVA Audiologist position was in the excepted service). This interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(ii) is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b), which does not define current continuous employment as a period of service confined to either the competitive or excepted service. <span class="Italic">See McCrary v. Department of the Army,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6; 8 (2006) (noting that the definition of "current continuous service" is the same in competitive service and excepted service cases).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now turn to the question of whether the appellant's NGT service in particular, along with his service as an Aircraft Mechanic at the March Air Reserve Base, provide him with 1 year of current continuous service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). As the successor to the state militias of the nation's early years, the National Guard is a deeply imbedded feature of our national defense system. <span class="Italic">Singleton v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 244 F.3d 1331, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The role of the National Guard, however, does not fit neatly within the scope of either state[6] or national concerns. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The National Guard is an essential reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, available with regular forces in time of war, and on stand-by to be federalized to assist in controlling civil disorders. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The activity, make-up, and function of the National Guard are provided for, to a large extent, by federal law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At the same time, the National Guard is available to serve state needs, and within each state, the National Guard is a state agency under state authority and control. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although we refer in this paragraph, for purposes of convenience, to "state" concerns, agencies, authority, and control, we note that under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101(3), (6), the terms "National Guard" and "Air National Guard" mean certain qualifying parts of the organized militia of the several States and Territories, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mirroring this special posture of the National Guard is the unusual status of its employees. In addition to purely military personnel, the National Guard employs civilians to perform a wide range of administrative, clerical, and technical tasks. Often the responsibilities and duties of these employees, who are generally referred to as NGTs, correspond directly to those of other civilian employees, yet they arise in a distinctly military context, implicating significant military concerns. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 348, 350 (1985), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Ockerhausen v. State of New Jersey Department of Military &#x0026; Veterans Affairs,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. 484, 489 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(5) provides that "[t]his subchapter does not apply to an employee...who is described in section 8337(h)(1), relating to technicians in the National Guard," and that section 8337(h)(1), in turn, provides that the term "technician" means an individual employed under section 709(a) of title 32 who, as a condition of the employment, is required under section 709(b) of such title <span id="Page_122"></span>to be a member of the National Guard and to hold a specified military grade. This case, however, does not involve an adverse action taken against an NGT who has appealed that action to the Board. Instead, it involves the question of how to treat NGT service in the excepted service in determining whether an individual in the competitive service has appeal rights to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A person like the appellant, who was employed under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(a), must be a military technician (dual status) as defined in section 10216(a) of title 10, United States Code. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b). Section 10216(a)(1), in turn, provides that, for purposes of that section "and any other provision of law," a military technician (dual status) like the appellant "is a Federal civilian employee." In fact, under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e), an NGT "is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States." <span class="Italic">See Ockerhausen,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. at 488 (even though National Guard technicians work for state organizations under the authority of a state official, they must be considered civilian employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force to the same extent as other employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force).[7] Such an NGT position is simply "outside the competitive service if the technician employed in that position is required under subsection (b) to be a member of the National Guard." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(e). Given that military technicians like the appellant are considered, for purposes of "any other provision of law," to be federal civilian employees, and that they are also considered to be employees of the Department of the Air Force and the United States to the same extent as other employees of the Department of the Air Force, we hold that the AJ correctly concluded that the appellant is an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii) because he completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less, i.e., he completed 1 year of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">See Ellefson,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Ockerhausen,</span> 52 M.S.P.R. at 488 ("[A] technician...must be deemed an employee in a covered position 'in an agency' who has the same rights as other civilian employees of those agencies, save those rights specifically denied them in the National Guard Technicians Act.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We note that, under 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1002.306, a National Guard civilian technician is considered a State employee for purposes of the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, but is considered a federal employee for "most other purposes." In addition, for purposes of OPM's regulations relating to restoration to duty from uniformed service, in the case of a National Guard technician employed under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, the employing agency is the adjutant general of the state in which the technician is employed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize that, under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(g), "[s]ections 2108, 3502, 7511, and 7512 of title 5 do not apply to a person employed under this section." As set forth above, subchapter II of chapter 75, relating to removals, suspensions for more than 14 days, reductions in grade or pay, or furloughs for 30 days or less, does not apply to NGTs. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(5). The agency argues that it is not logical for Congress to have "exclude[d] the service while the employee is a National Guard Technician, but then require[d] the federal agency to count the time that previously 'did not apply'" when calculating a probationary period or current continuous service under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). However, 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(g) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(5) do not exclude <span class="Italic">service</span> performed while an employee is an NGT; rather, they simply hold that such NGTs are not "employees" entitled to appeal to the Board while they hold such positions. The appellant was not employed under section 709 at the time of his termination in this case.[8] We also note that the agency relies upon an initial decision issued by a Board AJ finding that time spent in an NGT excepted service position cannot be applied toward the completion of a probationary period in the competitive service. Board initial decisions are of no precedential value, however, and cannot be cited or relied upon as controlling authority. <span class="Italic">Rockwell v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The agency is incorrect in suggesting that service in a position that is not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) can never be combined with subsequent service in a position covered by section 7511(a)(1) for purposes of determining an individual's appeal rights.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Compton</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>, the appellants were both serving in temporary appointments at the time of their terminations. Here, however, the appellant was serving in a career-conditional appointment when his termination occurred. His temporary limited appointment as a General Attorney immediately preceded his conversion to the career-conditional appointment. Therefore, we hold that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's prior temporary service could not be counted towards completion of his probationary period under <span class="Italic">Compton</span> and <span class="Italic">Morris</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's prior temporary service fails to meet the remaining conditions necessary to credit that service towards completion of his probationary period.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the condition that the prior service immediately precede a career or career-conditional appointment, the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) provides that the prior service must be rendered in the same agency and the same line of work, without more than one break of less than thirty (30) days. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(l) (Apr. 27, 1982). <span class="Italic">See also Long v.

Based on our review of the record, we find that while the appellant's prior service was rendered in the same agency without a break of more than thirty days, it was not in the same line of work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Same line of work" is defined as meaning that the two positions are so similar that they require the same qualifications and the nature of the work would place the positions in the same competitive level for reduction-in-force purposes. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(3); <span class="Italic">Haning,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. at 254.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record evidence shows that the qualifications and nature of the duties for the positions of Loan Specialist and General Attorney are different. Attorneys are required to be members of a state bar. Their duties range from conducting legal research and preparing legal documents to representing the agency in administrative or court proceedings. In contrast, a Loan Specialist's duties include analyzing and evaluating loan collateral, reviewing delinquent and defaulted loans, counselling loan applicants and developing policies to govern lending programs. In addition, the positions of Loan Specialist, GS-1165, and General Attorney, GS-905, are not in the same occupational level or classification series for purposes of reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that during his appointment as General Attorney with the agency's Philadelphia Regional Counsel Office, he was actually performing the duties of a Loan Specialist.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the evidence to be insufficient to establish that the appellant actually performed the duties of a Loan Specialist while serving in his temporary appointment as General Attorney. We find further that, since the two positions are not in "the same line of work," the appellant's prior service as a General Attorney cannot be counted towards completion of his probationary period and that he was a probationary employee when the agency removed him on December 12, 1986.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other decisions restate the relation between temporary appointments and completion of probationary periods through tacking. To qualify under the former FPM as time served toward the completion of a probationary period after conversion to career-conditional status, the temporary employee must have been employed without a break in service and in the same line of work as that held after conversion. <span class="Italic">Coltin v.

<p class="Body-Text">Earlier OPM regulations and many older MSPB cases refer to rules from the late Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) governing crediting toward completion of probation of prior federal service.

According to the FPM, prior federal service may be counted towards completion of a new probationary period of an individual who is competitively appointed to a career or career-conditional appointment from a register or who is converted to a career or career-conditional appointment if the prior service were: (1) rendered immediately preceding the career or career-conditional appointment or conversion; (2) in the same line of work; (3) in the same agency; and (4) with no more than one break of less than 30 days during that service. <span class="Italic">See</span> FPM Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c)(1) (Apr. 27, 1982); <span class="Italic">Marcus v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 473 F.2d 896, 200 Ct. Cl. 544 (1973); <span class="Italic">Haning v. U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 31 MSPR 252 (1986); <span class="Italic">Angell v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy,</span> 4 MSPB 340, 4 MSPR 266 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this exception was not noted in <span class="Italic">Rochniak</span> or in <span class="Italic">Oulvey</span>, those appeals were correctly decided since the appellants in those cases did not meet the conditions for counting prior federal service. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Rochniak</span>, <span class="Italic">Oulvey</span>, or other Board cases imply that prior federal service may never be counted toward a new probationary period when an eligible is competitively appointed from a civil service register, they are MODIFIED for the reasons stated in this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant's prior federal service may not be counted toward completion of her probationary period since that service was not in the same agency....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An early case applied a (now defunct) FPM provision requiring that for tacking to occur service in a temporary position had to be immediately preceding the career or career-conditional appointment or conversion. When an employee would otherwise receive credit toward completion of a competitive service probationary period through creditable service in a temporary position, but her service was interrupted by a one-day break, the Board disregarded technical application of OPM regulations and considered the probationary period completed to avoid defeating the intent of the regulations governing probation. <span class="Italic">Angell v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 4 MSPR 266, 268, 4 MSPB 340 (1980). The current OPM regulations allow up to a 30 day break in service for tacking. 5 CFR 315.802(b)(3) (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The line of work requirement, discussed below, still applies to time served in an excepted service job when the appellant seeks to credit that time to the time served in a competitive service probationary appointment. <span class="Italic">Spurlock v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 86-1470), decided before <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald</span>, <span class="Italic">supra, and based on the provisions of the now obsolete FPM,</span> considered tacking of prior excepted service employment as an IRS tax auditor for purposes of completion of the probationary period for an employee placed into an IRS internal auditor competitive service position by appointment from a register:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues that the board erred in dismissing her appeal because she had completed a probationary period in her former position and was not required to complete a second probationary period, or because the agency was estopped from contending that her dismissal was effectuated during the probationary period. We cannot agree with petitioner's arguments. Petitioner was required to complete a second probationary period following her appointment to the career conditional position regardless of her thirteen months of previous employment in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Personnel Manual, Chapter 315, Subch. 8-2. Furthermore, the thirteen months of employment in the excepted service cannot be credited toward the second probationary period, because the position in the excepted service was not in the same line of work as the position in the competitive service, as evidenced by the different occupational code for the latter, which was reflected on the Standard Form 50. Federal Personnel Manual Chapter 315, Appendix A-3(c). Petitioner was therefore required to serve a full one-year probationary period in the career conditional position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To reduce (or explain) some confusion concerning crediting of prior service in early cases, we reprint below an excerpt from the (now retired) Appendix to FPM Chapter 315, "Determining Completion of a Probationary Period," of September 19, 1989 (the FPM provision differs from the current regulation, 5 CFR 315.802(b)(3) (2022), particularly as to breaks in service):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A-3. COUNTING SERVICE TOWARD COMPLETION OF PROBATIONARY PERIOD</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;Service prior to personnel action involving new probationary period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;When service is counted. All actual prior service which meets the requirements listed below is counted toward the completion of a new probationary period in connection with:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--career-conditional or career appointments from civil service register; or under a direct hire authority; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the conversions to career-conditional or career employment from other types of employment which are covered by subchapter 7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior service is counted regardless of whether it was under competitive appointment (career-conditional, career, probational, permanent, war service indefinite, indefinite, limited, or unlimited temporary), under excepted appointment, as a <span class="Italic">status quo</span> employee, or as a nonappropriated fund employee of a Department of Defense instrumentality. However, service of employees whose positions in public or private enterprise are taken over by the Government is counted only from the date the positions are placed in the competitive service. Prior service which meets all of the following specifications is counted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;It was rendered immediately preceding career or career-conditional appointment or conversion. Employees must have been on the rolls of the agency at the time of the career or career-conditional appointment or conversion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;It was in the same agency and, except for conversion of a disabled veteran from a temporary appointment under the provisions of section 7-8 of this chapter, was in the same line of work as the position for which the action is taken. All service to be counted must have been continuously in the same line of work; there must have been no interruption by official position change to another line of work. (The same line of work requirement does not apply to conversion of a disabled veteran to career or career-conditional appointment under section 7-8 of this chapter.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;No more than one break of less than 30 days has occurred in it. (While actual service preceding a break of less than 30 days may be counted, the period of separation from the service may not be counted.) Military service is a continuation and not a break in service when a veteran who left a civilian position to enter the military service is restored to civilian service in accordance with his restoration rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Same line of work means the positions in which the duties performed are similar in nature and character and require substantially the same or similar qualifications, so that the incumbent could be interchanged between the positions without significant training or undue interruption to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Competitive service term (temporary) appointments are treated, for purposes of probationary requirements, as are competitive service appointments without time limitation. <span class="Italic">Gamble v. Dept. of Army</span>, 111 MSPR 529, 531 n.1, <span id="Page_124"></span>2009 MSPB 118 (2009), explained as to an employee terminated during a competitive service trial period in a temporary appointment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 316.304, prior federal civilian service of an individual with a term appointment is credited toward completion of the trial period in the same manner as it is in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802, meaning that such prior service must have been in the same agency and the same line of work, and it contained or was followed by no more than a single break in service that did not exceed 30 calendar days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Periods an employee is on disability retirement before the initiation of probation do not tack for purposes of completing probation, <span class="Italic">Baggan v. Dept. of State</span>, 109 MSPR 572, 575-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9, 2008 MSPB 196 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To qualify as an "employee" with appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75, the appellant, as a competitive service employee, must show that he either is not serving a probationary period or has completed one year of current continuous service under an appointment other than a temporary one limited to a year or less. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A); <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339, 1341-44 (Fed. Cir. 2002). An appellant who has not served a full year under his appointment can show that he has completed the probationary period, and so is no longer a probationer, by tacking on prior service in the competitive service if: (1) The prior service was rendered immediately preceding the probationary appointment; (2) it was performed in the same agency; (3) it was performed in the same line of work; and (4) it was completed with no more than one break in service of less than 30 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b); <span class="Italic">Ellefson v. Department of the Army</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 16 (2005). Alternatively, an employee can show that, while he may be a probationer, he is an "employee" with Chapter 75 appeal rights because, immediately preceding the adverse action, he had completed at least one year of current continuous service in the competitive service without a break in federal civilian employment of a workday. <span class="Italic">Ellefson</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he was not a probationer at the time of his separation, noting that prior to his appointment as a Program Analyst, he received disability retirement, effective October 11, 1996, from the competitive service position of Procurement Analyst with the Department of Transportation. He asserts that he retired from that position due to a compensable injury and points to a regulation regarding completion of probationary periods, which states in part that "[a]bsence (whether on or off the rolls) due to compensable injury...is creditable in full upon restoration to Federal service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c). The context of this provision, however, shows that it was intended to enable an employee who had begun a probationary period, and who subsequently was absent from his position for a reason addressed in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c), to have part or all of the period of absence counted towards the probationary period already begun at the time of the absence. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c) begins with a statement that "[p]eriods of absence while in a pay status count toward <span class="Italic">completion</span> of probation" (emphasis added), and it then provides that other kinds of absences in a non-pay status, including those caused by compensable injury, also are creditable. Nothing in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c) indicates that any of the absences described therein may be credited toward a probationary period not yet begun. Therefore, the period during which the appellant was receiving a disability retirement annuity is not creditable toward completion of the probationary period that he began on April 15, 2007.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant's prior service as a Procurement Analyst with the Department of Transportation cannot be tacked on to fulfill his probationary period that began in April 2007 because it was not with same agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(b); <span class="Italic">Ellefson</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 191, &#x00B6; 16. Therefore, for the foregoing reasons and because the appellant was separated from his Program Analyst position less than a year after his appointment, he was serving a probationary period at the time of separation and so is not an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, the appellant argues that as a disability retiree he remained in federal service for the duration of his retirement and so, at the time of the adverse action, he had more than a year of current continuous service without a break of a workday and, therefore, was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii). However, the appellant's disability retirement was not current continuous federal service because he was separated from federal service and removed from the rolls of the Department of Transportation when he retired in 1996. <span class="Italic">Cf. Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 546, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-9 (2001) (appellant completed a year of current continuous service even though she was in a non-duty, non-pay status because she was not formally separated); <span class="Italic">Tom v. Department of the Interior,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 126, 128-30 (1987) (seasonal employee, despite being placed in non-duty, non-pay status for 2 months during the year prior to his separation, completed a year of current continuous service because he remained on the agency's rolls). Moreover, the Board has held that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c), the provision permitting the crediting of absences due to compensable injuries, does not affect the computation of an employee's current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See Gadsden v. Department of State,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 79, &#x00B6; 14 (2006). Therefore, the appellant did not have a year of current continuous service at the time of the adverse action and so was not an "employee" with Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).</p>
