Dept. of Interior</span>, DC-0752-19-0755-I-1 (NP 2/28/2023) ("The appellant also argues on review that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she was unable to go to the public library to use the computer, printer, or scanner because she is an 'at-risk patient.' We acknowledge that the appellant appears to live in Greenbelt, Maryland, and that, during the early months of the pandemic, including in April and May of 2020, it is possible that public facilities such as libraries were closed to the public in Maryland. However, the appellant has not explained why she was unable to pursue a timely filing by other avenues. For example, she has not explained why she was unable to submit a handwritten petition for review or request for an extension."); <span class="Italic">Keys v.

OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 559, 562 (1996) (lengthy delay was not excused by the appellant's explanation that he had been shot and wounded; he did not describe the extent of his wounds and did not identify the period of his incapacitation); <span class="Italic">Sembach v.

OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 89, 90 (1989) (family death was not a reason for delay without further specifics). A group of personal problems, including health care requirements for the appellant's father, was insufficient to excuse a PFR delayed beyond an extension granted by the Board. <span class="Italic">Stephens v. DHHS</span>, 95 MSPR 600, 603 &#x00B6; 6 (2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board found itself unable to excuse a late PFR filed by an appellant who said that she misread the deadline because she was wearing an old pair of eyeglasses when she first read the Board's notice. <span class="Italic">Mata v.

OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 294, 295 (1990) (late PFR was not excused because the appellant was "housebound" and had difficulty walking because of arthritis).

<p class="Body-Text">An assertion of homeless status, resulting in inability to receive Board <span id="Page_1790"></span>decisions, was insufficient to warrant waiver of the PFR filing deadline, <span class="Italic">Jones v. SSA</span>, 111 MSPR 498, 502-03 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11, 2009 MSPB 112 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claims, that he did not receive documents, that there was confusion regarding his address, and that he was homeless for some of the time in question, do not show good cause for his filing delay. The record shows that the vast majority of pertinent documents in his appeals, including both initial decisions, were served on the appellant's residence of record. Further, by the appellant's own admission, he did not become homeless until after the deadline for filing a petition for review had passed in both cases. While the appellant claims that he did not receive any of the pertinent documents concerning his second removal appeal, we note that the appellant has significant prior experience with Board procedures, having appealed a prior action concerning another agency and pursued three compliance appeals stemming from that appeal. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0752-02-0381-C-3 (Apr. 22, 2009); <span class="Italic">Jones v.

Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, MSPB Docket No. PH-0752-02-0381-I-1 (Nov. 19, 2002) (Initial Decision). This experience should have alerted the appellant to possible problems regarding service of documents, and his failure to note these problems breached his personal duty to monitor the progress of his appeals at all times. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12, 14 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's arguments, that he needed to await the results of his FOIA request before filing his petition for review and that he timely filed his petitions upon receiving the FOIA response, are also without merit. The appellant admits that he initiated his FOIA requests after the regional office informed him in June of 2008 that his appeals were closed and that he needed to contact the Board's headquarters. The decision to delay contacting the Board after receiving notice regarding the problems with the status of the appeal does not show due diligence warranting a finding of good cause. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 258, &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">Groesbeck v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 4 (2008). Further, even though the appellant was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, his belief that he needed to obtain information pursuant to a FOIA request does not excuse the delay, nor does it explain the failure to seek an extension of time to file a petition for review in advance. <span class="Italic">See Bocock v. Department of the Navy</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 241, &#x00B6; 5 (2000); <span class="Italic">Comer v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 30, 33 (1993) (an appellant's effort to gather information that was believed to support the case does not establish good cause for a waiver of the filing deadline).</p>

VA</span>, NY-0752-10-0238-I-1 (NP 6/15/2011) ("[T]he fact remains that the initial decision was mailed to the appellant's address of record, and that he failed to notify the Board of any change in his address. As to his assertion that he did not have an address because he was homeless, he has provided no evidence that he was homeless at the time the initial decision was issued or when he received it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 576, &#x00B6; 9 (2010)."); <span class="Italic">Sutton v.

<p class="Body-Text">Confusion by the appellant when the AJ who signed the initial decision was not the same AJ who heard the case did not excuse a delayed PFR: "irrespective of which administrative judge signed the initial decision, the decision itself clearly stated that a petition for review must be filed with the Clerk of the Board no later than May 20, 2005." <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. SSA</span>, 100 MSPR 287, 291 &#x00B6; 8 (2005).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One case found the appellant filing a timely PFR but omitting a certificate of service. The notice from the Board to cure the deficiency and the time allowed for its cure fell within a short period while the appellant was away on vacation. Within a day of his return, he corrected the service deficiency. The Board adjudicated the PFR. <span class="Italic">Bianco v. OPM</span>, 48 MSPR 291, 293 (1991); <span class="Italic">Gethers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 196, 198 (1993) (appellant was on notice of the need to correct a deficient PFR before he left town for a vacation: the appellant has not "explained why he was unable to timely file his corrected petition for review in the time available before going out of town or why he did not request additional time to respond.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Holidays do not excuse the untimely PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dooley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 57 MSPR 684, 690 (1993) ("We believe...that 35 days is ample time both to prepare a petition for review and to celebrate the holidays. Moreover, we expect a party who has filed an appeal before the Board to take the time necessary to meet Board filing deadlines, even if it means taking time away from holiday celebrations.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Travel may not persuade the Board to excuse a delayed PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 228, 229 (1982) (delay in a PFR was excused; the appellant was on a trip when the initial decision was received by someone handling mail during his absence; that individual "put it with appellant's other second class mail to hold until his return.")<span class="Italic">. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Sembach v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 199, 201 (1995) ("[A]n appellant's assertion that he was out of town during part of the filing period and left 'his papers' behind does not establish good cause for waiver of the time limit, where he has not explained why he was unable to timely file before leaving town or why he did not request an extension of time to file.").</p>
