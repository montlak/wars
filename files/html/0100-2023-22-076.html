<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-77"><span class="space">4.</span> Mitigation: <span class="Italic">Boese, VanFossen</span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Soon after the 1984 <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> decision, decisions contained at least the suggestion that fees could be obtained if some charges were sustained and a mitigated penalty was directed. <span class="Italic">Thomson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Thomson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 106, 115 (1987)), involving mitigation from removal to suspension, implied the possibility of a fee award under the test of substantial innocence for a mitigated penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her fee decision, the presiding official committed two cardinal legal errors in deciding that the interest-of-justice element of 7701(g)(1) did not warrant award of any fees. First, she contented herself with determining, on the basis solely of the evidence before the Navy, that the Navy's initial action was not clearly without merit or wholly unfounded and that Thomson was not substantially innocent--even though petitioner also definitely placed his fee request on the assertion that he was substantially innocent of the threatening charges on the basis of evidence adduced at the MSPB hearing and reflected in that decision. Our subsequent <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> decision (not yet issued at the time of the presiding official's fee decision) has made it clear that category 2 of the MSPB fee scheme (announced in <span class="Italic">Allen v. USPS</span>, 2 MSPB 582 (1980))--as distinguished from category 5--"refers to the result of the case in the Board, not to the evidence and information available prior to the hearing."...&#8197;For that reason, the presiding official in the current case erred in resting her determination of substantial innocence (of the charge of threatening supervisors) wholly on the evidence before the agency and its action in considering removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's general preclusion of fee awards in mitigated penalty cases fell under direct attack in <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Petitioner's removal was mitigated to a 90-day suspension by the Board, but fees were denied. The court remanded for a fee award:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Category 5 of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guidelines deals with the <span class="Italic">agency's</span> reasons (or lack of reasons) for bringing the proceeding (<span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>), and that is the only category the MSPB treated in its fee decisions in this case. But <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span> also makes clear that <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> category 2 [clearly without merit, wholly unfounded, substantial innocence of the charges] is separate from and independent of category 5, the former "refer[ing] to the result of the case in the Board, not to the evidence and information available prior to the [MSPB] hearing."...&#8197;Here, the MSPB presiding official who decided the merits of the defalcation charges against Boese held that the agency had not proven those charges; he explicitly said he credited Boese's testimony in clearing him. It is true that the presiding official thought the case "close," and for that reason his decision may perhaps not show that the defalcation charges were "<span class="Italic">clearly</span> without merit" or <span class="Italic">wholly</span> unfounded" (emphasis added), but the decision does show, at the least, that Boese was "substantially innocent"...of those charges.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We have already held that there is no automatic rule against allowance of fees in "factually close" cases (<span class="Italic">Thomson v. MSPB</span>, 772 F.2d 879, 881 (Fed. Cir. 1985)), and there is no reason to even consider that factor in this case where the presiding official believed Boese's testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no doubt that the decision was on the merits, not based on some technical defect. And "substantial innocence," in itself, is an adequate ground for the allowance of fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>....[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The informal remark about Boese (by the judge at the criminal trial) at the time of the criminal sentencing of the commissary manager cannot be used to detract from the MSPB findings and decision. "Substantial innocence" is to be determined on the Board's own record, not according to some other person's views grounded on a different record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4606"></span>Moreover, as we have already pointed out the defalcation charges were, by far, the primary and major charges in the removal proceeding; the assault charge was very secondary and minor, resulting only in a 90-day suspension. Insofar as the qualification "substantial" (in the criterion of "substantial innocence") connotes innocence of the more important and greater part of the original charges, that prerequisite is also fulfilled here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore reverse the Board's denial of fees and remand the case for determination of the reasonable fees to be allowed. If it is practicable to segregate costs related only to the assault charge, they should be eliminated from the fees allowed. Boese is not entitled to fees on that charge--if those fees are calculable. If such a separation is not feasible or practical, or if the fees related solely to the assault matter are <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>, fees can be allowed for the whole case, or in its discretion the Board can allow "that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained." <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 434-37, 440 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The essence of <span class="Italic">Boese</span> is that a petitioner is substantially innocent and entitled to fees if he prevails on all but minor charges (still warranting a suspension of three months) even though the case is factually close; the employee is substantially innocent if the agency does not meet the preponderance of proof standard as to the charges. <span class="Italic">Gremillion v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2655).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boese</span> was soon followed by <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">VanFossen II</span>), the second appearance of the appellant in the Federal Circuit. The underlying facts are described in <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. DHUD</span>, 748 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (<span class="Italic">VanFossen I</span>). VanFossen's removal for a purported conflict of interest as a DHUD appraiser was reversed by the court for failure of the agency to consider a significant mitigating factor: permission by the agency, albeit not in complete compliance with agency regulations, to engage in an outside appraisal business, the practice that led to the conflict charges. On remand the Board mitigated the penalty to a 30-day suspension, but the Board ruled that VanFossen was not entitled to fees because he was technically guilty of infractions of agency regulations. The court dispatched to oblivion "the Board's rigid and simplistic argument that because all the charges against petitioner were sustained, he cannot be considered substantially innocent for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under the interest of justice mandate." Substantial innocence was derived from the technical and minor nature of the sustained charges and the gulf between the penalty imposed--removal--and the penalty determined by the Board--a 30-day suspension, 788 F.2d at 749-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he substantial innocence category serves a compensatory function, and is not punitive. This standard reflects Congressional awareness that the significant and often prohibitive expenses related to the defense of adverse actions discourage federal employees from challenging adverse agency action. Without the prospect of an award of attorney fees under the substantial innocence category, many employees would be forced to accept their removal without dispute since a successful challenge would leave them severely in debt, and possibly worse off than if they had not challenged their removal in the first place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, economic hardship by itself is insufficient to establish an award of fees in the interest of justice....&#8197;Rather, "the extent of a party's victory" and "the magnitude of the injustice done the employee" are controlling considerations....&#8197;More specifically, "the qualification 'substantial' (in the criterion of 'substantial innocence') connotes innocence of the more important and greater part of the original charges." <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is true that all three charges against petitioner were sustained. However, the lead charge (engaging in outside employment without authorization) was based on a purely technical violation of an agency regulation--petitioner received his authorizing memorandum from the wrong individual (the area manager) in the agency's hierarchy....&#8197;Moreover, the second charge of engaging in unauthorized outside activity was wholly dependent on the technical violation of receiving authorization from the incorrect official. And the third charge of not filing a report of his outside income was mentioned by the Board (in its opinion and order on remand) only in briefly summarizing the three charges. In sum, the Board itself did not on remand consider any of the charges, though sustained, as serious or significant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The gravity and circumstances of the offenses sustained are important factors in determining whether and to what extent fees should be allowed. We must reject the Board's rigid and simplistic argument that because all the charges against petitioner were sustained, he cannot be considered substantially innocent for the purpose of awarding attorney fees under the interest of justice mandate. That mechanical position disregards the nature and weight of the particular offenses, and treats fleas as always the equivalent of elephants. That has not been this court's rule or understanding in fee cases. In <span class="Italic">Sims</span>, 711 F.2d at 1582, a mitigation case in which we upheld a denial of fees, we indicated that the sustained charges "concerned indisputably improper conduct." In <span class="Italic">Boese</span>,...in allowing fees, we distinguished between the major and primary charge on which the employee was vindicated and the minor and secondary charge which was upheld.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the charges sustained were technical and very minor, and because the original drastic penalty of removal was significantly mitigated to the minor penalty of a thirty-day suspension, we hold that under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> not only did petitioner prevail in this proceeding but he has also shown himself to be substantially innocent of the charges so as to be entitled to attorney fees. These charges were all slight, and petitioner succeeded in cutting down the initial penalty of removal to a relatively short suspension. The Board will have to decide whether to allow full fees or to make some deduction for the fact that these minor and technical charges were sustained....&#8197;If any deduction at all is made, it should, of course, be small in view of our holding and discussion in this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Judge Bissell concurred in <span class="Italic">VanFossen II</span>, stating that she would have awarded fees under the "knew or should have known" rather than the "substantial innocence" standard. It was her opinion that the former standard governed because the agency ignored relevant mitigating circumstances that it was required by law to consider. The "merits" of the charges, she suggested, were not really in dispute; she implied that the charges themselves were not disputed and VanFossen could not be said to be substantially innocent of the charges. She reasoned, 788 F.2d at 753:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n a factual situation where an employee admits that all the charged misconduct occurred, one strains to regard the employee as innocent of the charges. It seems much more in accord with a "sense of justice and fair play"...to simply recognize that the agency did not, and knew or should have known that it would not, prevail on the merits.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not all mitigated penalties lead to fee awards, <span class="Italic">Ferry v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3507):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A mitigated penalty does not necessarily require the award of attorney fees. It depends on the facts....&#8197;Here, petitioner was not vindicated of the charge of AWOL. His suspension was for the efficiency of the service....&#8197;This is too weak a reed on which to hang a claim for attorney fees in the interest of justice, especially absent any finding by the MSPB of bad faith or harmful procedural error in the suspension penalty on the part of the United States.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boese</span> receives limited acceptance with the Board. If a major charge is sustained, as opposed to a minor or technical charge, there is no room for an award of fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 138, 149 (1992) (denying fees to a developmental air traffic control specialist whose removal after failing to succeed in training was mitigated to a demotion; "appellant's failure to satisfactorily complete the training program to become an ATCS goes to the heart of the agency's mission"). <span class="Italic">Shaffer v. DLA</span>, 30 MSPR 369, 370 (1986), determined that substantial innocence connotes innocence of the more important and greater part of the original charges. In <span class="Italic">Shaffer</span>, fees were awarded to an appellant whose removal was reduced to a 30-day suspension based on one sustained charge of unauthorized possession and transfer of marijuana on agency premises. The charges that were not sustained in <span class="Italic">Shaffer</span> were two instances of aiding and abetting the unauthorized sale and transfer of controlled substances, criminal and disgraceful conduct, and unauthorized use of government phones on official time to arrange drug transactions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Boo v. DHS,</span> SF-0752-13-3302-A-1 (NP 10/29/2015) ("We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant is substantially innocent of the charges brought against him and that the agency was unsuccessful in establishing the more important and greater part of its original charges that the appellant engaged in misrepresentation"; reducing fees by 15% for partial success); <span class="Italic">Ramirez v. EEOC</span>, 32 MSPR 228, 229 (1987) (AJ found that the most serious charge of pushing and threatening a subordinate was unsupported). The Board granted fees to an employee who was removed for theft of government property and conspiracy to commit theft. After the Board hearing, the only charge sustained was theft of gas cans, an offense the Board felt was worth only a 30-day suspension. Fees were awarded because there was long service, no prior discipline, and no showing that the offense would have a lasting effect on the employee's ability to perform his work. The employee was substantially innocent. Only a portion of one charge was sustained and it was minor. <span class="Italic">Ceja v. DLA</span>, 34 MSPR 399, 403 (1987). Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Lehman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 240, 242-43 (1987), fees were awarded to an employee whose removal for making false and malicious statements was mitigated to a suspension. The substantial innocence test was met as a result of consideration of the "nature and weight of the incidents, and the success of the appellant in receiving a reduction in the penalty."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees were denied in an appeal involving seven charges. Only one was sustained, but the Board the sustained charge, falsification of information in an employment application, was serious--it resulted in mitigation of removal to a 120-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 214, 221-23 (1989). Fees were again denied when an employer failed to prevail on all the charges against the employee, but the charge that was sustained was characterized by the AJ as "extremely serious." The penalty was reduced from removal to a 60-day suspension, characterized by the Board as "'among the most severe penalties that an agency can impose short of [removal].'" <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dept. of <span id="Page_4607"></span>Labor</span>, 45 MSPR 28, 32 (1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 504). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Boese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">supra</span> (fees awarded despite a 90-day suspension).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The distinction between major and minor charges remains indistinct, as the Board made clear in its treatment of an AJ's dismissal of a charge that the appellant incited disruption, coupled with a sustained charge of making threats, ultimately resulting in reduction of removal to a 60-day suspension in <span class="Italic">Cayaban v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 32 MSPR 540, 542 (1987), denying fees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the instant case is different from <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span> because here the charges were not based on technical or minor violations but on the appellant's participation in a disruptive exchange of threats and obscenities for several minutes after he had received ample warning to refrain from this conduct. The administrative judge also properly distinguished this case from <span class="Italic">Boese</span> because here the part of the charge that was sustained was not "very secondary and minor" but an important element of the charge and a major basis for the agency's action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sims v. Department of the Navy</span>, 711 F.2d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (removal mitigated to ten-day suspension but attorney fees denied because sustained charges "concerned indisputably improper conduct").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of major and minor charges, the court observed in <span class="Italic">Hilliard v. USPS</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 504, 506 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Penalty mitigation alone, however, "does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors." <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996). While charges are not necessarily weighted equally when assessing whether an employee was substantially innocent of the charged conduct, <span class="Italic">see Van Fossen v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 750 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the administrative judge in this case found that the charge of failure to perform duties was "a serious matter" and not "'minor' in comparison to the charge of insubordination." In order to satisfy the "substantially innocent" standard, the employee must show that he was "essentially without fault for the charges alleged and was needlessly subjected to attorney fees in order to vindicate himself." <span class="Italic">Massa v. Dep't of Def.</span>, 833 F.2d 991, 993 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The administrative judge did not find Mr. Hilliard to be essentially without fault; to the contrary, the administrative judge found that he was negligent in failing to perform the duties of his position. We hold that substantial evidence supports that finding, and that the Board was therefore justified in concluding that Mr. Hilliard was not substantially innocent of the charges against him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another decision demonstrating the imprecision of a test distinguishing major and minor charges, <span class="Italic">Ford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 298, 300 (1991), the appellant was removed for insubordination and delay in carrying out orders. The AJ determined that the first charge lacked merit; the second charge, sustained, warranted a 30-day suspension. The appellant had 10 years of satisfactory service. The delay was caused, in part, by confusing directions from the supervisor. The sustained portion of the charges was "considerably less grave than the agency had posited." Fees were warranted under the substantial innocence standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 616, 620-21 (1991), mitigated removal to a suspension and awarded fees under the "substantial innocence" test, distinguishing the "knew or should have known" test developed under <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 507 (1987) (discussed concerning the "knew or should have known" standard):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that the administrative judge incorrectly relied on <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 38 MSPR 398 (1988), in which the Board held that attorney fees are generally warranted under the knew-or-should-have-known category if the Board sustained all the agency's charges but nevertheless mitigated the penalty, where mitigation is based on evidence that was available to the agency....<span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 505-07 (1987). Because in this case, the administrative judge did not sustain all the agency's charges, including the most serious charge of working under the influence of alcohol, his reliance on <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> was misplaced. Moreover, we find that the administrative judge erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category 5 as the basis for his fee award....&#8197;[H]e found that there was an apparent basis for the agency's removal action because of the seriousness of the charged offense of working under the influence of alcohol. In light of this finding, we cannot conclude that at the time it took the action, the agency knew or should have known that it would not be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the interest-of-justice prerequisite for awarding attorney fees is fulfilled here because...the appellant...is substantially innocent for the purposes of an award of attorney fees. In <span class="Italic">Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 390-91 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the court found that the appellant was substantially innocent because the charges not sustained "were, by far, the primary and major charges," and he, therefore, was innocent of "the more important and greater part of the original charges." We conclude that the appellant here meets that test.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, we find that the administrative judge incorrectly concluded that the appellant was not "substantially innocent" in view of his finding that the most serious of the agency's charges, that the appellant was on duty under the influence of alcohol, could not be sustained and that the penalty should be mitigated. While the charged safety violations...are not, on their face, minor, we note that the agency admitted that it would have suspended the appellant for 30 days but for the intoxication charge. Moreover, the agency's table of penalties calls for discipline ranging only between a reprimand and a 5-day suspension for a first violation of safety regulations that endangers life or property. Finally, the administrative judge found that the agency had imposed substantially lighter discipline in cases involving similar or worse violations than those sustained against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a fee petition is analyzed by the Board under the substantial innocence test, an effort may be made to deny fees by distinguishing the facts of the underlying case from the circumstances of <span class="Italic">Boese</span>, <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span>, and <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>. An appellant was denied fees, although removal was mitigated to a 30-day suspension, because the remaining charge--failure to submit a leave request as directed within the time allotted--amounted to improper conduct that followed prior warnings concerning obedience to instructions. The Board considered the residual charges "the important ones" and as a result, the appellant was not substantially innocent. <span class="Italic">Ryan v. VA</span>, 33 MSPR 463, 467 (1987). Using essentially the same reasoning, fees were denied in <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 557, 561 (1987), to an appellant whose removal as a distribution clerk for taking undeliverable mail was reduced to a 90-day suspension. Distinguishing <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span>, the Board decided there was no showing that a supervisor would have approved the appellant's actions, the appellant was in a position of trust as custodian of property of postal customers, the violation of regulations was not slight or technical, and the 90-day suspension was not "relatively short" (adding in a footnote that the severity or leniency of the 90-day suspension in <span class="Italic">Boese</span> was not the deciding factor in that case in comparison to the court's concern that only the least serious of the charges against the appellant had been sustained). <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> was affirmed on appeal, the court concluding that the charges against the employee involving mishandling of postal material were serious, even though the value of the material was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. The charges that were sustained could not be considered technical, "very secondary," or very minor within the meaning of <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span> and <span class="Italic">Boese</span>. <span class="Italic">Taylor v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3448).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an assault resulting in a 90-day suspension in <span class="Italic">Boese</span> was no bar to a fee award, a 60-day suspension, mitigating a removal, was sufficient to bar a counsel fee award under the substantial innocence test in <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 501, 503-04 (1987) (also discussed concerning the "knew or should have known" test supporting a fee award). Appellant was removed as a threat to himself and others when, as a meatcutter, he upset some meat and threw it and some pans across the room. The AJ mitigated the penalty because the misconduct was isolated and brief, and the appellant quickly calmed down and worked at his job from the time of the incident to the time of removal. The agency's professions of concern about the safety of the appellant and others were undercut by allowing the appellant to continue in his job after the incident. Although fees were awarded on other grounds, as to substantial innocence the Board injected into the analysis the severity of the mitigated penalty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find here, upon consideration of the gravity and circumstances of the sustained offense, that appellant is not substantially innocent of the charges against him. Although appellant has succeeded in overturning the drastic penalty of removal, he is still subject to the significant penalty of a sixty-day suspension. This penalty's potential financial impact illustrates its severity.[1] A sixty-day suspension represents approximately one-sixth of appellant's total yearly salary. As such, it is among the most severe penalties that an agency can impose short of removing the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 131-32 (1987), the Board held that the amount of back pay actually received is not a relevant measure of the extent of an appellant's victory because the amount may vary depending upon such factors as appellant's success in finding another source of income. However, the potential loss an appellant faces is clearly a good measure of a penalty's severity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the nature of the sustained charges against appellant is vastly different from the minor and technical violations at issue in <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>. While the agency did not establish that appellant was a threat or that his conduct was likely to recur, an outburst such as appellant's could have had disastrous consequences in the environment of a meat cutting room. Thus, we conclude that appellant is not substantially innocent of the sustained charges, as that criterion is defined in <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, because those charges against appellant are very serious.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another decision mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension barred fees for services other than the defense of a frivolous agency PFR, <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOD</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 42-43 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, unlike <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, the sustained misconduct was not based on technical or minor violations but on the appellant's disruptive and <span id="Page_4608"></span>violent behavior in the work place....&#8197;Further, unlike the employee in <span class="Italic">Massa</span> [post], the appellant in this case cannot be said to have been an "innocent victim" of any agency conduct....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has also noted the financial impact of a 60-day suspension, which represents approximately one-sixth of the appellant's annual salary, illustrates the severity of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 MSPR at 504.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in the administrative judge's finding that the assault and battery charge was the primary charge in this case and that the remaining charges were considered to be secondary....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]ll three of the original charges stemmed from the same incident....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's findings that the sustained misconduct was serious and that the appellant's actions were not excused...indicates that the charges were far from technical, minor, or secondary. Accordingly, we find that the appellant was not without fault and was therefore not substantially innocent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 40 MSPR 638, 641-42 (1989), appellant was demoted from a GM-13 Supervisory Computer Specialist to GS-11 Computer Specialist. The AJ mitigated the demotion to a nonsupervisory GS-12 position based on two sustained charges: failing to effectively supervise and manage; and failing to produce acceptable work products. Fees were denied under the substantial innocence criterion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">VanFossen</span>...the court held that an appellant may be substantially innocent for purposes of an attorney fee award where the sustained charges were insignificant and the penalty was reduced significantly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The charges sustained against the appellant were not insignificant. The errors identified in the Warehouse Subsystem's program were so fundamental--the Subsystem took as much time to run as performing the tasks manually; it aborted several times during the initial runs; and it did not have any restart capabilities, requiring the system to start from the beginning when it aborted--that they should have been noted by the appellant in his review of his subordinate's work and should have been identified by the appellant through testing before the Subsystem was turned over to the user....&#8197;[T]he seriousness of the problems with the Warehouse Subsystem reflected adversely on the appellant's assignment decision and on his monitoring of his subordinate's progress....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while only these two specifications were sustained, they evidence significant failures basic to both the technical and supervisory aspects of the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the penalty was not significantly reduced. Although it was mitigated, it nonetheless denied the appellant supervisory status. Thus, the Board finds that the appellant was not substantially innocent of the major charges....</p>

Cir. 1996), found that court determining that fees should not be awarded, despite mitigation, when a major charge is sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz appealed the agency action and sought arbitration. After an extensive hearing, the arbitrator sustained the charges. Specifically, the arbitrator found Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz culpable in the mistaken administration of Mivacron to the patients. At the same time, because systemic failures at the Medical Center contributed significantly to the tragedy, the arbitrator mitigated Mr. Dunn's and Mr. Ruiz's penalties. In particular, the arbitrator noted the similarity in the manufacturer's labeling of Mivacron and Metronidazole, the proximity of storage locations for the two drugs, and the failure of the administering nurses to confirm that they had the proper drugs. For these reasons, the arbitrator mitigated the dismissal sanction for Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz to four weeks suspension without pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After they were reinstated, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz filed a request for attorney fees. The arbitrator denied their request. Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz now seek this court's review of the denial of attorney fees.</p>

Far from vindicating the appellants, the arbitrator found them culpable in the mistaken administration of Mivacron to patients. Rather than declaring Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz innocent, the arbitrator declared: "[t]heir lack of care in assuring that the labels correctly identified the contents of the IV bags made them culpable." Notwithstanding certain systemic failures, the arbitrator continued, Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz had inexcusably neglected their "fundamental responsibilities to make absolutely certain that the labels accurately portrayed the contents of all IV bags." As the arbitrator noted, "heavy discipline [of Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz] is appropriate." Indeed the arbitrator took care to note that the mitigated penalty for Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz was still "the maximum he imposes short of discharge." By no means did the arbitrator exonerate Mr. Dunn and Mr. Ruiz. Moreover, the findings of culpability and the imposition of a penalty just short of discharge dispel any notion that the agency's original decision to discharge was "without merit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's decision in <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span> does not compel a different conclusion. 788 F.2d 748. In <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, an employee sought attorney fees following mitigation of his penalty from removal to a thirty-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 748. The court rejected a rigid rule urged by the Board that would have denied fees under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category two whenever the Board sustained the underlying charges against the employee, regardless of whether the penalty was mitigated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 750. According to the court, "[t]hat mechanical position disregards the nature and weight of the particular offenses, and treats fleas as always the equivalent of elephants." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the charges against Van Fossen were "technical and very minor," the court sustained an award of fees in the interest of justice<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 751 (Van Fossen engaged in outside employment without acquiring prior authorization).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike <span class="Italic">Van Fossen</span>, this case involves charges of a serious and grave nature. On <span class="Italic">Van Fossen's</span> flea-elephant scale, mislabeling of dangerous drugs resulting in a fatality lies toward the mammoth end. The arbitrator found that Mr. Dunn's and Mr. Ruiz's negligence led to the death of one patient and the injury of three others. Under these circumstances, this court has no reservation about affirming the arbitrator's determination that fees are not warranted under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category two. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 750 ("The gravity and circumstances of the offenses sustained are important factors in determining whether and to what extent fees should be allowed.").</p>
