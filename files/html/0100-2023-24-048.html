<h5 class="h5" id="sec17-45"><span class="space">a.</span> Disability Retirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">T</span>he limited scope of judicial review of Board decisions under 5 USC 7703 is further circumscribed in disability retirement cases. The additional limitation is imposed by a "finality clause" in the retirement statute. Some history is helpful to understand the present judicial review scheme.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As of 1956, disability retirement annuities were administered in accordance with Title IV of Pub.L. 854, 70 Stat. 758-59 (July 31, 1956) (amending the Civil Service Retirement Act of May 29, 1930) [References to the "Commission" are to the Civil Service Commission, predecessor to the Office of Personnel Management and the MSPB]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SEC. 16. (a) This Act shall be administered by the Commission. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Commission is hereby authorized and directed to perform, or cause to be performed, any and all acts and to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary and proper for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this Act into full force and effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b) Applications under this Act shall be in such form as the Commission shall prescribe, and shall be supported by such certificates from departments or agencies as the Commission may deem necessary to the determination of the rights of applicants. The Commission shall adjudicate all claims under this Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c) Questions of dependency and disability arising under this Act shall be determined by the Commission and its decisions with respect to such matters shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review. The Commission may order or direct at any time such medical or other examinations as it shall deem necessary to determine the facts relative to the disability or dependency of any person receiving or applying for annuity under this Act, and may suspend or deny any such annuity for failure to submit to any such examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d) An appeal to the Commission shall lie from any administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of any person or of the United States under this Act, the procedure on appeal to be prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The statute was amended in 1966 by Pub.L. 554, 80 Stat. 583 (Sept. 6, 1966), codified to 5 USC 8347:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a) The Civil Service Commission shall administer this subchapter. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, the Commission shall perform, or cause to be performed, such acts and prescribe such regulations as are necessary and proper to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b) Applications under this subchapter shall be in such form as the Commission prescribes. Agencies shall support the applications by such certificates as the Commission considers necessary to the determination of the rights of applicants. The Commission shall adjudicate all claims under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c) The Commission shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter. The decisions of the Commission concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review. The Commission may direct at any time such medical or other examinations as it considers necessary to determine the facts concerning disability or dependency of an individual receiving or applying for annuity under this subchapter. The Commission may suspend or deny annuity for failure to submit to examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d) An administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter may be appealed to the Commission under procedures prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 amended 5 USC 8347 to substitute OPM and MSPB for the Commission, and those changes will be discussed below. Before the Reform Act was enacted, the "finality" clause was interpreted as to judicial review of a disability retirement application, initiated by an agency for an employee's mental disability, granted by the Civil Service Commission (resulting in the disability separation of the plaintiff), then unsuccessfully challenged in the Court of Claims, resulting in a decision explaining the limited scope of judicial review available to an appellant in a disability retirement appeal, <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States</span>, 397 F.2d 295, 297-300, 184 Ct. Cl. 530 (1968), <span class="Italic">cert. den</span>. 89 S. Ct. 376 (1968):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Retirement Act provides 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347 (1964 Supp. II], formerly 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2266] that 'the Commission shall determine questions of disability and dependency' and its decisions 'concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review.' This is a special and unusual restriction on judicial examination, and under it courts are not as free to review Commission retirement decisions as they would be if the 'finality' clause were not there.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Plaintiff calls a disability retirement for psychiatric reasons a 'badge of infamy.' In answer to a similar argument, the Fifth Circuit recently said (<span class="Italic">Chafin v. Pratt</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 358 F.2d at 357): 'Appellant has not lost the right to work elsewhere as a secretary, retirement is certainly less drastic than outright discharge, and appellant's retirement for disability, even if interpreted as she does to be a finding of mental incompetence, casts no aspersion on her moral character or loyalty.'</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only other question is whether the Commission, in appraising the materials before it, made an error going to the heart of the administrative determination.[7] Since we cannot weigh the evidence for ourselves or even apply the conventional 'substantial evidence' standard, there is little point to setting out a full summary of the record. The Board of Appeals and Review, as well as the Commissioners, had before them Dr. Shapiro's three-page, single-spaced report (based on his psychiatric examination of the plaintiff) which contained the details of his psychiatric interview, what the plaintiff told him, how she responded to his questions, and his observations.'...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;There is no contention that the Commission misconstrued the substantive aspects of the Retirement Act or of its regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other side were short written medical statements, favorable to her position, which were supplied by plaintiff....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At most, this record presents a pure conflict of medical evidence, and it is <span id="Page_5215"></span>of course settled that 'a court cannot substitute its judgment on medical evidence for the determination of the Commission.' <span class="Italic">Gaines v. United States</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 158 Ct. Cl. at 502<span class="Italic">. See</span>, to the same effect, <span class="Italic">Ellmore v. Brucker</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 236 F.2d at 736; <span class="Italic">Cerrano v. Fleishman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 339 F.2d at 931. There is plainly no error going to the 'heart of the administrative determination' when the Commission accepts one medical view rather than another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Two other attacks on the determination are left. The first is that the Board of Appeals and Review and the Commissioners did not examine all the material before them. There is nothing whatever to support this charge and it is contradicted by the Board's observation that it carefully considered 'all the facts.' An unsupported allegation of this kind is obviously fruitless. <span class="Italic">Cf. Harrington v. United States</span>, 161 Ct. Cl. 432, 442 (1963).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other assertion is that the Commission's decision was vitiated by bad faith since, it is said, both the report of Dr. Shapiro and that of Dr. Alderete (the staff psychiatrist at the Public Health Service Hospital) were made in <span class="Italic">mala fide</span>. This is an issue which could have been, but was not, presented to the Board of Appeals and Review and to the Commissioners. Under <span class="Italic">Pine v. United States</span>, 371 F.2d 466, 178 Ct. Cl. 146 (1967), we need not consider it. In any event, the assault is based on nothing but disagreement with certain of the statements in the reports which fall far short (on the most adverse interpretation) of indicating bad faith. No affidavits are presented nor detailed factual allegations made. There is no reason for a further inquiry on this point (<span class="Italic">Greenway v. United States</span>, 163 Ct. Cl. 72, 82 (1963)), and plaintiff does not even ask for a trial. Obviously, we have here nothing approaching the 'well-nigh irrefragable proof' needed to show bad faith, personal animus, or 'railroading.' <span class="Italic">Knotts v. United States</span>, 121 F.

<p class="Body-Text">Early in its history, MSPB determined that the Reform Act placed it into a position of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> reviewer on appeals from OPM disability retirement decisions. <span class="Italic">Chavez v. OPM</span>, 6 MSPR 404, 408-24 (1981), rejected OPM's argument that the "finality clause" limited the scope of MSPB review of those decisions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM contends that the "finality clause" of 5 U.S.C. 8347(c) limits the Board's scope of review to that employed by the appellate courts, and precludes the Board from considering evidence which had not previously been presented to OPM. While both of those contentions have already been essentially resolved adversely to OPM's position, <span class="Italic">see Hein, supra,</span> and <span class="Italic">Toppi v. OPM,</span> 2 MSPB 360 (1980), we will address them in an effort to clarify the applicable legal principles once and for all.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subchapter III of Chapter 83, Title 5, U.S. Code, related to civil service retirement. Prior to enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (the Reform Act), the administrative determination of retirement benefit claims by federal employees, including disability retirement, was vested exclusively in the Civil Service Commission. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8347 (1976). Since the Commission performed both administrative and appellate adjudicatory functions with respect to federal personnel matters, the statute referred to the Commission's role in both respects. Subsections (c) and (d) of Section 8347 thus provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;The Commission shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter. The decisions of the Commission concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review. The Commission may direct at any time such medical or other examinations as it considers necessary to determine the facts concerning disability or dependency of an individual receiving or applying for annuity under this subchapter. The Commission may suspend or deny annuity for failure to submit to examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;An administrative action or order affecting the rights or interests of an individual or of the United States under this subchapter may be appealed to the Commission under procedures prescribed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Commission's regulations, the administrative determinations called for by subsection 8347(c) were made by the Commission's Bureau of Retirement, Insurance, and Occupational Health (BRIOH). 5 C.F.R. 831.1204 (1978). However, if BRIOH disallowed an application, the affected applicant had a right of administrative appeal as provided by subsection 8347(d). The appellate adjudicatory functions called for by subsection 8347(d) were performed by the Commission's Federal Employee Appeals Authority (FEAA), subject to reopening by the Commission's Appeals Review Board (ARB). 5 C.F.R. 831.1205 (1978) and 5 C.F.R. Part 772 (1978). The decisions of FEAA appeals officers, or of the ARB in reopened cases, including decisions reversing BRIOH determinations, were final and there was no further right of appeal. 5 C.F.R. 772.309, 772.310(g) (1978). Since both BRIOH and the appellate bodies FEAA and ARB were constituent units of the Commission, no question arose of any inconsistency between the "finality clause" of subsection 8347(c) and the appellate adjudicatory functions performed by the FEAA and ARB under subsection 8347(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission's procedures provided for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the FEAA of BRIOH determinations. Appellants before the FEAA had a right to a hearing, to designate a representative, to produce and cross-examine witnesses, to introduce documentary and other evidence, to request that the hearing be open to the public, and to obtain a transcript of the hearing. 5 C.F.R. 772.307 (1978). Such FEAA review, including specifically the right to a hearing, was expressly provided for appeals from BRIOH determinations in disability retirement cases. 5 C.F.R. 831.1205 (1978). Nothing in the Commission's regulations, or in the FEAA's normal practice, limited appellants before the FEAA to the documentary record considered by BRIOH. Indeed, since there was no provision for BRIOH to hear witnesses or to consider any evidence beyond the written reports and other documentary information appearing in the employee's file, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.1204 (1978), the provision for a hearing with witnesses before the FEAA necessarily entitled the appellant to present for the FEAA's consideration evidence which had not been presented to BRIOH.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Thus, in the Commission's consistent administrative practice, the "finality clause" of subsection 8347(c) was construed solely as a limitation upon <span class="Italic">judicial</span> review of Commission disability retirement determinations. It was not construed as limiting an appellant's right of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review upon appeal of BRIOH decisions to the FEAA. Consistently with that construction, the courts interpreted subsection 8347(c) to limit judicial review of Commission disability retirement determinations to whether there had been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.[3] Despite their aversion to reviewing the Commission's determinations, the courts did review the records of the administrative proceedings to ascertain the existence of some evidence to support the Commission's disability determinations. The courts equated any harmful misjudgment by the Commission in evaluating the evidence to "an error going to the heart of the administrative determination."[4] The courts made it plain, however, that they could not weigh the evidence or even apply the conventional "substantial evidence" standard for review of the Commission's disability determinations.[5]</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The only change made by the Reform Act in subsections 8347(c) and (d) was to substitute OPM for the Commission in subsection (c) and this Board for the Commission in subsection (d). Both of those changes were described by the Congress as mere technical amendments to conform those subsections with the substantive provisions of the Reform Act, which bifurcated the administrative and appellate functions of the former Commission and devolved them upon OPM and this Board respectively. Neither the Reform Act nor its legislative history supports the proposition that the substitution of this Board as the administrative appellate authority which adjudicates retirement-related appeals under subsection 8347(d) was designed to restrict the administrative appeal rights theretofore accorded the parties in retirement-related claims. A congressional intent to limit the Board's administrative appellate review of OPM's determinations of retirement-related claims may not be gleaned from these technical amendments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On the contrary, a clearly opposite congressional intent is manifested by the broad grant of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review authority to the Board provided by 5 U.S.C. 7701, as amended by the Reform Act, which applies expressly and unequivocally to all matters which are appealable to the Board "under any law, rule, or regulation." Since subsection 8347(d) clearly is a "law" under which applicants in disability retirement cases may submit an appeal to the Board, such appeals are necessarily governed by Section 7701. We so held in <span class="Italic">Hein, supra,</span> and we now reaffirm that decision. The Reform Act contains no provision for Board consideration of "appeals," whether authorized under that act or under some other statutory or regulatory authority, which are not to be governed by Section 7701.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM asserts that in this case the Board's presiding official erred in considering the medical report by Dr. Feldman, the allergy specialist, because that report had not been submitted to OPM when appellant applied for disability retirement. Under its theory that <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review by the Board is inconsistent with the finality clause of Section 8347(c), OPM urges the Board to "direct its Field Offices in future disability retirement appeals to refuse to admit any <span class="Italic">de novo</span> evidence--particularly medical evidence--which had not been submitted to OPM with the application." However, the Board has consistently rejected the theory that its scope of review is limited to that of the appellate courts or to consideration of the administrative record established before the agency,[10] and we reject it here. The limitation for which OPM contends would render nugatory the right of appellants to a hearing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 7701(a) and 1205(a)(1), and our implementing regulations at 5 C.F.R. 1201.24(c). It would also be inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. 8347(c) and (d) as consistently construed by the former Civil Service Commission, and as re-enacted without substantive change by the Reform Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 315-318 (1981); <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 MSPB 489, 497-99 (1980); <span class="Italic">Toppi v. OPM, supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We conclude for these reasons that in adjudicating an appeal to the Board under 5 U.S.C. 8347(d) from an OPM disability retirement determination, the Board is not limited to a review of the record before OPM. We are mandated by 5 U.S.C. 7701(a) and (b) to conduct a hearing if requested by the appellant, and to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all the relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record. Nothing in the law or in our regulations restricts OPM to reliance upon its documentary administrative record, or withholds from OPM a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine or otherwise rebut appellant's evidence presented at the Board's hearing.[13] We therefore find no merit to OPM's contention that the presiding official erred in admitting and considering additional medical evidence during the adjudication of the appeal below.[14]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[13]&#x2003;Nor does anything in the law or in our regulations prevent OPM from reconsidering its disallowance of an appellant's application, and possibly settling the case, in light of the evidence presented to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Toppi v. OPM, supra.</span> While OPM has apparently restricted itself from doing so by its own self-imposed limitation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.110(c), that limitation can be removed at OPM's discretion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8347(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[14]&#x2003;The additional evidence in this case related to the same medical condition on which appellant had based his application to OPM. By contrast, since we have jurisdiction under 6 U.S.C. 8347(d) only to consider matters "appealed" to us, we do not consider in such cases evidence relating to a totally different or additional medical condition which was never the subject of an appellant's application to OPM. <span class="Italic">See Scovens v. OPM,</span> 5 MSPB 833 (1981); <span class="Italic">Hudson v. OPM,</span> 1 MSPB 1 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The next question was the scope of judicial review of Board and OPM decisions following the Reform Act. That issue was resolved, and the Scroggins approach was left undisturbed, by <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. OPM</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 773-791, 105 S. Ct. 1620, 1626 (1985) [footnotes omitted], parting ways with the Federal Circuit (rejecting review authority) and determining that "while the factual underpinnings of &#x00A7; 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed, such review is available to determine whether 'there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some other error going to the heart of the administrative determination'":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978</span> (CSRA). This legislation comprehensively overhauled the civil service system. Several of the CSRA's provisions bear on this case. First, Congress abolished the Civil Service Commission and created the OPM, which is now responsible for administering the Retirement Act. CSRA &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 201, 906, 92 Stat. 1118, 1224; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(a). Second, Congress created the MSPB, and directed that one of the Board's duties would be to review OPM's decisions in Retirement Act cases "under procedures prescribed by the Board." CSRA &#x00A7; 906, 92 Stat. 1225; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1). Third, Congress created a new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against "employees" and "applicants for employment": it established exacting standards for review of such actions by the MSPB, provided that "employees" and "applicants for employment" could obtain judicial review of MSPB decisions, and specified the standards for judicial review of such actions. CSRA &#x00A7; 205, 92 Stat. 1138, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7701, 7703 (1976 ed., Supp. V). Finally, Congress provided generally that jurisdiction over "a final order or final decision of the Board" would be in the Court of Claims, pursuant to the Tucker Act, or in the regional courts of appeals, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2342. <span class="Italic">See</span> CSRA &#x00A7; 205, 92 Stat. 1143, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1)(1976 ed., Supp. V).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Public Law 96-500</span> ("the 1980 amendment"). Congress revisited the finality language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347 in 1980, and enacted legislation providing that one subclass of Retirement Act applicants would enjoy the enhanced administrative and judicial review provisions of the recently enacted CSRA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"In the case of any individual found by [OPM] to be disabled in whole or in part on the basis of the individual's mental condition, and that finding was made pursuant to an application by an agency for purposes of disability retirement under section 8337(a)of this title, the [MSPB review] procedures under section 7701 of this title shall apply and the decision of the Board shall be subject to judicial review under section 7703 of this title."

FCIA &#x00A7; 127, 96 Stat. 37, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295. Whereas the Court of Claims and the regional courts of appeals formerly shared jurisdiction over appeals from the MSPB, the Federal Circuit now has exclusive jurisdiction "of an appeal from a final order or final decision" of the Board pursuant to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9); <span class="Italic">see</span> FCIA &#x00A7; 144, 96 Stat. 45.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit sitting <span class="Italic">en banc</span> dismissed Lindahl's appeal as barred by &#x00A7; 8347(c). 718 F. 2d 391 (1983). The court concluded that the plain words of the subsection, along with the structure of the civil service laws and the import of the 1980 amendment, overcome the usual presumption favoring judicial review of administrative action. The court acknowledged that courts for almost 30 years had interpreted &#x00A7; 8347(c) permit judicial of alleged legal and procedural errors, but concluded that "those cases...would have to be viewed as wrongly decided and overruled." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 396. The court also rejected Lindahl's argument that the legislative history of the 1980 amendment indicated Congress' intention to preserve limited judicial review in Retirement Act cases. Two judges filed qualified concurring opinions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 400 (Nichols, J.), 405 (Nies, J.). Four others dissented, arguing, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the legislative history of the 1980 amendment demonstrates Congress' awareness of the previous judicial construction of &#x00A7; 8347(c) and its intention to preserve judicial review to the extent previously recognized. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 405 (Davis, J., joined <span id="Page_5217"></span>by Friedman, Kashiwa, and Smith, JJ.), 407 (Smith, J., joined by Friedman, Davis, and Kashiwa, JJ.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have often noted that "only upon a showing of 'clear and convincing evidence' of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial review." <span class="Italic">Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</span> 387U. S. 136, 141(1967). <span class="Italic">See also Dunlop v. Bachowski,</span> 421 U. S. 560, 568 (1975). The Court previously has applied just such a presumption in Retirement Act cases, albeit prior to the enactment of &#x00A7; 8347(c). <span class="Italic">See Dismuke v. United States,</span> 297 U.S., at 172 (judicial review presumed available "in the absence of compelling [statutory] language" to the contrary). Of course, the "clear and convincing evidence" standard has never turned on a talismanic test. <span class="Italic">Block v. Community Nutrition Institute,</span> 467 U.S. 340, 346-346 (1984). Rather, the question whether a statute precludes judicial review "is determined not only from its express language, but also from the structure of the statutory scheme, its objectives, its legislative history, and the nature of the administrative action involved." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 345.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit reasoned that &#x00A7; 8347(c), except as qualified by &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2), plainly precludes any judicial review of OPM decisions in voluntary disability retirement cases: "[i]t is difficult to conceive of a more clear-cut statement of congressional intent to preclude review than one in which the concept of finality is thrice repeated in a single sentence." 718 F. 2d, at 393. We do not share the Federal Circuit's certainty with respect to the plain import of the statutory language. To begin with, while &#x00A7; 8347(c) plausibly can be read as imposing an absolute bar to judicial review, it also quite naturally can be read as precluding review only of OPM's <span class="Italic">factual</span> determinations about "questions of disability factual and dependency." Under this reading of &#x00A7; 8347(c)'s language, the factual "question" whether an applicant is disabled is quite distinct from questions of what laws and procedures the OPM must apply in administering the Retirement Act. In addition, the application of &#x00A7; 8347(c) as completely preclusive is problematic when a disability applicant, as here, challenges not only OPM's determinations but also the standards and procedures used by the MSPB in reviewing those determinations. Section 8347(c) speaks of the preclusive effect of OPM determinations, but says nothing one way or the other about the finality of MSPB judgments. Finally, our hesitation regarding the "plain meaning" of &#x00A7; 8347(c) is compounded by the fact that, when Congress intends to bar judicial review altogether, it typically employs language far more unambiguous and comprehensive than that set forth in &#x00A7; 8347. Congress' failure to use similar language in &#x00A7; 8347(c) therefore reinforces the possibility that the finality bar may extend only to OPM's <span class="Italic">factual</span> determinations "with respect to" disability and dependency questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Until Congress' 1980 amendment of &#x00A7; 8347, this was precisely the interpretation adopted by courts in reviewing disability retirement decisions by the OPM and its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission. Under the "<span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>" standard, so-called after <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States,</span> 184 Ct. Cl. 530, 397 F. 2d 295, <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 393 U.S. 952 (1968), courts acknowledged that &#x00A7; 8347(c) imposes "a special and unusual restriction on judicial examination, and under it courts are not as free to review Commission retirement decisions as they would be if the finality' clause were not there." 184 Ct. Cl., at 533-534, 397 F. 2d, at 297. Accordingly, courts emphasized that they could not weigh the evidence or even apply the traditional substantial-evidence standard for reviewing disability determinations. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 534, 397 F. 2d, at 297. Courts also held, however, that &#x00A7; 8347(c)'s finality language did not prevent them from reviewing Commission decisions to determine whether there had been '"a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error "going to the heart of the administrative determination."'" <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit nevertheless believed that Congress' revision of &#x00A7; 8347 in 1980 "provide[s] compelling evidence of its intent to preclude judicial review of MSPB decisions on voluntary disability retirement claims." 718 F. 2d, at 394. Again employing a "plain words" analysis, the court reasoned that the addition of &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2)--providing for MSPB review of involuntary mental disability retirement decisions pursuant to the standards of &#x00A7; 7701 and for judicial review of such decisions pursuant to the standards of &#x00A7; 7703--demonstrates that Congress intended all other types of disability retirement decisions to be unreviewable. "To hold that judicial review of all &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1) decisions had all along been available under &#x00A7; 7703, would be to render superfluous Congress' action in &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2), making judicial review available for particular claims under &#x00A7; 7703." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 399.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Again we cannot agree that the meaning of the 1980 amendment is "plain" on its face. The <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard allows only for review of legal and procedural errors. The 1980 amendment added &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2), which provides special safeguards in cases of involuntary mental disability retirements. That subsection incorporates &#x00A7; 7703, which provides, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> for a substantial-evidence standard of review of the factual bases of OPM's decisions. Given the much more deferential <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard of review, there would be nothing "superfluous" about an amendment providing for the full measure of judicial review pursuant to &#x00A7; 7703 in one subclass of retirement cases. There is certainly nothing on the face of the 1980 amendment suggesting that Congress intended to discard <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> review generally while expanding upon it in a particular category of cases. Absent more compelling indicia of congressional intent--whether from the overall statutory structure or from the legislative history--"we thus believe in these circumstances that '[t]he mere fact that some acts are made reviewable should not suffice to support an implication of exclusion as to others.'" <span class="Italic">Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</span> 387U. S., at 141(citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the fact that Congress amended &#x00A7; 8347 in 1980 without explicitly repealing the established <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> doctrine itself gives rise to a presumption that Congress intended to embody <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> in the amended version of &#x00A7; 8347. We need not rely on the bare force of this presumption here, however, because the legislative history of the 1980 amendment demonstrates that Congress was indeed well aware of the <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard, amended &#x00A7; 8347 on its disability retirement decisions generally, and intended that <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> review continue except to the extent augmented by exacting standards of &#x00A7; 8347(d)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Congress had intended by the 1980 amendment not only to expand judicial review in mental disability cases beyond the established <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard but to abolish the standard in all other cases as well, there would presumably be some indication in the legislative history to this effect. There is none. Nor, despite Congress' explicit consideration of the <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> interpretation of &#x00A7; 8347, did Congress amend the wording of the finality clause other than to provide for more expansive review in mental disability cases. "Given that the sole purpose of the amendment was to expand judicial protection of employees through review of factual findings in a certain subset of cases, it hardly follows that Congress negatively implied its intent to strip" employees of <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>-type review in other cases. <span class="Italic">v</span> 228 U.S. App. D.C. 94, 98, 707 F. 2d 1499, 1503 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit therefore erred in concluding that &#x00A7; 8347, as amended, altogether bars judicial review of MSPB decisions in retirement disability cases. Accordingly, while the factual underpinnings of &#x00A7; 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed, such review is available to determine whether "there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error 'going to the heart of the administrative determination."' <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States,</span> 184 Ct. Cl., at 534, 397 F. 2d, at 297.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Until the 1985 Supreme Court decision in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, MSPB decisions denying employee-initiated disability retirement applications were not reviewable in the appellate courts.

The Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> decision determined that &#x00A7; 8347(c) was an express preclusion of judicial review defeating more general review authority found in the Administrative Procedure Act (5 USC 704, 701(a)). <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> rejected the review authority conferred by <span class="Italic">Scroggins v.

The court concluded that OPM's failure to file a timely response to the appeal and the Board's failure to apply maximum sanctions against OPM were not substantial departures from important procedural due process rights.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, Congress enacted the FERS scheme, including OPM administration of that scheme under &#x00A7; 8461, after <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> was decided. Pub. L.

We may hold unlawful and set aside an agency action found to be "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). With one small exception, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(d) precludes us from reviewing the factual underpinnings of physical or mental disability determinations. <span class="Italic">Anthony</span>, 58 F.3d at 626; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8461(e)(2) (excepting findings of mental disability "made pursuant to an application by an agency for purposes of disability retirement under section 8451").

<p class="Block-Quote1">This court's review of a claimant's entitlement to disability retirement benefits is very limited. We cannot review the factual underpinnings of a disability determination. <span class="Italic">See Lindahl v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 791 (1985) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c)). Under &#x00A7; 8347(c), factual "questions of disability and dependency" are "final and conclusive and are not subject to review." Whether substantial evidence supports the Board's disability determination is not a challenge within this court's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Baker v. Off. of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 782 F.2d 993, 994 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We have jurisdiction to determine only "whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination." <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 791 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Harty asks this court to reconsider the evidence she presented to the Board and to overturn the Board's determination. This sort of re-weighing of evidence is precluded by &#x00A7; 8347(c), and thus, this court is without jurisdiction to review her fact-based challenge. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Likewise, we cannot review Ms. Harty's contention that the MRI evidence should be afforded more weight than the Board gave it. Such a determination falls squarely within the statute's mandate that OPM is to determine all "questions of disability and dependency." &#x00A7; 8347(c). The record leaves little doubt that Ms. Harty suffers from back pain, but we lack the authority to consider her challenge to OPM's and the Board's fact findings that the submitted evidence did not demonstrate that "her injury constituted a disability under the law."</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Zeitlin v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 94-3659), explained as to a factual dispute underpinning an OPM decision that the appellant failed to establish eligibility for disability retirement benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Zeitlin argues that OPM and the Board failed to afford proper weight to certain evidence that was submitted by her and that the Administrative Judge (AJ) made faulty determinations about the credibility of certain witnesses. She claims that the AJ inappropriately relied on the testimony of Mr. Ahearn, her immediate supervisor, and that the AJ mistakenly found Mr. Bledsoe's testimony to be "unconvincing." Ms. Zeitlin also argues that the AJ ignored medical evidence and ignored Ms. Zeitlin's own testimony concerning her ongoing pain and alleged inability to perform her duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this court is without jurisdiction to review the factual underpinnings of a Board decision regarding disability retirement benefits. 5 USC &#x00A7; 8347(c) (1988); <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. OPM</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 791 (1985); <span class="Italic">Bruner v. OPM</span>, 996 F.2d 290, 291 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 784 F.2d 397, 398 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

Ms. Zeitlin does not allege such violations, but challenges the factual bases of the Board's decision. We are precluded, however, from inquiring into any of these factual matters. <span class="Italic">See Smith</span>, 784 F.2d at 400 ("The sufficiency of the evidentiary support for the Board's decision ordinarily would not be viewed as a question of procedural rights or construction of legislation, or analogous or comparable to those questions.").

<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing the scope of its review in a disability retirement case, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3064):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee seeks disability-retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System, the governing statute gives OPM the responsibility to "determine questions of disability," and with limited exceptions that include administrative review in the MSPB, the OPM decision on the question is "final and conclusive and... not subject to review." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c). The Supreme Court has interpreted that statutory provision to mean that "the factual underpinnings of &#x00A7; 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed," but that "review is available to determine whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination." <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 791 (1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, this court "cannot review issues related to evidentiary sufficiency or to minor legal errors," but "we can review claims of serious legal error in the course of the proceedings." <span class="Italic">Reilly v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">This case, like many disability cases, turns mainly on the standard of review. Disability claims in general are very factual in nature, and Congress has given this court a very narrow scope of review over Board decisions regarding claims for disability benefits. In sum, while we find this to be a troubling case factually, there is no legal basis for us to intercede. We therefore are constrained to uphold the decision of the Board and, in turn, of OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Weeks v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3017) ("[P]etitioner cites various statements from his physicians and argues that OPM erred in denying petitioner disability retirement benefits. However, these factual allegations fall clearly outside this court's limited jurisdiction.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court may review the Board determination of whether the appellant was unable, because of mental disability, to file a disability retirement application within the statutory period allowed for that filing, <span class="Italic">McLaughlin v. OPM</span>, 353 F.3d 1363, 1366-68 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 470 U.S. 768 (1985), 105 S. Ct. 1620, 84 L. Ed.2d 674 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> addressed an appeal arising under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS).[2] The statutory section at issue in <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> section 8347(c), currently reads in relevant part: The Office shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter. Except to the extent provided under subsection (d) of this section, the decisions of the Office concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c) (2000). During the time relevant to this appeal, the language, concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review has not changed. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 773, 105 S. Ct. 1620.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Currently, 5 U.S.C. 8331-8351 (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> involved a former Navy employee who filed an application for disability retirement based on the disability of acute and chronic bronchitis. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 775, 105 S. Ct. 1620. The Board affirmed OPM's denial of disability retirement because Lindahl had not proved that his disability [was] severe enough to prevent useful, efficient, and safe performance of the essential duties of the position from which [Lindahl was] seeking retirement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 776, 105 S. Ct. 1620 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lindahl's case eventually made its way to this court, where, <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, we held that the language of section 8347(c) stating that the decisions of [OPM] concerning [questions of disability] are final and conclusive and are not subject to review, prevented judicial review of Lindahl's case. <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 718 F.2d 391, 393 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (It is difficult to conceive of a more clear-cut statement of congressional intent to preclude review than one in which the concept of finality is thrice repeated in a single sentence.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversing, the Supreme Court explained that our interpretation of final and conclusive and are not subject to review was overbroad because we failed to distinguish between the factual determinations concerning disability questions and other questions of law and procedure pertaining to disability retirement. In the Court's words:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We do not share the Federal Circuit's certainty with respect to the plain import of the statutory language. To begin with, while &#x00A7; 8347(c) plausibly can be read as imposing an absolute bar to judicial review, it also quite naturally can be read as precluding review only of OPM's <span class="Italic">factual</span> determinations about questions of disability and dependency. Under this reading of &#x00A7; 8347(c)'s language, the factual question whether an applicant is disabled is quite distinct from questions of what laws and procedures OPM must apply in administering the Retirement Act.... &#8197;[W]hen Congress intends to bar judicial review altogether, it typically employs language far more unambiguous and comprehensive than that set forth in 8347. Congress' failure to use similar language in 8347(c) therefore reinforces the possibility that the finality bar may extend only to OPM's <span class="Italic">factual</span> determinations with respect to disability and dependency questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 779-80, 105 S. Ct. 1620 (footnote omitted; emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5220"></span>Finding this reading supported by the legislative history, the Court held that while the factual underpinnings of section 8347 disability determinations may not be judicially reviewed, such review is available to determine whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some error going to the heart of the administrative determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 791, 105 S. Ct. 1620 (citing <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States</span>, 184 Ct. Cl. 530, 397 F.2d 295, 297, <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 393 U.S. 952, 89 S. Ct. 376, 21 L. Ed.2d 363 (1968)). We have recently reaffirmed that our review authority under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> is constrained regarding determinations of disability made in connection with applications for disability retirement. <span class="Italic">See Licausi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 350 F.3d 1359, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the question is whether an applicant should be excused from normal filing deadlines due to mental incompetence, our ordinary review authority is not affected. As noted at the outset, review of whether an applicant should be excused from the normal filing deadlines for mental incompetence does not require a review of a disability determination<span class="Italic">. See Deerinwater</span>, 78 F.3d at 573; <span class="Italic">Killip</span>, 991 F.2d at 1570. This makes sense from a procedural standpoint, and likewise makes sense because disability and mental incompetence for the purposes of waiving the one-year filing deadline examine different facts. A person mentally incompetent for purposes of the waiver may not be, ultimately, determined disabled. Moreover, disability under the statute[3] does not require mental incompetence. Because review of a decision on mental incompetence during the statutory filing period does not implicate the constraints of <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>,[4] we affirm the Board unless its decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8451(a)(1)(B) (2000) (For purposes of this subsection, an employee shall be considered disabled only if the employee is found by the Office to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position.); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.102 (2003) (<span class="Italic">Disabled</span> and <span class="Italic">disability</span> means unable or inability, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's current position.) (emphasis in original).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We note that the government agrees with our conclusion that <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> is not applicable to the determination of our standard of review of questions of waiver based on mental incompetence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> considered the standard of review permitted by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c) of the CSRS, we have applied the teachings of <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> to disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. 8461(d)[5] of the FERS. <span class="Italic">See Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 58 F.3d 620, 625-26 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Accordingly, section 8461(d), like section 8347(c), preserves our ordinary review authority when we are not reviewing determinations of disability made in connection with applications for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;This section also contains the so-called finality clause: the decisions of [OPM] concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review. 5 U.S.C. 8461(d) (2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On matters not involving the existence of disability, but the legal justification for discontinuation of a disability annuity, the reviewing court defers to OPM's construction of the law that the agency is charged with administering.

<p class="Body-Text">The question of what distinguishes a reviewable basic legal issue, involving categorical exclusion of post-retirement medical evidence in disability cases, from a nonreviewable question of fact involving the evaluation of evidence of disability, was presented by <span class="Italic">Reilly v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our jurisdiction to review disability determinations is quite limited. The Civil Service Retirement Act provides in pertinent part that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office [of Personnel Management] <span class="Italic">shall determine questions of disability and dependency arising under this subchapter</span>. Except to the extent provided under subsection (d) of this section [dealing with findings of mental disability], <span class="Italic">the decisions of the Office concerning these matters are final and conclusive and are not subject to review</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(c) (emphasis added). Despite the seemingly unequivocal language of the statute, as the Supreme Court has stated, there is a strong presumption favoring judicial review that can only be rebutted "upon a showing of clear and convincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent." <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 778 (quotation and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> the Supreme Court analyzed the language and history of &#x00A7; 8347. As the Court in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> noted, "&#x00A7; 8347(c) imposes 'a special and unusual restriction on judicial examination, and under it courts are not as free to review [agency] retirement decisions as they would be if the finality clause were not there.'" <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 780 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States,</span> 397 F.2d 295 (Ct. Cl. 1968)). However, the Court concluded that the statute did not entirely deprive our court of jurisdiction to review decisions of the Board on disability claims. The Court cited approvingly our predecessor court's decision in <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, 397 F.2d 295, which held that this court had jurisdiction to review whether there has been "'a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination'" but had no jurisdiction to review factual determinations. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 780-81 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins,</span> 397 F.2d at 297). The Supreme Court adopted this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The result is that, under <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> and <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> we cannot review Board decisions for substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 781-82. However, in the rare case where the petitioner alleges that the agency committed legal errors of sufficient gravity, we have jurisdiction to review the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> 470 U.S. at 790 n.26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> can be understood by examining the prior cases cited by the Supreme Court as applying the <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> standard, as well as more recent cases applying <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> after <span class="Italic">Lindahl.</span> These cases generally fall into either of two categories: first, there are cases holding that we cannot review issues related to evidentiary sufficiency or to minor legal errors. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gaines v. United States,</span> 158 Ct. Cl. 497, 501-503 (1962), relied on by the court in <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> and cited in <span class="Italic">Lindahl,</span> the court rejected "hyper-technical arguments that the [CSC] did not follow every jot and tittle of the applicable procedures," as well as challenges to weighing of medical evidence, as beyond the jurisdiction of the court. <span class="Italic">See also Davis v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 470 F.3d 1059, 1060-61 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The scope of our review under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> and <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span> was most recently addressed by this court in <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 508 F.3d 1034 (Fed. Cir. 2007). We described the scope of our review, concluding that "we may only address the critical legal errors, if any, committed by the [Board] in reviewing OPM's decision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1039.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals,</span> the appellant sought to establish her psychological disability by submitting, among other things, letters and medical reports from her doctors. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1036-38. Her doctors' reports were based primarily on the doctors' consultations with the petitioner, and relied on the petitioner's own description of her psychological symptoms.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> In denying her claim for disability, OPM and the Board gave no weight to the medical evidence because the appellant failed to submit any "objective" medical evidence "such as emergency room reports showing incidents <span id="Page_5221"></span>of panic attack... [and] relevant psychiatric studies or test results." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1039-40. According to OPM, the doctors' opinions were entitled to no weight because the doctor "provided no details concerning any mental status evaluation," and "does not provide copies of any formal cognitive testing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Before the Board, the AJ noted that the medical evidence relied on the appellant's account of her symptoms, and stated that "the evidence presented by Dr. Nichols is only as good as the information given to her by [the appellant] ," and that evidence based on appellant's "subjective narrative" would not be considered. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We rejected the distinction drawn by the Board and OPM between objective evidence of the appellant's condition and subjective, i.e. self-reported, evidence of the appellant's condition. We noted that the doctor's reports inherently involved a determination by the doctor that the appellant's "account of these symptoms is credible." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1042. We held that under general evidentiary rules there was no basis for rejecting such "subjective" medical evidence as irrelevant, and that this legal error went to the heart of the administrative determination. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1043-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In interpreting the Board's decision, we cautioned that the court "must be discerning and cannot be satisfied by opinions that invoke the trappings of factual analysis--<span class="Italic">e.g</span>., by vaguely describing broad swaths of evidence as 'insufficient' or as failing to carry the claimants burden, or simply asserting that all record evidence was considered." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1040.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these standards, we first consider Reilly's argument that the Board "act[ed] arbitrarily and capriciously in conducting a legally insufficient factual analysis" by failing to consider particular items of evidence. For support, Reilly relies primarily on the fact that this evidence was not explicitly mentioned in the Board's decision. We conclude that this claim is beyond our jurisdiction to review. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, arguments relating to whether "the Board improperly failed to consider the totality of the evidence... are, in reality, challenges to the factual underpinnings of the Board's determination. Under <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, we cannot entertain these arguments." 470 F.3d at 1060-61.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, Reilly's argument that the Board categorically rejected all uncorroborated lay evidence is of the type that, if established, likely would be within our jurisdiction to review. Under <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, we have jurisdiction to determine whether the Board gave no weight to evidence pursuant to a legal "error going to the heart of the administrative determination" or "a substantial departure from important procedural rights."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the sufficiency of evidence may not be reviewed in court in a disability appeal, the court may review and correct error by the Board and OPM as to the proper evidentiary test to be applied. <span class="Italic">Vanieken-Ryals v. OPM</span>, 508 F.3d 1034, 1038-40 (Fed. Cir. 2007), cited in <span class="Italic">Reilly</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, rejected an adjudication standard imposed by the Board that effectively allowed only objective evidence as support for a disability determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold issue, we first address whether this court has jurisdiction to hear Vanieken-Ryals' appeal due to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347. While we have exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from a final decision of the MSPB under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9), the scope of review available regarding OPM disability determinations is restricted by &#x00A7; 8347 and by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 470 U.S. 768 (1985). Under that statute as interpreted in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, factual determinations on "questions of disability and dependency" are unreviewable by this or any other court. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347; <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 779-80; <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 58 F.3d 620, 625-26 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court made clear, however, that issues of <span class="Italic">law</span> regarding decisions on disability applications <span class="Italic">are</span> reviewable: "[Judicial] review is available to determine whether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination." <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, 470 U.S. at 791 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scroggins v. United States</span>, 397 F.2d 295, 297 (Ct. Cl. 1968)) (internal quotations omitted). Thus we may only address the critical legal errors, if any, committed by the MSPB in reviewing OPM's decision. Vanieken-Ryals contends that both the MSPB and OPM committed an error of law by entirely rejecting all of her medical evidence simply due to the absence of so-called "objective" medical evidence, arguing that such a requirement is unlawful and not supported by any statute, regulation, or precedent. The government argues that no such requirement was imposed and that the MSPB (and OPM) simply found the medical evidence insufficient to establish disability as a factual matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, however, that the MSPB's decision was indeed predicated on its view that "objective" medical evidence is required to prove disability and that Vanieken-Ryals had failed to meet this requirement, affirming and expressly approving of OPM's holding to this effect. This is evident upon close examination of all three written decisions in this case.... &#8197;OPM then elaborated, criticizing the lack of "documentation such as emergency room reports showing incidents of panic attack" and "relevant psychiatric studies or test results."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its later May 9, 2005 reconsideration decision, OPM further expressed its view that the critical defect in Vanieken-Ryals' evidence was the lack of so-called objective medical documentation...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB in turn enforced OPM's "objective" medical evidence requirement. In his opinion, the AJ pointed to OPM's finding that Vanieken-Ryals had provided "little <span class="Italic">objective</span> medical evidence... to demonstrate that [she] is disabled." He further noted that "OPM also points out that the bulk of the evidence presented by [Vanieken-Ryals] is Dr. Nichol's [sic] reports of what [Vanieken-Ryals] told her." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This latter point was relied on by the AJ in his own analysis, and he remarked that "the evidence presented by Dr. Nichols is only as good as the information given to her by [Vanieken-Ryals]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus the AJ also concluded that Dr. Nichols' reports were necessarily immaterial since they were "subjective" in that they were primarily based on Dr. Nichols' assessment of Vanieken-Ryals' own account of her symptoms and experiences. The AJ made this apparent when he declared that "[t]he <span class="Italic">only</span> evidence which supports [Vanieken-Ryals'] claim of disability is her protracted absence form [sic] work," and emphasized that "the necessity of the absences is based on <span class="Italic">purely subjective medical evidence</span>, which are not supported by an [sic] <span class="Italic">objective medical evidence</span>." Clearly, the AJ totally discounted any probative value that Vanieken-Ryals' medical evidence might have to support her claim of disability since the <span class="Italic">only</span> evidence he credited was her attendance record (which he then also rejected for being based on "purely subjective medical evidence"). His treatment of the medical evidence was thus tantamount to exclusion; he "considered" Dr. Nichols' and Dr. Rummler's evidence but only so far as deciding to disregard it as not at all probative as to her disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span>, by expressly rejecting that the MSPB and OPM are not subject to any judicial review on any issue, indicated that the courts have a limited but important role to play. Both to guard against the substantial errors of law and resulting miscarriage of justice described in <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, and to properly respect our jurisdictional limitations on truly factual determinations, we must be discerning and cannot be satisfied by opinions that invoke the trappings of factual analysis--<span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, by vaguely describing broad swaths of evidence as "insufficient" or as failing to carry the claimant's burden, or simply asserting that all record evidence was considered, all of which the AJ and OPM did here--but, when read closely and carefully, reveal that absolutely no weight was given to certain evidence solely because it can generally be classified as "subjective" and not because of any specific identifiable defect. Giving little weight to specific evidence because of its individual failings, such as the lack of qualifications of the author of a particular medical report, is a factual analysis over which we have no jurisdiction to review. Disqualification of evidence because of its type is an imposition of a legal standard because it inherently imposes a categorical requirement. When the use of such a standard is dispositive of disability retirement claims, they go to the heart of the administrative determination, and we are charged with resolving whether the imposed standard and its inherent evidentiary requirement are lawful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we hold that our jurisdiction is established as to the issue of whether the imposition of an objective medical evidence requirement by the MSPB (or OPM) in disability retirement cases is lawful or "a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination." <span class="Italic">Scroggins</span>, 397 F.2d at 297. We now turn to this issue of law, which we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, keeping in mind that the MSPB decision sustaining OPM's actions may only be reversed if it is arbitrary or capricious, or if it is contrary to law.[5] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;While we may also reverse an MSPB decision if it is unsupported by substantial evidence, our limited review of legal issues only in OPM disability cases does not implicate the substantial evidence standard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The sufficiency of the evidentiary support for the Board's decision ordinarily would not be viewed as a question of procedural rights or construction of legislation, or as analogous or comparable to those questions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3580) (eligibility for disability retirement benefits: citing <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 784 F.2d 397, 400 (Fed. Cir. 1986)).</p>
