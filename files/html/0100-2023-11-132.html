<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> may bar repeated Board litigation of related retirement claims, whether through direct review of OPM reconsideration decisions or through regulation implementation review proceedings, <span class="Italic">Navarro v. OPM</span>, 105 MSPR 278, 281 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 2007 MSPB 78 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The same cause of action means the same set of facts which gives an appellant a right to <span class="Italic">seek</span> relief from the agency. <span class="Italic">Frias v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 276, 280 (1994). Further, the doctrine precludes a party from raising a claim that was, or could have been, asserted in a prior proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Nevada v. United States</span>, 463 U.S. 110, 130 (1983); <span class="Italic">Spears v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 766 F.2d 520, 523 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Fabros v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 2. The doctrine is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 337. The application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is appropriate here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that the Board had jurisdiction to decide the prior appeals concerning the entitlement of petitioner's late husband to an annuity, petitioner's entitlement to a survivor annuity, and petitioner's request for regulation review. The Board's decisions in those cases were adjudicated on the merits by denying the claim of petitioner's husband to an annuity, finding that that denial was <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> of petitioner's request for a survivor annuity, and denying the request for regulation review filed by petitioner. Finally, the denial of petitioner's request for regulation review, whether considered a true challenge to the validity of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.201(a)(13), or in fact an attempt to secure a survivor annuity, is the same cause of action as was present in her earlier appeals and requests for regulation review. Further, to the extent that petitioner's late husband rather than petitioner filed the appeal, the Board found that petitioner was in privity with Mr. Navarro in his previous annuity appeals. To the extent that petitioner's claim in this proceeding is distinguishable from the claim made in her prior proceedings, the claim could have been raised in the earlier proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Morales v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 631, &#x00B6; 7 (2001). Accordingly, we deny petitioner's request for regulation review on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an annuity claim that could have been raised in a prior MSPB annuity appeal, the Board applied <span class="Italic">res judicata,</span> <span class="Italic">Hasanadka v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 636, 640-42 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-18, 2011 MSPB 77 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1573"></span>In its response to the petition for review, OPM appears to concede that the administrative judge incorrectly applied collateral estoppel because the issue in the present appeal is not identical to that in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span>. OPM argues, however, that issues relating to the survivor annuity provisions in the divorce decree could have been raised in the appellant's first Board appeal, and that the appellant is therefore barred from relitigating such claims by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> (also known as "claim preclusion"), a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action. <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995); <span class="Italic">see Muyco v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 694, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in the prior action, and is applicable if: (1) the prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">Peartree</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 337. For claim preclusion to bar a new claim, it must be based on the same set of transactional facts as the earlier one. <span class="Italic">International Air Response v. U.S.</span>, 302 F.3d 1363, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Jet Inc. v. Sewage Aeration Systems</span>, 223 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (explaining that "courts have defined 'transaction' in terms of a 'core of operative facts,' the 'same operative facts,' or the 'same nucleus of operative facts,' and 'based on the same, or nearly the same, factual allegations.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the appellant's first Board appeal was a matter within the Board's jurisdiction that resulted in a final judgment on the merits. There is also no dispute that the same parties were involved in both <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span> and the present appeal. The remaining questions, therefore, are whether the same cause of action is involved in both appeals and whether the issues in the present case could have been raised in the prior appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Encarnado</span>, the Board held that an appellant's prior Board appeal challenging OPM's denial of his application for a retirement annuity barred a subsequent appeal in which he sought to pay a deposit for the same service at issue in his first appeal. The Board reasoned that the appellant sought to make a deposit in order to qualify for a retirement annuity, and that therefore the same cause of action (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the appellant's entitlement to a retirement annuity) was involved in both appeals. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 301, &#x00B6; 12. The Board found that although the appellant did not raise the issue of his eligibility to make a deposit in his first appeal, he could have done so. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Encarnado</span>, we find that the cause of action in the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span>, is the proper calculation of the annuities to be paid to the appellant and his former spouse, respectively. Certainly, the specific arguments raised in the two cases differ. Whereas his primary argument in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span> was that OPM regulations prohibited his former spouse from receiving a greater annuity payment than he did, his primary argument in the present appeal is that his former spouse should pay the full cost of providing a survivor annuity. However, in both cases the appellant's goal is to increase the annuity he receives (and to decrease that of his former spouse). We therefore find that the same cause of action is involved in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span> and the present appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that he did not raise the issue of who is responsible for paying the cost of the survivor annuity in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span> because OPM did not specifically inform him who would be paying that cost. In effect, he argues that the issue is not one that could have been raised in the prior appeal. We disagree. On June 2, 2006, OPM informed the appellant that it had processed his former spouse's claim for a portion of his civil service retirement benefit, and that in accordance with the divorce decree, it would be paying the appellant's former spouse 53% of his gross annuity of $6,063.00, or $3,213.39 per month. One could not reasonably interpret that statement from OPM as an indication that the appellant's former spouse would pay the full cost of providing a survivor annuity. OPM did not indicate that it was reducing his former spouse's annuity payment to pay the cost of providing a survivor annuity, and the specific amount OPM stated it would pay to the appellant's former spouse was equal to a full 53% of the gross annuity. Thus, to the extent the appellant believed his former spouse should have been paying the full cost of providing a survivor annuity (as he argues in the present appeal), OPM's June 2, 2006 letter placed him on notice that OPM did not interpret the relevant court order in that manner. Accordingly, we find that the appellant was on notice as of at least June 2006 that OPM was not going to recover the cost of providing a survivor annuity entirely from his former spouse's annuity, and we find that he was not prevented from raising the issue of who is responsible for paying the cost of the survivor annuity in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that all of the requirements for the application of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> are met. We therefore find that the appellant's claim regarding the cost of providing a survivor annuity is barred by the final judgment in <span class="Italic">Hasanadka I</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...OPM's 1989 reconsideration decision is entitled to administrative <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect. <span class="Italic">See Astoria Federal Savings and Loan Ass'n v. Solimino</span>, 501 U.S. 104, 107, 111 S. Ct. 2166, 2169, 115 L.

Secretary of Health and Human Services</span>, 700 F.2d 566, 568 n.2 (9th Cir. 1983). Because OPM's 1989 reconsideration decision resolved the appellant's claim to an immediate retirement under 5 USC 8336(d)(1) at the administrative level, OPM was entitled to give administrative <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> effect to that final decision and had no obligation to issue another reconsideration decision on the appellant's second application for an immediate retirement. <span class="Italic">See Astoria,</span> 501 U.S. at 107-08, 111 S. Ct. at 2169-70. Although OPM's May 24, 1989 reconsideration decision did not address the appellant's argument that she was entitled to an immediate annuity under 5 USC 8336(d)(1) because her December 31, 1983 resignation was involuntary based on alleged intolerable working conditions, the appellant did not raise the allegations of intolerable working conditions before OPM in her 1988 retirement application. The doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the previous proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Peartree</span>, 66 MSPR at 337.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor does the fact that OPM issued the December 5, 1995 reconsideration decision, addressing again the appellant's claim to an immediate annuity under 5 USC 8336(d)(1) despite its May 24, 1989 reconsideration decision, afford the Board with jurisdiction over this appeal. OPM asserts that it issued the December 5, 1995 reconsideration decision erroneously. In other circumstances, the Board has held that an agency's correction of an administrative error does not give rise to an action appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Paszek v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 50 MSPR 534, 538 (1991) and <span class="Italic">Lemon v. Dept. of Labor,</span> 44 MSPR 43, 47-48 (1990) (the agency's correction of an administrative error in setting a pay-step level was not a reduction in pay action appealable to the Board). Likewise, we find under the circumstances of this appeal that OPM's December 5, 1995 reconsideration decision, issued in error and appropriately rescinded, does not constitute a basis for Board jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Muyco v. OPM</span>, 104 MSPR 557, 561-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12, 2007 MSPB 34 (2007), dismissed an appeal from a an OPM letter that essentially stated that OPM was bound by an earlier reconsideration decision denying an annuity that was earlier affirmed on appeal by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the appellant's assertion that OPM's February 23, 2006 letter to him constitutes a new reconsideration decision, or any other type of decision, on the merits of his entitlement to a CSRS retirement annuity. OPM's letters to the appellant's co-workers, that he submits in support of his assertion, reflect that, once OPM has previously issued a final decision on an individual's entitlement to a CSRS retirement annuity, OPM will not issue another decision unless the individual submits new evidence that establishes actual entitlement to an annuity. OPM's February 23, 2006 letter to the appellant does not alter its prior decision regarding the appellant's entitlement to an annuity, nor its final decision regarding the timeliness of the appellant's previous request for reconsideration. The letter simply informs the appellant that OPM has previously determined that he is not entitled to a CSRS retirement annuity (and the legal basis for its prior initial decision), and that there has been no change in the law which would allow him to qualify for such an annuity. OPM's letter also informs the appellant that its previous decision is final and will not be changed in the future. Thus, OPM's February 23, 2006 letter to the appellant clearly does not constitute a decision on the merits of the appellant's entitlement to a CSRS retirement annuity or on the timeliness of the appellant's prior request for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we <span class="Italic">see</span> no legal error or abuse of discretion in OPM's refusal to issue a new reconsideration decision simply because the appellant appears dissatisfied with OPM's prior decision and requested <span id="Page_1574"></span>further consideration. Although the Board has found jurisdiction in retirement annuity appeals where OPM has improperly failed or refused to issue a reconsideration decision after issuing an initial decision on an individual's application for a retirement annuity, following the individual's timely request for such a decision, <span class="Italic">see Johnson v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 193, &#x00B6; 6 (2004); <span class="Italic">McNeese v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 70, 74, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 40 F.3d 1250 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), those circumstances are not present in this case. As previously noted, OPM issued a final decision on the appellant's original application for a CSRS retirement annuity and the appellant filed an appeal with the Board regarding that final decision. Further, the appellant did not submit new evidence establishing his actual entitlement to a CSRS retirement annuity; he merely submitted citations to older Board decisions that allegedly show legal error in OPM's previous decisions. Thus, at best, the appellant's purported new evidence constituted nothing more than legal argument that he could and should have raised before OPM at the time OPM was considering his original application. We find that OPM's letter informing the appellant that it was rejecting his request to reconsider his application on the basis of allegedly "new evidence" did not constitute an appealable final decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Annuity appeals based on different sets of claims are not barred by collateral estoppel or <span class="Italic">res judicata,</span> <span class="Italic">McNeel v. OPM</span>, 113 MSPR 356, 363-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-22, 2010 MSPB 44 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to challenging OPM's decision to terminate his disability annuity in 1997, the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant is also claiming implicitly that OPM should have reinstated his disability benefits prior to June 9, 2003. A request to reinstate a disability retirement annuity is distinct from a challenge to the original decision to terminate the annuity. <span class="Italic">See DeGrant v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 414, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10, 12 (2007). The record reflects that the appellant asked OPM to reinstate his annuity in 1999, and OPM denied that request in a reconsideration decision dated January 21, 2000. The record also reflects that OPM granted a subsequent reinstatement request from the appellant, and reinstated his annuity effective June 9, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue of whether OPM should have reinstated the appellant's annuity prior to June 9, 2003, has not been actually litigated in any of the appellant's prior Board appeals. Thus, the doctrine of collateral estoppel does not apply. <span class="Italic">See generally McNeil v. Department of Defense,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 146, &#x00B6; 15 (2005) (the doctrine of collateral estoppel may apply if, among other things, the identical issue was "actually litigated" by the parties in a prior case). Further, although the Board's final decision in <span class="Italic">McNeel I</span> was a judgment on the merits of the termination of the appellant's disability benefits in 1997, the issue of whether the appellant subsequently became eligible for reinstatement of his benefits is a different cause of action. <span class="Italic">See DeGrant,</span> 107 M.S.P.R. 414, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10, 12. Similarly, none of the appellant's other Board appeals have resulted in a judgment on the merits of the appellant's reinstatement claim. Thus, the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not apply. <span class="Italic">See generally Wade,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. at 399 ("Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a valid, final judgment on the merits of an action bars a second action involving the same parties or their privies based on the same cause of action.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant did not immediately appeal OPM's January 21, 2000 reconsideration decision or OPM's November 25, 2003 decision to reinstate his disability benefits effective June 9, 2003. To the extent that he is trying to do so now, his appeal may be untimely, as the record reflects that, after these decisions were issued, he did not attempt to raise any issues concerning his disability retirement until May 2, 2007, when he filed his second Board appeal. We note that, although the January 21, 2000 reconsideration decision contained notice of the appellant's Board appeal rights, the November 25, 2003 letter did not contain such notice. We decline to rule on the timeliness issue based on the existing record, because the parties had no notice of or opportunity to address the timeliness issue below. We remand the appeal to allow the administrative judge to notify the appellant of his burden of proof on the timeliness issue, consider whether his appeal of his reinstatement claim was timely filed and, if not, determine whether the appellant has shown good cause for any delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22. In addressing the timeliness issue, the administrative judge should consider the effect, if any, of the appellant's alleged chronic medical conditions on his ability to timely file his appeal pursuant to <span class="Italic">Lacy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant's delusional disorder diagnosis is not barred by res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues here, as he did below that his second application included several conditions that were not previously identified "such as PTSD, [d]elusional [d]isorder, [o]bsessive [b]ehavior, [c]hronic [p]ain and several conditions relating to his back and spine." The appellant's first disability retirement application to OPM listed major depression, acute anxiety, emotional crisis, panic attacks, panic episodes, back injury and pain, and opioid dependence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), delusional disorder is within the schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders and is not related to the anxiety and depressive disorders that the appellant identified in his disability retirement application. Therefore, we find that the appellant's delusional disorder is a new condition that he did not identify in his first disability application. Thus, he is entitled to a decision on the merits on his second disability retirement application as it relates to his delusional disorder diagnosis.[3]</p>

The appellant attempted to include that he suffered from delusional disorder in his first appeal. He alleged that he submitted evidence of this condition to OPM and they failed to consider it.

<p class="Body-Text">According to the DSM-5, there are close relationships between the anxiety disorders and some of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.
