<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-32"><span class="space">a.</span> Determining Whether Removal Is Based on Reason Unrelated to OWCP Entitlement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">There can be difficulties determining if an employee is removed for misconduct or for a compensable injury. In the latter event, the employee may have restoration rights, [described in <a href="0100-2023-13-102.html#sec6-101">Chapter 14</a>]. <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. USPS,</span> 174 Fed. Appx. 555, 556-58 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), endorsed a test of "reasonable belief" by the management deciding official to determine the motivating factor for the employee's dismissal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Pedro G. Bagunas, Jr. ("Bagunas") petitions for review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board"), affirming denial of Bagunas' request for restoration following his full recovery from a compensable injury. <span class="Italic">Bagunas v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, No. SF-0353-03-0470-I-2, 98 M.S.P.R. 637 (May 3, 2005). Finding no reversible error in the Board's decision, we <span class="Italic">affirm</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bagunas was hired as a Letter Carrier at the Livermore, California Post Office on April 24, 1999, subject to a 90-day probationary period. On May 7, 1999, his first day delivering mail, he complained to his trainer, Christine Warner, about discomfort in his eye. Bagunas was absent from work for several full days and several partial days. He was terminated from his probationary position by letter on May 19, 1999. The termination letter explained that "[i]n light of events that have taken place during [Bagunas'] probationary period, there is a question as to [his] work ethics," and that "there will not be sufficient time in order to properly evaluate [his] performance."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bagunas filed a claim for benefits with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) on September 2, 1999. His claim was accepted for corneal abrasion of the right eye. He was granted OWCP benefits from May 8, 1999, through May 23, 1999.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bagunas requested reinstatement to his City Carrier position in letters dated August 7, 2002 and May 2, 2003, on the theory that he was entitled to restoration rights pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Bagunas appealed the agency's denial of reinstatement on June 11, 2003. In a March 5, 2004, decision, the Administrative Judge ("AJ") denied Bagunas' request for restoration because he had failed to show that the termination was substantially related to his compensable injury, and concluded that there was no need to address the question of timeliness....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who fully recovers from a compensable injury within one year "is entitled to be restored immediately and unconditionally to his or her former position or an equivalent one." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(a) (2005); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b) (2000). However, the employee is only entitled to restoration if the employee was separated "as a result of a compensable injury." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 353.103(b) (2005). To establish restoration rights, a petitioner must prove by preponderant evidence (1) that he suffered a compensable injury or the recurrence of such an injury; (2) that his OWCP benefits were terminated on the basis that he fully recovered from his injury and were terminated within one year from the date on which they began; and (3) that his separation was "substantially related" to his injury. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.103(b); <span class="Italic">see Walley v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 279 F.3d 1010, 1016 (Fed. Cir. 2002), abrogated on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322, 2006 (Fed. Cir. 2006). In order to show that termination was substantially related to his compensable injury, the petitioner must show that the separation was solely attributable to the compensable injury. <span class="Italic">See Walley</span>, 279 F.3d at 1016; <span class="Italic">New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that Bagunas received benefits relating to his eye injury from OWCP from May 8, 1999, to May 23, 1999, and that his payments were terminated because he had fully recovered from his condition. However, the parties dispute whether the agency's termination was "substantially related" to a compensable injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The termination letter indicated that Bagunas was removed for two reasons: first, because of his "work ethics"; and second, because there was insufficient time to evaluate his performance. Although the lack of time to evaluate Bagunas' performance may have been substantially related to his compensable injury, the AJ concluded that he was also removed because of questionable work ethics, a reason unrelated to his injury, and thus he had "failed to show that there was no valid cause aside from the injury that precipitated the agency's action." Specifically, the AJ found that "Ms. Smith terminated the appellant, in part, because he did not report the injury immediately and because she believed he may have been making a false claim for an on-the-job injury." Termination for failure to report an on-the-job injury would be a reason unrelated to the injury itself. There is no suggestion that Bagunas' injury prevented him from timely reporting the nature of the injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ apparently concluded that the agency's reasonable belief that Bagunas had failed to follow instructions constituted a "valid cause" for his removal unrelated to his injury, even though Bagunas may have in fact followed instructions. The AJ stated that "<span class="Italic">even assuming that the appellant could prove that he had followed instructions and told Ms. Warner that his injury had occurred on-the-job</span>, the merits of the agency's action are not before the Board, and the only question is whether the appellant's termination was 'solely' attributable to the compensable injury." The AJ found, based on his evaluation of the testimony, that "appellant did not make it clear to either Ms. Warner or Ms. Smith that he had incurred an on-the-job injury until 3 days after the injury allegedly occurred--May 10, 1999--at the earliest...." Accordingly, the AJ found that "Ms. Smith had <span class="Italic">reason to believe</span> that the appellant had not followed her instructions to report an injury immediately...." No case law has been called to our attention suggesting that a "reasonable belief" standard is inappropriate. Moreover, a contrary rule would require evaluation of decisions on the merits of the removal action during restoration proceedings. We therefore conclude that Bagunas is not entitled to restoration if the agency reasonably believed it was discharging Bagunas for a cause unrelated to the injury.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nelson v. USPS</span>, 200 Fed. Appx. 983, 983-86 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP), also explained Board jurisdiction in cases involving claims to restoration following compensable injury when the employee was, according to the employer, terminated for cause unrelated to the injury:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 13, 2004, Ms. Nelson began duty as a Part-Time Flexible City Carrier for the United States Postal Service. As a probationary employee, she was required to complete a 90-day probationary period, during which she would receive periodic performance evaluations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following two weeks of training, Ms. Nelson reported to a Postal Service facility in Brunswick, Georgia, where her supervisor, Belinda Hardee, assigned her to an auxiliary postal route. On November 19, 2004, Ms. Nelson received a 30-day evaluation. In that first evaluation, Ms. Hardee rated Ms. Nelson as "satisfactory" in five of six categories, but deemed her performance as "unsatisfactory" in the category of "Work Quantity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 9, 2004, Ms. Nelson was involved in a motor vehicle accident with another postal vehicle and sustained an injury to her right hand. Ms. Nelson was granted two days off and returned on December 13, 2004. The following day, Ms. Nelson received her 60-day evaluation. In that second evaluation, Ms. Hardee rated Ms. Nelson "unsatisfactory" in four categories, including "Work Quantity," "Dependability," "Work Relations," and "Personal Conduct." Concluding that Ms. Nelson had "Fail[ed] to Meet Probation Standards," Ms. Hardee issued a notice of termination, effective December 14, 2004.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In that letter, Ms. Hardee stated that Ms. Nelson's "measured performance does not meet measurement standards for the city carrier craft" and "does not meet proficiency standards established by the Postal Service." Ms. Hardee explained that Ms. Nelson's 30- and 60-day evaluations indicated that she had "not demonstrated acceptable levels of performance in 4 of the 6 skill factors." Ms. Hardee also noted that on December 7, Ms. Nelson had complained about a change to her scheduled assignment. Ms. Hardee stated that the incident "demonstrates unwillingness to be flexible, even though flexibility is a key element of this position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Nelson subsequently filed an appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board, alleging that the agency had denied her request for restoration to duty following her full recovery from a compensable injury. The administrative judge assigned to the case conducted a hearing and concluded that Ms. Nelson failed to show that she is entitled to restoration to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted that Ms. Nelson bore the burden of establishing that her termination was "substantially related to her compensable injury." Citing our decision in <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987), the administrative judge stated that "[by] definition, separation <span class="Italic">as a result of</span> a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury." (emphasis in original). The administrative judge explained that "the employee must show that no cause aside from the compensable injury precipitated the termination."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2484"></span>The administrative judge also found that "the record clearly establishes that the agency had raised concerns about [Ms. Nelson's] performance and conduct prior to the appellant's compensable injury on December 9, 2004." Citing specific "Workhour Workload Report[s]," the administrative judge observed that the "record is replete with evidence of [Ms. Nelson's] substandard casing speed." In particular, he noted that the report for the rating period of November 19, 2004, to December 11, 2004, "shows that [Ms. Nelson's] casing speed/office time was below the minimum standard every day of the rating period but one prior to the date of her compensable injury."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge further noted that "Ms. Hardee credibly testified, and [Ms. Nelson] did not dispute," that two days prior to the compensable injury, Ms. Hardee and Ms. Nelson had a confrontation over the decision to reassign Ms. Nelson's route. The administrative judge thus found that concerns about Ms. Nelson's "bad attitude" and unwillingness to be flexible had arisen prior to the date of her injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, the administrative judge concluded that the agency had clearly established a basis for its termination action "that was rooted in [Ms. Nelson's] performance long before [her] compensable injury occurred." Because Ms. Nelson had "failed to show that there was no valid cause aside from the injury that precipitated the agency's action," the administrative judge ruled that she was not entitled to restoration to duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Nelson argues that the administrative judge applied an incorrect standard under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301 because he improperly relied on this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 279 F.3d 1010 (Fed. Cir. 2002), and <span class="Italic">New v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1998). According to Ms. Nelson, those cases, which require the employee to show that the separation is "solely attributable to the compensable injury," <span class="Italic">Walley</span>, 279 F.3d at 1016 n.6, are distinguishable because they involve employees who were either partially recovered (<span class="Italic">Walley</span>) or fully recovered after more than one year (<span class="Italic">New</span>). In contrast, Ms. Nelson asserts that she is an employee who recovered fully within one year and that a different standard applies in her situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In making that argument, Ms. Nelson overlooks the fact that an employee who recovers from a compensable injury, whether partially or fully, within one year or after one year, is not immune from separation for cause. Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.108, "separation for cause that is substantially unrelated to the injury...negates restoration rights." Moreover, as we explained in <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, and as noted by the administrative judge, "[by] definition, separation <span class="Italic">as a result of</span> a compensable injury excludes a valid removal for cause unrelated to the employee's compensable injury." 817 F.2d 100, 101 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Consequently, the administrative judge appropriately required Ms. Nelson to establish that she was not terminated for a reason substantially unrelated to her injury. Because the administrative judge found that the termination action "was rooted in [Ms. Nelson's] performance long before [her] compensable injury occurred," the administrative judge did not err in denying her request for restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Nelson argues that four cases, <span class="Italic">Raicovich v. United States Postal Service,</span> 675 F.2d 417 (D.C. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Ruppert v. United States Postal Service,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 593 (1981); <span class="Italic">Rishavy v. United States Postal Service,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 528 (1987); and <span class="Italic">Roche v. United States Postal Service,</span> 828 F.2d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 1987), stand for the proposition that "unsatisfactory performance does not preclude restoration." Those cases, however, do not support her request for restoration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span>, the court's decision to reinstate Raicovich was based on the government's concession that he "could not have been dismissed at the time of his injury on the basis of the three disciplinary incidents." 675 F.2d at 424 n.7. Unlike in Ms. Nelson's case, Raicovich's previous misconduct did not rise to a level requiring removal, and reinstatement was granted because separation was not for cause. <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span> therefore does not assist Ms. Nelson, who was found to have been terminated for cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Ruppert</span> the Board found that there was a relationship between Ruppert's injury and the reason for his separation, and that "the separation indisputably would not have occurred in the manner that it did had [Ruppert] not been injured." <span class="Italic">Ruppert</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. at 596. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Ruppert</span> also does not apply to Ms. Nelson's situation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Rishavy</span> and <span class="Italic">Roche</span> are entirely inapposite. <span class="Italic">Rishavy</span> merely addressed the question whether restoration rights are applicable to employees serving in probationary status, an issue that is not in dispute in Ms. Nelson's case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 35 M.S.P.R. at 531. And <span class="Italic">Roche</span> dealt only with the question of jurisdiction; that is, "whether Roche sufficiently alleged that he was removed due to a compensable injury." 828 F.2d at 1557 (remanded to the Board "for a hearing on the jurisdictional issue"). Here, that question is not at issue; the administrative judge expressly found that Ms. Nelson had made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. Ms. Nelson's reliance on <span class="Italic">Raicovich</span>, <span class="Italic">Ruppert</span>, <span class="Italic">Rishavy</span>, and <span class="Italic">Roche</span> is therefore misplaced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analyzing the connection between a compensable injury, a Labor Department determination, and the basis for removal, AWOL, <span class="Italic">Carlson v. USPS,</span> DC-0353-10-0743-I-1 (NP 5/18/2011), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that, as part of her burden of proving jurisdiction, the appellant must make a non-frivolous allegation that she was separated because of a compensable injury and not for cause. [<span class="Italic">S</span>]<span class="Italic">ee, e.g., Payton v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 403 F. App'x 496 (Fed. Cir. 2010), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 131 S. Ct. 965 (2011). A compensable injury is a medical condition accepted by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be job-related and for which medical or monetary benefits are payable from the Employees' Compensation Fund. The determination of whether an individual suffers from a medical condition that is compensable under the Federal Employees Compensation Act is within the exclusive purview of OWCP (subject to review by the Employees' Compensation Appeals Board) and neither the employing agency nor the Board has the authority to make such a determination. <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge erred in dismissing her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. As the administrative judge found, the appellant's grievance did not result in the agency withdrawing her removal, but in a March 21, 1995 pre-arbitration settlement in which she withdrew her grievance with the provision that "[i]f and when" she received OWCP benefits, the agency would offer her a rehabilitation position. As the administrative judge also found, the latest undisputed evidence--dated December 26, 2002--showed that OWCP had denied the appellant's claim for compensation for the period during which she was charged absent without leave, i.e., beginning April 21, 1994....Therefore, even if the agency offered her reinstatement in 1997 based on previous OWCP decisions finding in her favor, she has not made a non-frivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over her appeal--on the basis that she was absent because of a compensable injury--because OWCP concluded in its latest decision that she was not entitled to compensation for the period during which she was charged absent without leave. <span class="Italic">Cf. King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 341, &#x00B6; 8 (2001) (a removal action based on Absence Without Leave cannot be sustained when OWCP subsequently determines that the employee was entitled to compensation benefits as a result of a work-related injury for the entire period charged to Absence Without Leave. That nexus is sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction, unless she was removed for cause unrelated to her compensable injury).</p>
