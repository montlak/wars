<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-71"><span class="space">b.</span> Post-PIP Performance; Roller Coaster Employees</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 646 (1990), addressed when an agency may consider and when the Board may decide a Chapter 43 case based on post-PIP performance. The concern was with an employee who, receiving a PIP, improves performance, but who, after the PIP ends, allows his performance to descend to the point that another PIP is required, the phenomenon of the serial pipper--probably a rare phenomenon, given the trauma visited upon most employees through the imposition of a PIP. The Board's solution for the roller coaster performer found expression concerning a GM-13 employee who received a 30-day PIP and was evaluated, instead, over a period of 90 days. It was determined that the employee's performance during the PIP would not sustain action against him. The question then became whether the agency should have continued the evaluation past the formal PIP period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before returning to <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> to answer the question, a little background is provided. First, the "advance notice" is defined by 5 USC 4303(b)(1)(A):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of this section, an agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)(1)&#x2003;An employee whose reduction in grade or removal is proposed under this section is entitled to--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;30 days' advance written notice of the proposed action which identifies--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;specific instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the proposed action is based; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;the critical elements of the employee's position involved in each instance of unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "advance notice" is the proposed performance-based removal or demotion. Turning to 5 USC 4303(d):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for 1 year from the date of the advance written notice provided under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed under this section shall be removed from any agency record relating to the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The two statutory provisions lead to interesting conclusions: that an agency shall consider the employee's performance not only during the PIP but, if the PIP is failed, the agency may also consider performance during the 30-day period (extendable by 30 days under 5 USC 4303(b)(2), subject to the conditions of 5 CFR 432.105(i)(B) (2022)) following the notice of proposed removal or demotion. If the employee receives favorable reviews during the post-notice period and the agency decides to then take no action, under &#x00A7; 4303(d), the employee is then on what amounts to a one-year PIP starting with the date of the proposal notice. If the employee's again falls to the level of unacceptable, as interpreted by the cases that follow, the agency may take action in accordance with a proposal letter providing notice of post-PIP deficiencies, the opportunity to respond, a decision, and a notice of Board appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">White v. VA</span>, 120 MSPR 405, 409-10 &#x00B6; 6, 2013 MSPB 97 (2013), noted of the one-year extension of a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM regulations and Board case law have long recognized what is required to provide a reasonable opportunity to improve to an employee whose performance is unacceptable until the PIP, improves during the PIP, but shortly thereafter deteriorates and again becomes unacceptable. <span class="Italic">See Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 646, 656 (1990). OPM's regulation provides that: (1) once an employee has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve, an agency may propose a reduction in grade or removal action if the employee's performance "during or following" the PIP is unacceptable in one or more of the critical elements involved in the PIP; (2) if an employee who has been placed on a PIP performs acceptably for 1 year (starting with the commencement of the PIP), he is entitled to a new PIP if his performance again becomes unacceptable; and (3) a proposed reduction in grade or removal may be based on instances of unacceptable performance that occur within a 1-year period ending on the date of notice of proposed action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 432.105(a)(1)-(3).[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In promulgating these provisions, OPM stated that it was clarifying that "employees may be subject to removal or reduction in grade if acceptable performance demonstrated during the opportunity to improve is only short-term or temporary," and stated its belief that it was "strik[ing] a balance between the needs of agencies for an efficient and effective work force and the rights of employees to a reasonable chance to demonstrate they can overcome serious performance deficiencies." 54 Fed. Reg. 26172, 26177 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Referenced in <span class="Italic">White</span> is the OPM regulation (revised in 2020 and again in 2022), 5 CFR 432.105 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Proposing and taking action based on unacceptable performance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposing action based on unacceptable performance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Once an employee has been afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance pursuant to &#x00A7; 432.104, an agency may propose a reduction-in-grade or removal action if the employee's performance during or following the opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance is unacceptable in one or more of the critical elements for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If an employee has performed acceptably for 1 year from the beginning of an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance (in the critical element(s) for which the employee was afforded an opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance), and the employee's performance again becomes unacceptable, the agency shall afford the employee an additional opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before determining whether to propose a reduction in grade or removal under this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A proposed action may be based on instances of unacceptable performance which occur within a 1 year period ending on the date of the notice of proposed action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The calculus under the regulation is two-part. Assume that a 90-day PIP is instituted on January 1, 2020. The employee does well and there is no proposal to fire or demote the employee. if the employee's performance remains acceptable until January 1, 2021, performance-based action could only be initiated through another PIP. But if the employee's performance declines to unacceptable in November 2020, and if the agency decides in January of 2021 to propose removal under Chapter 43, the agency action could consider unacceptable performance from January of 2020 through the date of the proposal--or at least that seems the intent of the regulation and 5 USC 4303(c-d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Back to the question. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> determined that performance after the close of a PIP may be considered in determining whether the agency may take a performance-based action under Chapter 43 if the instances of unacceptable performance are in the same critical element or elements involved in the PIP <span id="Page_2943"></span>and if, consistent with 5 USC 4303(d), reliance is limited to those instances that occur prior to one year from the advance notice issued under &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(A), 44 MSPR at 656-61:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The position of OPM, the agency, and most of the agency <span class="Italic">amici</span> is that the Board should allow agencies to rely on post-PIP performance. Their major concern, the briefs make clear, is the "roller coaster" employee, one whose performance is unacceptable until the PIP, then improves to the marginal level during the PIP, but shortly thereafter deteriorates and again becomes unacceptable. If agencies were required to place such an employee on a second PIP simply on the basis of his ability to perform marginally for a limited time, they argue, it is likely that the employee would spend much of his career on successive PIPs, following successive periods of no better than marginal performance. To avoid this result, some of the agencies argue that acceptable performance must be sustained after a PIP for 5 years or more before the employee may be entitled to a new opportunity period following unacceptable performance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant did not respond to the notice of opportunity to submit briefs, two employee unions and the representatives for certain other appellants named in the Board's orders did so. Their position, generally, is that an employee who performs acceptably during a PIP may not be removed, demoted, or reassigned under Chapter 43, irrespective of how briefly his period of post-PIP acceptable performance lasts. Their contention is that Congress intended to provide for removal or demotion under Chapter 43 only where the employee has not demonstrated rehabilitation through acceptable performance, and that where he has done so, he is entitled to a new opportunity if his performance again becomes unacceptable. They also posit that a second performance problem may not be due to the same reason that caused the first. For example, the original problem may have been in a different critical element than the later one, new technology or procedures may have been introduced in the interim, the critical elements themselves may have been revised, or the employee may now be suffering from a handicap that entitles him to rehabilitation under the antidiscrimination laws. Finally, they point out that the agency is free to take an adverse action, under 5 USC Chapter 75, if an immediate response to uneven performance is necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having carefully considered the positions of the parties and <span class="Italic">amici,</span> the Board concludes that there is some validity to the positions of both sides and holds that, within certain important limitations, post-PIP performance may be relied on to sustain a Chapter 43 action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reading of the statute demonstrates that its scheme provides for greater protections for an employee before an action has been taken than he would be entitled to under Chapter 75, in return for the lessened burden of proof on an agency once the action is effected. <span class="Italic">See Lovshin v. Department of the Navy,</span> 767 F.2d 826, 842 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 475 U.S. 1111, 106 S. Ct. 1523, 89 L. Ed.2d 921 (1986). As we reiterate today in our decision in <span class="Italic">Brown,</span> slip op. at 6, the "guarantee of notice and an opportunity to correct performance deficiencies is a substantive right of fundamental importance." <span class="Italic">See Sandland,</span> 23 MSPR at 588-90. Nonetheless, two other provisions of the statute indicate that Congress did not intend that performance during the PIP must be dispositive and that all post-PIP performance be disregarded. Specifically, 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303(b)(2) allows the agency to extend the notice period of a proposed Chapter 43 action from 30 to 60 days, and section 4303(d) provides that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If, because of performance improvement by the employee during the notice period, the employee is not reduced in grade or removed, and the employee's performance continues to be acceptable for one year from the date of the advance written notice provided under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, any entry or other notation of the unacceptable performance for which the action was proposed under this section shall be removed from any agency record relating to the employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress thus foresaw a situation in which an employee might perform unacceptably during a PIP, but improve his performance thereafter during the advance notice period, and made specific provision for allowing that employee to retain his job.[12] It required the employee to maintain that acceptable performance for a one year period after the date of the notice of proposed action, but once he did so, mandated that the agency expunge his record. Clearly, then, Congress did not intend that all performance after the close of the PIP be disregarded for every purpose.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;The legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (October 13, 1978), contains a statement that "[t]he bill does not require...that the agency's decision whether to take action against an employee must, in each instance, be governed by the performance...during the specific 30- or 60-day notice period afforded him under section 4303." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 42, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, II Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 1506 (1979). This statement would have been nonsensical if the outcome of the PIP were always dispositive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history contains an additional indication that Congress intended to allow consideration of post-PIP performance, this time where that performance is not acceptable:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Committee added to section 4303(b), as proposed in the original bill, the requirement that the advance notice to the employee must specifically cite any failure by the employee during the past year which the agency may consider when making a decision on the proposed action. <span class="Italic">An agency may consider, for example, a previous proposal to remove which was not carried out because of short term improvement in performance.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 43, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, II Legislative History of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, at 1507 (1979) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we note that the legislative history is replete with statements that the primary purpose of Chapter 43 was to "simplify and expedite procedures for dismissals of Federal employees whose performance is below the acceptable level." <span class="Italic">Lisiecki v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Home Loan Bank Board,</span> 23 MSPR 633, 638-39 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom., Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 769 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1985), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 475 U.S. 1108, 106 S. Ct. 1514, 89 L. Ed.2d 913 (1986). <span class="Italic">See also Lovshin,</span> 767 F.2d at 841 ("[t]he CSRA must be interpreted so as to give effect to Congress' expressed desire that the new statute serve the <span class="Italic">public's interest</span> in seeing that employees who do not live up to the public trust can be efficiently removed..."). (Emphasis in the original.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of these provisions of the law and its legislative history, the Board concludes that consideration of post-PIP performance was not foreclosed by Congress and that in order to effectuate the purpose of the law, its consideration may be appropriate. We are persuaded that Congress intended neither to reward the "roller coaster" employee nor to make agencies repeatedly provide time-consuming PIPs in such a circumstance. At the same time, we find no support for the view that allowing an employee a single PIP will, under all circumstances and for all time, satisfy the agency's obligation, particularly where the agency has not demonstrated a history of poor performance, <span class="Italic">see Brown,</span> slip op. at 9, and provided warnings and assistance to the employee in the past.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the suggestion that because agencies have available to them the procedures of Chapter 75, post-PIP performance should be disregarded for all purposes. The establishment of Chapter 43 was clearly a central purpose of the Civil Service Reform Act. Although the Federal Circuit has held that Chapter 75 still remains viable as a basis for taking performance-based actions, <span class="Italic">Lovshin,</span> 767 F.2d 826, Congress obviously established Chapter 43 to respond to the needs of the public and management, and thereby provided employees with substantial advantages as well. We decline the invitation to allow the scope and importance of Chapter 43 to turn on the actions of the few who would use the system to their advantage by sustaining acceptable performance only so long as necessary to avoid an action under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold here that an agency may generally rely on instances of unacceptable performance in the same critical element or elements that occur after the successful completion of a PIP. Consistent with 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303(d), reliance must be limited to those instances that occur within 1 year of the advance notice issued under section 4303(b)(1)(A). In those cases where no such notice is issued because of improved performance during the PIP, we find that it would not accord with fairness or the intent of the provision to allow the agency to delay taking action indefinitely beyond the close of the PIP. Thus, reading together 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4302(b)(6), 4303(c)(2)(A), and 4303(d), we find that the 1 year period should be limited not only retroactively but prospectively as well, by requiring that the agency not delay taking action more than one year after the beginning of the PIP. Beyond that date, if performance again falls, the agency should be required to place the employee on a new PIP before initiating action under Chapter 43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reiterate what has been the law since <span class="Italic">Sandland</span>, 23 MSPR 583, that the agency retains the burden of proving by substantial evidence that an employee received a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. Our holding that post-PIP performance may be considered in some circumstances does not change that allocation of the burden of proof. Thus, where the agency makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that it provided a reasonable opportunity to improve, in response to which the employee shows that new technology, procedures, or other work-related factors were introduced after the PIP that changed the nature of the work or the way in which it is to be performed, the agency must meet its burden of proof that the single PIP nonetheless constitutes a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. If it does not, the action cannot stand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, if the agency has revised the employee's critical element after the successful completion of his PIP, a Chapter 43 action based on that PIP will not be sustained unless the agency shows that reliance on that PIP would be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the degree of notice provided to an employee will be important <span id="Page_2944"></span>in instances like the present, where the length of the PIP was not clearly known, or where the agency attempts to take an action on the basis of a successfully completed PIP. There may be circumstances that render such an action unfair and not sustainable, but we note that it will be no defense to such an action for the employee simply to assert that he was prejudiced by a lack of notice because if he had known that his performance was still being watched he would have worked more diligently. Our holding should in no way be interpreted to encourage relaxation of effort because the employee has narrowly avoided removal or demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because we have determined that post-PIP performance may be considered under some circumstances, we address the related issue [of] the weight to be accorded such post-PIP performance....&#8197;[W]e find that where the agency has not taken action on the basis of performance during the PIP alone, it may rely on the employee's performance during both the pre- and post-PIP periods, combined with performance during the PIP itself, to show that performance overall was unacceptable. The Board, then, will necessarily have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether that showing constitutes substantial evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance in the context of the employee's annual performance plan. A realistic application of the performance standards will, of course, govern any such inquiry. <span class="Italic">Cf. Shuman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 23 MSPR 620, 628-29 (1984) (determination of whether unacceptable performance of a single component of a multiple-component performance standard constitutes a proper basis for action under Chapter 43 turns on the agency's demonstration that it constitutes substantial evidence of unacceptable performance on the element as a whole).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> still requires notice of post-PIP deficiencies. For the agency to rely on post-PIP performance deficiencies, it must make clear in the proposal letter that it is not basing the action on the appellant's performance during the PIP alone. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. VA</span>, 59 MSPR 340, 346 (1993). If the agency action is based on unacceptable performance during the PIP, the case is not properly analyzed for post-PIP performance. <span class="italic">See Lin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 2023 MSPB 2, &#x00B6; 23 (2023) ("While considering this period is appropriate for determining whether the appellant's performance again deteriorated after the CIP, the proper period for assessing the appellant's opportunity to improve is the CIP period itself, from January 14 to May 13, 2013.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In early 2012, the Board provided some interpretation of the 1990 <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span> decision. In <span class="Italic">Muff v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 117 MSPR 291, 292-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2012 MSPB 5 (2012), the appellant survived a PIP, performed well for a number of months but fell short of the required level of performance for one month after the PIP. The Board reversed the ensuing removal, determining that the agency could not, for a standard that was based on an annual rate, select one month of performance post-PIP to justify a removal; instead, the period of performance relied upon must demonstrate "evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency removed the appellant from the GS-4 position of Field Representative under chapter 43 procedures for failing to maintain acceptable performance in a critical element of her position. The agency's charge relied on instances of unacceptable performance in critical element 1 (CE 1), Interviewing/Response Rate/Listing/Sampling, that occurred during a 1-month period in May 2010 after her earlier successful completion of the PIP and within a year of the advance notice that the agency was placing her on a PIP. The appellant had served the PIP from July 1 through October 31, 2009, for the same critical element, CE 1. The critical element provides that the appellant "[c]ollects data for current surveys and/or other one-time surveys by contacting respondents by a designated personal visit or telephone call." The purpose of the surveys is to provide information on labor force characteristics of the U.S. population to obtain estimates regarding employment, unemployment, earnings, hours of work and other indicators. As a Field Representative, the appellant was charged with obtaining responses from the households by gaining their cooperation. To perform at the minimally successful level in CE 1, the appellant's survey response rate had to be at an annual rate of 90%. The appellant's response rate for May 2010 was 87.50%. The agency based the removal action on this 1 month of unacceptable performance in CE 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed the agency's action. She claimed that the agency's action was the result of harmful procedural error. Based on the record developed by the parties, including hearing testimony, the administrative judge reversed the agency's action. He found the agency failed to prove by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance of the critical element in question was unacceptable. Specifically, he found the agency established by substantial evidence that the appellant's performance of CE 1 in May 2010 was at the unacceptable level. He found further, however, that under the circumstances of this case, the appellant's performance for only 1 month was an insufficient basis on which to remove her under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(d) because the agency failed to consider her performance for any other month after her successful completion of the PIP. He noted that the agency cited no authority for its contention that it could base a removal action on 1 month of performance without considering other post-PIP performance. He also found that the "overwhelming" evidence of record shows that the appellant's cumulative performance for the 1-year period preceding the proposal to remove her was at the acceptable level. With regard to the appellant's harmful error claim, he found she failed to prove it. He ordered the agency to afford the appellant interim relief if any party filed a petition for review of the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency may reduce in grade or remove an employee for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 when the agency proves by substantial evidence that: (1) The agency had performance standards that were approved by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); (2) the appellant's performance fails to meet the established performance standards in one or more critical elements of her position; (3) the agency established performance standards and critical elements and communicated them to the appellant at the beginning of the performance appraisal period; (4) the agency warned the appellant of the inadequacies of her performance during the appraisal period and gave her an adequate opportunity to improve; and (5) after an adequate PIP, the appellant's performance remained unacceptable in at least one critical element. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez v. Department of Transportation</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 250, &#x00B6; 6 (2008). The agency may remove an employee for unsuccessful performance under chapter 43 after the successful completion of a PIP if: (1) the instances of unacceptable performance are in the same critical elements involved in the PIP and (2) the agency's reliance for its action is limited to those instances of performance that occur within 1 year of the advance notice of the PIP. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 646, 656-61 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant stipulated that OPM had approved the agency's performance appraisal system, her performance standards were communicated to her and were valid, and she was given a reasonable opportunity to improve her performance. Thus, there is only one issue still in dispute: whether, when the appellant's performance was acceptable at the end of the PIP, the agency may take an action within 1 year of the advance notice of the PIP based on 1 month of unacceptable performance in the same critical element without consideration of other months of successful performance during and after the successful PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 656, the Board held that, within certain important limitations, post-PIP performance may be relied on to sustain a chapter 43 action. The Board found that Congress did not intend that all performance after the close of the PIP should be disregarded for every purpose and indicated that both acceptable and unacceptable performance after the PIP could be considered by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 657-58. The Board held that an agency may rely on instances of unacceptable performance in the same critical element or elements that occur within a year of the advance notice that an agency was placing an employee on a PIP, even after the successful completion of a PIP, to take an action against an employee under chapter 43 without affording the employee another opportunity to improve. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 659.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Board found that, although it had determined that post-PIP performance may be considered under some circumstances, no overall formula for application in such cases would be appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 660-61. The Board found instead that it would determine on a case-by-case basis what constitutes substantial evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance in the context of the employee's annual performance plan. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board stated that a realistic application of the performance standards would govern any such inquiry. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency agrees it was required to comply with <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. It asserts, however, that the administrative judge improperly relied on <span class="Italic">Brown v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 635, 642-43 (1990), to adjudicate the appeal. The agency's assertion is without merit. The administrative judge relied on the finding in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that explains the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. Specifically, the administrative judge relied on the holding in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> that, if the administrative judge determines that the appellant performed the critical element acceptably during the PIP, he should then determine whether the appellant continued to perform that element acceptably thereafter and, if he finds that performance failures occurred after the PIP, he must determine whether those failures, in light of the appellant's performance during the year preceding the notice of proposed removal, amount to unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 644. In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, the Board noted that this holding was consistent with its decision in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. Thus, the administrative judge properly relied on <span class="Italic">Brown</span> to the extent that it clarified the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. Consistent with the guidance in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, the administrative judge properly considered the appellant's performance during the 1 year preceding the notice of proposed removal. He correctly found that the appellant's survey response rate during that interval, including the response rate for May 2010, was better than the 90% required for a minimally successful rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2945"></span>Moreover, the administrative judge relied on the fact that the performance standard under which the appellant performed refers to a cumulative response rate and found that assessing the appellant's performance based on a single month ignored the performance standard's requirement that performance be assessed based on the appellant's cumulative performance. This is consistent with the guidance in <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and relevant to this case. If the appellant demonstrated acceptable performance during her PIP but failed to sustain it thereafter, the appellant's overall performance during the year then must be evaluated under the annual standard. The Board held that the agency's action can be sustained only if the evidence shows her performance was unacceptable under the annual standard for this critical element. Here, the appellant's performance was measured monthly, but it was evaluated on an annual basis. Under <span class="Italic">Brown</span> and <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, the administrative judge properly found that the agency's action based on a single month measure of performance applied the annual performance standard in an unreasonably strict manner. The administrative judge properly determined, consistent with <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, that the agency's showing did not constitute substantial evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance in the context of the employee's annual performance plan. <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 656.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that this case is similar to <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Defense</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 123 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 117 Fed. Appx. 722 (Fed. Cir. 2004), and that the administrative judge erred in not finding that <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> controlled. Critical Element 4 (CE 4) of the performance standards for Thomas's position as a Sales Store Checker required that she ensure that the amount of money in her till at the end of the day was accurate. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 126. The agency placed Thomas on a PIP for unsuccessful performance in CE 4 and she successfully completed the PIP in August 2001. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 125. Two months later, in November 2001, she failed in the same critical element as had triggered the PIP by having more than 8 days when her till had variances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 126-27. The following month, December 2001, Thomas again failed in CE 4, this time by a variance which exceeded $50 in that month. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the agency warned Thomas after she completed the PIP in August 2001 that if her performance in CE 4 again fell below the acceptable level before August 2002, it could propose her removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted the evidence that Thomas's performance in CE 4 fell below an acceptable level only about 2 months after she completed the PIP and that she continued to fail in CE 4 for 2 months in a row. Additionally, the Board relied on testimonial evidence that checkers were not subjected to action for failing the standard in only 1 month. Under these circumstances, the Board found that the agency provided the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance before it removed her and that the agency proffered substantial evidence to show that this performance standard was not applied in an unreasonably strict manner. The Board found that this post-PIP evidence of failing to meet performance standards for 2 successive months shortly after successful completion of a PIP constituted substantial evidence that Thomas's performance within the year of her successful completion of the PIP fell short of her standard. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. at 130. The Board sustained the agency's removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>. In <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, the appellant performed unacceptably within just 2 months after she successfully completed the PIP and the agency did not propose Thomas's removal until she had performed unsuccessfully for 2 successive months after the PIP. Here, the appellant performed acceptably during the 4-month PIP and for 6 months thereafter. Further, the appellant's performance was unacceptable for only 1 month, May 2010, not 2 months in succession, and she consistently performed acceptably after May 2010. As the administrative judge noted, the appellant received an annual performance rating of Level 3, the fully successful level, for the appraisal year that included the PIP and May 2010, the month that the appellant's performance was measured as unacceptable. Further, she received a performance award for her performance that included the PIP and May 2010. As noted above, the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. at 656, that it necessarily will have to determine on a case-by-case basis whether an agency's evidence of post-successful PIP performance constitutes substantial evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Comparing the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> with those here, we find that <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> presents a different set of facts and that, while the agency's factual showing in <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> constituted substantial evidence of unacceptable performance under the particular facts of that case, the agency's factual showing in this case failed to show unacceptable performance by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Muff</span> may have examined post-PIP performance from the perspective of a slice of time sufficient to provide a representative sampling of the employee's performance, the Board sustained a removal for post-PIP performance in <span class="Italic">Thomas v. DOJ</span>, DA-0432-13-0109-I-1 (NP 12/10/2014), based on four work assignments issued on a single day and evaluated over a period of time<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas</span> noted of <span class="Italic">Muff</span>, at n.4:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, citing <span class="Italic">Muff v. Department of Commerce</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 291 (2012), the appellant seems to suggest that the agency was not permitted to rely solely on a 2-week period to justify his removal. We find this argument to be without merit because <span class="Italic">Muff</span> does not announce an absolute rule requiring an agency to rely on a minimum period of performance in order to remove an employee. To the contrary, as explained in <span class="Italic">Muff</span>, the Board determines what constitutes substantial evidence of genuinely unacceptable performance in the context of an employee's annual performance plan on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Muff</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 291, &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 1990, the Board endorsed discrete and final PIPs. <span class="Italic">Benton v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 25 MSPR 430, 435 n.4 (1984), determined that the agency was not required to begin an unacceptable performance case immediately after the performance improvement period. The agency could wait before taking action, even if the one-year limit barred consideration of some work performed during the performance improvement period, as long as the employee had an opportunity to improve. However, if the performance was evaluated and found satisfactory, only a new notice of deficiencies and PIP would support a performance action for subsequent poor performance. The agency could not be relieved of the obligation to provide notice and further opportunity for improvement by telling the employee that if his acceptable performance continued, it would merit a fully successful rating. <span class="Italic">Zoltowski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 26 MSPR 525, 528 (1985). So matters stood through <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 696 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Brown I</span>), and changed with <span class="Italic">Brown v. VA</span>, 44 MSPR 635, 640-41 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Brown II</span>), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
