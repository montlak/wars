<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-262"><span class="space">3.</span> Petty Theft</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The value of the stolen property is to be considered as to assessment of the penalty, not as to validity of the charge of theft. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Urogy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 53 MSPR 342, 346 (1992). Petty theft can support discharge. A position of fiscal trust can aggravate the offense. Although dismissal of a postmaster for misappropriation of $22 worth of property was harsh, it was not an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">Book v. USPS</span>, 675 F.2d 158 (8th Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">Anderson v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 442, 444-45 (1983) (supervisor of mails removed for unauthorized removal of mail); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Cooper v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 174, 180-81 (1989) (law enforcement officer was held to higher standard of conduct; a postal police officer was properly removed for the off-duty shoplifting of items of minor value). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 549, 552 (1987) (shoplifting offense involving about $17 did not warrant discharge of a postmaster with long service record, a history of recent depression shown to directly relate to the offense; a demotion was ordered to a nonsupervisory position).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of fairly close scrutiny of a petty theft case is <span class="Italic">Hunt v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 246, 248-49 (1985). The appellant, a rural carrier, was discharged for removing uncanceled postage stamps worth $5.86 from two packages placed in his possession for delivery. He had 28 years of service, 26 with the Postal Service. The Board affirmed removal, determining that it was a serious offense because it related directly to the duties of the appellant, contravened the Postal Service ethical code, and violated federal law 18 USC 1711--misappropriation of postal funds--although there were no criminal charges:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in the instant case discloses that although appellant has no history of disciplinary action and he has a reputation in the community of being an honest man, sufficient doubt existed concerning removal of uncancelled stamps from packages on appellant's route to warrant the agency's instituting an investigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant denied removing any stamps until he was confronted by the results of the inspector's investigation. Although the agency did not prove that he converted the missing stamps to his own use, the presiding official found that intent to misappropriate the stamps could be inferred from circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the various mitigative factors suggested by appellant, including a history of family problems. However, considering the various factors...we find that under the circumstances of this case, the penalty of removal, although severe, is within the bounds of reasonableness and was not an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hunt</span>, 29 MSPR at 248 n.1, summarized other decisions involving charges of petty theft or fraud:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (removal of cashier for theft of two bars of soap, valued at $2.10 from the commissary, was an abuse of discretion in light of the <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> nature of the objects taken, her twenty-four years of service with numerous commendations, and no prior disciplinary actions); <span class="Italic">DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (penalty of removal of store worker with thirteen years of service, for unauthorized possession of $14.00 worth of groceries, although severe, was not abuse of discretion because he occupied a position of control and custody over the items he took, agency guidelines authorized a penalty outside the general range depending on circumstances, and appellant was deceptive and gave false testimony at the hearing); <span class="Italic">Ceja v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 27 MSPR 531, 533 (1985) (although Property Disposal Specialist who removed empty gas cans from dumpster for his own use had both control and custody over the items in his possession, because of the <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> nature of the action, his many years of service, absence of a prior disciplinary record and no showing that it would affect his ability to perform his duties in a satisfactory manner, the Board determined that the removal penalty was excessive and reduced to a thirty-day suspension); and <span class="Italic">Oberman v. US Postal Service</span>, 11 MSPB 477, 13 MSPR 218 (1982) (employee who removed magazines from the dead letter office was held to a higher standard of conduct because of his position as a Security Police Officer; however, the Board mitigated his removal to a thirty-day suspension based on his many years of service, reputation for honesty, and <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> nature of the offense).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One case cited by the presiding official in affirming the penalty of removal, <span class="Italic">York v. US Postal Service</span>, 10 MSPB 218 (1982), has been reversed in an unpublished decision by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Nos. 84-848 and 84-849 (Fed. Cir. Sept. 21, 1984). The court, relying on <span class="Italic">Miguel</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, in which it stated that even in the face of direct evidence of theft, mitigation was appropriate, found that removal was not warranted in the case of a twenty-five year employee, with an otherwise exemplary work record, who failed to follow proper procedures in handling a blank money order. The court found that a thirty-day suspension was the maximum appropriate penalty under the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Newman v.

USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 10, 14 (1982) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension on a charge that a window clerk converted $86 to his own use; there was evidence of a disparate penalty between appellant and other employees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chin v. DOD</span>, 2022 MSPB 34, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-28, 30 (2022) (Member Limon dissenting), mitigated removal to a suspension of 90 days when the appellant removed a some food from an agency cafeteria without payment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our review of the record, including the deciding official's analysis of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors, we find that the deciding official failed to appropriately consider all of the relevant factors in determining the penalty. As the administrative judge noted, the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have found that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of a theft may be a significant mitigating factor when, as in this appeal, the appellant has a satisfactory work record and no prior discipline. ID at 36 (citing <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and <span class="Italic">Underwood v. Department of Defense</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 355, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 744 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table)). The deciding official's testimony shows that she did not treat the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft as a mitigating factor. For instance, she testified that she "dismissed" the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft in deciding what penalty to impose because "what matters is the action," i.e., the misconduct, which, in her view, demonstrated a "lack of character" and caused her not to trust the appellant. HT 1 at 328 (testimony of the deciding official). She further stated that someone who steals "has a character flaw" and "should not be working as a senior security professional...with a security clearance in the Department of Defense." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 374.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2790"></span>Additionally, the record shows that the deciding official failed to consider the appellant's lengthy service (30 years) and his satisfactory work record as mitigating factors. In her written <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis, the deciding official identified these factors as "NEUTRAL" and stated that she considered them "irrelevant <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> the offense." In her hearing testimony, the deciding official explained that she considered these factors irrelevant because stealing "shows a character flaw."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft, the appellant's 30 years of service, and his satisfactory work record are relevant mitigating factors in this case; however, the deciding official did not treat them as mitigating factors in determining the penalty. Instead, as discussed above, the deciding official deemed these factors "irrelevant." We therefore find that the deciding official's treatment of the mitigating factors was not sufficiently substantive, and we do not defer to her penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Stuhlmacher</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 272, &#x00B6; 24 (finding that it was appropriate not to defer to the deciding official's penalty determination because his treatment of the mitigating factors was not sufficiently substantive); <span class="Italic">Omites v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 223, &#x00B6; 11 (2000) (finding that the administrative judge correctly did not defer to the agency's penalty determination because the agency failed to seriously consider the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors). Accordingly, we will review the penalty imposed in light of the considerations articulated in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> to determine whether the penalty exceeds the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 60, &#x00B6; 17 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, although not addressed by the deciding official or the administrative judge, another mitigating factor in this case is that the appellant did not have custody or control over the stolen items as part of his official duties. Our reviewing court and the Board have treated this as a significant mitigating factor in cases involving <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft, including cases in which the appellant occupied a position of trust. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miguel</span>, 727 F.2d at 1082, 1084 (remanding for a determination of a lesser penalty after concluding that removal was too harsh for a commissary cashier who took two bars of soap valued at $2.10); <span class="Italic">Skates</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 368-69 (mitigating a removal to a 14-day suspension for the appellant's theft of left-over food of a <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> value from the dining room where he worked when there was no specific evidence that he was in control over the food that he took); <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 590, 592-93 &#x0026; n.1 (1995) (mitigating to a 30-day suspension the demotion of a shipfitter foreman for the unauthorized possession and attempted removal of scrap metal valued at $2.60 because, among other things, the appellant did not have custody and control over the property as part of his official duties); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 358, 359, 362-63 (1990) (mitigating to a 90-day suspension the removal of a claims representative who was convicted of off-duty shoplifting, finding that the items she took did not come into her possession as a result of her position). Conversely, the Board and our reviewing court have found that mitigating the agency's chosen penalty for <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> theft is inappropriate when the employee gained control over the stolen item as a direct result of his position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., DeWitt v. Department of the Navy</span>, 747 F.2d 1442, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (sustaining a commissary worker's removal for taking $14.00 worth of groceries because "[w]here the employee takes unauthorized personal possession of property entrusted to his care and responsibility, the breach of trust is difficult to repair"); <span class="Italic">Underwood</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. at 359 (sustaining a material worker's removal for the attempted theft of two jars of cinnamon that she was responsible for loading and, thus, came within her custody and control).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If everyone who walked off with a government pen or pad of paper were fired, government halls would be emptied. Theft of $4.50 worth of paint did not warrant removal because of the relatively <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> amount involved; the penalty was reduced to a 60-day suspension for an employee with five years of good service. <span class="Italic">Yuson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 611, 613 (1984) (still a steep price for a can or two of paint). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lovenduski v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 612, 616 (1994) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension for the personal use of government equipment worth about $53; the actual loss to the government was considerably less); <span class="Italic">Stancil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 93, 94 (1984) (attempted theft of a set of disposable salt and pepper shakers worth less than a dollar was reversed based upon the appellant's past record and lack of a penalty table in the record). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPR 528, 532 (1981) (sustaining removal of a mechanic's helper with five years of service for the theft of two cans of paint: "In performing his duties, appellant undoubtedly came into contact with various agency equipment temporarily entrusted to his care. Appellant has breached that trust by the commission of theft.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Theft of $2.10 of property by a store worker did not warrant removal; the appeal was remanded for reconsideration of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Dept. of Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 287, 290 (1993) (counsel fees were awarded when the agency should have known it could not sustain dismissal of a store worker for theft of a $.27 creme pie). Five gallons of gas cost one worker 30 days of pay, mitigated from removal. <span class="Italic">Major v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 283, 286 (1986). Removal was too harsh and was mitigated to 30 days off the clock for theft from a commissary of $4.74 worth of beef brisket and a box of garbage bags. <span class="Italic">Maston v. Dept. of Army</span>, 32 MSPR 168, 172 (1987). Removal by a custodian of a magazine of "minimal dollar value" warranted 60 days off rather than removal. <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 457, 463 (1988) (a custodian removed one magazine, of minimal value, found on the floor near a trash bin; the appellant was not entrusted with custody of or responsibility for mails; removal mitigated to suspension of 60 days). <span class="Italic">Miguel notwithstanding</span>, the Board does not look charitably upon petty theft. Discharge of a custodial worker was sustained for removal of four glass government ashtrays. The employee had 10 years of service and a prior disciplinary record. <span class="Italic">Sweeney v. GSA</span>, 23 MSPR 471, 474 (1984) (the table of penalties called for removal for a first offense of unauthorized possession of government property).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal of a warehouse worker was sustained for theft of $2.50 of food from the agency's cafeteria. The appellant had a prior disciplinary record that included a reprimand for taking a breakfast worth $1.60 from the canteen without paying for the meal, an admonishment for 15 minutes of AWOL, and a three-day suspension for 30 minutes of AWOL. An outstanding performance rating and over seven years of service did not mitigate the offense. <span class="Italic">Howlett v. VA</span>, 53 MSPR 604, 606-07 (1992). Theft of a government pager, apparently taken during the course of an MSPB hearing, warranted, along with another charge, removal. <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 32, 40 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was mitigated to a 60-day suspension for a GS-7 Purchasing Agent who appropriated to her own use a Federal Express envelope, using the agency's account number, involving charges of about $13.00, <span class="Italic">Mann v. DHHS</span>, 78 MSPR 1, 13-15 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are, however, significant mitigating factors in this appeal. The appellant's offense was not repeated, but appears to have been an isolated incident. The appellant has nineteen years of prior Federal service, five of which she has served with the agency. In addition, the amount of money involved in the incident ($13.00) was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. The Board and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have held that the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of a theft may be a significant mitigating factor where, as in this appeal, the appellant has a satisfactory work and disciplinary record. <span class="Italic">Banez v. Department of Defense,</span> 69 MSPR 642, 650 (1996); <span class="Italic">Miguel v. Department of the Army</span>, 727 F.2d 1081, 1083 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The appellant testified without contradiction that the agency had no problems with her work, and that her performance evaluations were highly successful until the fall of 1995, when she received a fully successful rating. The appellant has no record of discipline at the agency. The appellant submitted letters of recommendation from co-workers regarding her honest and trustworthy character, as well as her good work performance at the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that, although the agency claims that it lost trust in the appellant's ability to accomplish her duties, it allowed the appellant to continue to perform the normal duties of her position for several months after it became aware of the offense. <span class="Italic">See</span> (April 16, 1996 letter placing the appellant on administrative leave); (testimony of the appellant's supervisor that he was not sure what duties the appellant was performing after the agency became aware of the offense, and that she was "moved" out of her position between February and April 1996), (testimony of the appellant that she performed the same duties, and had the privilege of sending Federal Express packages, until April 1996); <span class="Italic">Goode v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 31 MSPR 446, 450 (1986) (the agency's decision to allow the appellant to continue in his position for five months after learning of the offense was a mitigating factor where the agency claimed that it lost trust in him).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency and the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Sears v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 7 MSPB 290, 7 MSPR 417 (1981), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 680 F.2d 863 (1st Cir. 1982), in support of the penalty of removal, <span class="Italic">Sears</span> is distinguishable from this appeal. In <span class="Italic">Sears,</span> the Board upheld the removal of a purchasing agent with twenty-five years of experience based on a sustained charge of unauthorized removal of government property valued at less than $100.00. This was the only charge brought by the agency in <span class="Italic">Sears.</span> In a case where all of the charges are sustained, the Board limits its review of the penalty selection, and will correct the agency's penalty only to the extent necessary to bring it to the maximum penalty or the outermost boundary of the range of reasonable penalties. <span class="Italic">White</span>, 71 MSPR at 525. In this appeal, by contrast, two of the agency's four charges have not been sustained, and deferring to the agency's penalty determination on the basis of charges that were not sustained would involve indulging in a legal fiction, because when not all of the charges are sustained, the penalty determination made by the agency no longer stands and there is no penalty selection to review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 526. In such a case, as here, the Board will independently and responsibly balance the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors to determine a reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 527. Moreover, the Board did not find in <span class="Italic">Sears</span> that the value of the property removed was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> as we have here. Further, the Board found in <span class="Italic">Sears</span> that the agency was justified on the facts of that case in concluding that it could not trust the appellant and that his conduct would severely impair his usefulness in any position with the agency. By contrast, the agency in this appeal allowed the appellant to perform the normal duties of her position for several months before either removing some of those duties or placing her on administrative leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency's deciding official testified that, if only reason <span id="Page_2791"></span>(1) were sustained, he would still have removed the appellant because that charge dealt with the heart of the matter, namely, the appellant's dishonesty. In determining a reasonable penalty in cases where not all of the charges are sustained the Board will consider statements by deciding officials concerning what penalties they would have imposed for the sustained charges<span class="Italic">. White</span>, 71 MSPR at 527-28. Such statements may be relevant in those cases where, for example, the statements are supported by a table of penalties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 528. While such statements should not be given absolute deference, they should be carefully weighed where the AJ finds the testimony of the deciding officials credible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have carefully considered the deciding official's statement, we find that it does not require a different result in this appeal. The agency has not submitted a table of penalties that supports the deciding official's testimony that he would have imposed the penalty of removal for a first offense of dishonest conduct. Moreover, the factors set forth above warrant mitigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the reasonable penalty in this appeal is a sixty-day suspension. <span class="Italic">Cf. Goode,</span> 31 MSPR at 450-51 (affirming the AJ's mitigation of the appellant's removal for embezzlement in violation of 18 USC &#x00A7; 641 to a 90-day suspension where, among other things, the appellant had eleven years of satisfactory service with no prior disciplinary record, and the agency allowed the appellant to continue in his position for five months after learning of the offenses he committed); <span class="Italic">Stead v. Department of the Army,</span> 27 MSPR 630, 632-35 (1985) (sustaining the AJ's mitigation of the appellant's removal for theft of government property to a 90-day suspension, upon finding that the agency's action of continuing the appellant in his position with unlimited access to the installation demonstrated its continuing trust in him); <span class="Italic">Banez</span>, 69 MSPR at 650-51 (mitigating a removal for misappropriation of government property valued at $13.99 to a sixty-day suspension, based on the <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> nature of the theft, the fact that it was the appellant's first offense in twenty-six years of military and civilian service, the appellant's satisfactory performance, and his lack of custody and control over the item).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Supervisory status of the appellant may militate against mitigation of a demotion for unauthorized possession and attempted removal of government property of relatively small value. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 59 MSPR 675, 681 (1993) (scrap steel plate was cut by the appellant to fit the bed of his pickup truck--the value set by agency was $250), <span class="Italic">rev'd in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563 (Fed. Cir. 1994), <span class="Italic">following remand from court</span>, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 590, 593 (1995) (reducing penalty from demotion to 30-day suspension in part because the actual value of the metal was about $3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One of the smaller thefts to reach the Board involved a commissary store worker fired for eating and pocketing four ounces of yogurt-covered walnuts worth 54 cents. The <span class="Italic">de</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> value of the property was not given proper consideration; prior disciplinary infractions occurring a few months before removal were preceded by almost eight years of good service with the agency; the recent disciplinary record involved charges unrelated to the theft charge and resulted in only a reprimand and a three-day suspension. The employee was learning disabled and had difficulty understanding the nature and implications of the agency rule prohibiting unauthorized use or possession of commissary merchandise. The removal was reduced to a 30-day suspension. <span class="Italic">McGowan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 28 MSPR 314, 318 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 287, 290 (1993) (counsel fees were awarded when the agency should have known it could not sustain the dismissal of a store worker for theft of $.27 creme pie); <span class="Italic">Stancil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 93, 94 (1984) (reversing removal for attempted theft of disposable salt and pepper shakers worth, as in <span class="Italic">McGowan</span>, 54 cents).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The notion of what constitutes "petty theft" is debatable. <span class="Italic">Harper v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 446, 449 (1994), distinguished cases involving theft of materials worth but a few dollars from a theft of property valued at less than $100. Of the theft the Board said: "Here, although the value of the property was not great, neither was it <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>."
