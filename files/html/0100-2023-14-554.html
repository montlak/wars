<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-555"><span class="space">6.</span> Facilities, Assistance for Disabled, Stressed Employees</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA approved the negotiability of a proposal that a means be provided for disabled persons to enter the office. That the proposal might assist nonunit employees or members of the public did not remove it from the ambit of conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 644 and Dept. of Labor, MSHA</span>, 27 FLRA 375, 381 (1987) (Proposal 6). Approved as negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 and Dept. of Army, Army Publications Distrib. Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 47 FLRA 931, 932 (1993), was Proposal 2, that management make electric scooters available to disabled employees who distributed agency publications within an enclosed building. Although FLRA did not decide a negotiability dispute in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1808 and Dept. of Army, Sierra Army Depot</span>, 30 FLRA 1236, 1242 (1988), it referred to statutory and regulatory requirements concerning on-the-job assistance to disabled employees. Nothing precluded the negotiation of a proposal defining when employees are considered participants in employee assistance programs. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 405 and Army Aviation Sys. Command</span>, 33 FLRA 604, 616 (1988) (Provision 5). Proposal 32 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1521 (1992), sought agreement that reasonable accommodations be considered exceptions to agency general fiscal restrictions. The proposal was negotiable. No violation of management's right to establish its budget was established; the agency neither provided FLRA with cost figures nor demonstrated whether those costs would be offset by compensating benefits.</p>
<p class="noindent">Proposals were unacceptable that both required interpreters or readers for disabled employees and required the agency to maintain recorded editions of the collective bargaining agreement and regulations or other documents needed by blind employees. The proposals were an infringement of the right of the agency to hire and assign employees and, to the extent they required acquisition of equipment, concerned the technology, methods, and means of performing work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1858 and Dept. of Army, Army Missile Command, Redstone Arsenal</span>, 10 FLRA 440, 443-44 (1982) (Proposal 3). As to manpower assistance for disabled employees, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, HCFA, Baltimore</span>, 44 FLRA 1405, 1430, 1531-35 (1992), considered negotiable as an appropriate arrangement Proposal 34, seeking assistance in the nature of modification of training and reference materials (e.g., Braille texts), provision of interpreters for deaf trainees, and use of mentors for individualized training:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that Proposal 34 does not involve the Agency's right to determine the methods and means of performing work. We also conclude that the proposal directly interferes with management's right to hire and assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. However, we further find that Proposal 34 is an appropriate arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 34 requires the Agency to make reasonable accommodations for the training of qualified employees with handicapping conditions.&#x2003;Under the proposal, reasonable accommodations for training shall include such things as:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;modifying training and reference materials;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;providing deaf trainees with qualified interpreters; and</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;using mentors to provide individualized training.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal interferes with management's right to determine the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, the Authority uses a two-part test. Under this test, an agency must first demonstrate a direct relationship between the particular method or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission. Secondly, an agency must also demonstrate that the proposal would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted.... The term "method" refers to the way in which an agency performs its work.... The term "means" refers to any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan or policy used to further the accomplishment of the agency's work. Under this test, the method or means adopted does not need to be indispensable to the accomplishment of an agency's mission. The term "performing work" is used to include those matters directly and integrally related to the agency's operations as a whole....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not demonstrate that there is any connection between Proposal 34 and the accomplishment of its mission.&#x2003;The Agency's mission is to administer the Medicare and Medicaid Programs and to oversee related Federal medical care quality control staffs. The proposed accommodations for employees with handicapping conditions and the policy concerning reasonable accommodations for these employees are not: (1) related to the performance of the Agency's work; or (2) directly and integrally related to the Agency's operations. The mission of the Agency does not involve the establishment of a policy concerning employees with handicapping conditions or the accommodations that will or will not be made in certain instances. Moreover, even if the proposal did concern the establishment of such a policy, the proposal, by its terms, would still concern the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Even assuming that a proposal establishing certain accommodations that an agency must make for employees with handicapping conditions is a method or a means under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute, such a proposal, in accordance with the test for determining whether a proposal concerns the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1), would be negotiable unless the agency demonstrated a direct and integral relationship to the operation of the agency as a whole.... Because the Agency has not established a direct connection between the proposed accommodations for employees with handicapping conditions and the performance of the Agency's work, we find,...that the proposal does not concern the methods and means of performing work within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsection (a) requires the Agency, as a reasonable accommodation for employees with handicapping conditions, to modify the training and reference materials used to train those employees. The Agency has not demonstrated that the requirements of the proposal have any connection to its decision to hire or to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Specifically, we note that the proposal does not require management to hire or assign any specific individual to accomplish the required modifications. Moreover, the fact that management may need to assign an employee to implement the requirement of the proposal that training and reference materials be modified does not mean that the proposal interferes with management's right to assign employees. We conclude, therefore, that subsection (a) does not directly interfere with management's right to hire or assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals that require an agency to provide employees with handicapping conditions with qualified interpreters directly interfere with management's rights, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, to hire and to assign employees. Such proposals prevent the agency from determining that it will not hire or assign a qualified interpreter.... Because Proposal 34 requires the Agency to provide trainees with handicapping conditions with qualified interpreters and <span id="page_1031"></span>mentors to provide individualized training, the proposal prevents the Agency from determining that it will not hire or assign such personnel. Accordingly,...we find that Proposal 34 directly interferes with management's rights, under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, to hire personnel and to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. Applying the test set forth in <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, we conclude that Proposal 34 is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B). When training is assigned to an employee with a handicapping condition, the Agency makes such an assignment with prior knowledge that the handicapping condition exists and that certain accommodations will be required in order to conduct the training of such employees. If the measures prescribed by the proposal to facilitate the assigned training are not provided, an assignment of training to employees with the specific handicapping conditions covered by the proposal would operate to disadvantage those employees in competing for promotion. We find, therefore, that the proposal is an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to whether Proposal 34 is an appropriate arrangement, we note that the proposal would preclude the Agency from assigning other duties to the interpreters and mentors during the period that they are assisting employees with handicapping conditions. Moreover, if the Agency does not have employees qualified to perform the tasks required by the proposal, the Agency would be required to hire such employees. By requiring management to provide mentors and interpreters to assist employees with handicapping conditions, the proposal necessitates a reallocation of the Agency's resources. Namely, the Agency would be required to assign employees to function as mentors and interpreters, thereby foregoing the right to assign other work to those employees during that period of time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, employees with handicapping conditions receive benefits from the operation of Proposal 34 that would ensure their participation in, and completion of, the training for which they were selected. If an employee with a disability that requires the use of an interpreter or a mentor is denied access to those resources, the ability of that employee to effectively participate in and/or complete the assigned training would be severely restricted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question presented, therefore, is whether the Agency's need to allocate personnel to perform the tasks of interpreters and mentors and to forego the assignment of other work to those employees is outweighed by the benefit to employees with handicapping conditions of effective participation in the assigned training and the increased potential for job advancement. We note that the personnel resources provided by the Agency to assist employees with handicapping conditions to effectively participate in training enhance the Agency's workforce by aiding employees with handicapping conditions to become more skilled and productive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.704(a) provides that, unless an agency can establish that a reasonable accommodation for an employee with a handicapping condition would impose an undue burden on its program operation, such an accommodation shall be made by that agency. The Agency does not establish, and the record does not indicate, that making reasonable accommodations for employees with handicapping conditions would place an undue burden on the Agency's operations. On balance, we find that the burden on management's right to assign work to employees who will function as mentors and interpreters is outweighed by the benefit to employees with handicapping conditions of ensuring: (1) effective participation in the training program; and (2) increased potential for job advancement. Accordingly, we find that Proposal 34 constitutes an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">PASS Dist. 6 and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps Air Station, Cherry Point</span>, 54 FLRA 1130, 1136-39 (1998), was Proposal 2, requesting the agency to provide professional counseling for employees determined to be "under duress." The provision was barred by a statute defining the scope of agency health service programs:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By its terms, Proposal 2 would require the Agency to provide professional counseling, at Government expense and on official time, to employees who are determined by a qualified professional to be under duress. The acceptance of such counseling is voluntary on the part of the employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Furnishing of Counseling at Government Expense Is Contrary to Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901, which is set forth below in pertinent part, authorizes Federal agencies to provide health service programs for their employees. It also identifies the type of services that may be provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7; 7901. <span class="Italic">Health Service Programs</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(a)&#x2003;The head of each agency of the Government of the United States may establish,...a health service program to promote and maintain the physical and mental fitness of employees under his jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(c)&#x2003;A health service program is limited to--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;treatment of on-the-job illness and dental conditions requiring emergency attention;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;preemployment and other examinations;</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(3)&#x2003;referral of employees to private physicians and dentists; and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(4)&#x2003;preventive programs relating to health.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously addressed the application of this section.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Defense Mapping Agency</span>, 26 FLRA 785, the Authority found that a proposal, which required the employer to provide eye examinations for all unit employees or reimburse employees for the expenses of private ophthalmologists, was inconsistent with section 7901. The Authority determined that "[a]gency-provided treatment for medical conditions beyond those of an emergency or on the job nature and reimbursement for private physicians for routine employee medical care exceeds the statutory authorization of medical services under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 790. <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 49 FLRA 973 (1994) (portion of proposal requiring agency to reimburse employee for cost of eye examination held contrary to &#x00A7; 7901). <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-109 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut</span>, 47 FLRA 651 (1993) (where a union proposed that employees not incur any costs for medical or dental services already rendered by an agency, there was no violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901 because the proposal did not obligate the agency to provide any health services).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Agency has the discretion to pay for counseling because it is the Agency that determines that an employee is under duress.&#x2003;Even assuming the Agency retains the right to identify the employees for whom counseling would be made available, the Union points to no authority that would allow the Agency to pay for counseling expenses. Furthermore, the Union has not explained how "duress" equates to, or results from, an on-the-job illness, which is a prerequisite for payment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that an employee under duress may display work-related problems, for example, diminished performance, or that duress may have work-related ramifications, such as the need to reassign an employee. However, these possible consequences do not signify that the duress necessarily concerns an on-the-job illness, which is one of the requirements that must be satisfied in order for payment to be authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration and National Air Traffic Controllers Association</span>, 52 FLRA 46, 50 n.6 (1996) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7901 does not authorize payment of medical expenses incurred by employee attending in-patient alcohol counseling program).</p>
