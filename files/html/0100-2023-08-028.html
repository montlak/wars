<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-29"><span class="space">E.</span> MSPB RECORDS</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Case files at the regional and field offices are maintained by a legal technician who lists all pending cases and the name of the AJ to whom each case is assigned. The legal technician coordinates transfers of files among regional or field offices and the Board's central office. When petitions for review are filed, or initial decisions are reopened, the case file is sent to the Board's central office in Washington, D.C. Closed case files are stored at a GSA records retention center. They are eventually destroyed in accordance with government records retention schedules. Times were that Board records were paper--lots of paper. Now lots of Board appeals are handled through electronic filings. Electronic files may last forever, and the retention policy on those files is unknown. For assistance in locating Board appeals records, contact the Board office where the case was docketed or contact the Board Clerk at its Washington, D.C., office. As of May 1993, the GSA retention schedules called for destruction of "nonprecedential cases" after seven years. The increasing reliance by the Board on its electronic filing system will, over time, reduce its dependence on paper files and permit indefinite electronic storage of case records--assuming the Board's servers are properly backed up and their files archived.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to organization of and access to an appeals file, the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> states at Chapter 3:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_24"></span>10.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ORGANIZATION OF THE APPEAL FILE</span>. Instructions for the proper organization of initial appeal case files are found in chapter 4 of the Board's <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span>. As noted earlier, the <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span> is undergoing revision and all references to it therefore are subject to change.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board's <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span> is being revised and has not been reissued, in general it is required that all case-related documents, including the hearing record whether stored on tapes, as a paper transcript, or as ESI (electronically stored information), if any, be included in the case file. Documents to be excluded from the case file are Congressional, FOIA, and Privacy Act correspondence. The file documents are kept in chronological order with the most recent document on top. The documents are tabbed, and there is an index clearly describing each document in the file. If a paper file exceeds approximately 2 inches in thickness, a new volume should be created and copies of the index included in each file volume. If a submission is too large to fit within the volume where it would normally be placed, it may be kept separately, marked with the tab number it would have had if it had been placed in the chronological volume. When this is done, the submission should be given a separate volume number(s) and a tab should be placed in the chronological volume indicating its location. If because of changes in Board procedures initiated since the <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span> was last updated (such as e-Appeal, e-filing, recordation of hearings on DVD or electronically, etc.) or other reasons, the <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span> does not cover the specific situation presented, it should be adapted as appropriate to the facts with which the office is dealing. Seeking the advice of the records specialist in OCB is often appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Note that although the Board now directs the parties to number the pages within all tabs of each submission, the RO or FO should not undertake to do so for them if they fail to comply, since documents in the record should remain as they were when the parties submitted them. Any statement to the contrary in the <span class="Italic">Records Manual</span> should not be applied to the original submission, but may of course be followed when marking up a copy of it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Opinions and orders in Board cases are generally subject to disclosure (and publication) under the Freedom of Information Act, requiring public availability of Board orders (or records) other than those specifically exempted under the Privacy Act. 5 USC 552a(b)(2). <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 25 MSPR 126, 128 (1984) (concerning the propriety of an MSPB news release); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 26 MSPR 415, 419-20 (1985) (MSPB news release and an accompanying order in a Special Counsel stay proceeding were not subject to the Privacy Act; the order was not a "record" contained within the Privacy Act "system of records"; the opinion and order were not retrievable by the name of the individual protesting publication; Board orders, even though interim in nature, are routinely published by the Board). Other Board records may be said to be generally subject to disclosure under FOIA, but records of an intimate, personal nature can be protected from disclosure under exemption (b)(6) of the Act [5 USC 552], prohibiting clearly unwarranted invasions of personal privacy. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cleary v.

<p class="Body-Text">77 Fed. Reg. 65206 (Oct. 25, 2012), sets out the current proposed Privacy Act system notice for the Board, MSPB/GOVT-1, "Appeals and Case Records":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MSPB/GOVT-1</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SYSTEM NAME:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appeals and Case Records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SYSTEM LOCATION:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Office of the Clerk of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), Suite 500, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419, and MSPB regional and field offices (see list of office addresses in the Appendix).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS COVERED BY THE SYSTEM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Current and former Federal employees, applicants for employment, annuitants, and other individuals who have filed appeals with MSPB or its predecessor agency, or with respect to whom the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) or another Federal agency has petitioned MSPB concerning any matter over which MSPB has jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Current and former employees of State and local governments who have been investigated by OSC and have had an appeal before MSPB concerning possible violation of the Hatch Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CATEGORIES OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;These records contain information or documents such as briefs, pleadings, motions, exhibits, hearing transcripts, and MSPB decisions, which comprise the administrative records of appeals and other matters arising under the adjudicatory authority of the Board. These records may also contain individual appellants' names, social security numbers, home addresses, veterans' status, race, sex, national origin, and disability status data.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;This system also includes the Board's case processing system (CPS). The CPS was designed to manage all documents created by the Board during the processing of a case, as well as documents that are received electronically from the parties. At the present time, the CPS includes: a document assembly system to create documents; a document management system to manage and store documents; a case management system to record activities in cases, track the location of case files, and produce statistical reports on cases; and an electronic filing and electronic publishing system to allow the parties to send and receive case documents electronically.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Note: This system includes records and documents compiled by Federal agencies in processing adverse actions and actions based on unacceptable performance, covered by OPM/GOVT-3, when such actions are appealed to MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AUTHORITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF THE SYSTEM:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">POLICIES AND PRACTICES FOR STORING, RETRIEVING, ACCESSING, RETAINING AND DISPOSING OF RECORDS IN THE SYSTEM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">STORAGE:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These records are maintained in file folders and binders and in computer storage media.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">RETRIEVABILITY:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These records are retrieved by the names of the individuals on whom they are maintained and by MSPB docket numbers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SAFEGUARDS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Access to these records is limited to persons whose official duties require such access. Personal screening is employed to prevent unauthorized disclosure. Automated records in this system are maintained in a secure computer room in a building with restricted access. Automated records are protected from unauthorized access through password identification procedures and other system-based protection methods.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">RETENTION AND DISPOSAL:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Paper records are maintained for up to one year after a final determination by MSPB or, in some instances, other administrative authorities or the courts. Thereafter, they are transferred to Regional Federal Records Centers or other appropriate facilities. Paper records are destroyed by the Federal Records Centers when the records are seven years old. Electronic records of the case management system may be maintained indefinitely, or until the Board no longer needs them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">SYSTEM MANAGER(S) AND ADDRESS:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Clerk of the Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Suite 500, 1615 M Street NW., Washington, DC 20419, and MSPB regional and field offices (see list of office addresses in the Appendix).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">NOTIFICATION PROCEDURES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Individuals wishing to inquire whether this system of records contains information about them should contact the Clerk of the Board and must follow the MSPB Privacy Act regulations at 5 CFR part 1205 regarding such inquiries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">RECORD ACCESS PROCEDURES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Individuals requesting access to their records should contact the Clerk of the Board. If the requester has reason to believe the records in question are located in a regional or field office, it is appropriate to submit the request to that office. Such requests should be addressed to the regional director or chief administrative judge (see list of office addresses in the Appendix). Requests for access to records must follow the MSPB Privacy Act regulations at 5 CFR part 1205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONTESTING RECORD PROCEDURES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Individuals requesting amendment should write to the Clerk of the Board. If the requester has reason to believe the records in question are located in a regional or field office, it is appropriate to submit the request to that office. Such requests should be addressed to the regional director or chief administrative judge (see list of office addresses in the Appendix).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Requests for amendment of records must follow the MSPB Privacy Act regulations at 5 CFR part 1205.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">These provisions for amendment of the record are not intended to permit the alteration of evidence presented in the course of adjudication before MSPB either before or after MSPB has rendered a decision on the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">RECORD SOURCE CATEGORIES:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The sources of these records are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;The individual to whom the record pertains;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;The agency employing the above individual;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;The MSPB, OPM, EEOC, OSC; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;Other individuals or organizations from whom MSPB has received testimony, affidavits or other documents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additional guidance was provided in Board Notice 85-52 of June 13, 1985, concerning public access to appeal files:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">All MSPB appeal files are covered by the Privacy Act. 5 USC 552a. These files are part of a system of records entitled "Appeal and Case Records" announced by the Board in 47 Fed. Reg. 57792, December 28, 1982, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An MSPB appeal file does not constitute a "public record" because of its coverage under the Privacy Act. Only MSPB initial decisions and final decisions can be regarded as presumptively public records. Accordingly, access to appeal files must be carefully controlled to protect the privacy interests of the parties and to maintain the integrity of the files.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Internal guidance concerning access to Board records at Chapter 13 of the Board's Records Manual:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;WHAT AGENCY INFORMATION CAN BE OBTAINED BY A FOIA REQUEST?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;The FOIA is intended to provide access to "agency records." The FOIA does not define this term but the courts have generally interpreted "agency records" to mean documents or other information-bearing materials (e.g., photographs or computer tapes) which were:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Created or obtained by a Federal agency; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;At the time of the request, within the possession and control of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;The FOIA does not require an agency to "create" a record if the record does not exist at the time of the request. The FOIA does not require an agency to conduct research for a requester. The requester must know what he or she wants and must be able to provide a description. Nevertheless, agencies should be as helpful as possible when requesters provide poor descriptions of the records they are seeking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;MSPB appeal case records are covered by the Privacy Act, 5 USC 552a. They comprise the Government-wide system of records entitled MSPB GOVT-1, Appeal and Case Records.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Unlike a court record, an MSPB case record, because of its coverage under the Privacy Act, does not constitute a "public record." Only MSPB initial and final decisions should be regarded as presumptively "public." A case record generally should not be disclosed to another Federal agency at its request unless a routine use that authorizes such disclosure exists (a list of routine uses published by the Board appears at Figure 13-2 of this chapter). Agency requests for access to case records should be in writing and state the reasons for seeking access (this does not apply to agency-parties in cases pending before the Board, but does apply to agency-parties in closed cases). This practice also applies to requests for access to MSPB case files from the Office of the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Third parties requesting to look at or copy case records in whole or in part should be informed that access is restricted to protect the privacy interests of the parties and the integrity of the files. Access may only be granted to third parties if they have the written consent of the appellant or if release is required under the FOIA. Prior to release of a case record pursuant to a FOIA request, the file must be examined to determine if any material should be withheld under any of the FOIA exemptions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Except for disclosure of case records made under the FOIA, the Privacy Act requires that the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made as well as the date, nature, and purpose of the disclosure be attached to the case record. The "Request For Access To Appeal File" form...has been developed for this purpose and is placed in the case record. The correspondence requesting access and the Board response also may be placed in <span id="Page_26"></span>the case record, or may be kept in office administrative files. These records must be maintained for 5 years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;ON WHAT GROUNDS CAN A REQUEST FOR AGENCY RECORDS BE DENIED?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">a.&#x2003;A negative response to a request for agency records is not a denial of access. If a good faith search has been made and no records are found, the requester can simply be informed that the Board, after conducting a search based on the description provided, found no records responsive to the request. The Board is required to provide administrative appeal rights when, after an exhaustive search, it determines that no records responsive to the inquiry exist. Such a "no record" response has been found to be an "adverse determination." <span class="Italic">Oglesby v. Dept. of Army</span>, 920 F.2d 57 (D.C. Cir. 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">b.&#x2003;An agency cannot refuse to provide records to a requester because of his or her identity or the requester's purpose in seeking the records; it can refuse to make requested records available only when the records fall within at least one of the nine statutory exemptions from the FOIA's disclosure provisions. A brief description of each exemption follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(<span class="Italic">Note: Do not rely solely on these descriptions to deny access to Board records. The Office of General Counsel must concur in any denial of access to records under the FOIA and is available for consultation in this regard. Regional offices may obtain OGC concurrence via telephone</span>.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 1--Applies to matters that are specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in the interest of national security or foreign policy and are in fact properly classified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(<span class="Italic">Note: If classified material is entered into a Board record, since the Board is not an agency authorized to classify records, any request for those records will be referred to the originating agency for response</span>.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 2--Applies to matters that are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency. This has generally been interpreted to exempt from disclosure only those minor and routine matters in which the public could not reasonably be expected to have an interest. It has also been interpreted to exempt law enforcement manuals from disclosure where such manuals are predominately of internal interest to agency personnel and their disclosure significantly risks circumvention of agency regulations or statutes. This exemption does not apply to government agency manuals which indicate how the agency understands or interprets the laws it administers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(<span class="Italic">Note: The Judges' Handbook (formerly the Appeals Procedure Manual) has, over the years, been routinely released to the public upon request</span>.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 3--Applies to matters that are specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than the Privacy Act) provided that such statute (a) requires that the matters to be withheld from the public are not left to the discretion of the agency, or (b) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular matters to be withheld.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: Generally speaking, if such a statute affects information contained in a Board record the agency submitting the information will inform the Board of the restriction on release.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 4--Applies to matters that are trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and which are privileged or confidential. Confidential business information includes such things as lists of customers, costs of production, business plans and other "tricks of the trade," not generally known to competitors. The nature of the information and the degree of possible harm to the business firm if it is released are the major elements in determining whether exemption 4 applies, but consideration may also be given to the future availability to the agency of needed information which can only be obtained voluntarily and to any express promises of confidentiality that may have been given.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: An agency is not compelled to release all portions of an awarded contract. Although general policy considerations favor disclosure to permit the public to evaluate the wisdom and efficiency of Federal programs and expenditures, an agency may withhold portions of an awarded contract if disclosure would cause one of the harms mentioned above.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note also that Executive Order No. 12,600, issued June 23, 1987, establishes procedures for processing requests for confidential commercial information. See Figure 13-3 and the Board(s rules at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1204.14.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 5--Applies to inter-agency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency. This exemption is designed to protect the advisory or deliberative process of agencies. The exemption usually protects opinions, recommendations and advice, and not factual matters. The reasoning behind this exemption is that release of these records would inhibit full and frank discussion. Although a document may be withholdable under this exemption, it might lose its coverage when it is expressly referred to or "adopted" by the agency as a statement of policy or when it is issued as an explanation of an agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: Memoranda prepared by the Office of Appeals Counsel on petitions for review are subject to FOIA requests. These memoranda are written to assist Board Members and their assistants in consideration of PFRs, however, the factual portions may be released upon receipt of a FOIA request. It has generally been the policy of the Board to destroy these memoranda once a final opinion and order has been issued. Regional offices should not keep permanent files of these documents. Such memoranda should be destroyed after their purposes have been served.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 6--Applies to personnel, medical, and similar records, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. If the invasion of privacy is considered to be minor and there is a public interest justification for it, it may not be unwarranted. Application of the exemption sometimes requires a balancing of the public interest served and the privacy interest being protected. Thus, it may be necessary to ask the requester why he or she wants the records. The exemption should not be used to deny a requester his or her own file, although special procedures for the release of medical or psychological records may be followed under the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: OPM regulations provide that certain basic information on most Federal employees be made available to the Public: name; present and past position titles; present and past grades; present and past salaries; and present and past duty stations. Further, it is the policy of the Department of Justice, in light of prevailing case law, to release additional items of information pertaining to the professional qualifications of Federal employees such as: post graduate or technical education; all prior employment in state or Federal government positions; prior employment in the private sector related to an employee's duties; awards and honors received; and membership in professional groups. Privacy sensitive information which should be withheld generally pertains to personal or family matters and matters capable of causing embarrassment and/or harassment and which are not related to the employee's duties. Such privacy interests specifically include, but are not limited to: place and date of birth; age; marital status; home address and telephone number; medical records; details of health and insurance benefits; the substance of promotion recommendations; supervisory assessments of professional conduct and ability; information concerning or provided by relatives and references; prior employment history not related to the employee's occupation; primary, secondary and collegiate education; allegations of misconduct or arrests; and military service number and social security number.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Traditionally, third-party requests for access to home addresses have been denied on the basis of Exemption 6. Board policy is to protect the home addresses of appellants from disclosure to third parties unless there is an overriding public interest. The U.S. Supreme Court limited the scope of the "public interest" to be considered under the FOIA privacy exemption in Department of Justice v. Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press, 109 S. Ct. 1468 (1989). The Court said that information that does not directly reveal government operations or activities falls outside the orbit of the public interest that the FOIA was enacted to serve.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 7--Applies to investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes but only to the extent that harmful consequences, as described in paragraphs (A) through (F) of the exemption, would result from the release. This exemption is designed to preserve the law enforcement capability of the various government agencies charged with enforcement of law, whether the law is criminal, as in the case of the FBI, or regulatory, as in the case of HEW, FCC or EPA, and many other agencies responsible for the implementation of regulatory programs. The record or file must have been made or compiled for law enforcement purposes, that is, for the purpose of detecting, punishing, preventing or otherwise opposing some violation of law. Release of the information must meet one of the conditions of paragraphs (A) through (F).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: Personnel security background investigations and EEOC investigations qualify as investigative records under this exemption.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 8--Applies to matters contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions. This is a very specific exemption to cover the specified information or data, not a general protection for all records on financial institutions. It is designed to insure the security and integrity of financial institutions from the potential harm from indiscriminate disclosure of sensitive details collected by government agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: If this type of information should find its way into a Board record, contact the originating agency before releasing.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Exemption 9--Applies to geological and geophysical information and data, including maps concerning wells. This exemption is also very specific and is designed to protect detailed information which oil and gas companies must file with the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(Note: If this type of information should find its way into a Board record, contact the originating agency before releasing.)</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">c.&#x2003;A requester must be informed in writing of a denial of access to records and must be given appeal rights. The denial letter must inform <span id="Page_27"></span>the requester exactly what is being denied, and what FOIA exemption is being relied upon, and why.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">d.&#x2003;A specific request for a waiver of fees under the FOIA must be responded to in writing and if denied, the requester must be informed of the reason and of his or her appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The factors considered in FOIA access to MSPB records are touched on in Chapter 17, section 4, of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">THIRD-PARTY REQUESTS UNDER FOIA; APPELLANT REQUESTS; PRIVACY ACT</span>. The Board's procedures for handling FOIA requests, the nature of the information that can be released, and fee assessments are found in 5 C.F.R. part 1204, Availability of Official Information. Beginning December 2016, responsibility for FOIA responses was centralized in OCB, although the regions retain responsibility for providing documents requested by OCB that will allow it to respond. As to FOIA requests from appellants, <span class="Italic">see Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589, 596 n.1 (2001). There, the appellant requested that the Board issue its Opinion and Order as an unpublished decision, withhold it from electronic dissemination, restrict access to all appeal-related documents in its control, and restrict from distribution and publication all such documents in the control of both the agency and the RO or FO. The Board found that the FOIA circumscribes its consideration of the appellant's requests, that she failed to show that those records are exempt from mandatory disclosure under the law, and that the law also requires that the Board make its final decisions available to the public and that it do so electronically. It noted, though, that if a third party requested access to any of the records of the appellant's appeal, that request would be addressed in accordance with the Board's regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 1204.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate Privacy Act claims. <span class="Italic">Calhoon v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 375, &#x00B6; 15 (2001) (the federal district courts, not the Board, are the appropriate forum for adjudication of a Privacy Act matter); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(g)(1) (an individual may bring a civil action in the district courts of the United States against an agency for a violation of the Privacy Act). The Board has, however, considered issues involving the Privacy Act where the Act is implicated in matters over which the Board has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gill v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 23, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-24 (2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although records that are covered by the Privacy Act can be obtained when their release is mandated by the Freedom of Information Act, if release is not permitted under FOIA, the Board and its employees may be liable for civil or criminal penalties for improper disclosure of records. Given the possibility of those sanctions, Board officials exercise restraint when they respond to requests for case records. Denial of access, or an improper grant of access, can be tested through a lawsuit in district court. Counsel fees can be recovered against the Board if, following successful FOIA litigation, a fee award promotes the public interest. Board decisions on Privacy Act (or FOIA) requests are not reviewable through the usual appellate review procedures; instead, review is pursued, following use of internal Board procedure, in district court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bush v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 415, 418-19 &#x00B6; 8 (2002). [Refer to Board internal FOIA procedures, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/foia/request.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/foia/request.htm</a>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are limitations on what is placed into the Board's e-filing system. Should a prohibited item find its way into that system, it can be removed with a violation of administrative due process. <span class="Italic">See Andersen v. DOD</span>, DC-1221-19-0058-W-1 (NP 11/17/2022) ("The Board's regulations do not require parties to file their responses to discovery requests with the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(b); <span class="Italic">see Robinson v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 13 n.2 (2003) (citing a prior version of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.73(c) for this principle). In addition, the acknowledgment order in this case informed the parties that, '[u]nless you are filing a motion to compel, you must not submit your discovery requests and responses to the Board.' It further provided that, '[i]f you do, they will be rejected and returned to you.' Under these circumstances, the appellant has shown no error or abuse of discretion in the apparent removal from the electronic case file of a document that should not have been filed with the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board follows the Privacy Act (and FOIA), the Board also requires that, unless circumstances otherwise warrant, its hearings are open to the public. At the hearings, information from agency records is constantly discussed in the course of examination of witnesses and discussion of exhibits. Information discussed at open hearings becomes public information. The Board does not squarely reconcile the application of the Privacy Act to its records with the use of those records in an open hearing forum (although hearings may be closed to protect personal privacy). Board final decisions often provide references to documents in the appeal file that might have been thought to be protected by the Privacy Act. Citation of those records in a public decision might defeat the Privacy Act coverage, since Board decisions are in the public domain and, arguably, if the Board cites to a record in its public decision, then the cited material should become publicly accessible.</p>
