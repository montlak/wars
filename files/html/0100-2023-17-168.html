<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-166"><span class="space">2.</span> Arbitrator's Ability to Enforce Laws, Regulations, Management Rights</h4>
<p class="noindent">The counterpart of the award challenged for failure to conform to law, rule, or regulation is the award challenged because the arbitrator enforced a regulatory requirement against an agency subject to the regulation. <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, 45 FLRA 1411, 1412-13, 1418-21 (1992), decided that an agency regulation implementing management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) (defining permissive subjects of bargaining) is enforceable in arbitration even though an agency is not required to bargain over matters covered in that section. The agency regulation can limit the scope of management rights. The case involved a grievance requesting that an arbitrator enforce provisions of DOD directives requiring conversion of temporary appointments to permanent appointments. The grievance was arbitrable, the directive was enforceable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Agency also denied the grievance on the basis that under the circumstances, the grievants were not entitled to have been converted. The grievance was not resolved and was submitted to arbitration on the issues of whether the grievance was grievable and arbitrable and whether the Agency had violated the directive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that the grievance was grievable and arbitrable.&#x2003;The Arbitrator agreed with the Union that the grievance concerned conversion and not appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the merits, the Arbitrator noted that the applicable provisions of DoD Directive 1400.13, section IV.D.1 provide as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;...Upon satisfactory completion of a cumulative period of 8 calendar months during one or more school years in a part or full-time position with the DoD Overseas Dependents' Schools System, the educator may be selected for conversion to an Excepted Appointment-Conditional at the end of the current school year.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;A fully qualified educator appointed in the United States or who has previously served at least 8 calendar months in a part or <span id="page_1947"></span>full-time position with the DoD Overseas Dependents' Schools System will, upon appointment to a continuing part or full-time position, be given an Excepted Appointment-Conditional, unless eligible for an Excepted Appointment without condition.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">f.&#x2003;Whenever reasonable doubt exists that an educator's services will be needed or available for a full school year an educator appointed to a part or full-time position may be given a temporary limited appointment for the period of actual need.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that when a teacher meets the conditions of subsection c, the Agency must convert the teacher....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency fails to establish that the award is deficient on the ground that it is contrary to the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a grievance over the claimed violation of provisions of DoD Directive 1400.13, pertaining to the conversion of temporary teachers. The Arbitrator found a violation of the directive and enforced the terms of the directive in ordering the grievants to be converted retroactively. The Agency contends that the provisions pertaining to conversion concern matters covered by section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association and U.S. Department of Defense, Office of Dependents Schools</span>, 45 FLRA No. 118 (1992) (Proposals 6 and 7), we held that determinations as to whether an employee holding a temporary appointment should be converted to a permanent appointment are matters directly related to the numbers and types of employees or positions under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. However, because this is not a negotiability case, but an arbitration case in which the Arbitrator has enforced the terms of an agency regulation affecting conditions of employment, we also agree with the Union that negotiability cases involving the right to elect not to bargain are not dispositive of the outcome of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that some external limitations on management rights under section 7106 are enforceable in arbitration. In <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922, 924 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), the Court recognized that, unlike the framework for grievances and arbitration in the private sector, in the Federal sector a collective bargaining agreement must provide for procedures for the settlement of grievances, which are defined to include any complaint concerning any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Court examined this scheme and concluded that with respect to management rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, the negotiated grievance procedure is available to unions and employees to enforce certain external limitations contained in "applicable laws." 494 U.S. at 931 (quoting section 7106(a)(2)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The prefatory language to section 7106(b)(1) is different from the prefatory language to section 7106(a)(2). Where the prefatory language to section 7106(a)(2) states that, subject to subsection (b) of that section, nothing in the Statute shall affect the authority of management, in accordance with applicable laws, to exercise the enumerated rights, the prefatory language to section 7106(b)(1) merely states that nothing in section 7106 shall preclude the agency and the union, at the election of the agency, from negotiating over the enumerated matters. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, United States Border Patrol, San Diego Sector, San Diego, California</span>, 38 FLRA 701 (1990), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied as to other matters</span>, Case No. 91-70162 (9th Cir. June 22, 1992), we recognized that the prefatory language to section 7106(a)(2) on which the Court focused in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> does not, by its own terms, apply to section 7106(b)(1). Accordingly, we held that the Court's analysis, which was based on the language of section 7106(a)(2), was not applicable to matters involving section 7106(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because section 7106(b)(1) does not have the constraining prefatory language of section 7106(a)(2), we find that the external limitations on management's rights under section 7106(b)(1) that are enforceable in arbitration are more extensive than those relating to management's rights under section 7106(a)(2). In particular, in view of the status of agency regulations in arbitration, we conclude that an agency regulation pertaining to a matter enumerated in section 7106(b)(1) may constitute an external limitation on management's rights that is enforceable in arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Campbell District, Third Region, Fort Campbell, Kentucky and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2022</span>, 37 FLRA 186 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>), we discussed in detail the status of agency regulations in the context of arbitration. We recognized that each Federal agency prescribes rules, regulations, and official declarations of policy to govern and control the resolution of matters to which they apply within the agency. We noted the decision in <span class="Italic">Local 2855, AFGE v. U.S.</span>, 602 F.2d 574, 581 (3d Cir. 1979), in which the court recognized that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 301, Congress has invested the heads of every executive and military department with general authority to prescribe regulations for the governing of their departments and the conduct of their employees, and that, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 302, the heads of departments are permitted to delegate to subordinate officials the authority to take final action on matters pertaining to the employment, direction, and general administration of personnel of their agencies. 37 FLRA at 194. We also noted that the dominance of agency rules and regulations was acknowledged by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641 (1990), when the Court stated that "[i]t is a familiar rule of administrative law that an agency must abide by its own regulations." 495 U.S. at 654 (citing <span class="Italic">Vitarelli v. Seaton</span>, 359 U.S. 535 (1959) (<span class="Italic">Vitarelli</span>) and <span class="Italic">Service v. Dulles</span>, 354 U.S. 363 (1957)). Consequently, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> that an applicable agency regulation governs the disposition of the matter resolved by an arbitration award when there is no applicable collective bargaining provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the analysis of <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span> to the issue in this case, we hold that when an agency regulation pertaining to a matter covered by section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute governs the disposition of a grievance, it is consistent with management's rights under section 7106(b)(1) to enforce that regulation in arbitration. In holding that such a regulation is enforceable as an external limitation on management's rights, we emphasize that the focus of section 7106(b)(1) is to permit bargaining while, at the same time, preserving management's right to elect not to bargain over the enumerated matters. In enforcing agencies' own regulations, arbitrators will not be forcing agencies to assume contractual obligations in the face of an election not to bargain, and agencies will not be committed to the regulatory provision for the term of a collective bargaining agreement. Instead, arbitrators will be enforcing only existing obligations as currently set forth in the agencies' own regulations. Because these obligations will remain regulatory and not contractual, the agencies retain the right to revise or rescind the regulatory obligation at any time<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 213 and 228 and United States Department of Energy, Washington, D.C.</span>, 32 FLRA 578, 586-87 (1988) (the Authority rejected the union's claim that a proposal was negotiable because it was consistent with the provision of an agency regulation; the Authority noted that the regulation conflicted with management's rights and that incorporation of those restrictions into the collective bargaining agreement would require management to comply with them for the term of the agreement regardless of whether the agency revised or rescinded the regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, this approach harmonizes <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">Ft. Campbell</span>, and the Statute. A grievance over the claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of an agency regulation affecting conditions of employment may be submitted for resolution by an arbitrator, as contemplated by Congress in defining "grievance" in section 7103(a)(9) and in providing for binding arbitration in section 7121, while an agency's right under section 7106(b)(1) to elect not to bargain over the matters enumerated in that section is preserved and remains unaffected. Because these provisions are unique to the Federal sector, such an issue would never arise in the private sector.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this approach in this case, we conclude that no basis is provided for finding the award contrary to section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. We find that DoD Directive 1400.13 governs the conversion of teachers from temporary appointments to permanent appointments and that, consequently, the regulation was enforceable by the Arbitrator consistent with section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. As we advised in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service and American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 45 FLRA 674 (1992), an agency "must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its actions to be judged." 45 FLRA at 690 (quoting <span class="Italic">Vitarelli</span>, 359 U.S. at 546 (Frankfurter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). Accordingly, we will deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Just as FLRA may set aside an award that is contrary to law, it can uphold a decision by an arbitrator that a provision of an labor contract is contrary to law and cannot be enforced against the agency, <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 238 and EPA</span>, 62 FLRA 350, 351 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Authority precedent, the validity of a contract provision may be raised in grievance and arbitration proceedings. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Educ. Activity, Arlington, Va., </span>56 FLRA 119, 121 (2000). In this regard, if an agreement term is found to be in violation of the Statute, it is considered void and unenforceable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency was not bound by a contract provision that provided for a two-tier performance appraisal system and that its decision to modify the system to a five-tier system was within its right to assign work, as provided in &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, Educ. Activity and FEA</span>, 56 FLRA 119, 121 (2000), cited in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 238</span>, explained in the context of agency-head review of contract provisions imposed by FSIP:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the provisions of the Statute an agency head is authorized to review and approve or disapprove all provisions of collective bargaining agreements, even those provisions imposed upon the parties by the <span id="page_1948"></span>Panel in resolution of an impasse. <span class="Italic">Interpretation and Guidance</span>, 15 FLRA 564, 569 (1984). Section 7114(c)(3) of the Statute provides that an agreement which has not been approved or disapproved by the agency involved within 30 days after the date of its execution becomes effective and binding on the parties on the 31st day, without the approval of the agency, subject only to the requirements of the Statute and any other applicable law, rule or regulation. Consequently, because the Agency's disapproval of the Panel's Order was untimely served on the Union, the Order became binding on the parties unless it is contrary to the Statute or any other applicable law, rule or regulation. A question as to the validity of such a provision may be raised in other appropriate proceedings (such as grievance arbitration and unfair labor practice proceedings) and, if the agreement provision is found to be in violation of the Statute or any other applicable law, rule or regulation, it would not be enforceable but would be void and unenforceable.[4] <span class="Italic">See American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1760 and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 28 FLRA 1142, 1143-44 (1987); <span class="Italic">Point Mugu Joint Council of National Association of Government Employees, Local R12-33 and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1374 and Department of the Navy, Pacific Missile Test Center, Point Mugu, California</span>, 8 FLRA 389, 390 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Although, as set forth above, a collateral proceeding to contest the legality of contract language is permissible, it is not the most direct and efficient manner of addressing an agency's questions regarding the legality of contract language. It can deprive the union of the ability to renegotiate, and it can create unnecessary litigation. It is important for agencies to be mindful of the time limits for reviewing agreements under section 7114(c)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency does not violate the Statute when it fails to implement a Panel Order subsequently found to be contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Administration, Washington, D.C.</span>, 33 FLRA 426, 428 (1988) (agency had no obligation to implement grievance procedure imposed by the Panel where employees' conditions of employment are within the discretion of the VA Administrator under 38 U.S.C. &#x0026; 4108(a)); <span class="Italic">Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, Indiana Air National Guard, Indianapolis, Indiana</span>, 17 FLRA 23, 24 (1985) (agency did not violate Statute in refusing to implement Panel-imposed provisions on wearing of military uniforms)</p>

An arbitrator may, in some cases, apply external law, but in some cases the arbitrator may not impose external law to infringe a management right without a negotiated appropriate arrangement. The distinction in arbitrability lies in the structure of the management rights clause. 5 USC 7106(a)(1) provides that, subject to subsection (b) of the statute, providing for arrangements of bargaining and negotiated procedures, "nothing" in the chapter shall affect the authority of management to determine the mission, budget, organization, number of employees, and internal security practices of the agency. Section 7106(a)(2) provides, however, that other management rights, including those of hiring, directing, and disciplining employees, assigning work, are to be exercised "in accordance with applicable laws." The arbitrator may apply external laws in the context of challenges to &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) rights, but the arbitrator may only apply negotiated limitations (including incorporation of external law) as to rights exercised under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DODDS and Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. The concept was explained in <span class="Italic">DOD, DFAS, Indianapolis Ctr. and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 48 FLRA 1124, 1127-28 (1993):</p>

U.S. Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158 (D.C. Cir. 1992), we discussed in detail the grievability of grievances contending that the exercise of a management right under section 7106(a) was contrary to law or regulation. We noted that in <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922, 924 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>), the U.S. Supreme Court made clear that some external limitations on management rights under section 7106(a) are enforceable in arbitration. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Court recognized that, unlike the framework for grievances and arbitration in the private sector, in the Federal sector a collective bargaining agreement must provide for procedures for the settlement of grievances, which are defined to include any claimed violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of any law, rule, or regulation affecting conditions of employment. The Court examined this scheme and concluded that, with respect to management rights under section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, the negotiated grievance procedure is available to unions and employees to enforce external limitations contained in "applicable laws." 494 U.S. at 931 (quoting section 7106(a)(2)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, however, we noted that the literal wording of section 7106(a)(1) does not contain a requirement, as does section 7106(a)(2), that management exercise the rights enumerated in section (a)(1) "in accordance with applicable laws." 38 FLRA at 1076 (quoting section 7106(a)(2)). In view of the lack of such prefatory language in section 7106(a)(1) and in view of the decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, we concluded that the Statute does not require management to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) in accordance with applicable laws. Accordingly, we held that the Statute, standing alone, does not empower unions to file grievances to enforce any limitations on the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(1), including those contained in laws and regulations. We indicated that the only basis available under the Statute to allow such grievances would be for the parties to agree to an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute requiring the Agency to exercise its rights under section 7106(a)(1) in accordance with external limitations on the exercise of those rights. We affirmed that holding on reconsideration. 39 FLRA at 1244-45.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator determined that there was no provision in the parties' agreement limiting the Agency's exercise of its internal security right under section 7106 of the Statute. Therefore, we find that the Arbitrator correctly determined that the Union's claim, alleging that the wearing of DoD police badges and insignias was contrary to law, was not grievable and that no basis is provided for finding the award deficient, as alleged by the Union....</p>
