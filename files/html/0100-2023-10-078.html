<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-78"><span class="space">7.</span> Ensuring Record Development; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Pro Se</span></span> Appellant; EEO File</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although it is not the Board's function to conduct or request an investigation into an appellant's appeal, <span class="Italic">Bell v. VA</span>, 31 MSPR 61, 62 n.* (1986), it is the AJ's job to develop a record that will permit adjudication. Concepts of fundamental fairness apply. When a disability retirement appellant requested that the AJ include in his consideration the record of a prior adverse action appeal adjudicated in the same regional office by the same appellant, the AJ should have done so because of the relation of issues in the two cases. <span class="Italic">Jeffery v. <span id="Page_1374"></span>OPM</span>, 56 MSPR 151, 155-56 (1992). Conversely, the AJ does not have to sit idly by and permit a confused or meaningless record to be made. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 648, 654 (1988); <span class="Italic">Sepulveda v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 38 MSPR 449, 452-53 n.3 (1988) ("judge acted appropriately to ensure that the record was fully developed on all significant issues, and permitted the appearance of those witnesses whose testimony she deemed to be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious"). In an early decision, <span class="Italic">Mascol v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 565, 567, 7 MSPB 408 (1981), the AJ apparently dismissed an appeal without prejudice "based on a failure of proof." The AJ's approach was an undesirable way to close out the appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the presiding official thought that the evidence was inadequate, he should have exercised the powers granted him, e.g., 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.41 and 1201.43, to avoid delay in the deposition of the proceeding and to develop the record more fully. We find that the presiding official should have requested additional evidence from the parties, if he thought it necessary, or suggesting the filing of closing briefs to avoid delay in the proceedings rather than dismiss the case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's views on the proper role of the AJ occasionally conflict. In <span class="Italic">Moody v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 30 MSPR 9, 11 (1985), reacting to an admonishment from EEOC that the Board should have obtained the agency EEO investigation file as part of the Board's record transmitted to EEOC on review of a Board decision, the Board responded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC misapprehends the Board's function in "developing the record," as described in [the former] 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.155. Section 1201.155(b) applies only when the appellant raises an allegation of discrimination that was not previously raised before the agency. Further, the Board is the adjudicator of appeals filed with it. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1205(a). The Board does not solicit, investigate, nor prosecute appeals. It is the parties' obligation to create the record upon which the appeal will be adjudicated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The purpose of filing a discrimination complaint with the employing agency is to give the agency an opportunity to investigate and attempt to resolve the matter. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.213. When an agency fails to decide the discrimination complaint within 120 days following the filing of the complaint with it, or when it issues a final decision on a discrimination complaint, if the action complained of involves a matter appealable to the Board, an appeal may be filed with the Board. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154. The Board then adjudicates both the appealable personnel action and the allegation of discrimination. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.151.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the parties are responsible for creating the record in the appeal and the Board proceeding is a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of the allegation of discrimination, the Board will not, <span class="Italic">sua sponte,</span> request the evidence gathered at the agency level. If the parties wish to submit this file as part of the record to be considered by the Board, they may do so. Therefore, the Board disagrees with the EEOC's finding that the Board must request the agency's EEO complaint file.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disputes with EEOC aside, the AJ is to exercise the authority granted by 5 CFR 1201.41 (2022) to facilitate the introduction of evidence and witnesses, to make necessary references to evidence from the appeal file, and to question witnesses as necessary to develop a proper record. <span class="Italic">Richardson v. DOJ</span>, 11 MSPR 186, 194-96 (1982), concluded there was nothing inappropriate about the AJ's vigorous questioning of the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Thus, the general rule that Federal administrative hearing examiners have wide latitude as to all phases of the conduct of a hearing is equally applicable in appeals before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Fairbank v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The case of <span class="Italic">Bethlehem Steel Co. v. National Labor Relations</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 120 F.2d 641 (D.C. Cir. 1941), is closely analogous to the case at hand. The petitioners in that case contended that the decision of the trial examiner on behalf of the National Labor Relations Board should be reversed because the fact that the trial examiner badgered their witnesses and subjected them to his own sharp cross-examination evidence the trial examiner's bias. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected that contention, explaining:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It is the function of an examiner, just as it is the recognized function of a trial judge, to see that the facts are clearly and fully developed. He is not required to sit idly by and permit a confused or meaningless record to be made. If the spirit and conduct of the Examiner throughout this case were reversible error, few administrative and few judicial proceedings could withstand attack<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 652.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">According to K. Davis, <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Treatise</span> &#x00A7; 17.13 (1980), this practice has generally remained constant to date.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The constancy of this practice is further reflected in M. Ruhlen, <span class="Italic">Manual for</span> <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Judges</span> 35 (1974), which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The judge may question the witness initially if it is likely to forestall extensive examination by others. He should interrupt when the witness and counsel are at cross purposes, when the record may not reflect with clarity what the witness intends to convey, or when for some other reason assistance is needed to assure orderly development of the subject matter. At the close of cross or redirect, the Judge may question the witness to clarify any confusing or ambiguous testimony or to develop additional facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued in his petition that the presiding official in this appeal assumed a prosecutorial position and used intimidating tactics such as failing to allow the appellant to complete his answers and placing words in his mouth. We disagree. Our review of the transcript leads us to conclude that, while the presiding official did challenge the appellant's story to a degree, he did it with a view toward finding out whether he could substantiate the medical emergency that the appellant claimed during the time for which he was charged AWOL. As held in <span class="Italic">Bethlehem Steel Co.</span> at 652:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The mere existence and reflection of feeling in the course of a trial does not disqualify a presiding officer or call for reversal. It does not constitute "bias and prejudice."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued further in his petition that the presiding official examined him on areas already testified to under examination by both the appellant's attorney and the agency representative. Specifically, the presiding official asked the appellant about further documentation of his appearance at the hospital, and about the appellant's failure to report for duty after his son was released from the hospital and under a baby-sitter's supervision at home. We agree that these two subjects had been discussed previously at the hearing, but we note from the tenor of the presiding official's questions that he simply sought clarification of those matters, namely, why the appellant could not obtain more reliable documentation of his medical emergency from the hospital records, and why the appellant believed he need not report for the remainder of his shift on the night in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, while the affirmative responsibility to present relevant evidence is fundamentally that of the parties, the presiding official properly acted within the bounds of his authority, and indeed his responsibility, in assuring that the facts of this case were clearly and fully developed. He even went so far on his own initiative as to allow the appellant a further opportunity to produce credible evidence of his medical emergency, but the appellant again proffered only vague and incomplete documentation. The presiding official would have overstepped his bounds if he had taken it upon himself to establish the agency's case against the appellant, since the statutory burden rests with the agency. 5 USC 7701(c)91). Here, however, the agency adequately developed its own case against the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caviness v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 564, 568 (1982), resolved there was nothing amiss in the AJ's engaging the appellant's attorney during the course of the lawyer's examination of a witness. The Board determined that the AJ attempted to assist the attorney in sharpening the focus of his examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 277, 281 (1984) ("Our review of the record shows that appellant appeared <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, that the presiding official took note of such status, and that he therefore took a role in questioning the witnesses and appellant in order to obtain a more complete record on which to base his decision."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">King v. VA</span>, 225 Fed. Appx. 875, 877 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("It is not an abuse of discretion for the AJ to focus a litigant away from irrelevant matters."); <span class="Italic">Miller v. OPM</span>, AT-0841-13-0450-I-1 (NP 7/18/2014) ("Further, administrative judges have broad authority in adjudicating their cases, including the authority to <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> extend the record closing date to ensure that the record is fully developed and that the case is fairly and justly adjudicated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hathaway v.

Under the circumstances in this case, the administrative judge did not abuse her discretion in ordering OPM to clarify its reconsideration decision or by extending filing deadlines in order to assure that the record is fully developed.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It may be difficult for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant to demonstrate that the AJ provided too little assistance, given comments from <span class="Italic">Friese v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 210, 217 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that the administrative judge was biased against him. He claims that, due to his lack of legal knowledge, he relied upon the administrative judge to ask questions, but the administrative judge failed to ask him any questions of substance, and he was unaware that he could take the stand in his own behalf. However, the record shows that the administrative judge informed the appellant at the start of the hearing that he should ask him any questions if he did not understand anything. The record shows that the appellant presented witnesses and testified under oath in his own behalf, after the administrative judge explained that that was his opportunity to tell his version of events. We therefore find the appellant's allegations to be insufficient to overcome the presumption of impartiality that accompanies an administrative judge. <span class="Italic"><span id="Page_1375"></span>See Oliver v. Department of Transportation,</span> 1 MSPB 368, 1 MSPR 382, 386 (1980) (in making a claim of bias or prejudice against an administrative judge, a party must overcome the presumption of honesty and integrity that accompanies administrative adjudicators).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The AJ need not direct the discovery or hearing efforts of an appellant, particularly when the appellant is represented by counsel and has a full range of discovery and hearing procedures available to challenge written statements offered in evidence by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Croken v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 128, 132 (1980) ("Appellant clearly had ample opportunity to call or question whatever witnesses he thought necessary, but decided for unstated reasons, not to do so.").</p>

MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 641-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (AJ should ensure that the agency produces evidence bearing upon the timeliness of an appeal).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the presiding official certainly has the authority to request the production of evidence as part of her authority to "conduct fair and impartial hearings," under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.41, that authority does not detract from the agency's responsibility for the presentation of its case before the Board; nor does it require the presiding official to request additional evidence pertaining to the claims of the parties. As we stated in <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, supra,</span> at 498, 1 MSPR at 519, "&#x00A7; 7701(c)(1) lays upon the agency the main burden of proof on whatever record is established before the Board, whether limited to written representations or expanded to include evidence adduced at a hearing, &#x00A7; 7701(b)." Moreover, the agency must establish every element of its charge by a preponderance of the evidence in order to sustain the charge. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barnett v. Department of the Interior,</span> 6 MSPB 19, 19, 6 MSPR 4, 6 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Hosler v. VA</span>, 42 MSPR 265, 269 (1989) (bias was not shown when the AJ informed the agency at the prehearing conference and again prior to the hearing that it "might need to gather additional evidence in order to prove that physical abuse [of patient] occurred in this case").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The authority of the AJ to develop evidence does not make her a party's advocate, <span class="Italic">Marion v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 12 MSPR 312, 314 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant...cites 5 CFR Section 1201.63, which reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At any stage of the proceeding, the presiding official may request further evidence concerning an issue and order its submission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">He then asserts that he was penalized by the "supposedly impartial" presiding official's "utter failure to meet his responsibilities" under that regulation and that his petition should be granted on that basis alone. However, his bold inference that Section 1201.63 confers upon the presiding official an affirmative duty to present an appellant's case for him is wholly unfounded. Appellant was clearly apprised of his right to representation at all stages of this case and his decision to forego that right was voluntary. Therefore, we find no violation of appellant's procedural rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit noted, <span class="Italic">Fonseca v. USPS,</span> 151 Fed. Appx. 948, 950 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AJ is a finder of fact, not an advocate; we do not expect him to raise additional claims <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, particularly where, as here, a petitioner is represented by a third party.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Mr. Fonseca also argues that his non-lawyer representative was ineffective. We dismiss this argument out of hand. Board regulations permit an employee to be represented by a third party, including a non-lawyer, so long as that representative is "willing and available." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31(b). Our predecessor court has ruled that non-lawyer representatives, even those who may be inadequate and ineffective, fulfill an employee's due process requirements. <span class="Italic">Mosely v. Navy</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 718 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Marion, supra,</span> notwithstanding, there may be times when the AJ will be required to call for production of documents, particularly at the behest of the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, as in <span class="Italic">Hall v. USPS</span>, 13 MSPR 476, 478 (1982), involving an appellant who requested the AJ to obtain documents to support his affirmative defense of discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously noted in cases such as this, where the initial decision is issued without a hearing, the interest of justice requires that the presiding official monitor the submissions closely and request additional evidence when appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Rosenberg v.</span> <span class="Italic">Commodity Futures Trading Commission,</span> 7 MSPB 491, 7 M.S. P.R. 664 (1981); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. U.S. Marine Corps,</span> 3 MSPB 411, 3 MSPR 328 (1980). Although appellant made his request for the production of documentary evidence under the wrong regulation, the presiding official was aware that appellant was without legal representation and may not have understood that his request should have been made by a motion for discovery under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.73(a), or by a motion for a subpena [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.81(a). Certainly, to an untrained eye, the authority granted the presiding official under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.63 could easily be mistaken, at least, as an alternate procedure to follow, especially in light of the title of that section--"Production of evidence by order of presiding official." Moreover, the procedure would appear to the layman to be far less cumbersome than the regulatory procedures provided for discovery and the issuance of subpenas [<span class="Italic">sic</span>] . <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Baum v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury,</span> 6 MSPB 414, 6 MSPR 492 (1981). While the presiding official cannot be faulted for not "becoming the advocate of one party or an adversary of the other" <span class="Italic">(Lewis, supra)</span> during the period of appellant's uncertainty about requesting a hearing, we find that his role was altered substantially by the agency's failure to supply the requested evidence voluntarily or offer a reasonable explanation for its failure to do so, as well as by appellant's notification that he waived his right to a hearing and that he felt that he had been denied due process by the agency's inaction. The evidence was clearly material and relevant to establishing appellant's allegation of discrimination and to the presiding official's finding that the removal was effected for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But it will not do for the AJ to direct the production of evidence from one party that only he will see and rely upon. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sarich v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 12 MSPR 144, 146 (1982) (information sent to the AJ by the agency EEO office but not served on the agency representative), although a AJ may review evidence <span class="Italic">in camera</span> during the course of a discovery dispute. [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-10-096.html#sec3-96">Closing Record</a>"; refer to Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-262.html#sec2-259"><span class="Italic">In Camera</span> Inspection</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Without becoming an advocate of one party or adversary to the other, the AJ must exercise his responsibilities under the regulations to assure that the initial decision is issued with the requisite factual and legal analysis. <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Marine Corps</span>, 3 MSPR 328, 330, 3 MSPB 411 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 81 MSPR 443, 447 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) ("Although a judge will provide appropriate aid to a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, early rulings of the Board established that he is not to be an adversary or an advocate in doing so. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Broadaway v. OPM</span>, 9 MSPR 650, 651, 9 MSPB 268 (1982); <span class="Italic">Sletten v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 2 MSPB 209, 2 MSPR 35, 40 (1980)."); <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 117, 119 (1984) (reciting <span class="Italic">Lewis</span> in support of the authority of a judge to reconvene a hearing and accept additional evidence). If the AJ solicits additional evidence, the AJ should ensure that the evidence is made known to both parties, with opportunity to comment upon or reply to the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 278 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (commenting on a Civil Service Commission examiner's development of a medical opinion on what amounted to an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> basis).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board clarified the AJ's responsibilities in <span class="Italic">Rosenberg v. CFTC</span>, 7 MSPR 664, 666, 7 MSPB 491 (1981): although the AJ is not to become the advocate of one party, he must ensure that an initial decision can be written to satisfy the Board's analytical requirements. The AJ cannot issue an initial decision ignoring the submissions of one of the parties because he cannot comprehend the technical nature of the evidence presented. In appeals decided without a hearing, the interests of justice require that the AJ closely monitor the parties' submissions and request additional evidence, if necessary, to ensure proper development of the record. If the technical evidence submitted cannot be understood by the AJ, he should direct the party making the proffer to provide explanatory material to assist preparation of findings of fact. If the agency fails to provide technical or expert guidance during the appeals process, it will not be heard to complain should the AJ misunderstand the technical evidence presented. <span class="Italic">Rosenberg v. CFTC</span>, 7 MSPR 664, 666, 7 MSPB 491 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Von Muller v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 101 MSPR 91, 97 &#x00B6; 13, 2006 MSPB 18 (2006) (when the AJ could not read information on a CD-ROM, he should have directed the agency to supply the information in a readable format). The AJ may reopen the record on his own volition and reconvene the hearing if it is necessary to adjudicate the case, assuming that an initial decision has not already been issued. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 117, 118-19 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Prehearing submissions from the parties can be incomprehensible, consisting of narrative and including documents having no meaning without explanation. That may occur in unacceptable performance actions involving the appellant's technical work product. Without testimony or other explanation of the nature of the work, the AJ is left with a mass of documentation, particularly if no hearing was requested, and the problem of determining what it all means. Because the agency bears the burden of persuading the Board that a case exists against the appellant, it might be expected that if the AJ cannot understand the file, the agency fails to persuade and fails in its burden of proof. Doubtless some AJs take that approach; however, the Board requires initial decisions to address carefully all issues of fact and law. An AJ cannot examine or analyze <span id="Page_1376"></span>what he does not understand. It may occur that the AJ, in meeting his own adjudicative responsibilities, assists the agency or the appellant in making its case intelligible to the Board by requiring that one or both parties provide clarification during or after a prehearing conference.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AJs ordinarily let parties develop their own cases. The parties do so initially through the submission of an appeal and a response to the appeal, followed by discovery and prehearing submissions. By the time the hearing date arrives, the parties will normally have developed the necessary information to support their cases. Information can and will be developed during the hearing whether it was or could have been obtained through discovery. By motion or at the request of a party, the AJ may request further evidence on an issue and order its submission. 5 CFR 1201.41(b)(10) (2022). At the hearing, someone may mention a document unknown to anyone else. A request is then made for the witness to produce the document, but, alas, it is not in his briefcase, so the AJ is asked to direct the witness, agency, or appellant to search out and produce a copy of the document during a recess or after the hearing closes. But the Board will not fault the AJ if a request for documents at the hearing is denied because the appellant could have earlier requested the documents through discovery, <span class="Italic">Lucas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 11 MSPR 334, 337 (1982), and the availability of prehearing discovery may preclude efforts to obtain new documentary evidence during a hearing. An appellant's PFR challenged the denial of documents requested during a hearing as adjudicative error. Noting that the appellant had a union representative, that the prehearing notice clearly stated that requests for documents were to be made before the hearing, and that obtaining the requested documents would have delayed the hearing because of the amount of time needed to review them, the Board found no error in the AJ's refusal to order the production of the documents during the hearing. <span class="Italic">Bollo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 286, 7 MSPB 181 (1981). <span class="Italic">Bollo</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Baum v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 492, 6 MSPB 414 (1981), determining that the AJ should have ordered release of significant documents requested during the hearing by an unrepresented employee if their production would not have delayed adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The opposite situation involves introduction of documents during the hearing that were within the scope of discovery requests, but that were not produced in response to those requests. The AJ will not be faulted for admitting the documents and allowing examination (and refutation) during the hearing unless an objection is preserved or a motion for sanctions or other relief is made by the party against whom the documents are offered, as was indirectly explained in <span class="Italic">Leftridge v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 340, 347 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record establishes, however, that the appellant did not move for sanctions before the administrative judge, although the appellant's attorney did express her dissatisfaction with the agency's failure to earlier provide the investigative file. Therefore, we need not further consider the appellant's assertion that sanctions should have been imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Banks v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 342, 4 MSPR 268, 271 (1980). In addition, the appellant's attorney did not object to either the administrative judge's decision to have a recess to permit her to view the documents, or to the length of the recess. Nor did she seek to recall Wanek after reviewing the file....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Lloyd v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 417, 421 (1982), the AJ, who admitted the documents during the hearing because the agency professed surprise at an element of the appellant's testimony, should not have then found the appellant to be prejudiced by their admission; the appellant could have used discovery to obtain the documents earlier, the agency did not intentionally mislead the appellant, and a continuance was granted so that the appellant could respond to the documents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With or without the appeal, the response to the appeal, and the parties' prehearing submissions, certain materials should be included in the record and the AJ is expected to make sure that they find their way there: one example is an agency table of penalties in a disciplinary case. <span class="Italic">Jones v. Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 3 MSPR 471, 474, 3 MSPB 540 (1980). Another example would be OPM's annuity calculations if the amount of an annuity is in dispute. <span class="Italic">Kozer v. OPM</span>, 52 MSPR 93, 95, 96 (1991) ("[W]here the initial decision is issued without a hearing, the administrative judge should monitor the parties' submissions and request additional evidence where appropriate." (citing <span class="Italic">Beasley v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 70, 74 (1989), for the proposition that "[a]s the agency charged with...administering civil service retirement laws, OPM has an affirmative duty to fully and accurately inform claimants of their rights and obligations")).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On his or her own motion in the mixed case, the AJ may call witnesses and order the production of evidence. If statistical information could be useful, the AJ may call for its production. (44 Fed. Reg. 38345, 38348). Ordinarily, however, the parties have the principal role in development of the administrative record. The Board is disinclined to direct the production of expert evidence, as can be inferred from its statement in <span class="Italic">Evans v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 11 MSPR 36, 40 n.2 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, in his petition for review, invites the Board to order an evaluation of his handicap by an independent expert. As noted previously, appellant must prove his affirmative defense by a preponderance of the evidence. The Board would have accepted and considered additional supportive material had it been provided by appellant in a timely and diligent manner. However, the Board, as an independent adjudicator, will not direct the submission of evidence which is clearly appellant's burden to produce....</p>
