<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-325"><span class="space">b.</span> Performance Appraisal--1988 and Beyond</h5>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's approach to arbitration awards involving performance appraisals has varied over the years as to the degree of interference that those awards, and the contracts they interpret and apply, permissibly present to management rights to direct and assign work, and also as to the discretion allowed to arbitrators to set aside, remand, or correct deficient performance appraisals.</p>
<p class="noindent">As background, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 30 FLRA 1156 (1988), redefined an arbitrator's authority to remedy a grievance pertaining to a performance rating. Before <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, if an arbitrator decided the rating or rating process was wrong, the normal course would be to instruct management to again rate the grievant under the proper criteria or procedures, with the exception for performance standards or critical elements that could be assessed in a mechanical, nondiscretionary manner. <span class="Italic">SSA</span> provided a new framework. The analysis was, first ("Prong I"), whether a rating error resulted from violation of law, regulation, or contract provisions and, second ("Prong II"), whether enough information was provided to the arbitrator to direct a particular rating or, lacking that information, whether the matter had to be returned to management for reevaluation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We now hold that when an arbitrator finds that management has not applied the established elements and standards or that management has applied the established elements and standards in violation of law, regulation, or a properly negotiated provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the arbitrator may cancel the performance appraisal or rating. When the arbitrator is able to determine on the basis of the record presented what the rating of the grievant's work product or performance would have been under the established elements and standards, if they had been applied, or if the violation of law, regulation or the collective bargaining agreement had not occurred, the arbitrator may direct management to grant the grievant that rating. If the record does not enable the Arbitrator to determine what the grievant's rating would have been, the arbitrator should direct the grievant's work product or performance be reevaluated by management as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) do not warrant finding awards deficient on the basis that in directing a rating change, arbitrators substitute their judgment for that of management. In <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span> [28 FLRA 961 (1987)], we rejected the argument that enabling arbitrators to substitute their judgment for that of management precluded the arbitrability of grievances challenging the legality of performance standards before employees were evaluated under the standards. We stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Resolution of the grievance in this case by an arbitrator would not require an arbitrator to do anything other than what arbitrators do routinely in resolving other disputes, including those involving the exercise of other management rights such as discipline. An arbitrator would simply be examining an action by management to determine whether that action was lawful....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This is precisely one of the functions that arbitrators perform, and that Congress intended that arbitrators perform, under the Statute. In requiring parties to negotiate grievance procedures that result in binding arbitration, and in broadly defining what grievances could encompass, Congress fully expected arbitrators to review a wide variety of actions, including actions taken by management pursuant to section 7106.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons expressed in <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station</span>, we reject the previous Authority holdings that arbitrators may not substitute their judgment for that of management by directing management to grant employees the performance ratings they would have received if they had been appraised properly. The application of elements and standards obviously involves the exercise of judgment by management officials. We find no basis in the Statute or legislative history for continuing to hold that this judgment must be exercised by management alone. In resolving these cases under the approach we have announced, an arbitrator will not be exercising any additional authority beyond that which they routinely exercise in resolving other grievances, including those that involve the exercise of other management rights. For example, arbitrators routinely resolve under the Statute and Civil Service Reform Act grievances over whether disciplinary action was warranted and, if so, whether the penalty assessed was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the new approach, an arbitrator should examine management's application of the elements and standards to determine whether established elements and standards were applied in accordance with law, regulation, and the collective bargaining agreement. We believe that these examinations and determinations are consistent with congressional intent concerning the functions performed by arbitrators in resolving grievances under the Statute. To the extent that the resolution of grievances by arbitrators in this manner conflicts with section 7106(a)(2)(A) or (B), that conflict results from implementation of congressionally mandated grievance and arbitration procedures. Consequently, decisions of the Authority which preclude arbitrators from resolving grievances in this manner will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">SSA</span> formulation was modified in 1997 as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v53/53-021.html">53 FLRA 146</a>, 151-56 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">BEP</span>"), FLRA determined that an arbitrator may set aside a rating only for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of 5 USC 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision negotiated pursuant to exceptions to 5 USC 7106(a), (b); if the rating was set aside, the arbitrator could only order reconstruction of the rating if it could be determined what management would have done or, if the arbitrator could not reconstruct the rating, the arbitrator would be required to remand the matter to management for reevaluation. As to a contract violation allowing an arbitrator to direct that an appraisal be canceled, the contract provision would be enforceable if it did not abrogate management's right to assign work:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analytical Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> the following two-prong test to determine whether an arbitration award resolving a performance appraisal grievance impermissibly affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">First, an arbitrator must find that management has not applied the established standards or has applied them in violation of law, regulation, or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. If that finding is made, an arbitrator may cancel the grievant's performance appraisal or rating. Second, if the arbitrator is able to determine based on the record what the performance appraisal or rating would have been had management applied the correct standard or if the violation had not occurred, the <span id="page_2313"></span>arbitrator may order management to grant that appraisal or rating. If the arbitrator is unable to determine what the grievant's rating would have been, he must remand the case to management for reevaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">34 FLRA at 328.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequent to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, the Supreme Court construed the language of section 7106 of the Statute in a manner that requires us to reexamine the first prong of this test. <span class="Italic">See IRS v. FLRA</span>, 494 U.S. 922 (1990). First, the Court held that the "nothing in this chapter" language of section 7106 means that nothing in the <span class="Italic">entire</span> <span class="Italic">Statute</span>, including grievance arbitration under section 7121, can affect the authority of management officials to exercise, in accordance with applicable laws, the management rights enumerated in section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute. 494 U.S. at 928. Second, in construing the "in accordance with applicable laws" language of section 7106(a)(2), the Court ruled that the Statute does not empower unions to enforce all external limitations on the enumerated rights, but only those limitations contained in applicable laws. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 931. Third, the Court rejected a construction of the Statute that would equate the term "applicable laws" with the phrase "any law, rule, or regulation" in section 7103(a)(9) of the Statute.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The case was remanded to the Authority to consider the scope of the term "applicable laws." On remand, the Authority construed the term to encompass rules and regulations having the force and effect of law. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 42 FLRA 377 (1991), <span class="Italic">enforcement denied on other grounds</span>, 996 F.2d 1246 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to the statutory limit on management rights resulting from the term "applicable laws" in section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, an agency's authority to exercise the rights enumerated in section 7106(a) is expressly made "subject to" section 7106(b), which states that "[n]othing in [section 7106] shall preclude an agency from negotiating" over the matters set forth in section 7106(b). Consistent with the language and structure of section 7106, it is clear that section 7106(b) constitutes a separate limitation on, or exception to, management rights under section 7106(a). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Montana Air Chapter No. 29 v. FLRA</span>, 22 F.3d 1150, 1155 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("&#x00A7; 7106(b) <span class="Italic">is</span> indisputably an exception to &#x00A7; 7106(a)." (emphasis in original)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On reexamination, we revise the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> analysis to comport with this construction of section 7106. In accordance with the plain wording of the Statute and the decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, it is clear that, with the limited exception of matters subject to the "carve-out" doctrine as discussed in note 7 above [involving negotiability of matters involving official time under section 7131(d) of the Statute], an arbitration award that affects management rights under section 7106(a)(2) may provide a remedy only for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b).[8] Thus, under prong I, an arbitrator may cancel a performance rating only if management applied the established performance standards for that job element in violation of either an applicable law or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement on a section 7106(b) matter. In addition, an arbitrator may cancel a rating only if the violation affected that rating. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1843 and U.S. Department Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, New York</span>, 51 FLRA 444, 448-49 (1995) (there must be a sufficient nexus between the remedy and the violation for which relief is provided). This revision applies the same approach to awards resolving performance appraisal grievances that are claimed to affect management rights that we apply to awards claimed to affect other management rights. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Birmingham</span>, <span class="Italic">Alabama and American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 274 (1995) (finding no basis in the Statute to apply a different approach to management's right to discipline than is applied to other management rights under section 7106(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;When an arbitrator has enforced a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement that constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, we apply the analysis of <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>), to determine whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement is contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B). Under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, an arbitrator's enforcement of an arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) is not contrary to management rights unless the enforcement would abrogate the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the revised analysis, agency regulations that do not constitute applicable laws, contract provisions that are not enforceable consistent with section 7106, and management's failure to apply established performance standards provide no basis for canceling a performance rating. Thus, the Authority will find an award deficient if the arbitrator canceled a performance rating solely because management failed to apply established performance standards; violated a regulation that does not constitute an applicable law; or violated an agreement provision that is not enforceable consistent with section 7106 of the Statute. Accordingly, we will no longer follow such decisions as <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, 509th Bombardment Wing, Pease Air Force Base, New Hampshire and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-111</span>, 41 FLRA 1035 (1991) (arbitrator canceled disputed performance ratings solely on the basis of the agency's failure to apply the established performance standards) and <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Headquarters, Army Garrison, Fort Richie, Maryland and National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 115</span>, 43 FLRA 968 (1992) (arbitrator canceled the grievant's performance appraisal solely on the basis of the agency's failure to comply with an agency regulation).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prong II of the analysis requires that the award must reflect a reconstruction of what management's appraisal of the grievant would have been if management had acted properly. Thus, an arbitrator who has properly canceled an appraisal or rating under the revised prong I may order management to change the grievant's rating only when the arbitrator is able to determine what management would have rated the grievant's performance if management had not violated applicable law or a contract provision concerning a section 7106(b) matter. An arbitrator does not properly reconstruct what management would have rated the grievant's performance when the arbitrator independently appraises or rates a grievant, or determines what management would have rated the grievant using standards different from those established by management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the arbitrator is unable to reconstruct what the grievant's appraisal or rating would have been had management acted properly, the arbitrator must remand the case to management for reevaluation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Revised Analytical Framework</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a. <span class="Italic">Prong I</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this revised analytical framework in this case, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly canceled the grievant's ratings on the disputed job elements. The Arbitrator found that management violated Article 34, Sections 1, 11, and 12 in appraising the grievant on those elements. Management's evaluation of employees under an established performance appraisal system constitutes the exercise of the rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 30 FLRA at 1158-59. By canceling the grievant's ratings for those elements, the award affects the exercise of those rights. However, we find that Article 34, Sections 1, 11, and 12, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, constitute arrangements within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and were enforced by the Arbitrator consistent with <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 34, Sections 1, 11, and 12 required management to apply the established performance standards to the grievant and to inform the grievant that her tardiness was adversely affecting her work performance under those standards prior to holding her accountable for tardiness in her performance appraisal. We find that these provisions, as enforced by the Arbitrator, provide relief to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees of being evaluated on matters on which they were never informed they would be appraised.<span class="Italic"> See Patent Office</span> <span class="Italic">Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce</span>, <span class="Italic">Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C.</span>, 47 FLRA 10 (1993) (provision 11), <span class="Italic">review denied as to other matters</span>, 26 F.3d 1148 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (a provision that is intended to provide relief to an employee whose performance is adversely evaluated on matters beyond the employee's control constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 39 FLRA 27 (1991) (provision 12), <span class="Italic">aff'd in relevant part sub nom.</span>, <span class="Italic">IRS, Office of Chief Counsel v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (a provision that precludes consideration of a performance evaluation that would adversely affect the employee unless it had been provided to the employee constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute) (<span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>). Accordingly, as the provisions "address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right[,]" they constitute arrangements. <span class="Italic">Office of Chief Counsel</span>, 960 F.2d at 1073.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because such provisions reserve to management the right to evaluate all performance under established performance standards as to which employees have been informed they will be appraised, their enforcement clearly does not abrogate management rights under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B).[9] Accordingly, the Arbitrator's cancellation of the grievant's performance appraisal as a remedy for the Agency's violations of Article 34 is not contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In this regard, we reject the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">PTO</span>. <span class="Italic">PTO</span> was a negotiability case and was resolved on the basis of an excessive interference analysis rather than the abrogation analysis required <span id="page_2314"></span>under <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service and American Federation of Government Employees, National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council</span>, 42 FLRA 222, 231-32 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I, the amount of harm caused by an agency's actions is not considered in canceling a disputed appraisal when management has improperly applied the established performance standards. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 34 FLRA at 327-28. Thus, the Agency's argument that its violations of the agreement were harmless provides no basis for concluding that the prong I finding is deficient. Furthermore, contrary to the Agency's claim, the Arbitrator found that the violations were not harmless.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">b. <span class="Italic">Prong II</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Arbitrator's prong II determination is not deficient. As interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 34, Sections 1, 11, and 12 required management to apply the established performance standards to the grievant and to inform the grievant that her tardiness was adversely affecting her work performance under those standards prior to holding her accountable for tardiness in her performance appraisal. The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Sections 11 and 12, by using the grievant's tardiness in her performance appraisal without having informed her that her tardiness was adversely affecting her performance under the established performance standards, and violated Section 1, by failing to appraise the grievant against the established performance standards for the disputed job elements. Finally, she specifically found that the grievant's supervisor had admitted that the grievant would have received a summary rating of "outstanding," but for her tardiness. In sum, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the Agency violated three separate provisions of Article 34 by basing the grievant's rating in part on her tardiness; and (2) the Agency admitted that this use of tardiness was the dispositive reason that the grievant had not received a rating of "outstanding." Therefore, in determining that the grievant should be rated level 5 on all disputed elements, the Arbitrator properly reconstructed what management would have rated the grievant's performance had it fulfilled the requirements of Article 34.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Agency's claim that the award is deficient because the reconstruction is not based on a failure to provide a progress review. The Agency has misapprehended the extent of the violations found by the Arbitrator, which, as discussed above, were much more extensive than a failure to provide a progress review. Furthermore, because the Arbitrator reconstructed what management would have rated the grievant under the established performance standards had it acted properly, the Arbitrator applied, and did not alter, those standards. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's order to raise the grievant's ratings is not contrary to law. </p>

The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Article 8 when it compared the grievant's performance to that of other employees and considered the grievant's performance in resolving customer incident tickets, which is not provided for in the performance standards.[6] Additionally, the Arbitrator rejected the justifications offered by the grievant's first-level supervisor for the challenged ratings. The Arbitrator found that the Agency improperly rated the grievant and sustained both grievances.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Article 8 provides:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In determining an appropriate remedy, the Arbitrator found that "it was not necessary for the Union to demonstrate that the [g]rievant's performance warranted" the requested Level 4 rating.

Accordingly, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to increase the grievant's rating to a Level 4 and awarded corresponding retroactive merit pay increases for both years.</p>

Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's award violates management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute because the Arbitrator determined that she could direct the Agency to raise the grievant's rating to a Level 4 even though the Union never established that the grievant's performance warranted a Level 4 rating.</p>

Because this remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the contractual violation, the answer to the second question is yes.[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2315"></span>The final question is whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the CBA excessively interferes with a &#x00A7; 7106(a) management right.[36] The Agency argues that the Arbitrator's remedy excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work because the Arbitrator directed the Agency to give the grievant a Level 4 rating without any consideration of whether the grievant's "actual" performance warranted that rating.

<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By directing the Agency to raise the grievant's rating to a Level 4, <span class="Italic">without finding that the grievant's 2015 performance actually supported a Level 4 rating</span>, the Arbitrator's remedy excessively interfered with the Agency's right to evaluate and rate the grievant's actual job performance.[39] Thus, the Arbitrator's award excessively interferes with management's rights.</p>

In reaching this conclusion, the majority does not purport to articulate any discernible standard by which parties or arbitrators might, in future cases, ascertain whether an award will be vacated on these grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, the majority summarily concludes that the award does not pass muster under <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> because the Arbitrator did not find "that the grievant's 2015 performance rating actually supported a Level 4 rating."[15] The majority fails to cite a single Authority decision to support or explain this conclusion, and instead relies more generally upon decisions addressing negotiability appeals which merely reiterate that the evaluation of employee performance is an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work.[16] Simply stated, the majority's conclusory application of its "excessive interference" test to vacate the award "casts further light on the arbitrary nature of the DOJ analysis."[17]</p>

However, in <span class="Italic">FDIC, Division of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Protection, San Francisco Region</span>, the Authority specifically rejected continued application of the "reconstruction" standard because it "unduly limits the appropriate remedial authority of arbitrators." 65 FLRA 102, 106 (2010).

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the evaluation of employee performance is an exercise of management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute,[33] and the Agency argues that the award violates those rights because it changes the grievant's performance ratings. For several reasons discussed further below, the Agency asserts that the award fails to satisfy the standards for evaluating management&#8209;rights claims under <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>).[35]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">At step one of <span class="Italic">DOJ's</span> three&#8209;part framework, the question is whether the Arbitrator found a violation of a contract provision.[36] The Agency argues that the Arbitrator did not find a contract violation. But the Arbitrator found that the Agency incorrectly faulted the grievant for a backlog without citing any applicable standard for backlogs or backlog reduction. And to support that finding, the Arbitrator relied on Section 5(D), which states, "[i]f there are numeric performance standards[,] they will be clearly identified in the employee's performance plan." Thus, the Arbitrator found a violation of Section 5(D), and the answer to the first question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405) (finding that <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> applied to management&#8209;rights challenge to an arbitrator's direction to raise a performance rating).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At step two, the question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to the contract violation.[40] The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the procedures set forth in Section 5(D) of the collective&#8209;bargaining agreement when it lowered the grievant's job&#8209;knowledge rating based on an alleged backlog standard that was not clearly identified. As relief, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to revise the flawed assessments so that the grievant received a level&#8209;five rating in the job&#8209;knowledge element for 2015 and 2016. This relief reasonably and proportionally relates to the contract violation,[43] so the answer to the second question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (citing <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 70 FLRA at 405). The Agency claims that the portion of the remedies that concerned only future assessments is not reasonably and proportionally related to a violation of Section 5(D). Exceptions Br. at 9. But because we have already set aside that portion of the remedies, this claim is moot.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Comptroller</span>, 71 FLRA at 390 (where arbitrator found that agency lowered grievant's performance rating based on factors that were not part of her performance standards, remedy that required "set[ting] aside the flawed rating and...chang[ing] the grievant's rating" to a higher level was reasonable and proportional).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The third question is whether the Arbitrator's remedy excessively interferes with management's rights.[44] The Authority has previously held that an arbitral direction to raise a performance rating "<span class="Italic">without finding that the grievant's...performance actually supported</span>" a higher rating excessively interfered with the rights to direct employees and assign work.[45] By contrast, here, the Arbitrator made credibility <span id="page_2316"></span>determinations and factual findings to support his conclusion that the grievant's performance merited level&#8209;five ratings in the job&#8209;knowledge element, due to the procedures established in Section 5(D).[46]</p>

(finding "no specific evidence" supported Agency's backlog allegation against grievant).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nevertheless, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator excessively interfered with management's rights by "reweigh[ing]" evidence.[47] We reject that argument because, under the Authority's previous decision on this question, an arbitrator <span class="Italic">must</span> evaluate pertinent evidence before directing a changed performance rating.[48] In other words, the Arbitrator did not excessively interfere with management's rights by undertaking the very analysis that the Authority's precedent required of him. The Agency also argues that the Arbitrator "merely substituted his judgment for the [A]gency's." In fact, the Agency argued before the Arbitrator that he should apply a "preponderance of the evidence" standard to decide the dispute over the grievant's rating, and the Arbitrator adopted and applied that standard. In addition, the Agency had the opportunity to provide evidence to establish that the procedures in Section 5(D) of the collective&#8209;bargaining agreement were met, but the Arbitrator found that the Agency's case suffered from "an amazing paucity of information...to support" its assessments of the grievant. Further, we have rejected the Agency's nonfact challenge to the Arbitrator's evaluation of evidence that supported his direction to change the grievant's ratings. Thus, the answer to the third question is no.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;Exceptions Br. at 8; <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 9&#8209;10. The Agency's management&#8209;rights exception also relies on its Personnel Policy Manual, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 9 n.10, and an argument that the Arbitrator lacked the power to "impose[&#8197;] a particular score or rating...without first finding that the appraising official would have given [the grievant] that score had [the appraising official] properly followed the contract," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 8 (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Wash., D.C</span>., 53 FLRA 146, 154 (1997)).

<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency has not shown that the award violates management's rights to direct employees and assign work, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The standard of review through 2010 for awards that considered challenges to appraisals was stated in <span class="Italic">DOD, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 54 FLRA 487, 491-92 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator applied the two-prong test established in <span class="Italic">SSA</span> in resolving the grievance. The first prong in the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> framework was recently modified by the Authority in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>).[4] However, as the dispute here involves only the Arbitrator's application of the second prong in the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> framework, which <span class="Italic">BEP</span> did not alter, the fact that the Arbitrator utilized the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> test does not, by itself, render the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In particular, under prong I of <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, arbitrators were required, prior to canceling a grievant's performance appraisal, to find that management had not applied the established performance standards, or had applied them "in violation of law, regulation, or a properly negotiated provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 30 FLRA at 1160. In <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153, the Authority modified prong I of the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> analysis, finding that "agency regulations that do not constitute applicable laws, contract provisions that are not enforceable consistent with section 7106, and management's failure to apply established performance standards provide no basis for canceling a performance rating." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, an arbitrator may cancel a performance rating only if management applied the established performance standards for that job element in violation of either an applicable law or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement on a section 7106(b) matter; the arbitrator may cancel the rating only if the violation affected that rating. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong II of both <span class="Italic">SSA</span> and <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, an arbitrator who has properly canceled a rating may order management to change the rating only when the arbitrator is able to determine what management would have rated the grievant if management had not acted improperly. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154; <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 34 FLRA at 328. As stated in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the remedy awarded must reflect a "reconstruction" of what management's appraisal of the grievant would have been if management had acted properly. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with this requirement, to raise a rating, an arbitrator must "find that the record supported raising the grievant's ratings[.]" <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Management Command, Defense Contract Management Area Operations Boston, Boston, Massachusetts and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-210</span>, 53 FLRA 210, 217 (1997).[5] Accordingly, an arbitrator may not simply substitute the grievant's previous appraisal on the ground that the agency "failed to indicate diminished performance on the part of the grievant from the previous year[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> However, when an arbitrator finds it "clear that [a] grievant was rated down <span class="Italic">because</span> <span class="Italic">of</span>" the agency's violation of either the law or the parties' agreement, then the Authority will uphold the arbitrator's reinstatement of the grievant's previous job appraisal rating. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 222, 230 (1997) (emphasis added).[6]</p>

<p class="noindent">In 2010, FLRA decided it would jettison the preexisting requirement that arbitrators reconstruct what management would have done had there been no contract or other violation established in arbitration and, instead, arbitrators would be freed to create appropriate remedies themselves. <span class="Italic">FDIC and NTEU Chap. 273</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-27.html">65 FLRA 102</a>, 106-07 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring), FLRA abandoned a requirement that arbitrators attempt in certain cases to reconstruct what management would have done had there been no contract violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon reexamination of the "reconstruction" standard reflected in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>'s second prong, and as discussed in the following section, we determine that such a standard is not required by the Statute and, indeed, unduly limits the appropriate remedial authority of arbitrators. It is sufficient that an arbitrator's award that affects management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On a practical level, parties to a collective bargaining agreement understand that (absent an express exclusion of a particular matter from arbitration) a violation of a negotiated contract provision is subject to being remedied by an arbitrator exercising his broad authority to remedy such violations. If an agency is concerned that the arbitral remedy for violating a particular contract proposal would impermissibly affect management rights, the agency need not agree to the proposal. However, if an agency agrees to include in its collective bargaining agreement a provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b), and that provision is applied by an arbitrator in a way reasonably related to the provision and the harm being remedied, a subsequent challenge to such an award is likely to be rejected by the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Keeping in mind that the "excessive interference" standard for management rights objections applies to exceptions in 2018, and that the "reconstruction" remedy for appraisals was discontinued in 2010 in favor of greater remedial discretion of arbitrators, we turn to law predating 2018 with the knowledge that decisions may not be reliable as precedent based on their facts and legal analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">Grievances most frequently challenge the results or contents of individuals' appraisals. But a union may challenge an entire performance appraisal system, and the arbitrator may direct the agency to conform its system to governing law and regulations. That OPM has certified a performance management system does not render that system immune from review by an arbitrator. The arbitrator is not barred from examining an entire appraisal system. The arbitrator's jurisdiction over the system is broader than that of the MSPB or its reviewing court. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 48 FLRA 1091, 1095 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to a challenge to an appraisal system, applying the abrogation standard of review, <span class="Italic">USDA, Farm Serv. Agency and NTEU Chap. 264</span>, 65 FLRA 483, 483-85 <span id="page_2317"></span>(2011), determined that an award properly sustained a grievance that management violated a contractual two-tier performance appraisal system when it unilaterally implemented a five-tier appraisal system:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unit of employees involved here operated under a two-tier PAS specifically established by Article 27 of the parties' CBA. The Agency unilaterally decided to implement a five-tier PAS. The Agency notified the Union of its decision by providing the Union with copies of Notices PM-2482 and PM-2512. Notices PM-2482 and PM-2512 are Agency notices announcing the implementation of a five-tier PAS. <span class="Italic"></span>The Union challenged this proposed change on the ground that it conflicted with Article 27's two-tier PAS. However, the Agency subsequently implemented the five-tier PAS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency violated Article 27 of the CBA by implementing a five-tier PAS. The grievance was unresolved and was submitted to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At arbitration, the parties stipulated to the following issues:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Did the [Agency] violate Article 27, Article 45 (sections A and B), or Article 62 (Sections A, B and C) of the [CBA]...; 5 USC Section 7114 (a); and/or 5 USC Section 7116 (a)(1)(5)(7) or (8) when it implemented a new performance appraisal system...?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator granted the grievance in part.&#x2003;She ruled that the Agency violated a number of provisions of the CBA by implementing the five-tier PAS. For instance, the Arbitrator held that the Agency violated Article 27, which established the two-tier PAS. In addition, the Arbitrator held that the Agency violated Article 45, which provides that the CBA can be modified only if a statute, Executive Order, government-wide regulation, or judicial decision conflicts with a CBA provision. The Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to prove that one of the outside authorities listed in Article 45 required implementation of a five-tier PAS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management rights exceptions to arbitration awards.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Envtl.

Under the revised analysis, the Authority assesses whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If so, then, as relevant here, the Authority examines whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Also, under the revised analysis, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 116-18. In concluding that it would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive-interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 118. Furthermore, in setting forth its revised analysis, the Authority specifically rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in prior case law. <span class="Italic">FDIC, SF Region, </span>65 FLRA at 106-07.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not disputed that the award affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work. Consequently, we examine whether the Arbitrator enforced a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b). Here, the Arbitrator enforced Articles 27, 45, and 62 of the CBA. He determined that the Agency violated these provisions by implementing a five-tier PAS because the parties already negotiated a two-tier PAS under Article 27. With regard to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Agency does not dispute that these provisions are arrangements, but argues that the Arbitrator's enforcement of these provisions excessively interferes with management's rights to direct employees and assign work by dictating the performance levels of the PAS. However, as stated above, the Authority no longer applies an excessive-interference standard in determining whether an arbitrator has enforced a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3); rather, it applies an abrogation standard. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116-18. The Authority has previously described an award that abrogates the exercise of a management right as an award that "precludes an agency from exercising" the right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Transp. Ctr., Fort Eustis</span>, <span class="Italic">Va</span>., 38 FLRA 186, 190 (1990) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency fails to demonstrate that Articles 27, 45, and 62, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, abrogate the exercise of the rights to direct employees and assign work. The Arbitrator did not interpret the provisions to prevent management from establishing criteria to evaluate employees in their performance appraisals. The provisions agreed to by the Agency require it to limit its evaluation to two performance levels. Therefore, the provisions do not preclude the Agency from evaluating employees in their performance appraisals. Accordingly, the Agency has failed to establish that the provisions abrogate management's rights to direct employees and assign work. Based on the foregoing, the Authority finds that the contract provisions at issue were negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also asserts, without elaboration, that even if the contract provisions are appropriate arrangements, the award is deficient because the award fails to "reconstruct" what the Agency would have done had it not violated those provisions. However, as discussed above, such "reconstruction" is no longer applicable. <span class="Italic">See FDIC, SF Region, </span>65 FLRA at 106-07. Accordingly, we find that the award does not impermissibly affect management's rights by failing to reconstruct what the Agency would have done if it had not violated the contract, and we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">As applied to an individual rating, an example of the application of law applying the abrogation standard and permitting the arbitrator to fashion a remedy rather than reconstructing the proper management action is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, DLI and AFGE Local 1263</span>, 65 FLRA 668, 669, 671 (2011), involving an award requiring elevation of a rating when the arbitrator decided that the grievant's rating would have been higher if management followed contract provisions involving counseling and providing other procedural protections:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by scoring the grievant's Target Language standard as successful. According to the Arbitrator, Article 25, Section 4 of the parties' agreement placed a duty on the Agency to inform the grievant if her performance was not "meeting the established performance standards[.]" Similarly, the Arbitrator found that, under Article 25, Section 7(A)(2), the Agency was required to counsel the grievant if it discovered any shortcomings in her performance. The Arbitrator found that the Agency had knowledge that the grievant's Target Language score could drop one level. The Arbitrator, accordingly, determined that the Agency should have counseled the grievant about her performance. He further concluded that, had the Agency counseled the grievant, she would have taken steps to improve her score.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the Union's grievance in part and denied it in part "[B]y way of reconstructing" what action the Agency would have taken but for its contractual violation, the Arbitrator cancelled the grievant's "[succeed]" score for the Teaching Language standard and ordered the Agency to raise it to an "[exceed]." Based on this change, the Arbitrator also ordered the Agency to raise the grievant's overall rating from a two to a one.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's award impermissibly affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, respectively. The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management-rights exceptions to arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F.

Furthermore, in setting forth the revised analysis, the Authority rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP. FDIC, S.F.

<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not dispute the Agency's assertion that the award affects management's right to direct employees and assign work under the Statute. We, therefore, assume that the award affects the foregoing rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SSA, </span>65 FLRA 339, 341 (2010). We next examine whether the award enforced properly negotiated provisions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the award is contrary to management's rights under the Statute because the Agency did not violate the parties' agreement. This is not the appropriate inquiry; rather, the Authority looks to whether the Arbitrator enforced properly negotiated contract provisions. <span class="Italic">E.g., EPA, </span>65 FLRA at 115. The Arbitrator found that Article 25, Sections 4 and 7(A)(2) are procedures and appropriate arrangements as defined in the Statute. The Agency does not dispute this conclusion. Moreover, as stated above, the Arbitrator's determination that the Agency violated the parties' agreement is not deficient. Accordingly, we find that the award enforces properly negotiated contractual provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency next argues that the award is deficient under <span class="Italic">BEP </span>because the Arbitrator failed to reconstruct what management would have done had it complied with the parties' agreement.

Moreover, Article 25, Sections 4 and 7(A)(2) are properly negotiated contract provisions. The Arbitrator's award enforces these provisions.

<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;As discussed below, because the Agency regulation is incorporated into the parties' agreement, we analyze whether the Arbitrator's interpretation of the Agency regulation fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The award does not abrogate management's rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving exceptions that contend that an award is contrary to a management right, the Authority first assesses whether the award affects the exercise of a right set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>) (Member Beck concurring). The Authority has consistently held that an arbitrator's cancellation of a grievant's performance rating affects the rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Exec. Office for Immigration Review, Bd. of Immigration Appeals</span>, 65 FLRA 657, 662 (2011); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Greensboro, N.C.</span>, 61 FLRA 103, 106 (2005). Therefore, as the Arbitrator cancelled the grievant's performance rating, we find that the award affects management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">If the award affects a management right, then the Authority examines whether the arbitrator was enforcing either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 104 (2010) (<span class="Italic">FDIC</span>) (Chairman Pope concurring). As relevant here, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right; and (2) if so, whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Prison Camp, Duluth, Minn.</span>, 65 FLRA 588, 590 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 11618) (applying &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) analysis when the agency argued that the award effectively abrogated management's rights). The Authority has previously described an award that abrogates the exercise of a management right as an award that precludes an agency from exercising the right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Agric., Farm Serv. Agency, Kansas City, Mo.</span>, 65 FLRA 483, 485 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Farm Serv.</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, we find that the Agency has failed to establish that the award abrogates the Agency's rights to direct employees and assign work. In this regard, the award does not preclude the Agency from evaluating its other employees under the performance standards, nor does it preclude the Agency from evaluating the grievant under any performance standards that are established in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Farm Serv.</span>, 65 FLRA at 485 (finding that the award did not abrogate management's rights to direct employees and assign work because it did not preclude the agency from evaluating employees). Further, although the Arbitrator cancelled the grievant's performance rating, he did not order the Agency to grant the grievant a higher rating, nor did he forbid the Agency from reevaluating the grievant under new performance standards. Because the award does not preclude the Agency from evaluating employees in all circumstances, the award does not abrogate management's rights to direct employees and assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 509, 515 (2011) (finding that, because the provisions only limited management's right to evaluate employees' performance in certain circumstances, it did not abrogate the right to direct employees or to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The Arbitrator's remedy is not deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also contends that the remedy is unreasonable, and that the "sole reasonably related remedy" would be to amend the start of the grievant's appraisal period. In <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, the Authority held that arbitrators no longer have to "reconstruct" what management would have done but for the violation of the parties' agreement. 65 FLRA at 106-07. A majority of the Authority determined that a party may only challenge a remedy on the grounds Congress established for review of arbitrators' awards, such as that the remedy awarded fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 107. Chairman Pope, in a concurring opinion, concluded that the remedy must also have a "reasonable relation" to the violated contract provision and the harm being remedied. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at<span class="Italic"> </span>112 (Concurring Opinion of Chairman Pope).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has not established that the remedy awarded is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute on any private-sector grounds.<span class="Italic"> </span>Here, the Agency argues that the remedy awarded fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement. In reviewing an arbitrator's interpretation of a collective-bargaining agreement, the Authority applies the deferential standard of review that federal courts use in reviewing arbitration awards in the private sector. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(a)(2); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 220</span>, 54 FLRA 156, 159 (1998). Under this standard, the Authority will find that an arbitration award is deficient as failing to draw its essence from the collective-bargaining agreement when the appealing party establishes that the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unfounded in reason and fact and so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the collective-bargaining agreement as to manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator; (3) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement; or (4) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Labor (OSHA)</span>, 34 FLRA 573, 575 (1990) (<span class="Italic">OSHA</span>). As the Agency concedes that the Agency regulation is incorporated into the parties' agreement, Exceptions at 8, the issue before us is whether the award draws its essence from the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, U.S. Army Aberdeen Proving Ground, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md.</span>, 49 FLRA 950, 953 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues the parties' agreement provides that performance standards will be in accordance with an Agency regulation, which sets the minimum appraisal period at 120 days. According to the Agency, because the grievant was given performance standards with more than 120 days left in the appraisal period, the Arbitrator's award evidenced a manifest disregard of the parties' agreement. However, the Arbitrator explicitly rejected the Agency's argument, instead finding that the minimum appraisal period was irrelevant because the grievant's appraisal period was 365 days. As a result, the Arbitrator concluded that the appropriate remedy was to cancel the grievant's performance rating in its entirety. The Agency has not established that the Arbitrator's chosen remedy--cancelling the grievant's rating rather than simply amending the start of the grievant's appraisal period--is an irrational or implausible interpretation of the parties' agreement as a whole. <span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 3955, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 65 FLRA 887, 891 (2011) (denying an essence exception because the Authority looks to the entire agreement in resolving essence exceptions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the award is not contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute and deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Wage &#x0026; Investment Div.</span>, 66 FLRA 235, 242 (2011) (finding that an award was not contrary to law because the agency did not establish that the relevant provisions of the parties' agreement were not appropriate arrangements).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Arbitrator did not exceed his authority.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority because he: (1) "disregarded the stipulated issue" when he cancelled the grievant's performance rating based on the timeliness of the Agency's issuance of the grievant's performance standards, a factor unrelated to the one presented to him; and (2) "failed to resolve" whether the grievant's performance rating should be elevated. Arbitrators exceed their authority when they fail to resolve an issue submitted to arbitration, resolve an issue not submitted to arbitration, disregard specific limitations on their authority, or award relief to those not encompassed within the grievance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1617</span>, 51 FLRA 1645, 1647 (1996). In determining whether an arbitrator has exceeded his or her authority, the Authority accords an arbitrator's interpretation of a stipulated issue the same substantial deference that it accords an arbitrator's interpretation and application of a collective-bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Info. Agency, Voice of Am.</span>, 55 FLRA 197, 198 (1999). Moreover, the Authority grants the arbitrator broad discretion to fashion a remedy that the arbitrator considers to be appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey, Nat'l Mapping Div., Mapping Applications Ctr.</span>, 55 FLRA 30, 33 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency has failed to establish that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority by disregarding the stipulated issue.&#x2003;The first issue before the Arbitrator was: "Did the [Agency] unfairly give [the grievant] a Level 4 rating on his...performance evaluation?" The Arbitrator directly addressed that question when he found that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by failing to give the grievant his performance standards within ten days and by failing to notify the grievant that his <span id="page_2319"></span>performance was unsatisfactory, as required by the parties' agreement. Further, he found that the violations rendered the grievant's performance rating "null and void." Although the Agency suggests that the timeliness of its issuance of the grievant's performance standards was not before the Arbitrator, the stipulated issue does not contain any specific factors that the Arbitrator could not consider. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Monongahela Nat'l Forest</span>, 64 FLRA 1126, 1130 (2010) (<span class="Italic">USDA</span>) (denying an exceeds-authority exception arguing that, because the grievance did not contain an issue, the arbitrator erred in considering it). Therefore, because the Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator disregarded the stipulated issue, we deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's contention that the Arbitrator failed to resolve the issue of whether the grievant's performance rating should be elevated is similarly without merit. The second stipulated issue was: "Should [the grievant's] evaluation be revised to an overall Level 3 rating?" The Arbitrator explicitly found that "the proper remedy...[was] <span class="Italic">not</span> to amend the evaluation by raising the overall rating to Level 3." Therefore, because the Arbitrator directly resolved the stipulated issue, we deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1804</span>, 66 FLRA 700, 702 (2012) (denying an exceeds-authority exception because the premise of the agency's exception, that the arbitrator failed to resolve a stipulated issue, was incorrect).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The award draws its essence from the parties' agreement.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the Arbitrator manifestly disregarded the parties' agreement because his award "abrogates the Agency's legal right to rate [the g]rievant." As stated above, an award draws its essence from the agreement unless the excepting party can establish that the award is irrational, unfounded, implausible, or in manifest disregard of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">OSHA</span>, 34 FLRA at 575.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency bases its exception on its belief that the award abrogates its rights to direct employees and assign work under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. However, as discussed above, the Agency has not shown that the award conflicts with its argued &#x00A7; 7106(a) rights to direct employees and assign work. Therefore, as it has not been shown that the award causes the Agency to relinquish any of its &#x00A7; 7106 rights, it cannot be said that the Arbitrator's award or interpretation of Article 28 is irrational, unfounded, implausible, or in manifest disregard of the agreement. As such, we find that the Agency has not shown that the award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement and deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. BOP, Fed. Corr. Inst., Marianna, Fla.</span>, 56 FLRA 467, 471 (2000) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 55 FLRA 6, 9 (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">OPM and AFGE Local 32</span>, 68 FLRA 1039, 1041-42 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting), concluded that nothing was amiss about an award directing a higher rating for an employee whose performance standards lacked objectivity:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If an award affects a management right, then the Authority examines whether the arbitrator was enforcing either a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b), or--as relevant here--an "applicable law," within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). The Authority has held that an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) includes not only statutes, but also the U.S. Constitution, judicial decisions, executive orders, and regulations having the force and effect of law.[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fed. Prof'l Nurses Ass'n, Local 2707</span>, 43 FLRA 385, 390 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Local 2707</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator was enforcing an "applicable law" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) when he found that the grievant's performance standards were invalid because they were not based on objective criteria. The Arbitrator applied the MSPB's decision in <span class="Italic">Greer</span> [<span class="Italic">Greer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 477, 483 (1998)]. Greer enforces the objectivity requirement for performance standards under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).[23] Section 4302(b)(1) requires that a performance appraisal system "shall provide for establishing performance standards which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria."[24] Thus, by relying on <span class="Italic">Greer</span> when he considered the validity of the grievant's performance standards, we find that the Arbitrator was enforcing &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1)'s objectivity requirement for those standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. DOL, Bureau of Labor Statistics</span>, 67 FLRA 77, 80 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[24]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the legal framework set forth above, the award and remedy are valid only if &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) constitutes an "applicable law" under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).[25] As mentioned previously, statutes are "applicable laws" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2).[26] Therefore, as the award is based on the Arbitrator's enforcement of an "applicable law," the Agency fails to establish that the award impermissibly affects its management rights to direct employees and assign work.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 2707</span>, 43 FLRA at 390.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that Arbitrator misapplied <span class="Italic">Greer</span>. Specifically, the Agency argues that the Arbitrator "did not identify a specific section, critical element, or particular wording of the [performance] standard[s] that he found to be unreasonable or unduly subjective."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's argument lacks merit. In applying <span class="Italic">Greer</span> to the grievant's performance standards, the Arbitrator concluded that "there was a disconnect between what [the Agency] thought [the g]rievant was doing and what, in fact, [the g]rievant did." The Arbitrator found that "once [the grievant] was reassigned to the manual aging reports...there was no degree of objectivity...in her [performance p]lan or performance standards" and the grievant's duties were not "specifically classified" in her performance plan. The Arbitrator explained, for example, "that [the grievant's supervisor] never clarified [for the grievant] how the [grievant's performance p]lan and [p]erformance [s]tandards would be considered after removing [the g]rievant from the intra/inter-agency agreements and reassigning her to do the manual aging reports." As noted above, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's underlying factual findings, unless the appealing party establishes that those factual findings are deficient as nonfacts.[32] The Agency does not argue that these underlying factual findings are nonfacts and, therefore, we defer to them.[33] Moreover, these factual findings are consistent with <span class="Italic">Greer's</span> enforcement of &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1)'s requirement that a performance-appraisal system "shall provide for establishing performance standards which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria."[34] The Agency does not address these arbitral findings or otherwise demonstrate that the award misapplies <span class="Italic">Greer</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[34]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find no support for the dissent's assertion that "no [independent] right exists" for an employee to grieve &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1)'s objectivity requirement under the negotiated grievance procedure. To the contrary, the legislative history of &#x00A7; 4302 indicates that its purpose was to require agencies to establish a "single interrelated framework for performance appraisals...[which] would be the basis for multiple personnel actions <span class="Italic">including promotions, pay increases</span>[,] <span class="Italic">and awards</span> as well as adverse actions."[36] Because Congress recognized the "inadequacies" and "potential for arbitrariness" in appraisal systems, one way it "sought to protect against those risks [was] by requiring objective performance criteria."[37] Here, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's appraisal, which determined her eligibility for a cash award, was invalid because her standards "did not permit the accurate appraisal of performance based on objective criteria," as required by &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">We also disagree with the dissent's claim that performance standards can be challenged under &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1) <span class="Italic">only</span> in conjunction with a removal or demotion action. The dissent may have been misled by focusing on MSPB and Federal Circuit cases dealing with employees' terminations or other adverse actions for performance reasons. But this "simply reflects the jurisdictional limitations on what sorts of cases can come before the MSPB and the Federal Circuit; it does not demonstrate that an inquiry by a third-party into the legal validity of performance standards can occur only in that context."[40] And the Authority has long held that "like the MSPB and the Federal Circuit, arbitrators have the power to consider whether performance standards comply with applicable legal requirements" under &#x00A7; 4302.[41] As the MSPB and the Federal Circuit do not, and cannot, consider promotions, pay actions, awards, or certain disciplinary actions, including suspensions of fourteen days or less, it is axiomatic that the resulting case law of these bodies only addresses challenges to performance appraisals under &#x00A7; 4302 that arise in the context of removals or demotions.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the dissent erroneously asserts that the Authority "abruptly changed direction" in 2012 when it upheld an arbitrator's finding that the agency violated &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1)'s objectivity requirement.[43] This statement misinterprets Authority precedent; all the cases that the dissent cites in support of this proposition are inapposite. Rather, if anything, the cases the dissent cites affirm the grievability of challenges to performance standards based on &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1)'s objectivity requirement.[44] Therefore, the dissent's assertion lacks merit.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator failed to specify the contract provision that he was enforcing and claims that its actions were consistent with section 15.06 of the parties' agreement. The Union responds that the award amounts to a finding that the appraisal was unlawful because it was based on the grievant's Union activities. However, a review of the award supports the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator failed to identify what contract provision, if any, he was enforcing. In addition, the Arbitrator did not identify any law that he was enforcing. In this connection, although the Arbitrator framed the issue in terms of the appraisal's consistency with "applicable law" and the "negotiated labor contracts/agreements[,]" he did not refer to any particular laws or contract provisions. Rather, the Arbitrator found the appraisal improper because it was based on "a personality clash" between the grievant and her supervisor. Moreover, even though the Agency claims the rating was consistent with section 15.06 of the parties' agreement, the Arbitrator did not refer to that provision and there is no indication that he relied on it as the basis for the award. As such, the record does not permit the Authority to apply the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>framework. Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to clarify what contract provision or applicable law the Arbitrator was enforcing, if any. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 FLRA at 310.</p>

And, applying that standard, the Arbitrator found that the rating official's narrative supporting the grievant's performance appraisal demonstrated that the grievant performed at an outstanding level for her second element."); <span class="Italic">cf.

We should not give arbitrators the power to issue a performance evaluation based on a few documents, particularly when there has been no allegation that the supervisor is either unwilling or unable to review the performance elements in light of the remedy.'). Member Abbott applauds the Arbitrator's requirement that the Agency determine the rating, instead of the Arbitrator determining the ratings based on his limited knowledge of employee performance obtained through the hearing or documentation.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite revisions in FLRA's approach to appraisal grievances since 1988, an arbitrator may not consider a challenge to the unacceptable performance rating of a probationer. That result, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Nellis AFB and AFGE Local 1199</span>, 46 FLRA 1323, 1326 (1993), explained, was essential to permit management the ability to terminate probationers without more protection than is granted to them by OPM regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">As a condition to a higher rating, <span class="Italic">BEP</span> required a linkage between the rating level, the management error, and a contract provision, statute, or implementing regulation. The arbitrator's award would not be sustained if the rating is revised because of an arbitrator's notion of fairness or equity not tethered to a contractual or statutory post, <span class="Italic">VAMC Northampton and NAGE Local R1-107</span>, 53 FLRA 1743, 1745-46 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In<span class="Italic"> BEP</span>, the Authority applied a two-prong test to determine whether an arbitration award that implicates management's rights set out in section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute is deficient as contrary to those rights. First, an arbitrator must be enforcing either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b). Second, the award must constitute a reconstruction of what management would have done had management acted properly. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 152-53.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency committed "defects" in the rating process, as discussed above, and failed to take into account the grievant's contributions with respect to the two elements where the Agency rated the grievant "fully successful." The Arbitrator did not explicitly link his findings with the Agency's violation of any law or provision of the parties' agreement, as required by prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Even if the "defect" were found to violate the contract or applicable law, there was no finding by the Arbitrator that the grievant's rating was affected by such a violation, as is required by prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> 53 FLRA at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Union's contention that the Arbitrator found a violation of the Article 25 requirement that the appraisal be objective. That contention is not supported by the language of the decision. The Arbitrator did not cite Article 25, and did not find that the Agency failed to make an objective evaluation of the grievant's performance. Instead, the Arbitrator stated that the issue was whether the grievant's appraisal was "reasonable, fair, consistent with past practice and free of procedural defects[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The award does not reveal a conclusion by the Arbitrator that the appraisal was not objective within the meaning of Article 25, Section 2. Accordingly, because the Arbitrator did not find a violation of a contract provision on a section 7106(b) matter, the award fails to satisfy prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">As to the link between the performance rating deficiency and the violation of a contract provision, <span class="Italic">VAMC Martinsburg and NAGE Local R4-78</span>, 51 FLRA 1287, 1289 (1996), pointed out:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her award, the Arbitrator quoted Article 5, Section 1 of the parties' agreement.[1] In canceling the grievant's rating, she specifically found that the grievant's supervisor had improperly relied on a complaint against him and had expressed annoyance at his union activities. Although the Arbitrator did not expressly rely on a violation of the collective bargaining agreement in canceling the grievant's rating, these findings could be construed as support for a violation of Article 5, Section 1 of the agreement, so as to raise uncertainty about the basis of the award. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 377, 382-83 (1990) (because many of the findings of the arbitrator closely paralleled alleged violations of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the award was remanded for the arbitrator to clarify whether any of the deficiencies he found constituted violations of the agreement). Accordingly, we remand the award to the parties for submission to the Arbitrator to have her clarify whether any of the deficiencies she found in management's appraisal of the grievant constituted violations of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_2321"></span>[1]&#x2003;Article 5, Section 1, provides that employees "will be treated in a fair, equitable and respectful manner without regard to politics, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or handicapping condition and with proper regard to individual privacy and all other rights under law."</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could direct reappraisal and set a minimum basis for the appraisal if it was established that the employee's appraisal should not fall below a level that management conceded that the employee achieved; the arbitrator could, without abrogating the right of management to assign work, enforce a contractual clause requiring a fair and equitable rating by directing that the rerating be conducted by a different individual than the supervisor whose first appraisal violated the agreement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2369 and DHHS, SSA</span>, 45 FLRA 124, 128-33 (1992). An arbitrator could direct that an agency revise a rating to the level suggested by the supervisor if the lower level chosen by the reviewer was unjustified. The award did not unduly interfere with the authority of a reviewing official to change a rating; the award required the exercise of that authority to be consistent with an employee's actual performance. <span class="Italic">USDA, Farm Serv. Agency and AFGE Local 3354</span>, 56 FLRA 679, 681 (2000). When an arbitrator determined that a grievant was rated lower because of an agency's violation of the parties' negotiated agreement, FLRA upheld the arbitrator's reinstatement of a prior performance appraisal. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. and IAM Dist. 160, Lodge 282</span>, 59 FLRA 763, 765 (2004); <span class="Italic">see Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 50</span>, 61 FLRA 103, 105 (2005) (award sustained that required rating to be increased to level of prior rating when agency did not provide contractually-required counseling concerning grievant's alleged performance deficiencies).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the basis for the rerating of the employee is a contract error in the rating process, the arbitrator must find that a higher rating would have occurred had the contract not been violated. The arbitrator's ruling on that point should not be conclusory. Under <span class="Italic">BEP</span> (53 FLRA 146 (1997)), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, there must be an explanation of the reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 58 FLRA 145, 147 (2002). An arbitrator's award requiring a grievant to be reappraised must contain the findings necessary to uphold the award. <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 35 FLRA 421, 430 (1990). <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1122</span>, 34 FLRA 323, 328-29 (1990), remanded an award for clarification:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Social Security Administration</span> [<span class="Italic">and AFGE</span>, 30 FLRA 1156 (1988)] establishes a two-prong test. First, an arbitrator must find that management has not applied the established standards or has applied them in violation of law, regulation, or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. If that finding is made, an arbitrator may cancel the grievant's performance appraisal or rating. Second, if the arbitrator is able to determine based on the record what the performance appraisal or rating would have been had management applied to the correct standard or if the violation had not occurred, the arbitrator may order management to grant that appraisal or rating. If the arbitrator is unable to determine what the grievant's rating would have been, he must remand the case to management for reevaluation. <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Indianapolis District and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 49</span>, 32 FLRA 335 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...If the Arbitrator found that the performance standard did not comply with applicable legal requirements, the appropriate remedy would be for the Arbitrator to direct the Agency to establish a plan which complies with applicable legal requirements in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302 and 5 C.F.R. Chapter 430. <span class="Italic">Newark Air Force Station and American Federation of Government Employees Local 2221</span>, 30 FLRA 616, 636 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Newark</span>). An arbitrator may not determine what the content of an employee's plan should be and may not establish new performance standards....</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of an award modified by FLRA for lack of a proper reconstruction of the remedy is <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 59 FLRA 14, 15 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an arbitrator cancels a performance rating and orders management to grant a specific performance rating, the arbitrator must base that remedy on a reconstruction of what the grievant's rating would have been if the agency had properly appraised the grievant. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 58 FLRA 145, 147 (2002) (Cabaniss dissenting) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Center, Martinsburg, W. Va.</span>, 52 FLRA 945, 948 (1997)) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>). Consistent with this requirement, an arbitrator must find that "the record support[s] raising the grievant's ratings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Defense, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah</span>, 54 FLRA 487, 492-93 (1998)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency asserts, and the Union does not dispute, that there is no GS-9 performance plan for the grievant's position. Without a valid performance plan for the grievant's position, the award raising the grievant's performance rating cannot reconstruct what management would have done had it used the proper performance plan. In this connection, applicable regulations require an agency to provide an employee with a "rating of record" that is "based on appraisal of performance on critical elements and, as applicable, non-critical elements[,]" as established in the performance plan. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(a) and (b). Thus, &#x00A7; 430.208 requires all ratings of record to be based upon an evaluation of an employee's actual job performance measured against the critical and non-critical performance elements identified in the applicable performance plan. As there was no applicable performance plan for the grievant's position in this case, the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an award raising a grievant's performance appraisal is found deficient, but the finding that the agency failed to properly appraise the grievant is left intact, the Authority's longstanding practice is to modify the award. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States DoD, Defense Logistics Agency, Defense Contract Mgmt. Command, Defense Contract Mgmt. Area Ops. Boston, Boston, Mass.</span>, 53 FLRA 210 (1997). Moreover, as the Agency points out, applicable regulations provide the appropriate remedy in this case. In particular, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.208(g) provides that "[w]hen a rating of record cannot be prepared at the time specified, the appraisal period shall be extended. Once the conditions necessary to complete a rating of record have been met, a rating of record shall be prepared as soon as practicable." Consistent with this regulation, we modify the award by striking the portions that direct the Agency to raise the grievant's performance rating and substituting the following: The Agency shall extend the grievant's appraisal period by 90 days and reevaluate her using the GS-9 performance plan. <span class="Italic">See Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals, Paducah, Ky.</span>, 58 FLRA 124 (2002) (modifying award consistent with parties' agreement, which provided the appropriate remedy) (Member Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">citing United States Dep't of HHS, Family Support Admin., Wash., D.C.</span>, 42 FLRA 347, 360 (1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent">That the agency contributed to a lower rating by violating a procedural requirement of a contract implementing the appraisal process did not permit the arbitrator to direct upgrading of the rating in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Martinsburg and NAGE Local R4-78</span>, 47 FLRA 797, 803-04 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had violated its regulation requiring it to inform the grievant of her level of performance at the mid-year progress review so that she could improve her performance to gain the level she had attained previously. The Arbitrator found, based on the record before him, that the grievant was not informed at the progress review that her performance at that point in the rating period in question would be rated lower than in the previous two rating periods, and that the failure to provide her with a clear delineation of what was expected of her with respect to the alleged deficiencies it later cited "flawed" her rating for the period in question. The Arbitrator also found that the regulation is "specifically designed to guarantee that an employee be informed specifically of his/her level of performance for rating purposes at least once during the appraisal period." The Agency has not established that the regulation requires such communication only when an employee's performance falls below the Fully Successful level. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that the award is inconsistent with the regulation. Accordingly, the exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By finding that performance standards were applied in violation of the applicable Agency regulation, the Arbitrator met the first prong of the test described in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>. However, the Arbitrator did not affirmatively find that the Agency would have rated the grievant any differently if it had met its obligation to inform her that she would probably be rated at a lower level than in previous years. In this regard, we reject the Union's contention that the Arbitrator made sufficient findings to raise the grievant's rating to "Outstanding." In support of its contention, the Union references testimony by the grievant and two co-workers that her performance was outstanding and that she had done more work than previously, presumably during periods when she had received an "Outstanding" rating. The Union also relies on a statement by the Arbitrator that the grievant "naturally thought that her performance continued to be outstanding because she was working as hard as ever." Contrary to the Union's position, these general statements of opinion by the grievant and her co-workers do not support a conclusion that the Arbitrator found that a different rating would have resulted if the Agency had informed the grievant of her perceived deficiencies. Rather, they merely reflect a difference of opinion between the Agency, on the one hand, and the grievant and two fellow workers, on the other hand, as to the quality of the grievant's performance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although notice of the Agency's view of her performance would have given the grievant an opportunity to improve, we find nothing in the Arbitrator's award to indicate that he determined, based on the record, what the grievant's rating would have been if the Agency had not violated the regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude, therefore, that the portion of the Arbitrator's award ordering the Agency to treat the grievant as if she had been rated "Outstanding" during the period in question is deficient because it is contrary to section 7106 (a) (2) (A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Ritchie</span>, <span id="page_2322"></span>43 FLRA at 972. Pursuant to our consistent precedent, the award will be modified to require that the Agency reevaluate the grievant to determine what her rating would have been had the Agency complied with its regulation. Thus, we reject the Union's contention that the matter should be remanded to the Arbitrator rather than to the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the arbitrator properly found an appraisal deficient but improperly directed that the rating be set at a specific level, FLRA could modify the award to require that the employee be rerated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 51 FLRA 379, 382 (1995) ("If the arbitrator is unable to determine what the rating would have been, he or she must remand the case to management for reevaluation."). An award was set aside in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Redstone Arsenal and AFGE Local 1858</span>, 58 FLRA 400, 404 (2003), when the arbitrator directed the continuation of a prior rating that could not have been extended because the rating system had changed since the prior rating was issued. The same case struck a portion of the arbitrator's award directing training when the contract provisions relied on by the arbitrator had nothing to do with training and could not have been interpreted by management to require training.</p>
<p class="noindent">For management to reappraise an employee, performance standards must be in place. FLRA set aside what amounted to a presumptive rating, <span class="Italic">DHHS, HRSA and NTEU</span>, 60 FLRA 118, 119-20 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a party challenges an arbitrator's cancellation of a performance rating and the arbitrator's substitution of a specific performance rating in its place, the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues only that the Arbitrator's remedy is deficient because it does not reflect a reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement. Accordingly, we assume prong I is met and address only whether the award is deficient under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Detention Ctr., Miami, Fla.</span>, 57 FLRA 677, 679 (2002);<span class="Italic"> United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr. Div., Keyport, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 884, 887 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority previously has held that where an arbitrator cancels a performance rating and orders management to grant a specific performance rating, the arbitrator must base that remedy on a reconstruction of what the grievant's rating would have been if the agency had properly appraised the grievant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio</span>, 58 FLRA 145, 147 (2002) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting on other grounds) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>). Consistent with this requirement, in order to raise a rating, an arbitrator must find that "the record support[s] raising the grievant's ratings." <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson</span>, 58 FLRA at 147 (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held, citing applicable government-wide regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 430, that in the absence of a "valid performance plan for the grievant's position, [an] award raising the grievant's performance rating cannot reconstruct what management would have done had it used the proper performance plan." <span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command</span>, 59 FLRA at 15. As relevant here, the Authority stated that "&#x00A7; 430.208 requires all ratings of record to be based upon an evaluation of an employee's actual job performance measured against the critical and non-critical performance elements identified in the applicable performance plan." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator did not state, and the record does not otherwise indicate, that the award reinstating the grievant's previous higher rating was based on a finding by the Arbitrator as to how the Agency would have rated the grievant's performance had it not violated the parties' agreement. Indeed, based on the finding that a valid performance plan was not given to the grievant until <span class="Italic">after</span> the appraisal period had ended, it would not have been possible for the Arbitrator to rate the grievant's performance against the established standards and elements. Moreover, the Arbitrator specifically stated that he was unable to determine what the grievant's rating would have been if the correct standard had been applied; the Arbitrator simply reinstated the grievant's prior rating of record based on what the Arbitrator viewed to be "the fair remedy...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority precedent, we find that the Arbitrator's award reinstating the grievant's previous rating does not reflect a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the parties' agreement. Consequently, we find the remedy portion of the award deficient. <span class="Italic">See Wright-Patterson</span>, 58 FLRA at 147.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, an award raising a grievant's performance appraisal is found deficient, but the finding that the agency failed to properly appraise the grievant is left intact, the Authority's longstanding practice is to modify the award to provide for an appropriate remedy. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Air Force Materiel Command, </span>59 FLRA at 15; <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def.

In this case, we modify the award to strike the portions that direct the Agency to rescind the grievant's rating of fully successful and to reinstate the grievant's previous rating of excellent.

<p class="noindent">Considering some older decisions, an arbitrator could resolve a grievance by an employee who believed that he was adversely affected by management's application of performance standards in a performance appraisal to that particular employee. In judging management's application of standards and elements to a grievant, an arbitrator could determine that management had not applied to a grievant the elements and standards it established or applied those (or other elements and standards) in violation of law, regulation, or an appropriate, agreed-upon general, nonquantitative review criterion. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Dept. of Treasury and Washington Plate Printers Union, Local No. 2</span>, 20 FLRA 380, 382-83 (1985). But the arbitrator's determination that the evaluation was arbitrary did not support an arbitrator's award of a higher rating. <span class="Italic">Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-106</span>, 33 FLRA 391, 395 (1988). An arbitrator could not reassess a rating on his notions of what is fair. The arbitrator was required to determine if management had not applied the established elements and standards or if management had applied those elements and standards in violation of law, regulation, or a properly negotiated provision of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 31 FLRA 1277, 1280 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE</span>, 31 FLRA 1277, 1280 (1988) ("The Arbitrator did not find that the existing standards were applied to the grievant in violation of law, regulation, or the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Instead, the Arbitrator directed the Activity to raise the grievant's performance appraisal ratings for the two disputed GJTs based only on his finding of what would have been a 'fair' evaluation.").</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not direct a higher appraisal without evidence that justifies a finding that a standard was met at a higher level. If she determines that the rating of the employee was improper, but that the evidence of record does not prove entitlement to a higher rating, the remedy is for the arbitrator to direct the employer to rerate the employee. <span class="Italic">Ogden Air Logistics Ctr. and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 31 FLRA 872, 875 (1988). Through 1987, FLRA determined that if management did not properly apply standards, the arbitrator could sustain a grievance and direct that the grievant's work product be granted the rating the employee deserved under the standards and elements established by management or be reevaluated by management utilizing those standards and elements. FLRA cautioned that an arbitrator could not substitute his or her judgment for that of the agency as to the appropriateness of elements and standards established by management. An arbitrator could not conduct an independent evaluation of an employee's performance under the elements and standards established by management and substitute his or her judgment as to what should be that employee's performance evaluation and rating. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing, Dept. of Treasury and Washington Plate Printers Union, Local No. 2</span>, 20 FLRA 380, 381 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 25 FLRA 513, 516 (1987) (after rejecting appraisal, arbitrator improperly substituted "his judgment for that of management as to what constituted the proper application and weight to be given various job elements").

Rucker and AFGE Local 1815</span>, 28 FLRA 866, 867-68 (1987).

The award is ambiguous as to whether the Arbitrator found that management applied the established elements and standards to the grievant in violation of provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement."). FLRA will not, on exceptions by the union, set aside an award interpreting standards if nothing in the record demonstrates, under MSPB case law, that a standard as applied was unreasonable, unattainable, or unrealistic. <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Personnel, St. Louis and AFGE Local 900</span>, 35 FLRA 1200, 1204 (1990).

<p class="noindent">An arbitrator's determination that the agency committed a procedural violation, e.g., that the agency failed to provide midterm evaluations or counseling to an employee, did not supply a basis to adjust the appraisal level; no finding was made of what the rating would have been had the error not occurred. The remedy that should be directed is reevaluation of the employee. <span class="Italic">SSA, Hq.

If from the arbitrator's award it appears that the arbitrator has considered some inappropriate factor that contributed to a directive to the agency to raise a rating, and if it is not clear what result would have been reached absent the error, FLRA may remand the case to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator for clarification. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, Admin. for Children and Families and NTEU Chap. 250</span>, 46 FLRA 1107, 1113-14 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator was not required to follow a particular standard of proof to determine whether established elements and standards were properly applied. The arbitrator properly considered whether there was a clear showing that the grievant's supervisor acted in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Falls Church and AFGE Local 3615</span>, 48 FLRA 562, 564 (1993). FLRA partially set aside one award adjusting an appraisal when the it concluded that the arbitrator made no finding of a violation of law, rule, or contract provision, and when the arbitrator did not discuss the appraisals. It was insufficient for the arbitrator to direct a change in the appraisals based on concerns about fairness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 645 Mission Support Squadron, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Local 1138</span>, 48 FLRA 955, 957 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator was not required to strike an appraisal because an employee was denied the opportunity to discuss the applicable standards with his supervisor, <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45 and DCA, Langley AFB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v55/55-134.html">55 FLRA 789</a>, 789, 792-93 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the original award, the Arbitrator sustained, in part, and denied, in part, a grievance challenging the appraisal of a grievant. The Arbitrator concluded that the Agency had applied its performance appraisal system in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, but had rated the grievant properly. However, the Arbitrator did not provide a remedy for the violation of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in an amended award, the Arbitrator provided a remedy. The Arbitrator ordered the Agency to comply with the collective bargaining by discussing and preparing with the grievant and other sales store checkers performance plans to be used on an objective basis for overall summary ratings of "excellent" and "outstanding." The Arbitrator required that this discussion occur with the assistance of the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's reliance on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor</span> [46 FLRA 3 (1992)] is misplaced. In that case, an arbitrator determined that a standard for one element had not been developed with required input from one employee, and the arbitrator ordered that the rating on that one element be deleted. Although the Authority denied the agency exception to the remedy fashioned by the arbitrator, it did not state or imply that such remedy was the only one permissible under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c). Similarly, the Union has not demonstrated that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(a) or 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.204(c) obligated the Arbitrator to provide a remedy in the original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently ruled that arbitrators have great latitude in fashioning remedies.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Center, Kelly Air Force Base, Texas and American Federation</span> <span class="Italic">of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">Local 1617,</span> 51 FLRA 1624, 1631 (1996).

The fact that an arbitrator ordered the appraisal to be changed in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Labor</span> does not mandate such a result in this case, particularly in light of the Arbitrator's specific findings that the grievant did not exceed the rating standard. The Union's contention constitutes an attempt to substitute another remedy for that formulated by the Arbitrator. Therefore, the Union's exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">An example of analysis of an appraisal by an arbitrator and FLRA is <span class="Italic">EEOC and AFGE Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals, Local 216</span>, 43 FLRA 131, 131-44 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A grievance was filed challenging the grievant's performance ratings. The Arbitrator sustained the grievance in part and ordered the Agency to change the grievant's rating for Critical Element III from Marginal to Fully Successful and to raise the grievant's overall performance rating from Marginal to Fully Successful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we conclude that the Agency's exceptions provide no basis for finding the award deficient. Accordingly, we will deny the exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is a GS-12 Investigator at the Agency's Philadelphia District office. The grievant has served in various union positions since 1984, including First Vice President of the Union. In 1988, the grievant was elected President of the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 14, 1989, Eugene Weaver, the grievant's supervisor from November 1987 to June 23, 1989, issued the grievant a mid-year progress review which noted problems with the grievant's performance on Critical Element II, but which stated that "[a]t this point in the rating period your overall performance is in the fully successful area."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the appraisal period from February 13, 1989, to September 30, 1989, the grievant received a rating of Marginal for Critical Element I, a rating of Highly Effective for Critical Element II, and a rating of Marginal for Critical Element III. Pursuant to the guidelines for determining the overall performance rating, the grievant received an overall rating of Marginal because "[m]ore than one critical element [was] rated 'Marginal.'" The grievant's supervisor from June 26, 1989, through the remainder of the appraisal period, Howard Gurmankin, attached a narrative to the grievant's appraisal explaining the individual ratings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of a Marginal rating for Critical Element I (Quality Case Development), Gurmankin's narrative cited: (1) examples of case submissions "contain[ing] substantive omissions or deficiencies"; (2) cases where the grievant used "inappropriate or ineffective investigative methods or techniques"; and (3) instances indicating that "inordinate supervisory input [was] sometimes required to ensure the completeness and thoroughness of work products which often lack clarity, conciseness and/or organization."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of a Highly Effective rating for Critical Element II (Operational Efficiency), the narrative stated in part that "several of [the grievant's] closures of potential 270-day old charges were due either to direct supervisory effort...or as the result of inordinately close supervision[.]" The narrative stated further that "the grievant's meeting of case management goals was marginal at 87%, or 20 goals met out of 23 assigned."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of a Marginal Rating for Critical Element III (Effective Working Relationships), the narrative cited three cases involving "extremely inappropriate handling of certain situations, based on the statements made by the grievant to charging party attorneys." The narrative also cited instances where the grievant "became impatient with an uncooperative party" and on occasion "defer[red] her charge processing responsibility to the supervisor." Gurmankin's narrative further stated that the grievant's processing of her caseload "does not manifest the ability to anticipate and deal with problems that would be particularly expected of a GS-12" and "at times [the grievant] prefer[s] to allow the supervisor to handle problem situations rather than taking the initiative [her]self." Moreover, the narrative indicated that the grievant "frequently will not make a decision or recommendation on a case" and that, as a result, cases "will sit for long periods of time." The narrative concluded that "inordinately close supervision has been needed to have [the grievant] process and resolve charges in [her] caseload."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance challenging the grievant's performance ratings in each of the three Critical Elements. The parties were unable to resolve the grievance and the matter was submitted to arbitration. The parties stipulated to the following issue before the Arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"Whether the evaluation for the appraisal period was in compliance with Article 22 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) and was a fair, accurate and objective evaluation of job performance as required by Article 22 and the 'Investigator Guide for GPAR [General Performance Appraisal and Recognition System] Appraisals.' This includes retaliation as appropriate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2324"></span>The Arbitrator noted the Union's contentions that management: (1) applied subjective standards and illegal case management goals to the grievant; (2) applied the performance standards in violation of law, regulation, and the parties' agreement; (3) subjected the grievant to standards of performance not required of other employees; and (4) harassed and criticized the grievant's work because of her Union activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that: (1) the Union had not shown that management applied illegal case management goals to the grievant; (2) the lack of a summary rating by Weaver for the period that he supervised the grievant and the lack of a meeting with the grievant and Gurmankin to discuss the grievant's final appraisal do "not <span class="Italic">per se</span> constitute harmful error in this case"; and (3) with respect to Critical Element II, the Union made no showing of disparate treatment in the application of the standard for 270-day old cases to the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether the grievant's ratings were fair, accurate and objective or whether the ratings were "issued in retaliation for her Union activities[,]" the Arbitrator found that the ratings for Critical Elements I and II were fair, accurate and objective.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to Critical Element III, however, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's rating of Marginal "was not fair, accurate and objective[.]" The Arbitrator noted that the grievant was rated Marginal under the performance standards in Critical Element III for the following criteria: (1) anticipating problems, apprising the supervisor, and suggesting solutions; and (2) dealings with the public, other Government agencies, and coworkers.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, with respect to the grievant's performance in anticipating problems, apprising the supervisor, and suggesting solutions, the Arbitrator found that neither Gurmankin nor Weaver discussed with the grievant her referral to the supervisor of phone calls and other work in certain cases. As these "asserted deficienc[ies]" were not discussed with the grievant during the rating period, the Arbitrator found there was "no basis to support [either] the characterization of 'frequently' deficient" in the narrative to this portion of the grievant's rating for Critical Element III or "the characterization of 'sometimes' used in the marginal standard for Critical Element III." Further, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's argument that deficiencies noted in the grievant's appraisal under the Quality Case Development Standard of Critical Element I should be considered in connection with the part of Critical Element III relating to whether an employee anticipates problems, apprises the supervisor, and suggests solutions. The Arbitrator stated that he would not consider the deficiencies noted in the appraisal's discussion of Critical Element I in connection with Critical Element III because his "arbitral charter is to review the rating official's rationale and examples in reaching his rating determination[.]" Based on his review of the rating official's rationale for his rating on this portion of Critical Element III, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's rating on this portion of Critical Element III should have been Fully Successful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, with respect to the grievant's dealings with the public, other Government agencies, and coworkers, the Arbitrator examined two instances cited by the Agency to support the grievant's Marginal rating for this portion of Critical Element III. In those cases, the Agency argued that, during an audit of all of the cases assigned to all investigators, "the grievant stated that the cases had not been closed because of comparable worth issues." The Agency further argued that when the charging party's attorney in those cases requested an extension to reply to an employer action, "the grievant referred the attorney to the District Director." With respect to whether the grievant referred the attorney in those cases to the District Director, the Arbitrator stated that he was "inclined to credit" management testimony that all employees had been informed of the policy against involving the District Director in an investigator's cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, as to the comparable worth questions, the Arbitrator found that although the two cases had been in the grievant's inventory for 6 years, "the record reflects that management had discussed the progress of the case[s] with the grievant only once" during the six-year period. The Arbitrator noted that Weaver had approved the grievant's actions on the cases as late as June of 1989, and concluded that "supervision had acquiesced in the grievant's handling of the case[s.]" The Arbitrator found that "[m]anagement cannot fairly hold the grievant accountable for case processing decisions made in a period prior to (and even during) the appraisal period which had been approved by her supervisor." For that reason, the Arbitrator concluded that the grievant's performance in the two cases involving comparable worth questions "primarily reflects a lack of supervision[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also examined an inappropriate statement allegedly made by the grievant to a charging party's attorney. The Arbitrator noted that there was conflicting testimony on whether the grievant actually made the statement and determined that he would "not render a finding on this matter[,]" except to state that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">the circumstances surrounding the processing of this charge embody all that is awry in the relationship between [the grievant], as an Investigator and Local President, and District Office management.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on his review of all of Gurmankin's comments under Critical Element III, the Arbitrator found "unpersuasive the Agency's assertion that it is not possible to support a rating above Marginal for this critical element." Moreover, the Arbitrator noted that for the grievant's 8-month appraisal period, "[f]ive of the months were evaluated Fully Successful in a progress review" completed by Weaver and considered by Gurmankin "as the summary rating." Although the progress review "reflected some problems under Critical Element II," the Arbitrator noted that "there was no indication of concern with the grievant's performance under the two other critical elements."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator then examined "the grievant's high level of Union activity in 1989" and found that several of management's actions in attempting to deal with the grievant's performance "were taken as a summary response to the grievant's Union activity[.]" The Arbitrator noted that, in connection with a review of office production standards on April 28, 1989, Gurmankin's immediate supervisor "cite[d] the grievant's use of Union time as a factor in her unit's productivity shortfall." The Arbitrator also noted that Gurmankin had denied the grievant's requests for official time because "he determined that her agreed[-]upon case management goals should take precedence over her Union business." Further, the Arbitrator found that, although Gurmankin had not reviewed the grievant's cases with Weaver, Gurmankin required the grievant to discuss her caseload weekly rather than monthly because "of the difficulty in projecting the amount of official time she would require for Union business[.]" Finally, the Arbitrator noted that, in violation of the contract, Gurmankin failed to discuss an acceptable level of performance with the grievant at the outset of his assignment as the grievant's supervisor and at the conclusion of the appraisal period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on all of the above findings, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's rating of Marginal for Critical Element III "was not fair, accurate and objective" and that "it should be changed to Fully Successful." The Arbitrator noted that with this change, more than one half of the grievant's ratings for critical elements are Fully Successful or higher and no more than one rating is Marginal. The Arbitrator concluded that "the grievant's overall performance rating qualifies for the Fully Successful level as described in the Investigator GPAR." Accordingly, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to change the grievant's overall performance rating for Fiscal Year (FY) 1989 to Fully Successful and to change all Agency records to reflect the new rating.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed two exceptions to the Arbitrator's award. First, the Agency contends that the award is contrary to law because the grievant's rating cannot be set aside on the basis of the Arbitrator's finding of retaliation. The Agency notes that under <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 30 FLRA 1156 (1988) (<span class="Italic">SSA I</span>), an arbitrator is without authority to set aside a performance rating unless the arbitrator</p>
<p class="noindent-2">first finds that the [a]gency has not properly applied the established performance elements and standards to the [g]rievant's performance or that the [a]gency has applied the elements and standards in violation of law, regulation or the parties' [collective bargaining agreement].</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the Agency, the Arbitrator's finding of retaliation "is not legally sufficient to set aside the rating received by the [g]rievant" because the Arbitrator did not find that there was "a causal connection between the [grievant's] protected activity and the adverse determination" by the Agency or that "a retaliatory motive on the part of Gurmankin was a significant or substantial factor in the [grievant's] performance rating."...&#8197;<span class="Italic">Ireland v. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration</span>, 34 MSPR 614 (1987) (<span class="Italic">HHS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its second exception, the Agency argues that, under <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1122</span>, 34 FLRA 323 (1990) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span> <span class="Italic">II</span>), the Arbitrator had no authority to require the Agency to raise the grievant's rating. The Agency contends that the Arbitrator "made no findings[,]" and "there is no evidence in the record[,]" to support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant should have been rated at the Fully Successful level. The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator "makes no affirmative finding that the [g]rievant actually performed at the Fully Successful level while under Gurmankin's supervision." The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant performed at the Fully Successful level for over half of the rating period and argues that the Arbitrator's finding "constitutes a non-fact" because Weaver stated in his progress review that the grievant's performance was "<span class="Italic">not</span> [&#8197;] Fully Successful, but [was] 'in the Fully Successful <span class="Italic">area</span>.'" Moreover, the Agency maintains that the Arbitrator cannot reasonably rely on Weaver's summary observations as a basis for concluding that the [g]rievant <span id="page_2325"></span>actually performed at the Fully Successful level in Element III because Weaver was relieved of his supervisory duties when the Director had concerns regarding the quality of Weaver's performance as a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA I</span>, the Authority reexamined the remedial authority of arbitrators in performance appraisal matters. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, the Authority described <span class="Italic">SSA I</span> as "establish[ing] a two-prong test":</p>
<p class="noindent-2">First, an arbitrator must find that management has not applied the established standards or has applied them in violation of law, regulation, or a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. If that finding is made, an arbitrator may cancel the grievant's performance appraisal or rating. Second, if the arbitrator is able to determine based on the record what the performance appraisal or rating would have been had management applied the correct standard or if the violation had not occurred, the arbitrator may order management to grant that appraisal rating. If the arbitrator is unable to determine what the grievant's rating would have been, he must remand the case to management for reevaluation.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator noted that Article 22 of the parties' agreement requires that performance appraisals be "fair, accurate and objective" and concluded that the grievant's rating of Marginal for Critical Element III "was not fair, accurate and objective[.]" In reaching this conclusion, the Arbitrator examined the grounds set forth in Gurmankin's narrative to support the Marginal rating. With respect to the portion of Critical Element III on anticipating problems, apprising the supervisor and suggesting solutions, the Arbitrator found that the supervisors never discussed with the grievant the deficiencies noted in the narrative. Therefore, the Arbitrator found no basis in the narrative to support the grievant's rating of Marginal on that portion of Critical Element III.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the portion of Critical Element III on dealings with the public, other Government agencies, and co-workers, the Arbitrator found that "supervision had acquiesced in the grievant's handling of the case[s]" cited in the narrative as deficient and that, therefore, "[m]anagement cannot fairly hold the grievant accountable for case processing decisions...which had been approved by her supervisor."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's conclusion that the grievant's rating of Marginal for Critical Element III "was not fair, accurate and objective" constitutes a determination that the Agency applied the established standards in violation of Article 22 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. An arbitrator may cancel a performance rating if the arbitrator determines that "management has not applied the established standards or has applied them in violation of law, regulation, or a provision" in a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 34 FLRA at 328. As the Arbitrator found that management applied the performance standard for Critical Element III in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly cancelled the grievant's Marginal rating for Critical Element III. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Mid-America Program Service Center, Kansas City, Missouri and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1336</span>, 38 FLRA 544 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the Agency's argument that, under <span class="Italic">SSA I</span>, the grievant's rating cannot be set aside on the basis of retaliation because the Arbitrator's finding of retaliation "is not legally sufficient to set aside the rating[.]" For the reasons stated below, this argument provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">HHS</span> [<span class="Italic">Ireland v. DHHS, SSA</span>, 34 MSPR 614 (1987)], the Merit Systems Protection Board discussed the standard for finding that an agency retaliated against an employee in violation of law, specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). However, based on the Arbitrator's findings noted above, we found that the award may be sustained under the first prong of the test set forth in <span class="Italic">SSA I</span> because the Arbitrator found that management applied the performance standard for Critical Element III in violation of Article 22 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As the award finds that the Agency applied the established performance standard in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, as opposed to finding that the Agency applied the standard in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 or any other law, we conclude that the Agency's argument that the Arbitrator's finding of retaliation "is not legally sufficient" under <span class="Italic">HHS</span> is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">The Award Satisfies the Second Prong of the Test Established in SSA I</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second prong of the <span class="Italic">SSA I</span> test, the Arbitrator noted that Weaver's progress review covering the first 5 months of the grievant's 8-month appraisal period indicated that the grievant's performance for that period was "evaluated Fully Successful[.]" While the progress review "reflected some problems under Critical Element II," the Arbitrator found that "there was no indication of concern with the grievant's performance under the two other critical elements."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the portion of Critical Element III on anticipating problems, apprising the supervisor, and suggesting solutions, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's rating "should have been Fully Successful" because Gurmankin's narrative provided "no basis to support" the grievant's rating of Marginal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the portion of Critical Element III on the grievant's dealings with the public, other Government agencies, and coworkers, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's handling of the comparable worth cases noted in Gurmankin's narrative "had been approved by her supervisor." Rather than finding that the cases supported the grievant's Marginal rating, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's performance on those cases "primarily reflect[ed] a lack of supervision[.]" The Arbitrator also examined an inappropriate statement allegedly made by the grievant and mentioned in Gurmankin's narrative. The Arbitrator noted that there was conflicting testimony on whether the grievant actually made the statement and determined that he would "not render a finding" on the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on his review of all of Gurmankin's comments under Critical Element III, the Arbitrator found "unpersuasive the Agency's assertion that it is not possible to support a rating above Marginal for this critical element."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant would have received a rating of Fully Successful for Critical Element III if the Agency had not violated Article 22 of the parties' agreement. That is, the Arbitrator determined what the grievant's rating "would have been...if the violation had not occurred[.]" <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, 34 FLRA at 328. In particular, the Arbitrator noted that for the first 5 months of the grievant's 8-month appraisal period, the grievant's performance had been evaluated Fully Successful and there were no problems mentioned with respect to Critical Element III. Further, the Arbitrator noted that Gurmankin supervised the grievant for the remaining 3 months of the appraisal period, but the Arbitrator rejected the grounds cited in Gurmankin's narrative to support the grievant's Marginal rating for Critical Element III. As the Arbitrator rejected the grounds used by Gurmankin to support the grievant's Marginal rating for Critical Element III, and as the Arbitrator noted that the grievant had been performing at the Fully Successful level for over half of the rating period, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's rating for Critical Element III should have been Fully Successful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on these findings, we conclude that the Arbitrator properly directed the Agency to grant the grievant a rating of Fully Successful for Critical Element III. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1168</span>, 41 FLRA 250, 254 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>) (arbitration award which found that the agency failed to state "any rationale" for its decision to lower the grievants' ratings satisfied the second prong of the test).</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator must apply the performance standards as management issues them; the arbitrator is not free to assess the employee under other, more favorable standards that the arbitrator decides should have been used. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Jackson and NFFE Local 589</span>, 46 FLRA 1638, 1645 (1993) (arbitrator could not order reevaluation on basis of equitable argument that agency should have defined level of performance for "exceptional" rating rather than establishing, as it could by law, standard that only defined fully successful performance level); <span class="Italic">VA, Olin Teague Med. Ctr. and AFGE Local 2109</span>, 41 FLRA 649, 652-53 (1991) (award set aside when arbitrator directed rating be raised because ratings of other employees were inflated); <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1228</span>, 31 FLRA 1271, 1275 (1988) ("[I]f an arbitrator were to find that a grievant's performance plan did not comply with applicable requirements, the appropriate remedy would be for the arbitrator to direct the agency to establish a plan which complies with applicable legal requirements.").</p>
<p class="noindent">If the agency uses multiple elements or standards, the arbitrator must apply those standards and not depend upon performance goals of the arbitrator's creation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot and NAGE Local R14-52</span>, 45 FLRA 626, 629 (1992). If the agency regulations call for a certain number of standards to be at a given level to obtain a particular overall rating, the arbitrator may not deviate from the regulation: an award will be set aside that directs a higher rating when the employee has not achieved the required level of rating for the requisite number of standards or critical elements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 46 FLRA 377, 380 (1992). If the appraisal is deficient, the arbitrator may not require the agency to substitute a prior rating of record without an independent analysis of what the grievant's performance level should have been. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 237, 240 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Martinsburg and NAGE Local R4-78</span>, 52 FLRA 945, 949 (1997) (arbitrator could set aside appraisal for procedural violations, but arbitrator could not order agency to issue "highly successful" rating based on agency's failure to document shortcomings or produce evidence justifying reduction of grievant's performance rating from prior years); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Ritchie and NFFE Local 115</span>, 43 FLRA 968, 972 (1992) (arbitrator improperly directed appraisal be raised for failure to counsel grievant concerning performance), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds,</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and NTEU</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v53/53-021.html">53 FLRA 146</a> (1997); <span class="Italic">DHHS, <span id="page_2326"></span>SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 1303, 1306 (1990) (arbitrator improperly directed agency to carry forward grievant's rating from prior period when award was not based on determination by arbitrator of what rating would have been had grievant been properly rated).</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may not avoid the necessity of reappraising a grievant by directing that the agency issue a rating of "not applicable" for various critical elements because of difficulties in the reappraisal process. If the arbitrator cannot properly assign a rating and a given supervisor is also incapable of providing an appraisal, the arbitrator may direct the agency to have a different supervisor provide the rating, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 48 FLRA 1030, 1035-37 (1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator failed either to determine what the ratings should have been on the three critical elements or to direct the Agency to reevaluate the grievant's performance on those elements. Instead, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to assign a designation indicating that three GJTs were "not applicable." Although both parties acknowledge that use of such a designation is appropriate when an employee has not had a sufficient opportunity to demonstrate performance on a GJT, no such circumstances exist here. Rather, it is undisputed that the grievant had an opportunity to demonstrate performance on those GJTs and, in fact, was rated on the corresponding critical elements by the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in <span class="Italic">SSA II</span> permits an arbitrator essentially to ignore critical elements and a grievant's performance on GJTs where, as here, the grievant was afforded an opportunity to perform duties encompassed by the disputed critical GJTs and, therefore, could have been rated under established critical elements. Consequently, we find that the portion of the award directing the Agency to assign the grievant a rating of "N" on GJTs 24, 40, and 112 is deficient because it conflicts with management's rights to direct employees and assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute, and we will set it aside. To the extent the Arbitrator's further order directing the Agency to assign a summary rating based on the remaining non-critical elements is tied to the "N" rating, we find that that portion of the award must also be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Ordinarily, when an arbitrator has directed a remedy that is inconsistent with the second prong of <span class="Italic">SSA II</span>, we set aside the unlawful portion of the award and modify the award to direct the agency to reevaluate the grievant....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, we find that an order setting aside the "N" designation and directing the Agency to reevaluate the grievant would not suffice. In this regard, we note that the grievance in this case resulted from the supervisor's reappraisal of the grievant following a prior arbitration award in which the arbitrator found that that supervisor violated law and the parties' agreement in evaluating the grievant. Thus, the supervisor has had two opportunities to rate the grievant and, in both instances, was found to have violated law and the parties' agreement. Under these circumstances, and noting particularly Arbitrator Vaughn's finding that this supervisor "was unable...to conduct a proper review [of the grievant's performance,]," we find that it is appropriate to remand this case to the parties for resubmission to Arbitrator Vaughn with instructions that Arbitrator Vaughn determine, based on the record, what the grievant's rating should be....&#8197;Further, we find no circumstances in this case that would preclude the Arbitrator from exercising his discretion to reopen the record to enable the parties to submit the documentation on which the Arbitrator can determine the grievant's rating....&#8197;If the record does not permit such a determination, and the Arbitrator chooses not to reopen the record, Arbitrator Vaughn may direct the Agency to have a different supervisor rate the grievant....</p>
<p class="noindent">If an arbitrator improperly avoided reconstructing an appraisal, FLRA could direct the agency to reevaluate the employee, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Kansas City and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 51 FLRA 725, 729-30 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">SSA I</span> and <span class="Italic">II</span>, an arbitrator must base a remedy substituting a performance appraisal for that of management on a reconstruction of what the grievant's rating would have been had the agency properly applied the established performance standards. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592</span>, 51 FLRA 379, 382 (1995). In this case, the Arbitrator substituted the grievant's prior appraisal without making such a determination. Therefore, the remedy is not based on a reconstruction and is deficient as contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 237, 240 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an arbitrator has properly canceled a performance appraisal, but has failed to base a substituted rating on a reconstruction of what the grievant's rating would have been if the agency had properly appraised the grievant, we order management to properly reappraise the grievant. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the Agency does not contest the cancellation of the grievant's disputed appraisal, we modify the award to require the Agency to properly reevaluate the grievant in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the arbitrator properly interprets a standard and data used in an appraisal and then orders the agency to raise the rating, the award will be sustained. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Camp Stanley Storage Activity and AFGE Local 3961</span>, 48 FLRA 672, 678 (1993) (arbitrator could direct issuance of exceptional rating when management could not justify reappraisal of grievant and lowering rating); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Hq., XVIII Airborne Corps and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 36 FLRA 414, 417 (1990) (sustaining award raising rating of particular critical element and of overall performance appraisal based on evidence of performance supporting grievant and rejecting contrary evidence from agency). If the arbitrator determines that the employee was improperly rated, the arbitrator must at least direct the agency to reappraise the grievant. The arbitrator may not decline that direction on the theory that a remand "would produce no useful result." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 45 FLRA 631, 638 (1992) (modifying award to direct reappraisal); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1336</span>, 51 FLRA 725, 729-30 (1996), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1913</span>, 48 FLRA 406, 409 (1993) (rejecting union argument that "any reevaluation would be fictional").</p>
<p class="noindent">In most decisions favoring grievants on challenges to appraisals, the arbitrator either directs the agency to reevaluate the grievant or raise the level of the appraisal. If an arbitrator decides that the grievant's appraisal should be raised, nothing precludes the arbitrator from also directing the agency to recognize the grievant in a manner consistent with other employees who received a similar rating. If that recognition amounts to a performance award, that result is consistent with the arbitrator's remedial authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923 and DHHS, SSA, Philadelphia</span>, 48 FLRA 1131, 1138 (1993). FLRA sustained an award determining that an employee was improperly placed on a PIP and directing the agency to cancel the employee's rating, to reevaluate the grievant after informing him of the requirements of the revised performance plan, and to provide him with appropriate training. <span class="Italic">GSA and AFGE Council 236</span>, 47 FLRA 1326, 1330-31 (1993). Under 5 CFR 430.205(a) (2022), performance appraisal systems are to provide for the preparation of interim ratings, but the regulation does not specify the manner that those ratings are to be taken into consideration in deriving employees' annual rating. An arbitrator's interpretation of an agreement to preclude the agency from changing an annual rating after it becomes the official rating is not contrary to 5 CFR 430.205(a) if that rating does not incorporate an interim rating. <span class="Italic">DHUD, Denver Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 3972</span>, 49 FLRA 1217, 1221 (1994).</p>
