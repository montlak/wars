<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-209"><span class="space">b.</span> Inadequate Representation by Incumbent Union</h5>
<p class="noindent">Inadequacy of representation as a basis for severance was considered in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, NAS Jacksonville and FOP Lodge 125</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v61/61-027.html">61 FLRA 139</a>, 142-43 (2005):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned above, where an established bargaining unit continues to be appropriate, a petition seeking to sever employees from an overall unit represented by a labor organization will be dismissed in the interest of reducing the potential for unit fragmentation and, thereby, promoting effective dealings and efficiency of agency operations, absent unusual circumstances. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress</span>, 16 FLRA at 431. One such circumstance involves the adequacy of representation afforded by the incumbent exclusive representative. The failure of an incumbent to fairly represent the employees sought would give rise to a question of representation concerning the petitioned-for unit and justify severance of those employees from an existing unit that continued to remain appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the cases cited above show, the Authority has previously applied its precedent concerning severance to cases involving officers and has evaluated the circumstances of these type of employees and determined whether such employees should be severed from an existing unit. Further, while the FOP suggests that the criteria for severance of police officers should be based on the success of a union in representing employees like the series 083 officers, Authority precedent establishes that the success of a petitioning union in dealing with conditions of employment of unit employees is not a factor in determining if severance is warranted. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">National Assoc. of Government Employees/Service Employees International Union, Local 5000, AFL-CIO-CLC, </span>52 FLRA 1068, 1077-79 (1997).<span class="Italic"> </span>Rather, in determining unusual circumstances, the Authority looks to, as relevant here, whether the incumbent has failed to fairly represent the employees sought. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the RD applied Authority precedent and found that there were no unusual circumstances that would justify the severance of the petitioned-for employees from the existing unit. The RD's application of Authority precedent to the facts of this case was appropriate and fully supported by the evidence. There is nothing in the record that shows that the petitioned-for employees have been "abandoned" or "subjected to incompetent representation by the exclusive representative." Rather, as the RD found, AFGE, Local 696 has represented such employees concerning their working conditions and continues to represent them. In this regard, the record shows that AFGE, Local 696 engaged in a "pattern of informal resolutions of police issues and bargaining unit issues generally and individually." The use of such informal policy within the Security Department "was supported by [FOP's] own witness" who became an AFGE, Local 696 steward even though he was not on dues allotment at the time. The record contains no evidence that shows that AFGE, Local 696 had treated the series 083 officers "unfairly, ineffectively, or differently" than any other unit employee."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The record thus does not demonstrate that the employees sought here have not been adequately represented.&#x2003;Therefore, the FOP has failed to establish that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE/SEIU Local 5000 and VA</span>, 52 FLRA 1068, 1078 (1997) ("The failure of an incumbent to fairly represent the employees sought would give rise to a question of representation concerning the petitioned-for unit and justify severance of those employees from an existing larger unit that continued to remain appropriate. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C</span>., 35 FLRA 172, 180 (1990).").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Pt. Mugu and Fed. Firefighters Ass'n, Local 55</span>, 26 FLRA 620, 623 (1987), denied severance over protests that the incumbent union had not negotiated a contract for two years:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...There is no evidence that the Incumbent Union has failed or refused to represent any of the petitioned-for employees or that it has treated them in a disparate manner. FFA asserts, contrary to the Regional Director, that the bargaining unit is not now covered by a collective bargaining agreement and has not been covered by an agreement for over two years. Even assuming that the FFA is correct, we do not find the lack of a collective bargaining agreement to be dispositive in this case because there is no evidence that failure to renegotiate a contract over the time period involved in this case deprived unit employees of rights under...the Statute or is "unusual" in the Federal program. Further, there is no showing that any such failure affected the petitioned-for employees any differently than other employees in the unit. Although the negotiation of a collective bargaining agreement is an important part of a union's representational responsibilities, we find in the circumstances of this case that the absence of such an agreement, standing alone, is not sufficient evidence to establish that the Incumbent Union failed to represent the petitioned-for employees in a fair and effective manner.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FOP and NFFE Local 2049</span>, 66 FLRA 285, 285, 287-88 (2011), determined there was no basis to sever a unit based on assertions of inadequate representation of some unit members by the incumbent union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its response to the order, FOP asserted that NFFE was inadequately representing the officers and guards, and that employees in the NFFE unit did not share a "community of interest" because the duties of the officers and guards include "investigating, citing, arresting, [and] prosecuting...the remaining employees" in the unit. In support of its petition, FOP submitted affidavits concerning several incidents of allegedly inadequate representation of officers and guards. Specifically, FOP cited NFFE's alleged mishandling of: (1) the institution of twelve-hour shifts for officers and guards; (2) the discipline of a guard who fell asleep at his post; (3) the use of medical and physical agility tests to allegedly harass an employee; (4) shift restructuring that adversely affected an officer; (5) the non-promotion of an officer; (6) an officer's grievance concerning a supervisor's instruction to tear up a speeding ticket the officer had issued; (7) an officer's grievance alleging that the Activity did not use the proper equipment for packaging hazardous drugs; and (8) a shift seniority issue (collectively, the misrepresentation allegations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD acknowledged, the Authority has held that, absent unusual circumstances, where an established bargaining unit continues to be appropriate, a petition seeking to sever employees from that unit will be dismissed in the interest of reducing the potential for unit fragmentation and, thereby, promoting effective dealings and efficiency of agency operations. <span class="Italic">Jacksonville</span>, 61 FLRA at 142 (citing <span class="Italic">Library of Cong.</span>, 16 FLRA 429, 431 (1984)). However, the failure of an incumbent exclusive <span id="page_235"></span>representative to fairly represent the employees at issue may give rise to a question of representation concerning the petitioned-for unit and justify severance of those employees from an existing unit that continues to remain appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In evaluating whether employees have been adequately represented, the Authority has considered such factors as employees' opportunities to participate in union affairs, <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Carswell Air Force Base, Tex.</span>, 40 FLRA 221, 231-32 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Carswell</span>), the existence of collective bargaining agreement provisions addressing the specific concerns of the employees at issue, <span class="Italic">see Library of Cong.</span>, 16 FLRA at 432, and the union's formal and informal efforts to resolve issues of concern to the employees at issue, <span class="Italic">Jacksonville</span>, 61 FLRA at 143.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, although FOP argues that NFFE should have pursued the officer's grievance concerning a speeding ticket even though there was no discipline at issue, this argument does not identify any specific factual findings of the RD that were erroneous. Similarly, although FOP argues that NFFE's proffered examples of its representation of the interests of officers and guards were not supported by sufficient evidence, FOP does not specifically dispute the veracity of any of NFFE's claims. Accordingly, these arguments do not establish that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the RD erroneously relied upon the disputed allegations, this error would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the RD committed a clear and prejudicial error concerning a substantial factual matter because the record does not support FOP's assertion that officers and guards were inadequately represented. With regard to NFFE's representation activities, as stated previously, the RD found that: (1) "[t]he contract contains police officer/security[-]guard[-]specific provisions"; (2) police officers serve in leadership positions in the NFFE unit as vice president and steward; and (3) "the record reflects significant actions taken by NFFE...in representing employees, both as a whole and on other individual matters." FOP's arguments do not establish that the RD erred in any of these findings and, as noted by the RD, although "[n]ot every issue raised by FOP may have been resolved to the complete satisfaction of every particular employee," this does not establish inadequate representation by NFFE.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the RD found that "[c]learly, NFFE...has not overlooked the police officers and security guards and has demonstrated adequate representation under all the circumstances." This finding is consistent with Authority decisions holding that evidence of employee opportunities to participate in union affairs, the existence of collective bargaining agreement provisions addressing the specific concerns of the employees at issue, and formal and informal union efforts to resolve issues of concern to the employees at issue support a conclusion that an incumbent union continues to provide adequate representation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jacksonville</span>, 61 FLRA at 143; <span class="Italic">Carswell</span>, 40 FLRA at 231-32; <span class="Italic">Library of Cong</span>., 16 FLRA at 432. Further, the decisions cited by <span class="Italic">FOP</span>, in which the Authority denied applications for review that argued that incumbent unions failed to adequately represent certain employees, do not provide a basis for finding that the RD erred in concluding that NFFE adequately represented the employees at issue here. <span class="Italic">See Ft. Carson</span>, 34 FLRA at 35; Navy, 26 FLRA at 622-23.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA and VA Indep. Union</span>, 35 FLRA 172, 180 (1990), identified a serious problem with the adequacy of representation by the exclusive representative as an unusual circumstance supporting severance. The failure of an incumbent to fairly represent the employees sought would give rise to a question of representation concerning the petitioned-for unit and justify severance of employees from an existing larger unit that continued to remain appropriate<span class="Italic">.</span> In a firefighters' severance petition, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Carson and Fed. Firefighters Ass'n Local 44</span>, 34 FLRA 30, 35 (1989), FLRA denied a request for review of a regional decision denying severance despite complaints of inadequate representation by the incumbent union. FLRA observed that "the record indicates that the AFGE has represented [firefighters'] interests on several occasions and has sought [firefighters'] input in the formulation of collective bargaining policies." The size or percentage of the membership of an incumbent union is not determinative of the quality or extent of its representational efforts. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Carswell AFB and Ft. Worth Fed. Firefighters Ass'n</span>, 40 FLRA 221, 230-31 (1991). FLRA will not grant severance to accommodate the interests of a group of dissatisfied employees.

<p class="noindent">Granting reconsideration of a regional director's determination, FLRA granted severance for a union--one of a number of unions in a multi-union trades council--when the employees of the petitioning union submitted a 30% showing of interest and supplied information to FLRA showing that their interests were poorly represented by, or frozen out of, the existing bargaining arrangement as a result of some historical patterns of division in national unions, reflected in operations of the local trades council, in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and New England Regional Council of Carpenters, Local 3072</span>, 70 FLRA 995, 995, 998-1001 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (Opinion by Member Abbott), remanding for the conduct of an election while noting that "when considering petitions for severance elections, employees' right to self-determination is a factor which should be given equal consideration with all other factors":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that when considering petitions for severance elections, employees' right to self-determination is a factor which should be given equal consideration with all other factors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...This case also presents us with a unique opportunity to emphasize that the concerns of potential bargaining-unit employees should be given equal weight as a factor when considering whether unusual circumstances warranting severance exist. And in this case, it is the determinative factor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First and foremost, the RD failed to account in any respect for the wishes of the plastic fabricators and shipwrights themselves--who first voted to withdraw and then established that 30% wanted to vote on who their exclusive representative, if any, should be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the RD's findings, the ongoing incidents were not a "temporary problem." The record is replete with examples of bargaining-unit plastic fabricators and shipwrights being ignored and forgotten. The incidents were numerous and well-cataloged in both the RD's decision and in the Petitioner-Union's application.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In particular, once the Incumbent-Union determined to remove the Petitioner-Union's chief steward as executive secretary, the plastic fabricators and shipwrights had little, if any, input into their representation by the Incumbent-Union. The plastic fabricators and shipwrights were not told how to become members of the Incumbent-Union-affiliated unions. For months, plastic fabricators and shipwrights had no clear idea what labor organization their dues were being paid to or to whom to approach to change dues allotments.[19] A dues-paying member of Petitioner-Union was turned away from a meeting that he tried to attend--a meeting at which conditions of employment significant to plastic fabricators and shipwrights were discussed.[20] Shipwrights did not hear from their "new" representatives about the status of their pending grievances and when the Incumbent-Union decided not to advance those grievances to Step 3, the shipwrights were not informed until several months later. The Incumbent-Union does not contest most of these points.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;RD's Decision at 18-19, 35, 37.

<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;In its opposition, the Incumbent-Union states that "[i]t is not unlawful to tell a non-member that he or she does not have the rights of membership, such as the right to vote on the direction of the organization."

<p class="noindent-1">These incidents were not a temporary problem.&#x2003;Rather, due to their membership in the Petitioner-Union instead of an Incumbent-selected local, the plastic fabricators and the shipwrights were unable to participate in most union affairs and received little to no communication from the Incumbent-Union for an extended period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plastic fabricators and shipwrights have relied on the Petitioner-Union to advocate for their interests for decades. In direct response to the Incumbent-Union's failure to adequately and fairly represent the employees, the plastic fabricators and shipwrights voted to withdraw from the larger unit and to be represented by the Petitioner-Union. But the RD failed to adequately account for their interests and concerns.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Once the Incumbent-Union "removed" the Petitioner-Union from the Incumbent's trade council, the plastic fabricators and shipwrights had almost no voice. In past severance cases,[26] the Authority has focused almost entirely on preventing unit fragmentation rather than giving even the slightest consideration to the interests, concerns, or wishes of affected employees. Preventing unit fragmentation is an important consideration, but employee interests, concerns, and self-determination are of equal importance when determining whether severance is warranted.</p>

In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles, and work assignments; and are subject to the same general working conditions. Historically, the Authority has also considered factors such as common supervision, the distribution and proportion of employees to be represented, the locus and scope of the personnel and labor-relations authority and functions, areas of consideration with regard to merit promotion or reduction-in-force actions, delegation to local management, and integration of mission and function."

In evaluating whether the unit will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved, the Authority examines such factors as: the parties' past collective-bargaining experience; the locus and scope of authority of the personnel office responsible for employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; the level at which labor-relations policy is set in the agency; and the impact on cost, productivity, and resources. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 82nd Training Wing, 361st Training Squadron, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md</span>., 57 FLRA 154, 156-57 (2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Def.

<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the employees represented by the Incumbent-Union are subject to the same personnel policies and practices, pay system, health insurance, geographical conditions, and Agency instructions, which are administered by the same human resources and payroll office. All the employees support the same mission of repairing and overhauling U.S. Navy submarines. Employees are sourced through the same hiring practices and trained through the same apprentice programs. Further, as the RD found that a broader group of employees (those represented by the Incumbent-Union) shared a community of interest, it stands to reason that the narrower unit made up of plastic fabricators and shipwrights would also share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether the proposed unit's employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest, as noted above, the interests and concerns of the employees should not be ignored. The plastic fabricators and shipwrights have distinct needs, such as craft-specific seniority lists for overtime priority and reductions in force. When it comes to which crafts have jurisdiction over new work entering the Shipyard, their interests diverge from those of other craftspeople when it comes to certain environmental hazards and workplace safety. The trades of the plastic fabricators and shipwrights both arose out of carpentry work, and they differ from those of the other wage-grade craftspeople. And they are subject to the same general conditions of employment. Accordingly, the plastic fabricators and shipwrights share a community of interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Examining whether the unit will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the Shipyard, it is important to note that the Agency currently interacts with different unions who represent other employees at this facility with no apparent negative impact on the Agency's labor and employee relations office. That office regularly negotiates with the different unions collectively, or individually, as the circumstances warrant. Furthermore, resolving once and for all this ongoing contentious relationship will promote effective dealings and ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest. Accordingly, the petitioned-for unit is appropriate.</p>
