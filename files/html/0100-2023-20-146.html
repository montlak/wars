<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DHUD</span>, 64 MSPR 314, 319 (1994), decided that an official reprimand qualifies as a covered "disciplinary or corrective action." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 165, 172 &#x00B6; 14, 2015 MSPB 2 (2015) (replacing <span class="Italic">Reed v. VA</span>, 122 MSPR 24, &#x00B6; 13, 2014 MSPB 85 (2014)) (admonishment, or failure to remove an admonishment from a personnel file, constituted a personnel action when it supported, or could support, a future disciplinary action); <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 114 MSPR 155, 159 &#x00B6; 13, 2010 MSPB 106 (2010) (admonishment a covered personnel action even if it did not go in the OPF) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DA-1221-11-0224-B-1 (NP 6/18/2103)); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 93 MSPR 38, 45-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2002) (letter of admonishment was a covered personnel action when it sought to change the appellant's behavior, constituting corrective action; it was immaterial that the letter was not placed in the appellant's OPF); <span class="Italic">Laberge v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 91 MSPR 585, 587 &#x00B6; 5 (2002) (reprimand a covered action); <span class="Italic">Weaver v. USIA</span>, 87 F.3d 1429, 1433 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (oral admonishment was within the purview of OSC); <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 85 MSPR 631, 641 &#x00B6; 18 (2000) (reprimand was a covered personnel action); <span class="Italic">McVay v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span>, 80 MSPR 120, 123 (1998) (reprimand was not directly appealable to Board, but was covered under an IRA appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Onasch v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 158, 163 (1994), explained that a reprimand qualifies as a personnel action under the WPA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that a reprimand is a personnel action for purposes of determining Board jurisdiction of an IRA appeal. Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), a personnel action includes an action under Chapter 75 of this title or other disciplinary or corrective action. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Charest v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 54 MSPR 436, 439-43 (1992) (the administrative judge's finding that whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the agency's issuing a letter of reprimand was reversed but the finding that the letter was a personnel action was left undisturbed). Moreover, we have not deemed the list of personnel actions in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A) as exhaustive. <span class="Italic">See Carter v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Army</span>, 62 MSPR 393, 398 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">McGowen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 601, 607 (1996), ventured (without deciding) that if oral reprimands are covered personnel actions, there is no effective remedy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming, however, that the appellant's disclosures are protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), the appellant has failed to state a claim with respect to his oral reprimands for which the Board can award effective relief. Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(g), as corrective action, the Board is authorized to order "that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred," including "back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes." Here, the appellant has lost no pay or benefits as a result of his oral reprimands and he has not alleged that he incurred medical costs, travel expenses, or other reasonable and foreseeable changes. Moreover, because there is no allegation and no evidence that the oral reprimands are a matter of record, there is no relief that the Board can fashion to return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>; there is no file that the Board can order expunged and there is no action that the Board can order canceled. Indeed, we can conceive of no remedy at all. Under these circumstances, even assuming that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal with respect to the three oral reprimands, the appellant has failed to state a claim for which relief can be granted, and his appeal must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Occhipinti v. Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice</span>, 61 MSPR 504, 508 (1994) (where the appellant was no longer an employee of the agency and the Board could not grant meaningful or effective relief, the appeal was dismissed as moot).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 669-70 (1997), oral counseling is not a covered personnel action, even if the counseling session is documented by a memo from the supervisor to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there may be circumstances in which notice of a performance deficiency would be an implied threat to issue a retaliatory performance appraisal, the record here does not support such a conclusion concerning respondent's mid-point counseling memorandum. <span class="Italic">Cf. Marren v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner objects to the ALJ's finding that the respondent did not take a personnel action, contending that oral counseling is a "disciplinary or corrective action" under 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii) because, like a reprimand, its purpose is to correct perceived inappropriate behavior. The respondent replies that counseling is not subject to the statute, citing our holding in <span class="Italic">Caddell v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 52 MSPR 529, 532-33 (1992), that, because the provision applies to Chapter 75 and "other disciplinary or corrective action," the latter phrase should be read to include only actions "in the nature of a Chapter 75 action." Unlike formal disciplinary action, he notes, no SF-50 (or SF-52) is issued to memorialize oral counseling, and no record is placed in the employee's official personnel file, precluding its consideration in subsequent discipline as a prior disciplinary action. As a matter of policy, the respondent also urges the Board not to treat counseling as a personnel action lest every communication between supervisor and employee be turned into a potential retaliation claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the respondent for the reasons stated that counseling such as Pendleton received does not constitute disciplinary or corrective action within the coverage of the statute. As the personnelist...testified, "[c]ounseling would occur before any discipline is taken--or should occur." The petitioner's reading of the statute is inconsistent with the rule of interpretation stated in <span class="Italic">Caddell</span> and we believe it would be <span id="Page_3897"></span>counterproductive to construe the statute in such a way as to discourage resolving workplace issues short of formal disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As relevant here, "personnel action" under the Whistleblower Protection Act includes "other disciplinary or corrective action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). Substantial evidence supports the determination that the red flag notification and informal memorandum of counseling do not constitute disciplinary action within the scope of &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). The red flag notification "is a reporting system that identifies student comments considered to be serious or immediate threats, acts, or behaviors within particular categories." It does not propose any disciplinary measures but instead highlights areas requiring additional investigation. The informal memorandum of counseling issued to Ms. Mohammed informed her about the negative feedback and reminded her about workplace expectations. It did not propose any disciplinary measures, and Mr. Bebawi expressly informed Ms. Mohammed that the memorandum of counseling would not have any impact on her future career because he wanted to give her a fresh start. The record thus sustains the Administrative Judge's finding that they are not covered personnel activities.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Koch next asserts that the administrative judge erred in holding that the 1994 performance counseling memorandum given to Mr. Koch did not constitute a threat to take a personnel action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and thus was not actionable under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The performance counseling memorandum explained to Mr. Koch that, despite repeated warnings about his failure to meet deadlines, his performance had demonstrated "little, if any, improvement." The memorandum provided specific examples of deficient performance and cautioned that "[u]nless you make immediate and profound improvements in your performance, it will be necessary to discharge you." Mr. Koch claims that the memorandum contained a threat to discharge him and thus constituted a threat to take a personnel action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The administrative judge held that the memorandum did not constitute a threat, and we conclude that substantial evidence supports that finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A wide range of agency rules, directives, and counseling measures contain the message, implicit or explicit, that failure to follow those directives or to meet expectations may have adverse consequences, including possible discharge. As the administrative judge correctly observed, not all such general statements setting forth performance expectations and the consequences of failing to meet them, or even similar counseling measures directed at particular employees, constitute actionable "threats" to take adverse action within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v.

In this case, the administrative judge reasonably viewed the performance counseling memorandum as a vehicle for giving Mr. Koch notice of weaknesses in his performance and encouraging improvement. The line between a counseling measure and a threat is not a bright one, and the distinction between the two is very fact-dependent. We are satisfied that the administrative judge's conclusion that Mr. Koch's performance counseling memorandum did not constitute a threat is well supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant alleged that the supervisor's email created a "chilled environment," for making protected disclosures and therefore was a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi), which provides that any significant change to duties, responsibilities, or working conditions is a personnel action.

Spears</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 639, 670 (1997), she found that a letter of counseling is not a personnel action. She found that the appellant failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency had taken a personnel action against him and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant proves that he exhausted his administrative remedies before OSC and makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure, and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The administrative judge correctly found that the sole issue in this appeal is whether the agency took a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erroneously relied on <span class="Italic">Spears</span> to find that the email from his supervisor did not constitute a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). The appellant argues that, in <span class="Italic">Spears</span>, the agency issued the letter of counseling before Congress enacted amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) in 1994, which modified the language defining a personnel action at section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant asserts, prior to October 29, 1994, the definition of "personnel action" included "any other significant change in duties or responsibilities which is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(x) (1988). Effective October 29, 1994, the definition above was amended to state: "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." The 1994 amendment's deletion of the qualifying language "which is inconsistent with the employee's salary or grade level" enlarged the category of actions encompassed in the definition of "personnel action." <span class="Italic">See Briley v. National Archives and Records Administration</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 211, 223 (1996). The legislative history of the amendment shows that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[c]onsistent with the Whistleblower Protection Act's remedial purpose, the provision adding "any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions" to listed personnel actions should be interpreted broadly. This personnel action is intended to include any harassment or discrimination that could have a chilling effect on whistleblowing or otherwise undermine the merit system, and should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">140 Cong. Rec. H11,421 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey); <span class="Italic">see Shivaee v. Department of the Navy</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 383, 388 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has continued to rely on <span class="Italic">Spears</span> as precedent in applying the language of section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi) as enacted in the 1994 amendments to the WPA in its case-by-case analysis deciding what agency actions fall within the purview of section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). After the enactment of the 1994 amendments, the Board relied on <span class="Italic">Spears</span> to find that verbal criticism does not fall within the enumerated personnel actions that are properly before the Board in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Greenspan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 247 (2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge properly relied on <span class="Italic">Spears</span> to find that the email to the appellant from his supervisor was not a personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi). That email is analogous to either a letter of counseling or verbal criticism, both of which the Board has found are not personnel actions under the WPA. Further, we cannot ascertain from the record whether the email should be viewed as having any chilling effect on the appellant's right to make protected disclosures. The supervisor's statement in his email that the appellant's email to his coworker was inappropriate may have been referencing the tone of the appellant's email, rather than the content of the material that it forwarded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has cautioned, however, that an admonishment short of formal disciplinary actions, such as a letter of counseling or verbal counseling that is not a personnel action under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi), may be a personnel action under another provision of section 2302(a)(2)(A) if such admonishment threatens a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Campo v. Department of the Army</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). Here, the supervisor's email does not threaten any action and thus is not a personnel action under any other of the personnel actions enumerated in section 2302(a)(2)(A). Indeed, in his petition, the appellant concedes that he is not alleging that the email was a personnel action other than under section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xi).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Koury v. DOD</span>, 84 MSPR 219, 228-29 &#x00B6; 15 (1999), suggested that a letter of warning can be an agency action within the Board's corrective action authority in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Campo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 93 MSPR 1, 3-4 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2002), provides an example of a warning letter, containing an explicit threat of possible future disciplinary action, that established a personnel action within the Board's IRA jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) states that an agency "shall not...take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action with respect to any employee...because of" a protected whistleblowing disclosure. A "personnel action" includes "an action under chapter 75 of [Title 5] <span id="Page_3898"></span>or other disciplinary or corrective action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii). We have held that "[U]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), an agency may not threaten to take a personnel action in reprisal for whistleblowing, and whether a threatened action is actually taken or not does not determine the Board's jurisdiction in an IRA appeal." <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 425 &#x00B6; 9 (2000). We have also previously found that the term "threaten" should be given a "fairly broad interpretation." <span class="Italic">Gergick v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 639, 670 (1997), the AJ found that admonishments short of formal disciplinary actions, such as the April 2, 2001 memorandum of warning issued by the agency here, are not personnel actions within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). ID at 3; <span class="Italic">see Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 204 &#x00B6; 11 (2000). The Board concluded in Spears that the particular memorandum of oral counseling in that case was not a personnel action because it did not constitute disciplinary or corrective action within the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), and stated that a contrary conclusion could discourage the resolution of workplace issues "short of formal disciplinary action." Spears, 75 M.S.P.R. at 670. In Spears, though, the Board did not determine that a memorandum of warning cannot "threaten" a personnel action for purposes of jurisdiction in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. Department of Defense</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 219 &#x00B6; 16 (1999) (a letter of warning may be a "personnel action" for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal). We now address that issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In approximately March 2000, the appellant and another employee complained, in essence, to the agency's Inspector General that a fellow employee and two supervisors committed fraud during the recruitment process for a GS-10 Civil Engineering Technician position with the agency. The agency found these allegations unsubstantiated. In September and October 2000, the appellant raised essentially the same fraud allegations with OSC. In March 2001, the appellant apparently raised similar allegations with her supervisor. The agency then issued an April 2, 2001 "Memorandum of Warning" to the appellant that stated, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">1.&#x2003;The purpose of this memorandum is to bring to your attention my concern over your lack of professionalism and disruptive behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">2.&#x2003;...[Y]ou made allegations regarding the qualifications and integrity of [a] co-worker.... I learned that you have previously raised these same issues with your chain of command and with independent authorities. Your allegations were found to be without merit.... [R]aising the same issues without any additional evidence...is in defiance of the chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Your conduct was unprofessional and disruptive to the orderly functioning of this Branch. Your refusal to accept management's</span> <span class="Italic">decisions in these matters borders on insubordination</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">4.&#x2003;...I want to reiterate to you that it is unacceptable conduct to make unfounded allegations or to continue to make allegations after you have received legitimate management decisions regarding them<span class="Italic">. You are warned that if there are any further instances of this nature, you will be charged with insubordination and/or creating a disturbance, which subjects you to disciplinary action, to include removal</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering the content of the memorandum, and the circumstances of this case, we find that the memorandum of warning contains a direct threat to take a "chapter 75...or other disciplinary or corrective action" and thus constitutes a threat to take a "personnel action" for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), (b)(8). We thus remand this appeal for further adjudication regarding the memorandum of warning.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a counseling letter did not, despite the warning of future disciplinary action, rise to the level of a personnel action in <span class="Italic">Vocke v. Dept. of Commerce,</span> DC-1221-13-1266-W-1 (NP 5/2/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge also found that the August 15, 2012 Letter of Counseling, which the appellant referenced in his OSC complaint and in his appeal, did not contain a threat of future disciplinary action and therefore did not constitute a personnel action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). The appellant challenges that finding on review, arguing that the Letter of Counseling was a threat to take a personnel action because it warned of possible future discipline, stating that "any future misconduct may result in disciplinary action up to and including removal from the Federal service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly pointed out, such a general statement, a reminder that future misconduct might result in disciplinary action, remains a truism for any employee, at any time. <span class="Italic">See Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 48 F. App'x 778, 787 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("A wide range of agency rules, directives, and counseling measures contain the message, implicit or explicit, that failure to follow those directives or to meet expectations may have adverse consequences, including possible discharge.... [n]ot all such general statements...constitute actionable 'threats' to take adverse action within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act."). The language in question is conditional in nature; if the appellant engages in future misconduct, then he may be disciplined as a result. Moreover, the administrative judge correctly noted that the lack of such admonition would represent an odd omission in any purported letter of counseling. This is especially true considering the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor that takes into account whether an appellant was placed on notice of any rules that were violated in committing the offense in question and whether he had been warned about engaging in such conduct in the future. Indeed, not warning an employee that prospective misconduct could result in disciplinary action would hamper an agency's ability to effectively manage the workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant cites to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Campo v. Department of the Army</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2002), in support of his claim, we agree with the administrative judge that <span class="Italic">Campo</span> is distinguishable. There, the agency issued the appellant a memorandum of warning and advised her that she would be charged with insubordination and/or creating a disturbance and would be subjected to disciplinary action including removal if she continued to make unfounded allegations, the substance of which comprised her alleged protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Campo</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 7. The Board found that, considering the content of the memorandum, and the circumstances of the case, the memorandum of warning contained a direct threat to take a "chapter 75...or other disciplinary or corrective action" and therefore constituted a threat to take a "personnel action" for purposes of Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Campo</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 8. Here, however, the Letter of Counseling began by advising the appellant that it was intended to "address [his] demonstrated failure to communicate with [his] supervisors appropriately and to clarify...expectations for [his] conduct in the future." After relating the incidents the agency deemed to have demonstrated the cited misconduct, the Letter of Counseling states that it "is only a counseling and will not be included in [his] Official Personnel File" and it "remind[s]" the appellant "that any future misconduct may result in disciplinary action up to and including removal from the Federal service." The Letter of Counseling does not "warn" the appellant that, in the event of "further instances of this nature," he "will be charged" with specific discipline ("insubordination and/or creating a disturbance") as was the case with the memorandum of warning in <span class="Italic">Campo</span>. Rather, the Letter of Counseling at issue here first expressly states that it is not being made a matter of record; that is, it is not itself a disciplinary action, and then simply adds standard language "remind[ing] the appellant that future misconduct may result in disciplinary action."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A notice to an employee that his responses to an investigation lacked candor, with no record of that notice in personnel records, and no warning as to future discipline, did not constitute a covered personnel action in <span class="Italic">Spivey v. DOJ</span>, 2022 MSPB 24, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-15 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Often, a "personnel action" in the context of an IRA appeal takes the form of a proposal or decision to impose discipline for a sustained charge of misconduct. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bacas v. Department of the Army</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 464, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5 (2005) (finding that an agency's decision to propose the appellant's removal based on charges of insubordination, creating a disturbance in the workplace, false statements, and inability to work was a covered personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 12 (2003) (finding that a proposed and effected removal based on charges of misuse of Government property, unprofessional behavior, and making misrepresentations during an official investigation constituted personnel actions), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 97 F. App'x 322 (Fed. Cir. 2004). Absent any proposed disciplinary action, however, the mere threat of disciplinary action also can amount to a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)-(9); <span class="Italic">Hoback v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 425, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2000) (clarifying that a threat of discipline must be of a covered personnel action); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1209.2(a), 1209.6(a)(5)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, in <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 654 (1990), an agency investigation resulted in a record of inquiry in which the agency notified the appellant that it appeared that he had violated the agency's standards of acceptable conduct or behavior, which could result in disciplinary action. The Board found that the record of inquiry amounted to a threat to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 656-57. The Board acknowledged that the record of inquiry did not include a statement that disciplinary action was being proposed and did not include a specific reference to a particular kind of discipline that may be imposed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found, however, that the language in the record of inquiry nonetheless served as notice that disciplinary action was possible. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 657. The Board further highlighted that the likelihood of discipline was not insignificant given that the record of inquiry was issued only after the agency had conducted an investigation of the appellant's activities and had compiled a substantial file. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege[2] that she suffered a personnel action in connection with the agency's allegations that she engaged in wrongdoing. The record reflects that the agency did not take <span id="Page_3899"></span>or propose to take any disciplinary action as a result of such allegations. Further, we find that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency threatened to take any disciplinary action against her. In contrast to <span class="Italic">Gergick</span>, the agency here provided written notice to the appellant that no action would be taken as a result of the findings of the investigation. We find that an allegation of wrongdoing alone, without any ensuing disciplinary or adverse action, or threat of disciplinary or adverse action, does not constitute a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;A nonfrivolous allegation is an assertion that, if proven, could establish the matter at issue. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(s).</p>

Department of Justice</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 624, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">Russell v. Department of Justice</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 317, 323-24 (1997); <span class="Italic">Geyer v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding a significant change in job duties, responsibilities, or working conditions, the Board has held that only agency actions that, individually or collectively, have practical and significant effects on the overall nature and quality of an employee's working conditions, duties, or responsibilities will be found to constitute a personnel action covered by section 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). <span class="Italic">Skarada v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 2022 MSPB 17, &#x00B6; 16. In <span class="Italic">Skarada</span>, the Board found that the appellant's allegations that his chain of command harassed him and subjected him to a hostile work environment by, among other things, excluding him from meetings and conversations, subjecting him to multiple investigations, accusing him of "fabricating data" and of a Privacy Act violation, refusing his request for a review of his position for possible upgrade, yelling at him on three occasions, and failing to provide him the support and guidance needed to successfully perform his duties, when considered cumulatively, constituted nonfrivolous allegations of a significant change in his working conditions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 18. However, the Board specifically found that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege that the investigations themselves were covered personnel actions because he did not identify any specific personnel actions associated with them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 18 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's allegation that she was subjected to an agency investigation fails to amount to a nonfrivolous allegation that she was subjected to a personnel action. As discussed above, an investigation itself is not a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). Indeed, we agree with the principle, explained by the agency here in its communication to the appellant, that, to maintain the integrity of the working environment, an employer should thoroughly investigate allegations of possible employee wrongdoing. The investigation here did not result in any proposal of disciplinary or corrective action, the appellant's detail, transfer, or reassignment, or any other personnel action identified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). We find no allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish that the investigation amounted to a threat to take a personnel action or was pretext for gathering evidence to use to retaliate against the appellant for her alleged protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller v. Department of Justice</span>, 842 F.3d 1252, 1254-56 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (analyzing the appellant's claim that an agency investigation stemming from his protected disclosures that resulted in his reassignment constituted reprisal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to nonfrivolously allege facts that could prove that the investigation amounted to a significant change in working conditions.[3] The appellant offered no allegations or evidence concerning any practical or significant effects that the investigation had on the overall nature and quality of her working conditions, duties, or responsibilities. Rather, she alleged that she participated in an interview and prepared an affidavit during the investigation. We find these allegations, if proven, do not amount to nonfrivolous allegations that she was subjected to a significant change in working conditions. <span class="Italic">See Sistek</span>, 955 F.3d at 955-56 (finding that the appellant's assertions describing a routine investigation that resulted in a letter of reprimand did not rise to the level of a significant change in working conditions such that it would qualify as a personnel action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant also did not identify any agency actions beyond the investigation and allegations of wrongdoing as contributing to her alleged significant change in working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in finding that the effect of the agency's investigation on her was minimal and, thus, did not amount to a significant change in working conditions. For the first time, she argues that the investigation itself amounted to a significant change in working conditions because, as a result of it, she was hospitalized for 7 days, remained out of work for an additional 36 days, exhausted her leave, had to take leave without pay, and had to apply for the voluntary leave transfer program. She further argues for the first time on review that, during the investigation, she was hindered from upward mobility and lost out on employment opportunities, such as being transferred to another institution or being promoted. With her petition, she submits various documents, including a list of job vacancies to which she applied but was not selected, a list of days on which she was unable to attend work between December 1, 2015, and April 20, 2017, and various leave and medical documents.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may consider new and material evidence or legal argument on review if, despite the party's due diligence, it was not available when the record closed. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(d). The appellant has not shown that her newly submitted documents, or the information contained in them, were previously unavailable or that her arguments or evidence are material to the outcome of this appeal. The documents contained in the appellant's petition for review are dated before the close of the record below and, thus, are not new. For example, the appellant submits her voluntary leave transfer form dated January 24, 2017, medical documentation dated February 1 and 7, 2017, and medical invoices dated between January 13 and February 23, 2017. Her new arguments also are not material because they do not amount to nonfrivolous allegations that she was subjected to a significant change in working conditions and, thus, fail to show error in the administrative judge's finding that she failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation that she was subjected to a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980) (stating that the Board will not grant a petition for review based on new evidence absent a showing that it is of sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision). Accordingly, we affirm the initial decision, dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639 (1997), a covered personnel action was not created by a request for nonbinding guidance from a personnel office, even though the written request expressed the opinion that the employee be disciplined. A "letter of understanding" was not a covered personnel action, <span class="Italic">Van Lith v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter of understanding merely "cautioned" Mr. Van Lith that if he again engaged in certain behavior, he "may" be disciplined for it in the future. On its face, the letter is not "disciplinary" or "corrective," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), nor is it a "performance evaluation," <span class="Italic">see id</span>., subp. (viii), and it was not placed in his file....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A letter establishing a performance improvement period under Chapter 43 constitutes a threat for the purpose of IRA jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 107, 115-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2000) (Board characterized as a PIP, and a threatened personnel action, a memo suggesting that the appellant's performance in a critical element was unacceptable, providing her an opportunity to improve, and offering assistance; the nature of the action, not the agency's characterization of the action, determined the Board's jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. DHUD</span>, 64 MSPR 314, 319 (1994) (performance improvement period plan involves a threatened personnel action, e.g., a reduction in grade or removal); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 96 MSPR 487, 490 &#x00B6; 7 (2004) (formal "Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance" was the equivalent of a PIP and constituted a matter actionable in an IRA case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Hudson v. VA</span>, 104 MSPR 283, 289-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17, 2006 MSPB 359 (2006), both a performance approval plan and a PIP constituted personnel actions cognizable in an IRA appeal, and the rescission or successful completion of either did not moot the IRA case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was placed on a 90-day PIP on June 22, 2005. On June 30, 2005, the agency informed the appellant that the PIP was no longer in effect. On July 14, 2005, the agency placed the appellant on a PAP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A PIP is considered a personnel action for purposes of an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 7. Even though the agency rescinded the PIP, there is no evidence regarding whether any references to the PIP remain in the appellant's personnel file. As relief, the appellant asked that negative materials, which would include information regarding the PIP and PAP, be removed from his personnel records. The Board has held that, if it were to find that an appellant was placed on a PIP in retaliation for <span id="Page_3900"></span>whistleblowing, the appellant's successful completion of the PIP would not render an IRA appeal moot because the Board could order references to the PIP expunged from the appellant's personnel file. <span class="Italic">Newcastle v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 242, &#x00B6; 11 (2003). The Board has also found that an IRA appeal was not rendered moot when the agency terminated the equivalent of a PIP where further relief, such as monetary damages for harm to the appellant's career, could be ordered if the Board found the PIP-like action to have been in retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13. Thus, in the present case, the PIP was a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA and this appeal was not rendered moot when the agency terminated the PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the PAP is also a personnel action. The Board has held that agency memoranda that merely informed an appellant of his performance deficiencies and instructed him as to what corrective actions were required, but did not threaten to take any disciplinary action against him, did not provide a basis for determining that the appellant had made a nonfrivolous allegation that the memoranda constituted personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Department of the Army</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 11 n.* (2005). However, the Board has also held that a PIP, even if it does not expressly threaten a personnel action, by definition, involves a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 107, &#x00B6; 18 (2000). Moreover, even though the agency did not call this action a PIP, that does not mean that it is not a personnel action under the WPA. It is the nature of the action, not the agency's characterization of it, that determines Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 20. For example, where an agency memorandum characterized as a "Temporary Realignment of Work" could be interpreted as suggesting that the appellant's performance in a critical element was unacceptable, and provided her an opportunity to improve (including an offer of assistance to help her improve), the Board found that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency's action was really a PIP and, therefore, a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21; <span class="Italic">see also Harris</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 7 (the Board held that an Opportunity to Demonstrate Acceptable Performance was equivalent to a PIP and was therefore a personnel action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the PAP does not <span class="Italic">expressly</span> threaten a personnel action. Nevertheless, the PAP could be read to suggest that the appellant's performance in a critical element was unacceptable, it provides the appellant with 30 days to show improvement, and it offers assistance in the form of weekly meetings with his supervisor, Dr. Chandon. The PAP and the rescinded PIP both contain several of the same "expectations" for the appellant to fulfill. Furthermore, the PAP states that, "[a]t the end of this 30-day time period, [Dr. Chandon] will reassess [the appellant's] performance and make a determination as to [his] current status." Thus, there was an implied threatened personnel action if the appellant did not meet the performance expectations of the PAP and the PAP therefore constituted a personnel action within the meaning of the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a "letter of performance concern" was not a covered personnel action, <span class="Italic">Delosreyes v. GSA,</span> NY-1221-14-0379-W-1 (NP 5/5/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the letter of performance concern at issue in the instant appeal is akin to the progress report addressed in <span class="Italic">King</span>. In the letter of performance concern, the appellant's supervisor informed her that her work product had been deteriorating over the past several months, provided examples of specific performance issues that the appellant had experienced on projects, and identified areas in which the appellant needed to improve her performance, including completing and billing her projects in a timely manner, adequately responding to requests from customer agencies, and arriving at meetings on time. The appellant's supervisor stated that she was available to help the appellant and requested (but did not order) that they meet once every other week to discuss the appellant's projects. The letter of performance concern was not an official rating and did not reference any disciplinary or corrective action. For these reasons, like the progress report in <span class="Italic">King,</span> the letter of performance concern was an informal and prospective attempt to improve the appellant's future performance, did not have practical consequences for the appellant, and was not a personnel action. <span class="Italic">See King,</span> 133 F.3d at 1452-53; <span class="Italic">see also Reeves v. Department of the Army,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 11 n.* (2005) (finding that an appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that a memorandum of counseling was a personnel action when the memorandum informed him of performance deficiencies and required corrective actions, but did not threaten to take disciplinary action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates her argument, raised below, that the letter of performance concern was a threat to lower her performance rating. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the letter of performance concern was a threat to take a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The line between a counseling measure and a threat is not a bright one, and the distinction between the two is very fact dependent. <span class="Italic">Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission,</span> 48 F. App'x 778, 787 (Fed. Cir. 2002). There may be some instances in which a supervisor's statements regarding an appellant's performance deficiencies raise a nonfrivolous allegation of a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Mastrullo v. Department of Labor,</span> 123 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2015) (finding that an appellant's assertions regarding statements that his supervisor made during a midterm progress review meeting raised a nonfrivolous allegation of a threatened personnel action); <span class="Italic">see also Czarkowski v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 107, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-21 (2000) (finding that an appellant raised a nonfrivolous allegation that a memorandum outlining her performance deficiencies was a performance improvement plan, when, among other things, it stated that the appellant's work was being realigned temporarily and that her performance appraisal was being deferred). However, the administrative judge correctly found that the letter of performance concern at issue here is not such an instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter of performance concern does not mention the appellant's performance evaluation, does not state that the appellant's supervisor intended to lower her performance rating, or discuss any proposed corrective or disciplinary action in response to her performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Campo v. Department of the Army</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2002) (explaining that a memorandum of warning was a threat to take a personnel action when it stated that an appellant would be subject to disciplinary action, including removal, if she continued to make unfounded allegations, the substance of which comprised her alleged protected disclosures); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 595, 608-09 (1991) (finding a threatened personnel action when an employee was informed that he should not expect the highly satisfactory performance rating that he had received the prior year), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 375, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span> 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The letter of performance concern does state that, despite being given assistance with her assignments, the appellant "continue[d] to have difficulty meeting the criteria established in [her] critical elements," and, as discussed previously, provides examples of the appellant's performance deficiencies. To the extent that the appellant contends that these statements raise a nonfrivolous allegation of an implicit threat that she would receive a lower performance rating, we disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a truism for any employee that poor performance may result in a low or unsatisfactory performance rating. However, not all general statements setting forth performance expectations and the consequences of failing to meet those expectations or counseling measures directed at particular employees constitute threats to take a personnel action. <span class="Italic">Koch</span>, 48 F. App'x at 787 ("A wide range of agency rules, directives, and counseling measures contain the message, implicit or explicit, that failure to follow those directives or to meet expectations may have adverse consequences, including possible discharge.... [n]ot all such general statements...constitute actionable 'threats' to take adverse action within the meaning of the Whistleblower Protection Act."). Indeed, in <span class="Italic">King</span>, the court found that Congress did not intend for the WPA to create an IRA appeal for every interim comment made in the workplace, written or otherwise, about the need for improvement.[7] 133 F.3d at 1453.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;On review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge failed to consider that the WPEA amended the WPA. However, the WPEA did not alter the jurisdictional requirement of an actual or threatened personnel action, nor did it effectuate any change to the definition of a personnel action material to the outcome of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (Nov. 27, 2012). Certainly, none of the amendments in the WPEA indicate that Congress intended to create an IRA appeal from every interim comment made about the need to improve an employee's performance. <span class="Italic">See King</span>, 133 F.3d at 1453.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the letter of performance concern was a threatened personnel action, as opposed to an effort to assist her in bringing her performance to an acceptable level. <span class="Italic">See Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 639, 669 (1997) (finding that a "mid point" counseling memorandum informing an employee that she was failing two of her critical elements was part of a process designed to assist her to bring her performance to an acceptable level, rather than a threatened personnel action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of what appeared to be a threat of a poor future performance appraisal, <span class="Italic">Mastrullo v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 123 MSPR 110, 121-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25, 2015 MSPB 67 (2015), observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also did not acknowledge or discuss the appellant's assertion that J.M.'s comments to him during the midterm progress review meeting constituted a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) (stating that it is a prohibited personnel practice to "threaten to take" a personnel action against any employee because of that employee's protected disclosure). The decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) in <span class="Italic">King</span> did not discuss a threatened personnel action. Additionally, we are unaware of any precedent that would preclude us from considering the appellant's claim of a threatened future performance appraisal as a threatened personnel action, even if it occurred during a midterm progress review meeting. <span id="Page_3901"></span><span class="Italic">See Koch v. Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission</span>, 48 F. App'x 778, 787 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("The line between a counseling measure and a threat is not a bright one, and the distinction between the two is very fact-dependent."); <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 639, 669 (1997) (acknowledging that there may be circumstances in which notice of a performance deficiency would be an implied threat to issue a retaliatory performance appraisal); <span class="Italic">see also Special Counsel v. Hathaway</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 595, 600, 608-09 (1991) (finding a threatened personnel action where an employee was informed that he should not expect a highly satisfactory rating the next year), <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 375, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 981 F.2d 1237 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over his claim of a threatened personnel action during the midyear performance review meeting. The Board has found that the term "threaten" means, among other things, "to give signs of the approach of (something evil or unpleasant)," and that it should be given a "fairly broad interpretation" in this context. <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 651, 656 (1990). The appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he viewed J.M.'s statement about deficiencies in his work performance as a threat.</p>
