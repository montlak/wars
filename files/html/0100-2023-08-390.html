<h2 class="h2" id="sec1-383"><span id="Page_751"></span><span class="space">VI.</span> SUITABILITY DETERMINATION</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">We begin discussion of suitability determinations for the competitive service with a brief summary of the process, taken from <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 754 F.3d 1031, 1034-36 (D.C. Cir. 2014), involving review of a decision from the Federal Labor Relations Authority and an arbitration award considering representation rights of IRS employees during suitability examinations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...A covered position is "a position in the competitive service, a position in the excepted service where the incumbent <span id="Page_752"></span>can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service, and a career appointment to a position in the Senior Executive Service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). Notwithstanding exceptions inapplicable here, an individual seeking covered employment must undergo an investigation in order to determine his "suitability for employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.104(a). The President, to whom the Congress has granted broad authority to regulate entry in the civil service, <span class="Italic">see, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3301, 3302, has delegated to OPM the authority to conduct the suitability investigation, <span class="Italic">see Dickson v. OPM</span>, 828 F.2d 32, 33-34 (D.C. Cir. 1987) ("[T]he President has delegated to OPM, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the authority...to investigate and determine the suitability of persons entering or employed in nonsensitive positions within the competitive civil service." (citing Exec. Order No. 10,450)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104(a) ("[A]ppointments to covered positions...require the person to undergo an investigation <span class="Italic">by OPM or</span> by an agency with delegated authority <span class="Italic">from OPM</span> to conduct investigations." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 736.201(a) ("[T]he investigation of persons entering or employed in the competitive service, or by career appointment in the Senior Executive Service, is the responsibility of OPM."); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 5.2(a) (OPM Director may investigate "the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service"). As part of the suitability investigation, the covered IRS personnel at issue here are required to participate in an interview. OPM has the authority to sanction anyone who refuses to furnish testimony during a suitability interview. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(g).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;"Excepted service" personnel are those IRS personnel who are not "covered." Excepted service appointments "include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by OPM." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1.4(a). Although an individual appointed to an excepted service position with the IRS is not required to undergo a suitability investigation, the IRS does require the individual to undergo a background investigation, which includes an interview component. OPM also conducts this background investigation and interview.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the conclusion of the suitability investigation, a covered individual receives a "suitability determination." A "suitability determination" is "a decision by OPM or an agency with delegated authority that a person is suitable or is not suitable for employment in covered positions in the Federal Government or a specific Federal agency." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). Pursuant to a standing OPM delegation, the IRS makes the suitability determinations for "applicants" for, and "appointees" to, covered positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a). An applicant is "a person who is being considered or has been considered for employment" and an "appointee" is "a person who has entered on duty and is in the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 731.101(b).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM provides a summary of the suitability determination process in its Delegated Examining Operations Handbook, <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>, at pp. 1-7, 6-33:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Suitability Determinations and Actions</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR part 731, OPM has delegated to agencies the authority to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions (including limited, agency-specific debarments under &#x00A7; 731.205) with regard to applicants for, and appointees to, competitive service positions, except where the following issues have arisen, in which instance such determinations and actions must be referred to OPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Deception or fraud in examination or appointment, or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Refusal to furnish testimony as required by 5 CFR section 5.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Note: A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal or credit background of the sort asked on the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment until the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant (unless the agency has requested and received an exception from OPM). Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant. An agency has the latitude to determine what office within the agency will be responsible for adjudicating suitability. This function may be done in the examining office, but there is no requirement that it be done there. For further information concerning suitability determinations refer to 5 CFR part 731.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Suitability refers to identifiable character traits and conduct that are sufficient to determine whether an individual is likely to be able to carry out the duties of a covered Federal position in such a manner as to protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service. Suitability arises from the President's authority (subsequently delegated to OPM) to "ascertain the fitness of applicants as to...character" (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301) and is thus distinguishable from a person's ability to fulfill the qualification requirements of a job, as measured by experience, education, and competencies/KSAs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important to understand the difference between determining an applicant's suitability and determining his or her qualifications. For example, a person who is well qualified for a position may nonetheless be deemed unsuitable for Federal employment due to factors listed in the suitability criteria, such as misconduct or negligence in prior employment (5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.202). Under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.103(d), however, a hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal and/or adverse credit background of the sort asked on the OF306, Declaration for Federal Employment, or other forms used to conduct background investigations for Federal employment unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. You may make inquiries, however, into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In certain situations, an agency may have a business need (i.e., a reason related to the requirements for the position or particularly burdensome cost) to obtain the above information about the suitability or background of an applicant prior to the conditional offer. In such cases, an agency must request an exception from OPM, in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR part 330 subpart M. (See CHCO Memo, Guidance on Requests for Exceptions to Timing of Suitability Inquiries Rule, dated February 15, 2017, at <a href="https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidancerequests-exceptions-timing-suitability-inquiries-rule">https://www.chcoc.gov/content/guidancerequests-exceptions-timing-suitability-inquiries-rule</a>.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR part 731, agencies have the responsibility to adjudicate suitability issues in cases involving tentative selectees (or, in exceptional situations, candidates) for competitive service positions, except where any of the following issues arise from the background investigation, in which event, the case must be referred to OPM for a determination of suitability (5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.103(d)(2):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Cases involving evidence of:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x2022; Cases involving refusal to furnish testimony as required by 5 CFR &#x00A7; 5.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Agencies must also refer a case to OPM when the agency determines that a Governmentwide debarment by OPM under &#x00A7; 731.204(a) may be an appropriate action (5 CFR &#x00A7; 731.103(b)(2)).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Suitability determinations are significant in the federal employment scheme. If an individual is deemed unsuitable for federal employment, adverse consequences often result, including removal from employment and, possibly, a bar for a given period of time to an individual's ability to apply for or to accept federal employment. For applicants for federal jobs, a negative suitability determination prevents further consideration of the applicant and may also bar the applicant's ability to reapply for federal jobs a period of time. A good descriptions of the suitability process are provided by the "Department of Defense Suitability and Fitness Guide," <a href="https://www.dhra.mil/Portals/52/Documents/perserec/DoD_Suitability_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf">https://www.dhra.mil/Portals/52/Documents/perserec/DoD_Suitability_Guide_Version_1.0.pdf</a>, and NASA's "Suitability Guide for Employees," <a href="https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/NSSC_suit_guide_for_employees.pdf?rhid=1000&did=6528641&type=released">https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/NSSC_suit_guide_for_employees.pdf?rhid=1000&did=6528641&type=released.</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Among the appeals the Board adjudicates are challenges to adverse suitability determinations made by OPM or by agencies with delegated examining from OPM. The regulatory scheme is designed to make determinations of suitability for employment in positions in the competitive service, in the Senior Executive Service, and, under 2008 regulations, in excepted service positions "where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the competitive service" (examples being Veterans Recruitment appointments under 5 CFR 307.103 <span id="Page_753"></span>and various student or intern appointments through the Pathways Programs, described at 5 CFR Part 362). 5 CFR 731.101 (2022). Ordinarily, a suitability determination is only made for an individual who is deemed eligible and qualified for a position. 5 CFR 731.103(d) (2022). When OPM takes a suitability action, the procedures at 5 CFR 731.301-04 (2022) are followed. If an agency initiates a suitability action, the procedures at 5 CFR 731.401-04 (2022) are followed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 97 MSPR 395 (2004) (noting the two procedures). Suitability actions take two forms: individuals may be barred from consideration or appointment in the federal service; individuals who have become employed, subject to the procedures later described, may be removed from their federal positions. [Refer to Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-002.html#sec6-3">Cancelation of Appointment, Promotion</a>," and Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-094.html#sec8-94">Lack of Suitability for Continued Employment</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Harpe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0731-11-0186-I-1 (NP 11/15/2011), described the nature of a suitability action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, an unsuccessful candidate for a federal civil service position has no right to appeal his nonselection. <span class="Italic">Tines v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 90, 93 (1992). Nevertheless, pursuant to Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations at 5 C.F.R. part 731, the Board has jurisdiction over certain matters involving "suitability" for federal employment. <span class="Italic">See Upshaw v. Consumer Product Safety Commission</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 236, &#x00B6; 7 (2009). A suitability determination focuses upon whether the individual's character or conduct is such that his employment by the agency would adversely affect the integrity or efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 8 (2009). Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.501(a), only a "suitability action" may be appealed to the Board, with a "suitability action" being defined as a cancellation of eligibility, a removal, a cancellation of reinstatement eligibility, or a debarment. <span class="Italic">See Kazan v.

OPM's regulations specify that a nonselection for a specific position is not a "suitability action," even if it is based on the criteria for making suitability determinations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. <span class="Italic">See Kazan</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 390, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.203(b).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As part of its examining authority, OPM conducts investigations of applicants for employment, as well as of "appointees" and "employees" under certain circumstances, to determine their suitability, in accordance with 5 CFR Part 731 (2022). OPM may initiate removal and debarment actions based on the results of its investigations, and OPM may delegate the authority to conduct suitability investigations and determinations to agencies. The OPM suitability regulations were rewritten and reissued in 2008 and those regulations restricted some previously-exercised authority of the MSPB to set aside or modify suitability determinations. OPM regulations give agencies the authority to request information from the employee bearing on suitability, including the authority to have the employee fill out forms SF-86 and OF-306. <span class="Italic">McFalls v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.101 <span class="Italic">Purpose.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The purpose of this part is to establish criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability and for taking suitability actions regarding employment in covered positions (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 3301, E.O. 10577 (3 CFR, 1954-1958 Comp., p. 218), as amended, and 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2. Section 3301 of title 5, United States Code, directs consideration of "age, health, character, knowledge, and ability for the employment sought." E.O. 10577 (codified in relevant part at 5 CFR 1.1, 2.1(a) and 5.2) directs OPM to examine "suitability" for competitive Federal employment. This part concerns only determinations of "suitability," that is, those determinations based on a person's character or conduct that may have an impact on the integrity or efficiency of the service. Determinations made and actions taken under this part are distinct from objections to eligibles or pass overs of preference eligibles, and OPM's and agencies' decisions on such requests, made under 5 U.S.C. 3318 and 5 CFR 332.406, as well as determinations of eligibility for assignment to, or retention in, sensitive national security positions made under E.O. 10450 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 936), E.O. 12968, or similar authorities.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Days</span> means calendar days unless otherwise specified in this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Employee</span> means a person who has completed the first year of a subject-to-investigation appointment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_754"></span>(a)&#x2003;An investigation conducted for the purpose of determining suitability under this part may not be used for any other purpose except as provided in a Privacy Act system of records notice published by the agency conducting the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Under OMB Circular No. A-130 Revised, issued November 20, 2000, agencies are to implement and maintain a program to ensure that adequate protection is provided for all automated information systems. Agency personnel screening programs may be based on procedures developed by OPM. The Computer Security Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-235) provides additional requirements for Federal automated information systems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;OPM may set forth policies, procedures, criteria, standards, quality control procedures, and supplementary guidance for the implementation of this part in OPM issuances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.103 <span class="Italic">Delegation to agencies.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the limitations and requirements of paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, OPM delegates to the heads of agencies authority for making suitability determinations and taking suitability actions (including limited, agency-specific debarments under &#x00A7; 731.205) in cases involving <span class="Italic">applicants</span> for and <span class="Italic">appointees</span> to covered positions in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;When an agency, acting under delegated authority from OPM, determines that a Governmentwide debarment by OPM under &#x00A7; 731.204(a) may be an appropriate action, it must refer the case to OPM for debarment consideration. Agencies must make these referrals prior to any proposed suitability action, but only after sufficient resolution of the suitability issue(s), through subject contact or investigation, to determine if a Governmentwide debarment appears warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Agencies exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM must adhere to OPM requirements as stated in this part and OPM's issuances described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c). Agencies must also implement policies and maintain records demonstrating that they employ reasonable methods to ensure adherence to these OPM issuances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)(1)&#x2003;&#x2003; A hiring agency may not make specific inquiries concerning an applicant's criminal or credit background of the sort asked on the OF-306 or other forms used to conduct suitability investigations for Federal employment (i.e., inquiries into an applicant's criminal or adverse credit history) unless the hiring agency has made a conditional offer of employment to the applicant. Agencies may make inquiries into an applicant's Selective Service registration, military service, citizenship status, or previous work history, prior to making a conditional offer of employment to an applicant. However, in certain situations, agencies may have a business need to obtain information about the suitability or background of applicants earlier in the process. If so, agencies must request an exception from the Office of Personnel Management, in accordance with the provisions of 5 CFR part 330 subpart M.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;OPM reserves the right to undertake a determination of suitability based upon evidence of falsification or fraud relating to an examination or appointment at any point when information giving rise to such a charge is discovered. OPM must be informed in all cases where there is evidence of material, intentional false statements, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment, and OPM will take a suitability action where warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;When an agency, exercising authority under this part by delegation from OPM, makes a suitability determination or changes a tentative favorable placement decision to an unfavorable decision, based on an OPM report of investigation or upon an investigation conducted pursuant to OPM-delegated authority, the agency must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Ensure that the records used in making the determination are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to the extent reasonably necessary to ensure fairness to the person in any determination;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Ensure that all applicable administrative procedural requirements provided by law, the regulations in this part, and OPM issuances as described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c) have been observed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Consider all available information in reaching its final decision on a suitability determination or suitability action, except information furnished by a non-corroborated confidential source, which may be used only for limited purposes, such as information used to develop a lead or in interrogatories to a subject, if the identity of the source is not compromised in any way; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Keep any record of the agency suitability determination or action as required by OPM issuances as described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;OPM may revoke an agency's delegation to make suitability determinations and take suitability actions under this part if an agency fails to conform to this part or OPM issuances as described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;OPM retains jurisdiction to make final determinations and take actions in all suitability cases where there is evidence that there has been a material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment. OPM also retains jurisdiction over all suitability cases involving a refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter. Agencies must refer these cases to OPM for suitability determinations and suitability actions under this authority. Although no prior approval is needed, notification to OPM is required if the agency wants to take, or has taken, action under its own authority (5 CFR part 315, 5 CFR part 359, or 5 CFR part 752) in cases involving material, intentional false statement in examination or appointment, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment; or refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this title. In addition, paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding, OPM may, in its discretion, exercise its jurisdiction under this part in any case it deems necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.104 <span class="Italic">Appointments subject to investigation.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;To establish a person's suitability for employment, appointments to covered positions identified in &#x00A7; 731.101 require the person to undergo an investigation by OPM or by an agency with delegated authority from OPM to conduct investigations. However, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2), an appointment will not be subject to investigation when the person being appointed has undergone a background investigation and the appointment involves:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Appointment or conversion to an appointment in a covered position if the person has been serving continuously with the agency for at least 1 year in one or more covered positions subject to investigation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Transfer to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a covered position subject to investigation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Transfer or appointment from an excepted service position that is not a covered position to a covered position, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a position where the person has been determined fit for appointment based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Appointment to a covered position from a position as an employee working as a Federal Government contract employee, provided the person has been serving continuously for at least 1 year in a job where a Federal agency determined the contract employee was fit to perform work on the contract based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Appointment to a covered position where there has been a break in service of less than 24 months, and the service immediately preceding the break was in a covered position, an excepted service position, or a contract employee position described in paragraphs (a)(1) to (a)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;(1) Either OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority may investigate and take a suitability action against an applicant, appointee, or employee in accordance with &#x00A7; 731.105. There is no time limit on the authority of OPM or an agency with delegated suitability authority to conduct the required investigation of an applicant who has been appointed to a position. An employee does not have to serve a new probationary or trial period merely because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section. An employee's probationary or trial period is not extended because his or her appointment is subject to investigation under this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;An appointment to a covered position also will be subject to investigation when:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;The covered position requires a higher level of investigation than previously conducted for the person being appointed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;An agency obtains new information in connection with the person's appointment that calls into question the person's suitability under &#x00A7; 731.202;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Suitability determinations must be made for all appointments that are subject to investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Positions that are intermittent, seasonal, per diem, or temporary, not to exceed an aggregate of 180 days per year in either a single continuous appointment or series of appointments, do not require a background investigation as described in &#x00A7; 731.106(c)(1). The employing agency, however, must conduct such checks as it deems appropriate to ensure the suitability of the person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Reinvestigation requirements under &#x00A7; 731.106 for public trust positions are not affected by this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;For purposes of this section, "criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR 731.202" are criteria that provide adequate assurance that the person to be appointed, converted to an appointment, or transferred is suitable to be employed in a covered position, as determined by OPM, in issuances under this regulation. A decision by OPM, or by an agency applying guidance from OPM, that a prior fitness determination was not based on criteria equivalent to the factors provided at 5 CFR <span id="Page_755"></span>731.202, and that a new investigation or adjudication is necessary is not subject to review under section 731.501 of this part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.105 <span class="Italic">Authority to take suitability actions.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Neither OPM nor an agency acting under delegated authority may take a suitability action in connection with any application for, or appointment to, a position that is not subject to investigation or check under &#x00A7; 731.104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an <span class="Italic">applicant</span> or <span class="Italic">appointee</span> based on any of the criteria of &#x00A7; 731.202;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Except as limited by &#x00A7; 731.103(g), an agency, exercising delegated authority, may take a suitability action under this part against an <span class="Italic">applicant</span> or <span class="Italic">appointee</span> based on the criteria of &#x00A7; 731.202;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;OPM may take a suitability action under this part against an <span class="Italic">employee</span> based on the criteria of &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(3), (4), or (8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;An agency may not take a suitability action against an <span class="Italic">employee</span>. Nothing in this part precludes an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee under the procedures and standards of part 752 of this chapter or terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of part 315 or part 359 of this chapter. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in &#x00A7; 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.106 <span class="Italic">Designation of public trust positions and investigative requirements.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Risk designation</span>. Agency heads must designate every covered position within the agency at a high, moderate, or low risk level as determined by the position's potential for adverse impact to the efficiency or integrity of the service. OPM will provide an example of a risk designation system for agency use in an OPM issuance as described in &#x00A7; 731.102(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Public Trust positions</span>. Positions at the high or moderate risk levels would normally be designated as "Public Trust" positions. Such positions may involve policy making, major program responsibility, public safety and health, law enforcement duties, fiduciary responsibilities or other duties demanding a significant degree of public trust, and positions involving access to or operation or control of financial records, with a significant risk for causing damage or realizing personal gain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Investigative requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Persons receiving an appointment made subject to investigation under this part must undergo a background investigation. OPM is authorized to establish minimum investigative requirements correlating to risk levels. Investigations should be initiated before appointment but no later than 14 calendar days after placement in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;All positions subject to investigation under this part must also receive a sensitivity designation of Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive, when appropriate. This designation is complementary to the risk designation, and may have an effect on the position's investigative requirement. Sections 732.201 and 732.202 of this chapter detail the various sensitivity levels and investigative requirements. Procedures for determining investigative requirements for all positions based upon risk and sensitivity will be published in OPM issuances, as described in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.102(c) and 732.201(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;If suitability issues develop prior to the required investigation, OPM or the agency may conduct an investigation sufficient to resolve the issues and support a suitability determination or action, if warranted. If the person is appointed, the minimum level of investigation must be conducted as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reinvestigation requirements</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Agencies must ensure that reinvestigations are conducted and a determination made regarding continued employment of persons occupying public trust positions at least once every 5 years. The nature of these reinvestigations and any additional requirements and parameters will be established in supplemental guidance issued by OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;If, prior to the next required reinvestigation, a separate investigation is conducted to determine a person's eligibility (or continued eligibility) for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position, or as a result of a change in risk level as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, and that investigation meets or exceeds the requirements for a public trust reinvestigation, a new public trust reinvestigation is not required. Such a completed investigation restarts the cycle for a public trust reinvestigation for that person.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Agencies must notify all employees covered by this section of the reinvestigation requirements under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Risk level changes</span>. If an employee or appointee experiences a change to a higher position risk level due to promotion, demotion, or reassignment, or the risk level of the employee's or appointee's position is changed to a higher level, the employee or appointee may remain in or encumber the position. Any upgrade in the investigation required for the new risk level should be initiated within 14 calendar days after the promotion, demotion, reassignment or new designation of risk level is final.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Completed investigations</span>. Any suitability investigation (or reinvestigation) completed by an agency under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section must result in a determination by the employing agency of whether the findings of the investigation would justify an action under this part or under another applicable authority, such as part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter. Section 731.103 addresses whether an agency may take an action under this part, and whether the matter must be referred to OPM for debarment consideration.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.201 <span class="Italic">Standard.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard for a suitability action defined in &#x00A7; 731.203 and taken against an applicant, appointee, or employee is that the action will protect the integrity or promote the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.202 <span class="Italic">Criteria for making suitability determinations</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">General</span>. OPM, or an agency to which OPM has delegated authority, must base its suitability determination on the presence or absence of one or more of the specific factors (charges) in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Specific factors</span>. In determining whether a person is suitable for Federal employment, only the following factors will be considered a basis for finding a person unsuitable and taking a suitability action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Misconduct or negligence in employment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Criminal or dishonest conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Material, intentional false statement, or deception or fraud in examination or appointment;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;Alcohol abuse, without evidence of substantial rehabilitation, of a nature and duration that suggests that the applicant or appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of the position in question, or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of the applicant or appointee or others;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Illegal use of narcotics, drugs, or other controlled substances without evidence of substantial rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Knowing and willful engagement in acts or activities designed to overthrow the U.S. Government by force; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_756"></span>(8)&#x2003;Any statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the lawful employment of the person involved in the position in question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Additional considerations</span>. OPM and agencies must consider any of the following additional considerations to the extent OPM or the relevant agency, in its sole discretion, deems any of them pertinent to the individual case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The nature of the position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The nature and seriousness of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The circumstances surrounding the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The recency of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;The age of the person involved at the time of the conduct;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Contributing societal conditions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reciprocity.</span> An agency cannot make a new determination under this section for a person who has already been determined suitable or fit based on character or conduct unless a new investigation is required under &#x00A7; 731.104 or &#x00A7; 731.106, or no new investigation is required but the investigative record on file for the person shows conduct that is incompatible with the core duties of the relevant covered position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">&#x00A7; 731.203 <span class="Italic">Suitability actions by OPM and other agencies.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For purposes of this part, a suitability action is one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Cancellation of eligibility;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Cancellation of reinstatement eligibility; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Debarment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A non-selection, or cancellation of eligibility for a specific position based on an objection to an eligible or pass over of a preference eligible under 5 CFR 332.406, is <span class="Italic">not</span> a suitability action even if it is based on reasons set forth in &#x00A7; 731.202.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_757"></span>(c)&#x2003;A suitability action may be taken against an applicant or an appointee when OPM or an agency exercising delegated authority under this part finds that the applicant or appointee is unsuitable for the reasons cited in &#x00A7; 731.202, subject to the agency limitations of &#x00A7; 731.103(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;OPM may require that an appointee or an employee be removed on the basis of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment; refusal to furnish testimony as required by &#x00A7; 5.4 of this chapter; or a statutory or regulatory bar which prevents the person's lawful employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;OPM may cancel any reinstatement eligibility obtained as a result of a material, intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;An action to remove an appointee or employee <span class="Italic">for suitability reasons</span> under this part is not an action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter. Where behavior covered by this part may also form the basis for an action under parts 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter, an agency may take the action under part 315, 359, or 752 of this chapter, as appropriate, instead of under this part. An agency must notify OPM to the extent required in &#x00A7; 731.103(g) if it wants to take, or has taken, action under these authorities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;Agencies do not need approval from OPM before taking unfavorable suitability actions. However, they are required to report to OPM all unfavorable suitability actions taken under this part within 30 days after they take the action.

<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;OPM may impose an additional period of debarment following the expiration of a period of OPM or agency debarment, but only after the person again becomes an applicant, appointee, or employee subject to OPM's suitability jurisdiction, and his or her suitability is determined in accordance with the procedures of this part. An additional debarment period may be based in whole or in part on the same conduct on which the previous suitability action was based, when warranted, or new conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;OPM, in its sole discretion, determines the duration of any period of debarment imposed under this section.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 CFR 731.201, OPM may direct an employing agency to remove an employee when OPM determines the action will promote the efficiency of the service. That determination is made on the basis of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, whether the conduct at issue may reasonably be expected to interfere with, or prevent, efficient service in the employee's position or whether the conduct may reasonably be expected to interfere with, or prevent, effective accomplishment of the employing agency's duties and responsibilities. 5 CFR 731.202(a).

Dept. of the Treasury,</span> 73 MSPR 159, 167 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulations specify factors to consider in making such a determination, including criminal or dishonest conduct related to the employee's service in the position or the service of other employees, intentional false statement or deception in examination or appointment, and alcohol abuse of a nature and duration which suggests that the appointee would be prevented from performing the duties of his position or would constitute a direct threat to the property or safety of others. 5 CFR 731.202(b)(2), (3), and (5). Additional factors to consider include the kind of position the employee holds, including the degree of public trust or risk in the position, the nature and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, the recency of the conduct, the age of the employee at the time of the conduct, contributing societal conditions, and the absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation. 5 CFR 731.202(c).</p>

After those due process procedures are initiated and exhausted, the individual who has been deemed unsuitable may appeal to the MSPB. Before 2001, OPM regulations permitted an agency to retain an employee or an appointee in active duty status pending adjudication of his or her MSPB appeal. 5 CFR 731.501(c).

Cir. 2003 NP) (describing suitability adjudication standards); <span class="Italic">Gizzarelli v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GIZZARELLI_JOYCE_L_DC_0752_95_0447_C_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249902.pdf">90 MSPR 269</a> (2001) (Chairman Slavet dissenting) (describing the significance of suitability investigations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A suitability determination is a specific agency administrative determination. A suitability determination does not occur when an employee is simply not selected for a job or the application process goes awry. <span class="Italic">Atanus v. MSPB,</span> 186 Fed. Appx. 993, 995 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A suitability determination involves a finding that an individual has been found suitable or unsuitable for employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.531(a). The Board's jurisdiction over challenges to such determinations is limited to actions by "employees" and "applicants." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.3(a)(7). An "applicant" is defined as "a person being considered for employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b). The record and pleadings indicate that Atanus, whose application was filed late and by an unauthorized method, was never considered for employment by the SEC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Even if Atanus were an "applicant" for purposes of the regulation, the Board lacked jurisdiction over her appeal, because she has identified no agency action that could plausibly be considered a suitability determination. Suitability determinations--which are required for competitive federal employment by Executive Order,<span class="Italic"> see</span> Executive Order 10577 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101--may by regulation consider only enumerated factors, including "misconduct or negligence in employment," criminal conduct, deception, alcohol and drug abuse, violent anti-government activities, and regulatory or statutory bars to employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202. The events she describes as constituting a suitability determination--including the Avue help desk's failure to return her call reporting technical difficulties on December 22, 2004, and the SEC's failure to respond to her post-December 30 communications--are simply unrelated to her suitability for employment. We therefore affirm the Board's dismissal of Atanus's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">The suitability appeal is limited to the facts before the Board. The AJ may not direct OPM on how it should consider a future employment application. <span class="Italic">Sosa v. OPM</span>, 101 MSPR 583, 585 &#x00B6; 7, 2006 MSPB 101 (2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulations make clear that, although an agency may be required to notify OPM when there are suitability reasons for acting against an employee, the agency is free to act under adverse action procedures or under termination procedures applicable to probationers. The notification is intended to permit OPM to decide whether to bring its own action to debar the employee from future employment for a period of time. [Refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-094.html#sec8-94">Lack of Suitability for Continued Employment</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The OPM regulations reserve to OPM the right initiate suitability actions against employees for specified reasons, even after their first year of employment, and even if agencies would prefer that no action be taken. OPM's position was explained in comments accompanying the 2008 regulatory revisions, at 73 Fed. Reg. 20149 (April 15, 2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One commenter stated that OPM should eliminate employees and appointees who have successfully completed twelve months of Federal service from coverage of the suitability regulations. The commenter stated that this change would eliminate the "collision" between OPM suitability regulations and the statutes that govern employees who have completed their probationary periods. The commenter also argued that this change would preserve agencies' discretion to take adverse actions and avoid the hardship when OPM initiates action to remove a long-term employee for suitability reasons when the agency may want to keep that employee. OPM declines to make these changes to the regulations for a number of reasons. As an initial matter, there is no collision of employee rights upon completion of a probationary period and OPM's suitability regulations. Suitability actions for persons who have become employees as defined by this part can be initiated only by OPM, and the bases for judging a person unsuitable and removing that person after the first year of employment are limited to material intentional false statement, deception or fraud in examination or appointment; refusal to furnish testimony; or a statutory or regulatory bar to employment. The commenter's recommendation would eliminate OPM's ability to take appropriate suitability actions merely because the individual has been employed for 12 months. However, mere completion of 12 months of service cannot shield a person from the consequences of, for example, making material, intentional false statements in order to obtain a position with the Federal Government. This would undermine the integrity of the Federal employment process.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 72, 74 (1984) ("The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is vested with authority to make suitability determinations, and under this authority OPM may deny an applicant examination or an eligible appointment if it determines that such action would promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Mattson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Of the evolution of suitability appeals, <span class="Italic">Parkinson v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 316, 320 n.2 (1996), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations in effect on October 13, 1994, an individual found unsuitable for competitive-service employment could appeal that determination to an OPM Review Panel. 5 CFR 731.503 (1994). An unfavorable Review Panel decision was appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 731.508(a) (1994).
