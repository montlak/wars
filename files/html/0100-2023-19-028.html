<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-28"><span class="space">2.</span> Analysis Following the <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Prima Facie</span></span> Case</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant demonstrates a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, the agency must then offer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for its action to dispel the inference of discrimination created by the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. The appellant then attempts to demonstrate that the reason offered by the agency is false, that is, that the employer's stated basis for its action is a pretext for discrimination. Supreme Court clarification was provided by <span class="Italic">Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc.</span>, 120 S. Ct. 2097, 2105-09 (2000), an age discrimination case. In <span class="Italic">Reeves</span> the Court concluded that the trier of fact should take into account all of the plaintiff's (and defendant's) evidence, including the evidence supporting the <span class="Italic">prima facie case</span>, in assessing whether an intent to discriminate has been established. This intention need not be express but may be implied from the circumstances of the employment action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3348"></span>Under the ADEA, it is "unlawful for an employer...to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's age." 29 USC &#x00A7; 623(a)(1). When a plaintiff alleges disparate treatment, "liability depends on whether the protected trait (under the ADEA, age) actually motivated the employer's decision." <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins</span>, 507 U.S. 604, 610 (1993). That is, the plaintiff's age must have "actually played a role in [the employer's decisionmaking] process and had a determinative influence on the outcome." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. Recognizing that "the question facing triers of fact in discrimination cases is both sensitive and difficult," and that "[t]here will seldom be 'eyewitness' testimony as to the employer's mental processes," <span class="Italic">Postal Service Bd of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983), the Courts of Appeals, including the Fifth Circuit in this case, have employed some variant of the framework articulated in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> to analyze ADEA claims that are based principally on circumstantial evidence....&#8197;This Court has not squarely addressed whether the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework, developed to assess claims brought under &#x00A7; 703(a)(1) of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(a)(1), also applies to ADEA actions. Because the parties do not dispute the issue, we shall assume, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework is fully applicable here....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> and subsequent decisions have "established an allocation of the burden of production and an order for the presentation of proof in...discriminatory-treatment cases." <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 506 (1993). First, the plaintiff must establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination<span class="Italic">. Ibid</span>,; <span class="Italic">Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 252-253 (1981). It is undisputed that petitioner satisfied this burden here: (i) at the time he was fired, he was a member of the class protected by the ADEA ("Individuals who are at least 40 years of age," 29 USC &#x00A7; 631(a)), (ii) he was otherwise qualified for the position of Hinge Room supervisor, (iii) he was discharged by respondent, and (iv) respondent successively hired three persons in their thirties to fill petitioner's position<span class="Italic">. See</span> 197 F.3d, at 691-692. The burden therefore shifted to respondent to "produc[e] evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 254. This burden is one of production, not persuasion; it "can involve no credibility assessment." <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 509. Respondent met this burden by offering admissible evidence sufficient for the trier of fact to conclude that petitioner was fired because of his failure to maintain accurate attendance records<span class="Italic">. See</span> 197 F.3d, at 692. Accordingly, "the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework--with its presumptions and burdens "--disappeared, <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 510, and the sole remaining issue was "discrimination vel non," <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 714.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although intermediate evidentiary burdens shift back and forth under this framework, "[t]he ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, 450 U.S., at 253. And in attempting to satisfy this burden, the plaintiff--once the employer produces sufficient evidence to support a nondiscriminatory explanation for its decision--must be afforded the "opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 507-508. That is, the plaintiff may attempt to establish that he was the victim of intentional discrimination "by showing that the employer's proffered explanation is unworthy of credence." <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 256. Moreover, although the presumption of discrimination "drops out of the picture" once the defendant meets its burden of production, <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 511, the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case "and inferences properly drawn therefrom...on the issue of whether the defendant's explanation is pretextual," <span class="Italic">Burdine</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 255, n.10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the evidence supporting respondent's explanation for petitioner's discharge consisted primarily of testimony by Chesnut and Sanderson and documentation of petitioner's alleged "shoddy record keeping." 197 F.3d, at 692....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner, however, made a substantial showing that respondent's explanation was false....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this evidence, the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner "very well may be correct" that "a reasonable jury could have found that [respondent's] explanation for its employment decision was pretextual." 197 F.3d, at 693. Nonetheless, the court held that this showing, standing alone, was insufficient to sustain the jury's finding of liability: "We must, as an essential final step, determine whether Reeves presented sufficient evidence that his age motivated [respondent's] employment decision." <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. And in making this determination, the Court of Appeals ignored the evidence supporting petitioner's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and challenging respondent's explanation for its decision<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>, at 693-694. The court confined its review of evidence favoring petitioner to that evidence showing that Chesnut had directed derogatory, age-based comments at petitioner, and that Chesnut had singled out petitioner for harsher treatment than younger employees<span class="Italic">. See ibid</span>. It is therefore apparent that the court believed that only this additional evidence of discrimination was relevant to whether the jury's verdict should stand. That is, the Court of Appeals proceeded from the assumption that a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, combined with sufficient evidence for the trier of fact to disbelieve the defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a jury's finding of intentional discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so reasoning, the Court of Appeals misconceived the evidentiary burden borne by plaintiffs who attempt to prove intentional discrimination through indirect evidence. This much is evident from our decision in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>. There we held that the factfinder's rejection of the employer's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action does not compel judgment for the plaintiff. 509 U.S., at 511. The ultimate question is whether the employer intentionally discriminated, and proof that "the employer's proffered reason is unpersuasive, or even obviously contrived, does not necessarily establish that the plaintiff's proffered reason...is correct." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 524. In other words, "[i]t is not enough...to disbelieve the employer; the factfinder must believe the plaintiff's explanation of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 519.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, however, we reasoned that it is permissible for the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of discrimination from the falsity of the employer's explanation. Specifically, we stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"The factfinder's disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, suffice to show intentional discrimination. Thus, rejection of the defendant's proffered reasons will permit the trier of fact to infer the ultimate fact of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 511.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Proof that the defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it may be quite persuasive<span class="Italic">. See id.</span>, at 517 ("[P]roving the employer's reason false becomes part of (and often considerably assists) the greater enterprise of proving that the real reason was intentional discrimination"). In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose. Such an inference is consistent with the general principle of evidence law that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party's dishonesty about a material fact as "affirmative evidence of guilt." <span class="Italic">Wright v. West</span>, 505 U.S. 277, 296 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. United States</span>, 162 U.S. 613, 620-621 (1896); 2 J. Wigmore, <span class="Italic">Evidence</span> &#x00A7; 278(2), p. 133 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1979). Moreover, once the employer's justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision. <span class="Italic">Cf. Furnco Constr. Corp. v. Waters</span>, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978) ("[W]hen all legitimate reasons for rejecting an applicant have been eliminated as possible reasons for the employer's actions, it is more likely than not the employer, who we generally assume acts with some reason, based his decision on an impermissible consideration"). Thus, a plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer's asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is not to say that such a showing by the plaintiff will always be adequate to sustain a jury's finding of liability. Certainly there will be instances where, although the plaintiff has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and set forth sufficient evidence to reject the defendant's explanation, no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory. For instance, an employer would be entitled to judgment as a matter of law if the record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer's decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer's reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred<span class="Italic">. See Aka v. Washington Hospital Center</span>, 156 F.3d, at 1291-1292; <span class="Italic">see also Fisher v. Vassar College</span>, 114 F.3d, at 1338 ("[I]f the circumstances show that the defendant gave the false explanation to conceal something other than discrimination, the inference of discrimination will be weak or nonexistent"). To hold otherwise would be effectively to insulate an entire category of employment discrimination cases from review under Rule 50, and we have reiterated that trial courts should not "'treat discrimination differently from other ultimate questions of fact.'" <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 524 (quoting <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, 460 U.S., at 716).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether judgment as a matter of law is appropriate in any particular case will depend on a number of factors. Those include the strength of the plaintiff's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the probative value of the proof that the employer's explanation is false, and any other evidence that supports <span id="Page_3349"></span>the employer's case and that properly may be considered on a motion for judgment as a matter of law<span class="Italic">. See infra</span>, at 15-16. For purposes of this case, we need not--and could not--resolve all of the circumstances in which such factors would entitle an employer to judgment as a matter of law. It suffices to say that, because a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case and sufficient evidence to reject the employer's explanation may permit a finding of liability, the Court of Appeals erred in proceeding from the premise that a plaintiff must always introduce additional, independent evidence of discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There have been many Board decisions outlining the burden and order of proof applied to EEO affirmative defenses. A relatively recent rendition is <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, PH-0752-14-0438-I-2 (NP 11/29/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant asserts an affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, the Board first will inquire whether the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28, 30 (2016); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51 (2015). Such a showing is sufficient to establish that the agency violated 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16, thereby committing a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Naval Station Norfolk Hearing 2 v. Department of the Navy</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 144, &#x00B6; 28 (2016); <span class="Italic">see Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. If the appellant meets his burden, the Board then will inquire whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the action was not based on the prohibited personnel practice, i.e., that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Naval Station Norfolk Hearing 2</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 144, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. If the Board finds that the agency has made that showing, its violation of 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16 will not require reversal of the action. <span class="Italic">Naval Station Norfolk Hearing 2</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 144, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Simien v. USPS</span>, 99 MSPR 237, 248-49 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-28 (2005), suggested a direct analytical approach in both discrimination and reprisal cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge began his analysis of the appellant's reprisal claim by reciting the three-part burden-shifting approach for assessing the sufficiency of a discrimination claim under <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802&#8209;04 (1973), and discussing the elements of a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" of retaliation for filing a complaint of discrimination. This appeal has already gone to a hearing, however, and the record is complete. Based on <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 714-15 (1983), the Board has held that after a hearing has been held, a claim of discrimination should not be analyzed under the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> framework. Instead, the administrative judge (or the full Board, as the case may be) should weigh the evidence and make a finding on the ultimate issue, which is whether the action under appeal was discriminatory. <span class="Italic">Schrodt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 609, 616 (1998); <span class="Italic">Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 51 (1998); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 49, 55 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite these decisions, the Board has continued to analyze retaliation claims asserted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) that have gone to a hearing according to a step-wise, multi-part approach. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 572 &#x00B6; 8 (2000); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 450 &#x00B6; 9 (1998). This multi-part framework is actually an assessment of whether the appellant has made out a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" of retaliation. <span class="Italic">Murry v. General Services Administration</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 560 &#x00B6; 6 (2003). Once both parties have put on all their evidence, though, in light of <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, the factfinder should not inquire into whether the employee (appellant) has made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of retaliation. <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kohler Co</span>., 335 F.3d 766, 772 (8th Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Coffey v. Dobbs International Service, Inc.</span>, 170 F.3d 323, 326 (2nd Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, it is appropriate to bring the Board's approach to retaliation claims under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) in line with its approach to discrimination claims. We hold that where, as here, the case has gone to a hearing and the evidentiary record is complete, an administrative judge (or the full Board) will not inquire into whether the action under review "could have been" retaliatory, <span class="Italic">Taylor</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 450 &#x00B6; 9, whether the appellant has made out a "<span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case" of retaliation, <span class="Italic">Murry</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 560 &#x00B6; 6, or whether some other threshold of proof has been met so as to shift the burden to the agency. Rather, the inquiry proceeds to the ultimate question, which is whether, upon weighing the evidence presented by both parties, the appellant has met his overall burden of proving retaliation under section 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kohler Co</span>., 335 F.3d at 772; <span class="Italic">Bryant v. Aiken Regional Medical Centers, Inc.</span>, 333 F.3d 536, 543 (4th Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">Cullom v. Brown</span>, 209 F.3d 1035, 1039 n.3 (7th Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">Coffey</span>, 170 F.3d at 326; <span class="Italic">Jack v. Texaco Research Center</span>, 743 F.2d 1129, 1131 (5th Cir. 1984). We now turn to that ultimate question.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 46, 50-53 (1998), involving an affirmative defense of disability discrimination, interpreted <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 103 S. Ct. 1478 (1983), to mean that once the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case is established, the order for production of evidence is no longer an issue:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the analytical framework used by the administrative judge, the Board in its prior decision reviewed the evidence under the burden-shifting analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973), and <span class="Italic">Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine</span>, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S. Ct. 1089 (1981), to find that the appellant made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination and had proven her affirmative defense<span class="Italic">. See Jackson</span>, 73 MSPR at 520. The Board held that the administrative judge "correctly concluded that the appellant satisfied the first two elements of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case (that she is a "handicapped person" under 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(a) and that the removal is based on the disability)," but that the administrative judge "erred in finding that the appellant failed to satisfy the third element, articulation of a reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board then found that the appellant had articulated a reasonable accommodation, in particular, she had been "examined for fitness for duty as a Mail Processor," and the examining physician had concluded that she "could perform the job with only two restrictions ('no contact with chemicals; wear well-ventilated shoes')." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 521. The Board stated: "We find that this constitutes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing by the appellant of an ability to perform the essential functions of the job with some reasonable accommodation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our legal analysis was flawed, however, because it failed to take into account that at the stage of the administrative proceeding at which the Board reviewed the case, the order for presentation of evidence and allocation of the burden of production was no longer at issue. Thus, in <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens</span>, 460 U.S. 711, 103 S. Ct. 1478 (1983), the Supreme Court stated that when a case is past that stage of the proceedings where the parties have presented their evidence on the discrimination issue, the rebuttable presumption created by the establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case "'drops from the case.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 715, 103 S. Ct. 1481. In <span class="Italic">Aikens</span>, the Supreme Court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">By establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the plaintiff in a Title VII action creates a rebuttable "presumption that the employer unlawfully discriminated against" him. To rebut this presumption, "the defendant must clearly set forth, through the introduction of admissible evidence, the reasons for the plaintiff's rejection." In other words, the defendant must "produc[e] evidence that the plaintiff was rejected, or someone else was preferred, for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">But when the defendant fails to persuade the district court to dismiss the action for lack of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, and responds to the plaintiff's proof by offering evidence of the reason for the plaintiff's rejection, the factfinder must then decide whether the rejection was discriminatory within the meaning of Title VII. At this stage, the <span class="Italic">McDonnell-Burdine</span> presumption "drops from the case," and "the factual inquiry proceeds to a new level of specificity."...&#8197;The District Court [is] then in a position to decide the ultimate factual issue in the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The "factual inquiry" in a Title VII case is "[whether] the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff."...&#8197;The <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case method established in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> was "never intended to be rigid, mechanized, or ritualistic. Rather, it is merely a sensible, orderly way to evaluate the evidence in light of common experience as it bears on the critical question of discrimination." Where the defendant has done everything that would be required of him if the plaintiff had properly made out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevant[;] [t]he district court has before it all the evidence it needs to decide whether "the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 714-15, 103 S. Ct. at 1481-82 (citations and footnotes omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court reiterated this principle in <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 509 U.S. 502, 113 S. Ct. 2742 (1993), stating that once the employer introduced evidence to rebut the employee's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, "the shifted burden of production became irrelevant" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507, 113 S. Ct. at 2747 (citations omitted). At that point, the "presumption, having fulfilled its role of forcing the [employer] to come forward with some response, simply drops out of the picture," and the trier of fact should decide, on the full record, whether the employee has met her ultimate burden of persuasion that the employer discriminated--a burden which, the Court noted, "remains at all times" with the employee<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 507, 511, 113 S. Ct. at 2747, 2749.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Aikens</span> and <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has held that, where the record is complete and a hearing has been held, it is unnecessary to follow the traditional burden-shifting order of analysis; rather, "the inquiry shifts from whether the complainant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case to whether s/he has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the agency's reason for its actions was. a pretext for discrimination." <span class="Italic">Pierce v. Social Security Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01961642, slip op. at 2 (Feb. 20, 1998); <span class="Italic">see also Jeffries v.

The EEOC and courts have adopted and applied Title VII burdens of proof to disability discrimination cases<span class="Italic">. See Kutyna v. National Aeronautics &#x0026; Space Administration</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01944637, slip op. at 3 (Dec. 4, 1995), and cases cited therein.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a disability discrimination case where the appellant seeks some form of accommodation, her <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case consists of a showing that she is a disabled person, and that the action appealed was based on her disability, and, to the extent possible, she must articulate a reasonable accommodation under which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant funded position to which she could be reassigned<span class="Italic">. See Sheehan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 493 (1995); <span class="Italic">Savage v. Department of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 148, 151-52 (1988). In disability discrimination cases, as in Title VII cases, once the agency submits evidence to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of discrimination, the <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case "'drops from the case,'" and the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proving that she was the victim of prohibited discrimination<span class="Italic">. Halperin v. Abacus Technology Corp.</span>, 128 F.3d 191, 196 (4th Cir. 1997) (quoting and citing <span class="Italic">Burdine</span> and <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>); <span class="Italic">see also Snow v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party has ever argued that the record was not fully developed when we issued our February 26, 1997 Opinion and Order. <span class="Italic">Cf. McDonnell Douglas</span>, 411 U.S. at 807, 93 S. Ct. at 1826-27 (the Court agreed with the employee that he was not afforded a fair opportunity to introduce evidence that the employer's stated reason for its refusal to reemploy him was a pretext for discrimination). But rather than engaging in a burden-shifting analysis, we should have instead reviewed the evidence to determine whether the appellant had met her burden of proving that the agency failed to offer her a vacant funded position that she could perform and which was at or below her current grade or level and in her commuting area, as required by 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(g)<span class="Italic">.
