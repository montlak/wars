<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-97"><span class="space">3.</span> Adequacy of PIP; Lack of Control of Work; Agency Bad Faith</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The opportunity to improve is a nullity if agency officials determine in advance that the appellant will fail. An opportunity to improve is denied if, because management assessed the employee's skills as inadequate even before the performance standards were developed, the appellant could do nothing to correct the performance that his supervisors constantly criticized through continual documentation of inconsequential conduct. <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 25 MSPR 213, 215 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 579 (1991) ("In this case, although the agency afforded the appellant a procedural opportunity to improve, the Board finds that the opportunity was not substantive. On one of the two Data Base element projects that the agency found unacceptable during the performance improvement period, the appellant did not receive the promised supervisory assistance. Further, the record as a whole establishes that the appellant's supervisors, by their actions before, during, and after the performance improvement period, revealed their predetermination that he was going to fail."); <span class="Italic">Adorador v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 461, 465 (1988) (no help was provided during the critical period of PIP from a supervisor who expressed the opinion that the appellant was incompetent and "should be gotten rid of"); <span class="Italic">Yetman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 425, 426 (1988) (unreasonable expectations, limitation of an employee's freedom of work, and constant criticism of the employee caused reversal of removal); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 204, 206-07 (1997) (comments by a supervisor and others suggesting the appellant would not survive a PIP did not invalidate the opportunity period when there was no evidence that the supervisor attempted to sabotage the appellant's performance required by the PIP); <span class="Italic">Beamon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 41 MSPR 525, 534 (1989) (supervisor's assessment of the appellant was poor, but there was no evidence of interference with her performance or a failure to provide assistance that would improve her performance); <span class="Italic">McCallon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 616, 619 (1988) (although the appellant testified that the proposing official told him of the deciding official's intent to remove him, the testimony was disputed and the appellant presented no supporting evidence; the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity period).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should the employee raise nonfrivolous allegations of bad faith and support those allegations through evidence, the AJ must carefully analyze the evidence in support of the defense. <span class="Italic">Beamon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 35 MSPR 15, 21-22 (1987) (testimony that an agency official stated that the PIP was only for documentation of the appellant's removal, and that the appellant would be removed following the PIP); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bonds v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 616, 618 (1987) (Chapter 75 case: the employee may defensively plead and prove the personal animus of his supervisor in a performance action). If an appellant commits the errors charged, prejudgment of the appellant by a supervisor may be of little consequence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beamon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 41 MSPR 525, 533-34 (1989) (no interference with the appellant's work; close scrutiny did not equate to bad faith); <span class="italic">cf. Brookins v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0432-18-0359-I-1 (NP 1/19/2023) (appellant claimed his weekly status report took too much time, but the supervisor told appellant he was spending too much time on the reports).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sandland v. GSA</span>, 23 MSPR 583, 590-91 (1984), describes an opportunity period that was not offered in good faith:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The record evidence shows that before appellant commenced the sixty-day improvement period, his supervisor briefed all other branch chiefs on appellant's status and informed them that appellant would soon be removed from any managerial position. The supervisor also cancelled several of appellant's field trips during this period, and gave responsibility for managing the computer system for the Region (DEPMAIN) to another individual. Appellant also testified that he was excluded from many staff meetings and omitted from the circulation list for crucial memos, and that his authority was frequently undermined. Under these circumstances appellant could do nothing to correct the management practices his supervisor had criticized, and therefore could not demonstrate acceptable performance. The agency failed to present sufficient evidence to successfully counter appellant's assertions. As a result, we find that the agency has not met its burden of proving by substantial evidence that appellant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to improve. Thus, the agency's Chapter 43 action, lacking proof of a substantive element, cannot be sustained.</p>

Cir. 2007 NP), determining that the initiation of a PIP suggests what amounted to an appropriate determination, subject to rebuttal during a PIP that was responsibly administered, that the employee's performance was so poor that removal was a definite option:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Daniel argues that Ms. Lockhart prejudged him and "had no intention of providing him with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance." As support for that proposition, he first claims that Ms. Lockhart was "prepared" to remove him at the end of the first 90 days of his PIP. While that is undoubtedly true, considering that she rated his performance as unacceptable at that time, it does not demonstrate that she prejudged him. As pointed out by the Board, the DVA could have removed Mr. Daniel at the end of his probationary period or after the initial term of his PIP. Placing Mr. Daniel on a PIP and later extending it could only work in Mr. Daniel's favor. Such actions indicate, if anything, that Ms. Lockhart was interested in giving Mr. Daniel a further opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. Mr. Daniel also argues that, sometime before June 2004, Ms. Lockhart indicated to her assistant that she "intended" to remove him. The testimony cited in support of that proposition, however, indicates only that Ms. Lockhart noted Mr. Daniel's lack of progress and that Ms. Lockhart anticipated the need to remove him. That evidence does not show that Ms. Lockhart denied Mr. Daniel a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. Regardless of Ms. Lockhart's expectations, the evidence showed that Mr. Daniel failed to perform satisfactorily after being given a reasonable opportunity to do so.</p>

DHHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/BEG_OBAID_DC_0432_13_3191_I_1_FINAL_ORDER_1315143.pdf">DC-0432-13-3191-I-1</a> (NP 7/5/2016) ("We have reviewed these emails, and we disagree that they evince a 'preemptive plan' to remove the appellant. In any event, there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the proposing and deciding officials or any other officials or persons during the implementation of the PIP itself. <span class="Italic">Fontes v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Deskins v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 276, 278 (1985), considered the problem created by the supervisor who puts an employee on a PIP, then creates difficulties for the employee, resulting in reversal of the removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that his project leader...subjected him to verbal abuse, insults, and harassment that interfered with his ability to work. Other agency employees testified that the project leader shouted at the appellant during work reviews and that he reacted particularly hostilely towards the appellant. There was also testimony that the project leader told another employee, at some point during the 50-day "grace period" that the appellant would not be employed at the agency for very long. Agency witnesses also testified to the volatile nature of the project leader, and corroborated appellant's evidence that he acted in an exasperated and heated manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, testimony indicated that while all other team members were granted overtime and computer access because their projects were 12-14 weeks late, the project leader denied the appellant's requests for overtime and computer access.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record, therefore, indicates that during the period in which he was to demonstrate acceptable performance the appellant was subjected to verbal abuse and denied the additional time and <span id="Page_2966"></span>facilities necessary to complete the projects. Thus, we find that, under the circumstances of this case, the agency denied appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate improved performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Deskins</span> involved an employee subjected to verbal abuse, insults, and harassment, who was denied time and facilities to complete assigned projects. A personality conflict alone between a supervisor and appellant does not rise to the level of interference warranting reversal of a performance-based action. <span class="Italic">Macijauskas v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 564, 569 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Beamon v. Dept. of Labor</span>, <span class="Italic">supra. But see</span> <span class="Italic">Vines v. DOD</span>, 67 MSPR 667, 671 (1995) (nonprecedential opinion; Chairman Erdreich expressed the view that sexual harassment during a PIP by the supervisor responsible for administering the PIP deprives an employee of the right to a meaningful opportunity to improve). <span class="Italic">Davis v. SSA,</span> SF-0432-12-0763-M-1 (NP 5/3/2016), showed the Board's unwillingness to reverse a Chapter 43 action based on poor supervisory interaction with the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As to her observations of the appellant, the coworker testified that her cubicle was near the appellant's cubicle and she overheard the appellant's supervisor yelling at the appellant because he had trained her on certain things repeatedly, but she still made the same mistakes. She also testified that she felt bad for the appellant and saw her almost in tears on at least one occasion. We discern no error by the administrative judge in failing to mention this testimony, which we find of insufficient weight to affect the outcome of the case. <span class="Italic">See Marques v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 129, 132 (1984) (stating that the administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that she did not consider it in reaching her decision), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 776 F.2d 1062 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not sustain a Chapter 43 action if, through conflicting information, the employee was led to believe that he did not have an opportunity for improvement and that his employment would be or had been terminated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gormley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 330, 334-35 (1990). But an employee's unilateral belief that an assignment properly meeting the elements and standards of his position is make-work and does not need to be performed does not constitute a defense to failure to perform. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sever v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 818 F. Supp. 382, 389 (D.D.C. 1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee who complains that he lacked necessary assistance from others to perform his work must explain with specificity what kind of manpower he needed and how the lack of that assistance adversely affected his performance. <span class="Italic">Archuleta v. DHHS</span>, 38 MSPR 648, 655-56 (1988) (as to the defense that the appellant could not prepare a report because other employees did not provide information: the appellant failed "to use the devices available to her to obtain information in a more timely fashion"); <span class="Italic">McCallon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 36 MSPR 616, 621 (1988) ("Appellant has not explained what kind of manpower he needed and how the lack of such manpower adversely affected his performance."). <span class="Italic">Hober v. Dept. of Army</span>, 64 MSPR 129, 132 (1994), involving the removal of a supervisory public relations specialist, explained the necessity for the AJ to address the defense of lack of time and staff necessary to complete projects in accordance with standards setting deadlines:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here the performance standard required the appellant to coordinate and compile the annual historical report by the "suspense date." The appellant's actual ability to render acceptable performance under this standard is not in dispute. Rather, the appellant testified that his need to complete other work tasks and the existing shortage of others to assist him to compile the historical report impaired his ability to complete it. The appellant further testified that notwithstanding these difficulties, he advised his supervisors on March 11, 1993, nine days after the suspense date for submission of the annual report, that the report was virtually complete and would be completed that same day. Because undisputed evidence reflects that the standard itself did not require an unreasonably high level of performance, we find that the standard is not invalid on the basis found by the administrative judge. This finding must therefore be vacated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has the burden to establish, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant had a reasonable opportunity to improve his performance to an acceptable level<span class="Italic">. See Sandland v. General Services Administration</span>, 23 MSPR 583, 587-90 (1984). We find that the appellant's contentions regarding his ability to complete the historical report during the PIP period due to his need to complete other work and a shortage of staff are relevant to the issue of whether the appellant was provided with a reasonable opportunity to improve his performance to an acceptable level during the PIP period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Bess v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, DE-0752-14-0280-I-1 (NP 9/25/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found substantial evidence that errors in the appellant's funding documents in Examples J, K, R, and S were "numerous and significant" and that this poor performance implicated standards under critical elements 3 and 5. The administrative judge nevertheless found that the appellant did not have an adequate opportunity to complete these tasks successfully. In so concluding, he observed that, while the appellant's position description indicated that she was supposed to have nine employees reporting to her, she had no more than five employees reporting to her prior to the PIP, and that she lost two more employees during the PIP. The administrative judge further noted that the majority of the errors relied on by the agency occurred after these two employees left the unit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The administrative judge likened the situation in this case to that in two precedential Board decisions, <span class="Italic">Yetman v. Department of the Army</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 425 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Administration</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 569 (1991). He cited <span class="Italic">Yetman</span> for the proposition that the agency's standards were unreasonable and "impossible" where the appellant had been promised but not given two new staff members. <span class="Italic">See Yetman</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 426. The administrative judge found that the instant appeal presented an even more difficult circumstance than that in <span class="Italic">Yetman</span> because, instead of a promise for more staff going unfulfilled, the appellant actually lost two employees on whom she had relied during the PIP, and because the loss of these employees disrupted the circumstance with which the appellant had been accustomed. The administrative judge cited <span class="Italic">Thompson</span> for the proposition that, while an agency may clarify a standard through written and oral instructions, it may not impose a higher level of performance than was previously required or called for by the critical element. <span class="Italic">See Thompson</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. at 569.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See Feesago v. DOD</span>, SF-0432-16-0458-I-1 (NP 8/10/2022) (staff shortages beyond appellant's ability to control contributed to inability successfully to meet PIP objectives); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Ortega v. NCUA</span>, CH-0752-13-0115-I-1 (NP 3/24/2014) (Chapter 43 case: "In this connection, the appellant asserts that, even though the PIP stated 'that continued assistance would be provided to him,' the supervisor testified that he briefly met with him on two occasions during the PIP period and that they did not discuss any deficiencies. The administrative judge addressed this argument and found that the agency afforded the appellant a 90-day period in which to improve his performance. The administrative judge found further that, while the appellant argued during the prehearing conference that he was not provided a reasonable opportunity to improve his performance, 'he did not testify that he was not provided a reasonable opportunity to improve," and he never asserted "that he was not provided training or that his supervisor failed to adequately instruct him regarding his duties.'").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers an allegation that the appellant's facilities impaired his ability to perform in accordance with the requirements of a PIP. <span class="Italic">Luscri v. Dept. of Army</span>, 39 MSPR 482, 488 (1989) (alleged lack of proper lab facilities and lab assistance; rejecting the defense). The opportunity to improve assumes that there is work to be done that, if successfully completed, will show improvement; the opportunity period is bogus if the appellant is not provided substantive assignments calling for performance against the standards he must meet. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Neal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 433, 489 (1991). <span class="Italic">But cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DOD</span>, 54 MSPR 641, 644-45 (1992) (performance assessment based on fictional exercises was designed to simulate the performance that the appellant was expected to achieve). <span class="Italic">Daniel v. VA</span>, 223 Fed. Appx. 986, 990 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), made the point that an appellant must demonstrate how he was harmed if the agency did not provide a particular type of PIP assistance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Daniel argues that Ms. Lockhart prejudged him and "had no intention of providing him with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance." As support for that proposition, he first claims that Ms. Lockhart was "prepared" to remove him at the end of the first 90 days of his PIP.

<p class="Body-Text">An employee's personal circumstances may not count for much in a Chapter 43 action, allowing for the possibility of a disability discrimination defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v.
