<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-53"><span class="space">5.</span> Involuntary Retirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Involuntary retirement is treated as removal. The appellant has the right to a hearing if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dodson v. USPS</span>, 67 MSPR 84, 87 (1995) (without specific assertions of fact that, if proven, would demonstrate an involuntary retirement, the appellant has no right to a jurisdictional hearing). Under <span class="Italic">Jenkins v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20190102055">911 F.3d 1370</a>, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (Judge Reyna dissenting):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An involuntary retirement is an adverse employment action "where an agency imposes the terms of an employee's resignation, the employee's circumstances permit no alternative but to accept, and those circumstances were the result of improper acts of the agency." <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted). "The [MSPB] has jurisdiction over an involuntary retirement, which is treated as if it were a removal." <span class="Italic">Cooper</span>, 108 F.3d at 326. "An employee thus may seek reinstatement or back pay as a result of an involuntary retirement." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is a presumption that an employee retired voluntarily. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1996). To overcome this presumption, a petitioner must establish (1) the retirement was the product of misinformation or deception by the agency; or (2) the retirement was the product of coercion by the agency. <span class="Italic">Terban v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000); <span class="Italic">see Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124 ("[T]he doctrine of coercive involuntariness is a narrow one."). The test for involuntariness is "an objective one" that "considers the totality of the circumstances." <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional bases for involuntary retirement claims were summarized, <span class="Italic">Manley v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3163):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since employee resignations and retirements are presumed to be voluntary and former employees thus bear the burden of pleading and proving involuntariness, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Middleton v. Department of Defense</span>, __ F.3d __, 1999 WL 600391, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 10, 1999), in order to be entitled to an evidentiary hearing before the Board on the question of jurisdiction, an employee must allege facts that, if proven, could make out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. We have followed a three-part test for determining when coercion or duress may be found to vitiate an apparently voluntary resignation. Coercion is shown by evidence establishing: "(1) that one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another; (2) that circumstances permitted no other alternative; and (3) that said circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Christie v. United States</span>, 518 F.2d 584 (Ct. Cl. 1975)). "This test is an objective, rather than subjective one; an employee's subjective feelings are irrelevant. The employee must present allegations of fact which, if proven, establish that a reasonable employee confronted with the same circumstance would feel coerced into resigning." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative record here reveals that the AJ stated the proper legal test and correctly applied it to his factual findings, which are supported by substantial record evidence. Manley has not alleged any facts showing that he retired involuntarily due to coercion or duress; specifically, he has not alleged that the agency "effectively imposed the terms of [his] retirement, that [he] had no realistic alternative but to resign or retire, and that [his] retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency." <span class="Italic">Staats v. United Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996). He has not alleged that he was induced by a threat to take disciplinary action that the agency knew could not be substantiated, <span class="Italic">see Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">At most, Manley alleges that he faced a "hostile, unpleasant, and personally distasteful work environment" and one in which various other individuals were discriminated against. However, those facts, even if proven, do not rise to the level of coercion and thus do not make his retirement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Staats</span>, 99 F.3d at 1124. Nor do they justify a hearing. There are no allegations that the agency ever took any detrimental, unauthorized, or discriminatory actions against him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to Manley's contentions, neither the governing statute nor the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees a right to an evidentiary hearing on a question pertaining to the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Anderson v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-17-0044-I-1 (NP 1/18/2023), summarized factors in the analysis of an involuntary retirement claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Retirements are presumed to be voluntary, and the appellant bears the burden of proving otherwise. <span class="italic">Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). To overcome the presumption that a retirement was voluntary, the employee must show that the retirement was the result of the agency's misinformation or deception, or that the retirement was coerced by the agency. <span class="italic">Id</span>. To establish involuntariness on the basis of coercion, an employee must show that the agency effectively imposed the terms of the employee's retirement, the employee had no realistic alternative but to retire, and the employee's retirement was the result of improper acts by the agency. Id. The touchstone of the "voluntariness" analysis is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, factors operated on the employee's decision-making process that deprived her of freedom of choice. <span class="italic">Id</span>. If an employee claims that her retirement was coerced by the agency creating intolerable working conditions, the employee must show a reasonable employee in her position would have found the working conditions so difficult or unpleasant that they would have felt compelled to retire. Id. The Board addresses allegations of discrimination and reprisal in connection with an alleged involuntary retirement only insofar as those allegations relate to the issue of voluntariness. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Although the appellant has alleged unpleasant working conditions, she has not alleged facts to show that her working conditions were so intolerable such that a reasonable person in her position would have felt compelled to retire or resign. See Miller v. Department of Defense, 85 M.S.P.R. 310, &#x00B6; 32 (2000) (explaining that dissatisfaction with work assignments, a feeling of being unfairly criticized, or difficult or unpleasant working conditions generally are not so intolerable as to compel a reasonable person to resign)....</p>

A retirement is not coerced because an agency separates an employee after the agency is notified by OPM that the employee has been granted disability retirement. The agency's administrative response to OPM's grant of the appellant's retirement application is not an agency-imposed separation action, assuming no wrongdoing on the part of the employing agency that led to the retirement application. <span class="Italic">Mavronikolas v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arroyo v. United States</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 647 (1981), described some standards governing an involuntary retirement claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether or not a separation is voluntary depends upon all the facts and circumstances. It is the substance of a transaction rather than its form that governs.... Petitioner's retirement may be found involuntary if it was induced by Government action causing duress.... The mere fact that petitioner faced two unpleasant alternatives, however, does not mean that his retirement was coerced.... Petitioner must show that a reasonable person would find that (1) one side involuntarily accepted the terms of another, (2) circumstances permitted no alternative, and (3) circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. Even if a petitioner resigns under protest to avoid a threatened termination, the resignation is voluntary.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Arroyo</span> determined that the employee was counseled as to his performance and that adverse action was proposed when there was no improvement.

<p class="Body-Text">Because an involuntary retirement is treated as an adverse action, the Board acquires jurisdiction only if it would have the authority to adjudicate an adverse action appeal by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Khan v.
