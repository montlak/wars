<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-283"><span class="space">1.</span> Nonnegotiable Proposals</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA considered a proposal in <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 32 FLRA 269, 274 (1988), that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When illegal drug use results in an act or omission which is cause for discipline (including adverse action), enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program will result in the automatic suspension of such discipline. Successful completion of the rehabilitation program will result in the dropping of all charges. Failure to complete the rehabilitation program may result in renewal of the suspended charges, but may not be a bar to reenrollment at a future date.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA concluded that the proposal was nonnegotiable, but made some interesting comments in <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots</span>, 32 FLRA at 275-76:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first two sentences of Proposal 8 preclude management from disciplining employees while they are enrolled in a drug rehabilitation program and when they successfully complete that program.&#x2003;Proposals which preclude disciplinary action against employees enrolled in a rehabilitation program prevent management from exercising its right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, we disagree with the Agency's contention that the last sentence of Proposal 8 is inconsistent with section 5(d) of Executive Order 12564. That section requires agencies to initiate action to remove employees found to have used illegal drugs if the employee refuses to obtain counseling or does not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that the last sentence of its proposal, which permits reenrollment in a rehabilitation program was intended to respond to an Agency proposal that employees failing to complete a program would be barred from future enrollment.... The Union states further that employees failing to complete the program and who the Agency does not remove, should not be barred from future enrollment.... Interpreted in this manner, the last sentence of the proposal would not prevent the Agency from complying with the requirements of section 5(d) of the Executive Order because it does not bar the Agency from removing an employee who fails to complete a drug rehabilitation program. It only provides that an employee who is not removed should not be barred from future reenrollment.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another nonnegotiable proposal stated that "[a]dverse action must be based on failure to participate in or complete the rehabilitation program." The complete prohibition against adverse action under any circumstances other than those stated in the proposal was too great a burden on the agency's ability to impose sanctions to justify permitting the proposal to be negotiated as an arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 738 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Leavenworth</span>, 38 FLRA 1203, 1209, 1212 (1990) (Proposal 2).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal failing the negotiability test in <span class="Italic">NFFE and Dept. of Interior, BLM</span>, 29 FLRA 1491, 1518 (1987) (Provision 16), was not rescued on appeal in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BLM v. FLRA</span>, 873 F.2d 1505, 1512 (D.C. Cir. 1989), the court there opining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Provision is so ambiguous that we are unable to determine its meaning....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin by examining the language of the proposal: "No employee <span class="Italic">acknowledging</span> medical/<span class="Italic">behavioral</span> problems shall be terminated without first having the <span class="Italic">opportunity to avail</span> himself/herself of <span class="Italic">professional help</span>."... At the risk of belaboring the obvious, the proposal is rife with ambiguity. What is "acknowledging" a problem? What is meant by "behavioral problems"? Does it include inefficient work habits as a result of an employee's domestic or personal problems?...We simply cannot determine whether the Bureau is barred from "acting at all" in terminating an employee....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, even if we assume some answers to the questions above, we can easily construct a situation which would bar the Bureau from "acting at all" when it has legitimate grounds to terminate an employee. Assume an employee is regularly late for work because he frequents a local drinking establishment. When threatened with termination of employment, he "acknowledges" that he has a minor alcohol problem and agrees to seek professional help. Although he enters some long-term substance abuse program, the employee's tardiness does not improve. After a few months, the agency discerns that the employee's nightly consumption of alcohol was only a singular part of the employee's preferred lifestyle of "burning the candle at both ends." Despite this realization, as long as the employee remains enrolled in the program, he could conceivably shield himself from termination.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1808 and Dept. of Army, Sierra Army Depot</span>, 42 FLRA 542, 562 (1991), was Proposal 11, inviting consent by the agency to a proposal that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer will not coerce or require employees to participate in voluntary drug testing programs.&#x2003;Participation or non-participation in these programs will neither advantage [n]or disadvantage employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1808</span>, 42 FLRA at 564-66, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The First Sentence of Proposal 11 Is Negotiable</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The first sentence of the proposal refers to voluntary drug testing programs.&#x2003;We reject the Agency's contention that the first sentence of the proposal does not clearly set forth the meaning that should be ascribed to the term. Instead, we find that the proposal is merely designed to ensure that the Agency adhere to its stated practice of not coercing or requiring any employee to participate in voluntary drug testing. Inherent in the nature of any voluntary activity is consensual, noncoercive participation. The proposal requires nothing more than the Agency claims is its practice, and nothing more than is otherwise inherent in voluntary drug testing programs under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's assertion that, based on the use of the term "voluntary" in other proposals, the first sentence of Proposal 11 excessively interferes with management's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute. As stated above, the use of the term voluntary refers to voluntary drug testing <span id="page_818"></span>programs under section 3(b) of the Executive Order, and not to any other matter. Also, nothing contained in the proposal references or is intended to apply to any other form of drug testing authorized under Executive Order 12564. Consequently, the Agency would not be prevented from subjecting employees to any other lawful drug testing. Accordingly, we find that the proposal does not conflict with the Executive Order or interfere with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices, as alleged.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Second Sentence of Proposal 11 Is Nonnegotiable</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of the proposal provides that participation or nonparticipation in voluntary drug testing programs will neither advantage nor disadvantage employees.&#x2003;The Agency argues that the proposal is inconsistent with section 5 of the Executive Order and the right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. The Agency argues, more particularly, that if an employee participates in a voluntary drug test and tests positive, the proposal would prevent the Agency from taking disciplinary action, such as a removal. We agree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that section 5(b) of the Executive Order requires agencies to "'initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs[,]'" but that the requirement does not apply to employees who "'voluntarily identify themselves as users of illegal drugs,' 'obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an'" Employee Assistance Program, and thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.... Consequently, the Authority has found that proposals that preclude an agency from disciplining employees who voluntarily disclose that they use, or have used, illegal drugs, enter rehabilitation, and refrain from using drugs thereafter, do not conflict with the Executive Order. The Authority further has found, however, that such proposals directly interfere with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second sentence of Proposal 11 is nonnegotiable for two reasons.&#x2003;First, by stating that there will be no disadvantage to employees who participate in voluntary drug testing programs, the proposal would prevent the Agency from removing an employee in accordance with the requirements contained in the Executive Order, if it is determined, following a voluntary drug test, that the employee is using illegal drugs. What distinguishes this proposal from those that are consistent with the Executive Order is that the proposal here makes no reference to the additional requirements in section 5(b) that the employee obtain counseling or rehabilitation and thereafter refrain from illegal drug use. The proposal, as the Agency contends, would provide blanket protection to an identified illegal drug user.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, by preventing the Agency from taking disciplinary action against employees, the second sentence of the proposal directly interferes with the Agency's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. Unlike proposals that have been found to constitute negotiable appropriate arrangements under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, the Union has made no claim that the proposal here was intended as an appropriate arrangement. In any event, as the proposal is inconsistent with the Executive Order, the proposal could not constitute a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 446 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Blue Ridge Parkway</span>, 43 FLRA 836, 904, 906 (1991) (negotiable: portion of Proposal 11 that employer would not require employees to participate in voluntary drug testing programs; nonnegotiable: section of the proposal stating that participation or nonparticipation in voluntary program would "neither advantage [n]or disadvantage employees").</p>
<p class="noindent">Another safe harbor, a proposal that "[e]mployees voluntarily referring themselves to the Navy Alcohol, Drug and Substance Abuse Program (NADSAP) for counselling may retain all current privileges (driving on/off base, driving government vehicles, clearances for professional purposes, etc.)," was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1513 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Air Station, Whidbey Island</span>, 41 FLRA 589, 606, 609-14 (1991) (Provision 4). The proposal violated the right of the agency to determine its security practices, a direct infringement on a statutory management right and a with law (removing the proposal from the category of an appropriate arrangement) because the proposal constituted a direct violation of Exec. Order 12564 &#x00A7; 5(c) (requiring removal of all employees from sensitive positions pending successful rehabilitation). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 1 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 49 FLRA 225, 232-33, 238-40 (1994) (Proposals 2 and 3, involving restrictions on the disclosure of information about individuals entering agency "safe harbor" program, interfered with internal security practices involving individuals in sensitive positions).</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 128 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA 1500, 1522, 1523-25 (1991), was Proposal 13, that "reasonable accommodation be made for an employee who fails a drug test, i.e., be given access to rehabilitation programs, instead of being fired":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 13 requires the Agency to provide employees who are found to use illegal drugs with access to rehabilitation instead of removing them from the Federal service.&#x2003;The Union states that the intent of the proposal is to provide employees with "the same accommodation" as employees who are in a voluntary program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under section 5(b) of Exec. Order No. 12564, agencies are precluded from taking disciplinary action against an employee who is identified as using illegal drugs after undergoing a voluntary test, who obtains appropriate counseling and rehabilitation, and who thereafter refrains from use of illegal drugs. <span class="Italic">See also</span> FPM Letter 792-19, Section 5(d). Thus, if the proposal is intended to provide employees with "the same accommodation" as employees who are in a voluntary program, the proposal would appear to preclude the Agency from disciplining employees who are found to use illegal drugs and would require the Agency to offer such employees rehabilitation instead.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The plain wording of the proposal, however, precludes the Agency only from removing employees who are found to use illegal drugs--presumably through other than the voluntary testing program--but does not preclude all disciplinary action. Because of this ambiguity, we will limit our interpretation of the proposal so that it is consistent with the wording of the proposal. Consequently, we find that the proposal is intended to prevent the Agency from removing employees who are found to use illegal drugs and to require that those employees be offered the opportunity to enter rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 738 and U.S. Department of the Army, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas</span>, 38 FLRA 1203, 1209-16 (1990)...the Authority found that a proposal that limited the range of disciplinary actions that management may take against an employee for a first confirmed finding of illegal drug use was consistent with Exec. Order No. 12564 and FPM Letter 792-19, but that the proposal was nonnegotiable because it directly and excessively interfered with management's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. We also noted that section 5(d) of Exec. Order No. 12564 and section 5(d) of FPM Letter 792-19 mandated the removal of an employee upon a second confirmed finding of illegal drug use....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 13 is broadly worded and would apply both to employees who are determined for the first time to be using illegal drugs and to employees who are determined for the second time to be using those drugs.&#x2003;To the extent that the proposal would preclude the Agency from removing an employee who has been determined for the first time to use illegal drugs, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>, that Proposal 13 would directly interfere with management's right to discipline employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the Union does not specifically claim that Proposal 13 is an "appropriate arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the statute, we note that, by its terms, the proposal seeks to ameliorate the adverse effects on employees of the exercise of management's rights. However, there is no substantive distinction between Proposal 13 and the proposal at issue in <span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>, which we found was not an "appropriate arrangement" because it excessively interfered with the agency's right to discipline employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See Fort Leavenworth</span>, 38 FLRA at 1215-16. Consequently, as there is no basis in record to conclude otherwise, we find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>, that Proposal 13 would not constitute an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, to the extent that Proposal 13 would prevent the Agency from removing an employee who is determined for the second time to use illegal drugs, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with law and Government-wide regulation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, section 5(d) of Exec. Order No. 12564 and section 5(d) of FPM Letter 792-19 require removal of an employee upon a second confirmed positive drug test. Consequently, because Proposal 13 would preclude removal of an employee upon a second confirmed positive drug test, we find that the proposal is inconsistent with...the Executive Order and section 5(d) of FPM Letter 792-19. We conclude, therefore, that Proposal 13 is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, to the extent that Proposal 13 precludes the Agency from removing an employee for a first confirmed use of illegal drugs, we find that it is nonnegotiable because it directly interferes with management's right to discipline under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. We also find that, to the extent Proposal 13 would preclude the Agency from removing an employee who is determined for the second time to use illegal drugs, the proposal is nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with law and Government-wide regulation under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Determined nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 498 (1991), was a "safe harbor" provision, Proposal 47:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After an employee has tested positive for illegal drug use, the employee shall be given the opportunity to identify himself/herself as a drug user, and that employee shall not be disciplined if he/she obtains counseling or rehabilitation through an employee assistance program or private therapeutic program and thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA said of Proposal 47, 42 FLRA at 499-500:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 5(b) of Executive Order 12564 requires agencies to "initiate action <span id="page_819"></span>to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs," except for employees who: (1) voluntarily identify themselves as users of illegal drugs or who are identified as users of illegal drugs under a voluntary drug testing program; (2) "[o]btain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program [EAP]"; and (3) "[t]hereafter [refrain] from using illegal drugs." Section 5.d of FPM Letter 792-19 similarly provides that, "[e]xcept for employees who voluntarily identify themselves as users of illegal drugs, obtain appropriate counseling and rehabilitation, and thereafter refrain from illegal drug use, agencies are required to initiate some form of disciplinary action against employees who are found to use illegal drugs." Neither the Executive Order nor the FPM Letter provides for cancellation of the required discipline when the affected employee successfully completes rehabilitation and subsequently refrains from using illegal drugs. Accordingly, in our view, the requirement "to initiate" disciplinary action, contained in the Executive Order and the FPM Letter, includes the obligation to impose discipline where otherwise consistent with applicable law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Leavenworth</span>, 38 FLRA at 1213.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 47 would preclude the Agency from disciplining employees who are found to use illegal drugs, through testing other than voluntary testing, provided that they: (1) subsequently identify themselves as illegal drug users; (2) obtain counseling or rehabilitation through the EAP; and (3) thereafter do not use illegal drugs. The Executive Order and the FPM Letter require that discipline be imposed on employees who are found to use illegal drugs in these circumstances. Accordingly, Proposal 47 is inconsistent with section 5(b) of the Executive Order and section 5.d of the FPM Letter. As noted previously, the Executive Order is a law and the FPM Letter is a Government-wide regulation within the meaning of section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.... Consequently, Proposal 47 is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of our finding that Proposal 47 is nonnegotiable because it conflicts with law and Government-regulation, it is unnecessary to address the Union's contention that the proposal is an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Education</span>, 38 FLRA at 1083.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of HUD Locals and DHUD</span>, 43 FLRA 1405, 1406, 1411 (1992), was Proposal 2: "Management agrees to avoid taking action against any employee who voluntarily self-identifies as a substance abuser and enrolls in a <span class="Italic">bonafide</span> [sic] treatment program":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 would exempt from discipline any employee who is voluntarily identified as a substance abuser and who enrolls in a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> treatment program. However, the proposal does not require the employee to successfully complete the rehabilitation program, or to remain drug free thereafter. Accordingly, we find the proposal nonnegotiable because it is inconsistent with Executive Order No. 12564.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[S]ection 5(b) of Executive Order No. 12564 requires agencies to "initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs," but exempts employees who voluntarily identify themselves as illegal drug users, obtain counseling or rehabilitation, and thereafter remain drug free. The Authority has found that proposals that preclude an agency from disciplining employees who voluntarily disclose to management that they use, or have used, illegal drugs, enter rehabilitation, and refrain from using drugs thereafter do not conflict with the Executive Order and the FPM Letter. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Treasury</span>, 41 FLRA at 1140.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 is distinguishable from proposals that are consistent with the Executive Order because this proposal makes no reference to the additional requirement in section 5(b) that the employee, after obtaining counseling or rehabilitation, refrain from illegal drug use. Rather, as the Agency contends, Proposal 2 would provide blanket protection to an identified illegal drug user so long as the individual merely enrolled in a treatment program. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 1808 and U.S. Department of the Army, Sierra Army Depot, Herlong, California</span>, 42 FLRA 542, 565 (1991) (Member Talkin dissenting as to other matters).... [T]he Executive Order requires that agencies discipline employees who do not refrain from illegal drug use. We conclude, therefore, that Proposal 2 is inconsistent with the Executive Order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[B]ecause the proposal is inconsistent with the Executive Order, it is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute and there is no need to address the parties' additional contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria</span>, 49 FLRA 874, 889 (1994) (nonnegotiable Provisions 9 and 11, safe harbor provisions: "Because neither provision is limited to those illegal drug users who identify themselves voluntarily, they are inconsistent with section 5(b) of the Executive Order.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Another broad disciplinary limitation was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 89 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Grand Coulee Project Office</span>, 48 FLRA 516, 534, 536 (1993), determining as to Proposal VI.H that "[a]n employee who voluntarily admits to the use of illegal drugs, is rehabilitated, and then remains drug-free shall remain exempt from disciplinary action":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency argues that the proposal exempts employees from "all discipline" after undergoing rehabilitation, for "past illegal drug use and possible future illegal drug usage." Based on the plain wording of the proposal, we agree. As such, the disputed proposal would give employees an opportunity to complete a rehabilitation program without fear of receiving a disciplinary penalty. However, Proposal VI.H provides that benefit to employees at the cost, as we noted above, of the Agency's ability to initiate any disciplinary action for any conduct, whether or not related to the use of illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the benefit to employees that would result from the restriction on the Agency's ability to initiate disciplinary action against those employees, and from the increased incentive to complete rehabilitation, does not outweigh the burden on management of the prohibition against initiating disciplinary actions....</p>
<p class="noindent">A similar proposal was nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFSCME Local 3097 and DOJ, Justice Mgmt. Div.</span>, 42 FLRA 412, 492, 496 (1991) (Proposal 42). Also nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">IFPTE Local 128 and Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation</span>, 39 FLRA 1500, 1527-28 (1991), was Proposal 15, to allow an employee who, having been in a treatment program and who again tests positive for drugs, to re-enter the program rather than being removed. The proposal was inconsistent with &#x00A7; 5(d) of the Executive Order, requiring an agency to initiate removal of an employee who does not refrain from illegal drug use after rehabilitation. Nonnegotiable was a proposal that an employer normally allow employees in an EAP a reasonable opportunity to improve work performance to an acceptable level before being subjected to disciplinary action. FLRA concluded as to Provision 3 in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prison Locals and DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 47 FLRA 836, 845, 848 (1993), that the proposal precluded agencies from disciplining employees who, after obtaining counseling or rehabilitation, fail to refrain from illegal drug use.
