USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 35, 37 (1988) (defense of mental incapacity to removal for AWOL). If the appellant pleads, but fails to prove, disability discrimination based on mental illness, the underlying condition may be relevant to an assessment of the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Yovan v.

Dept. of Labor</span>, 87 MSPR 667, 677-78 &#x00B6; 17 (2001) (recognizing the significance of a medical condition but discounting it as a causative factor in the charged misconduct); <span class="Italic">Thompson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Board erred to the extent it required Mr. Bal's depression to be so severe as to incapacitate him. The Board found that Mr. Bal's medical evidence did not establish incapacity. Presumably, this finding related to Mr. Bal's FMLA claim. That finding, however, infected the Board's findings regarding the reasonableness of Mr. Bal's removal under the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors because the Board repeated its finding regarding incapacity in its <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis. But <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> merely requires consideration of whether "mental impairment" was a mitigating factor to the charged misconduct. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.B. at 332. It does not require that the impairment result in full mental incapacitation. The Government conceded as much during oral argument. Moreover, we have explained that "[w]hen <span class="Italic">mental impairment</span> or illness is reasonably substantiated, and is shown to be related to the ground of removal, this must be taken into account when taking an adverse action against the employee." <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, 578 F.3d at 1356 (emphasis added). Thus, the Board erred in discounting Mr. Bal's evidence based on the fact that Mr. Bal's depression did not result in incapacitation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on these erroneous findings, the Board sustained Mr. Bal's removal without any analysis of his medical evidence of depression and the impact his depression had on his misconduct. The Board's final decision is devoid of any substantive discussion of Dr. Seymour's reports diagnosing Mr. Bal with major depression and specifically linking his depression to the misconduct leading to his proposed removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, we held that a remand was appropriate under similar circumstances. In that case, the record contained undisputed medical evidence that the employee had been diagnosed and treated for depression. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1355. The employee submitted that evidence to the Board and argued that her depression was a mitigating factor under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. The Board found "the appellant's assertions in this regard not credible and unsupported by the record" without mentioning any of the medical documents other than generically stating that it had "reviewed her submissions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1356. The Board further found that, despite the medical evidence, the employee "failed to establish any medical reason or provide any medical documentation that could justify or excuse her behavior." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1357. On appeal, we remanded the Board's decision because it "contain[ed] no analysis of the medical evidence, although the medical evidence in the record is voluminous and on its face may relate to [the employee's] inappropriate behavior." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Administrative Judge acknowledged Dr. Seymour's reports and Mr. Bal's depression diagnosis. The Administrative Judge noted that the deciding official, Ms. Walters, considered the "salient <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors" and, without discussing the evidence, concluded that there was no reason to disturb the agency's assessment of those factors. The Administrative Judge also discounted Mr. Bal's evidence of depression as mitigating evidence because it "did not establish incapacity" or show how his depression played a part in the charged misconduct. As we have explained, these findings are not supported by the record. On review, the Board compounded the Administrative Judge's errors by affirming the initial decision without any analysis of Dr. Seymour's reports, which diagnosed Mr. Bal with depression and directly linked his misconduct to his depression. "It is established that mental impairment, when present, warrants consideration and weight in assessing the reasonableness of the action taken." <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, 578 F.3d at 1357. Given Mr. Bal's uncontroverted evidence that his depression caused his misconduct, the Board should have explained why his evidence of mental impairment was insufficient to establish a mitigating circumstance under <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Higgins v. VA</span>, 955 F.3d 1347, 1356 (Fed.

Additionally, whereas Mr. Bal was 'neither a danger to himself or to others,'...Mr. Higgins presented a threat to other VAMC employees. And it is undisputed that unlike Mr. Bal, Mr. Higgins did not improve with continued treatment of his condition.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence of depression or its effect on the appellant's behavior is not limited to testimony or documentation from health care providers, <span class="Italic">Winfrey v. SSA,</span> AT-0752-10-0555-I-1 (NP 2/13/2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is not required to show through medical evidence that a mental condition contributed to the misconduct at issue, and affidavits that provide specific evidence regarding the manner in which an appellant's emotional condition may have influenced the misconduct may support a finding that the appellant was suffering from emotional problems. <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 15 (2010). Evidence that an employee's medical condition played a part in the charged misconduct is ordinarily entitled to considerable weight as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The appellant provided sworn, unrebutted testimony that her failure to report for work and placement on AWOL resulted from her depression, anxiety, and panic attacks that prevented her from leaving her house. Although the appellant's treatment evidence did not cover the period of her AWOL, this does not mean that her mental conditions did not exist at the time of her absences and did not play a role in her AWOL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative judge specifically found the appellant's testimony "particularly compelling and credible in part due to the detailed and consistent nature of her testimony." The Board must defer to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The administrative judge's reliance on the "nature" of the appellant's testimony, as well as her indication that the detail and consistency of the testimony were only "in part" why she found the testimony "particularly compelling and credible," suggest that the administrative judge implicitly relied on the appellant's demeanor. The agency has not provided sufficiently sound reasons to overturn those credibility findings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For there to be a responsibility on the part of the agency to consider a medical issue as a mitigating factor, the issue must be brought to the agency's attention, <span class="Italic">Walker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, in appropriate circumstances not present here, mental impairment may be entitled to considerable weight as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">See Malloy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 578 F.3d 1351, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2009) ("voluminous" relevant evidence of mental impairment, i.e., depression, improperly not considered by the Board) (citing <span class="Italic">Roseman v.

Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 82, 89 (1995); <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305. As we explained above, the appellant failed to establish that his mental impairment rose to the level of a disability. However, even when a mental impairment does not rise to the level of a disability, the Board may consider the condition in determining the appropriate penalty "if the agency knew about it before taking the action at issue." <span class="Italic">Roseman</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 345; <span class="Italic">see Sublette</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 89.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we explained above, neither the deciding official nor the proposing official was aware of the appellant's alleged mental impairment when proposing or deciding the removal action; Colonel Cole was only aware that the appellant claimed a traumatic brain injury, but the appellant had failed to provide Colonel Cole any information about the alleged injury as Cole had requested. Moreover, even though the appellant's attorney <span id="Page_2358"></span>initially requested the appellant's doctors as witnesses, he withdrew that request during the prehearing conference. Accordingly, the appellant presented no medical testimony during the hearing, and the appellant did not submit any medical records that were dated after early 2006. Thus, there is no written or testimonial medical evidence to support a showing that the appellant had not recovered from his 2003 brain injury by August 12, 2008, or that he continued to have cognitive issues. Because the appellant (who was represented by an attorney) failed to submit sufficient, relevant medical evidence, we conclude that <span class="Italic">Malloy</span> does not support an argument that the appellant's removal should be mitigated based on alleged mental impairment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But medical evidence can first be brought to the Board for consideration of mitigation. <span class="Italic">See Bowman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The medical evidence is not disputed by the USPS on this appeal, although the USPS argues that Ms. Malloy's disrespectful statements and inadequate performance warrant her removal from service. However, when mental impairment or illness is reasonably substantiated, and is shown to be related to the ground of <span id="Page_2359"></span>removal, this must be taken into account when taking an adverse action against the employee. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. Dep't of Army</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 233, 241 (1989) (the employee's testimony that "he was under severe emotional distress at the time he committed the acts in question" must be considered in assessing the reasonableness of the penalty); <span class="Italic">see also Robb v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision of the MSPB contains no analysis of the medical evidence, although the medical evidence in the record is voluminous and on its face may relate to Ms. Malloy's inappropriate behavior. Although the AJ stated that all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors were considered, the eleventh <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factor, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305 (mitigating circumstances such as "unusual job tensions, personality problems, mental impairment, harassment, or bad faith, malice or provocation on the part of others involved in the matter"), appears to be directly relevant, but is not mentioned and is not shown to have been considered.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This court has long held: "It is not reversible error if the Board fails expressly to discuss all of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors.

In this case, the decision of the MSPB contains no analysis of the medical evidence submitted by Ms. Malloy--even though the medical evidence in the record is voluminous and on its face may relate to Ms. Malloy's inappropriate behavior. This lack of any analysis in the face of such evidence, coupled with the Board's statement that Ms. Malloy failed to "provide any medical documentation that could justify or excuse her behavior," leads us to conclude that both the AJ and the full Board failed to consider the medical evidence provided by Ms. Malloy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is established that mental impairment, when present, warrants consideration and weight in assessing the reasonableness of the action taken. <span class="Italic">See Roseman v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record before us does not show what consideration or argument may have been given to the medical evidence by the AJ, or on appeal to the full Board.

Neither case supports the remand Mr. Higgins seeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, we vacated the Board's decision affirming the agency's removal of Ms. Malloy and remanded because the Board's decision failed to consider any of the medical evidence Ms. Malloy had submitted to the agency or the Board. 578 F.3d at 1357. Ms. Malloy argued before the agency and the Board that mental impairment sometimes caused her to act inappropriately, that her response to her proposed notice of removal indicated the presence of supporting medical documentation, and that she had provided "extensive medical documentation" at her hearing before the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1354. But in addition to treating Ms. Malloy's medical condition as irrelevant, her letter of removal from the agency dismissed her medical condition as lacking "any definitive medical evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board's decision acknowledged Ms. Malloy's testimony that her medical condition precluded her from performing simple tasks but discounted her testimony as "not credible and unsupported by the record," further finding that she had "failed to establish any medical reason or provide any medical documentation that could justify or excuse her behavior." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1356 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, by contrast, both the agency's deciding official and the Board acknowledged Mr. Higgins's PTSD and expressly considered it as a mitigating factor in assessing the reasonableness of Mr. Higgins's removal. Additionally, the agency's case supporting Mr. Higgins's removal is stronger than was the agency's case for Ms. Malloy's removal. Like Mr. Higgins, Ms. Malloy had a history of conflict with her supervisors. <span class="Italic">Malloy</span>, 578 F.3d at 1353. Unlike Mr. Higgins, however, Ms. Malloy was not found to present a threat to herself or others, and her mental condition was expected to resolve within a year of the onset of her symptoms. 578 F.3d at 1355. Mr. Higgins, by contrast, was found to present a threat to other VAMC employees, and his mental condition had "no expected date of remission, full or partial."

Though the Board's decision acknowledged Mr. Bal's depression diagnosis and the existence of supporting medical evidence, the Board failed to weigh Mr. Bal's depression as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 929. Instead, the Board discounted Mr. Bal's evidence of depression because it "did not establish incapacity." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). The Board also substituted its own judgment in place of record evidence supporting Mr. Bal's rehabilitation, which included his prompt return to work, "great improvement and...substantial behavioral changes," and his doctor's opinion that he was "not likely to repeat the problem[atic]" behavior. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 929-30. Setting this evidence aside, the Board concluded that "Mr. Bal did not have rehabilitation potential because he had not taken responsibility for his actions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 927.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as discussed above, both the agency's deciding official and the Board expressly considered Mr. Higgins's PTSD as a mitigating factor in assessing the reasonableness of his removal.

She testified that she began treating the appellant shortly after the incident in question and has been treating him for approximately 2 years at intervals of once a week. She testified that the appellant was depressed before the incident took place and based her opinion on the course of events in the appellant's life over several years preceding the misconduct. Among these were: the death of the appellant's mother; the death of his wife's mother and father; and his wife's miscarriage after a difficult pregnancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dr. Shelley-McIntyre testified that the miscarriage was especially stressful because the appellant and his wife were expecting twins as the result of a third attempt at in vitro fertilization and 6 months into the pregnancy, the appellant's wife miscarried. She testified that the appellant's wife's life was in danger due to bleeding at the time of the miscarriage and the appellant put aside his own feelings to console his wife, disallowing him the opportunity to grieve himself. She testified that, because of the stress, the appellant and his wife argued, including having an all-night argument the night before the appellant left on his assignment to Hawaii. She testified that the confluence of all of these events, the deaths, the compounded losses, the difficult pregnancy, and the couple falling apart, all caused the appellant to fall apart and created a situation where he made an error in judgment.

In addition, we note that the appellant has over 26 years of military and civilian federal service with above-satisfactory ratings and no prior disciplinary record. Further, he has shown potential for rehabilitation, in that he indicated to agency officials that he was willing to work to improve and to do whatever was necessary to improve.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant stated that her regular medications have no effect on her ability to function, but that the methadone that she was taking made her sleepy. Assuming the methadone contributed to the sleepiness at issue in specification (A), neither the appellant's testimony nor any of the notes from her doctors indicate, let alone show, that her prescription medications played any part in the conduct underlying specifications (B) or (C). Nor does any record evidence show that her alleged depression and bipolar disorder played a part in specification (B) or (C). In fact, the appellant declared at the hearing that her medication allowed her to perform "[b]etter--better than [her] normal." This is consistent with her verbal response to the proposed removal. Given the deciding official's view that removal is warranted for specification (B), neither the appellant's asserted mental condition nor her use of prescription drugs justifies mitigation. <span class="Italic">See Thomas</span>, 66 MSPR at 553. Further, as explained above, the appellant did not show disparate treatment. Thus, she has not shown disparate penalty. <span class="Italic">See Rackers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although the appellant's petition for review does not demonstrate error in the AJ's conclusion to uphold the removal penalty, one matter deserves mention. The AJ considered the appellant's claim that his mental condition was the cause of, or contributed to, his misconduct, but she found that no medical evidence supported that position. While it is true that no individual medical report states that the precise misconduct for which the appellant was removed was caused by his bipolar disorder, it is also true that his condition was under control until such time as he was advised that he would be reassigned to Japan, that his treating physician strongly recommended against the move, that the Army Medical Officer agreed that the move would aggravate the appellant's symptoms, and that his aberrant behavior manifested itself only after he moved to Japan. Under the circumstances, it is fair to say that the sustained misconduct was at least consistent with appellant's bipolar disorder, and that that factor should have been considered in determining the reasonableness of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Roseman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 76 MSPR 334, 345 (1997). Still, consideration of that factor does not provide a basis for mitigation based on the other factors reviewed by the AJ, particularly her conclusion, with which we agree, that the appellant lacks potential for rehabilitation because there is a lack of evidence to suggest that his behavior would improve if he were to be reinstated. <span class="Italic">cf. Bishopp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 33, 40-41 (1997) (mitigation was appropriate where, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, appellant's mental illness caused her misconduct, she had a long and distinguished government career, and she had a good potential for rehabilitation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board mitigated to a 30-day suspension the removal of an employee who was insubordinate and who misrepresented facts regarding an investigation. The employee was suffering from mental problems at the time of the misrepresentation and was seeing a psychologist.

McKowen v. DLA</span>, 10 MSPR 98, 103 n.3 (1982) (suggesting a defense of diminished mental capacity to an insubordination charge).

Supervisors testified they lost confidence in the appellant as a result of some misrepresentations and other misconduct. <span class="Italic">Boyd v. DOJ</span>, 14 MSPR 427, 432-33 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oglesby v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 202, 206 (1991), set aside mitigation of removal because the AJ improperly weighed medical evidence of depression. The AJ mitigated the penalty after concluding the depression was in remission. The Board reinstated removal of an appellant for threatening supervisors and a coworker because the Board did not find the medical evidence persuasive and because the agency had an "obligation to maintain a safe work place." <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 66 MSPR 113, 119-20 (1995), discounted evidence of depression offered in mitigation of charges against a supervisor of insubordination and performance deficiencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that Col. Salt had failed to adequately consider the appellant's depression and degree of recovery in his deliberations, that finding would not, in itself, necessarily warrant the conclusion that his ultimate penalty decision was unreasonable. Rather, there would have to be some analysis of that factor <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> the other factors involved in the case. <span class="Italic">See Douglas</span>, 5 MSPR at 302 (in reviewing the appropriateness of a penalty, the Board's function is to assure that the agency's managerial judgment has been properly exercised within the tolerable limits of reasonableness).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge merely found that the appellant's depression "likely" had an effect on his relations with other people, and that "to the extent that" it may have done so, the medical condition warranted mitigation. These statements fall short of a finding that the appellant's medical condition caused or even contributed to his "extremely serious" conduct and performance problems. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. Dept. of the Army,</span> 42 MSPR 233, 241 (1989) (severe emotional stress is not a mitigating factor absent evidence containing reasoned explanations of how the misconduct was directly related to that mental condition). The degree of recovery is also an important consideration, because even if the appellant's depression was shown to have caused his behavior, the "extremely serious" insubordination and performance problems could not be tolerated in a supervisory employee. In short, the administrative judge <span id="Page_2361"></span>set forth no persuasive analysis showing that the factor of the appellant's medical depression outweighed all of the other pertinent factors, which, the administrative judge found, Col. Salt thoroughly considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, we note that the appellant has a prior disciplinary record, consisting of a 5-day suspension for threatening another staff chief, which is the suspension that Col. Salt attempted to give the appellant on February 19, 1993. Col. Salt testified that the appellant's refusal to accept that letter showed that he was trying to avoid facing up to his conduct and making a correction thereto. We find that, inasmuch as the appellant demonstrated no remorse for his behavior at the hearing, essentially the same thing can fairly be said as to the removal action. The appellant has simply not shown rehabilitative potential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not specifically find that the appellant had shown the potential for rehabilitation, but only made the vague statement that "to the extent that the charges...were related to the appellant's depression and to the extent that the appellant has now recovered from his depression, his potential for rehabilitation is much improved." Even if the appellant had shown a good potential for rehabilitation, however, the Board has held that a good prognosis or favorable "forward looking" analysis for future behavior does not alone outweigh an agency's legitimate concern as to an appellant's ability to perform his duties and the effect of his conduct upon the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Dept. of the Navy,</span> 35 MSPR 438, 443 (1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 861 F.2d 728 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (Table).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record established that the appellant had a five-year history of a psychiatric condition that diminished his ability to control his anger in a stressful situation. In proposing his removal, the agency cited two previous disciplinary actions in which the appellant was suspended, first for three days based on the charge of using loud, profane, and abusive language toward a superior, and then for five days based on the charge of becoming boisterous and using profane and abusive language toward two supervisors. The first suspension had been reduced from five days to three because the appellant explained that his improper behavior resulted from feelings of pressure at work and at home due to his unsatisfactory performance record and his attempting to complete two correspondence courses. The second suspension had been reduced from ten days to five because the appellant again explained that his behavior resulted from the same pressures, plus financial problems and participation in the agency's Employee Assistance Program in connection with his psychiatric condition. Thus, the appellant's psychological problems have already been taken into account twice by the agency in mitigating disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant did not allege or establish on appeal that the insubordinate act charged and proved was beyond his control as a result of his psychiatric condition, we shall hark back to our opinion in <span class="Italic">Jefferson v. Veterans Administration,</span> 6 MSPB 297, 6 MSPR 348 (1981), where we reached the following conclusion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Insolent disrespect toward supervisors so seriously undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline that no agency should be expected to exercise forbearance for such conduct more than once. To expect management to tolerate appellant's repeated insolent behavior would make a mockery of management's authority and supervisory responsibility; few other types of misconduct go so directly to the heart of maintaining the 'efficiency of the service.'</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 298-99, 6 MSPR at 351-52. In this appeal, the agency assumed the role of a fairminded umpire in allowing the appellant a third strike before calling him out.

<p class="Body-Text">Stress will not ordinarily serve to mitigate a charge involving illegal drugs, <span class="Italic">Barry v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 71 MSPR 283, 286-87 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In discussing the "mitigating factors favorable to the appellant," the administrative judge noted that "[t]he record...reflects that the appellant was under considerable stress because of her personal problems at the time of the incident." The administrative judge appears to have determined that the appellant's personal problems constituted one of "the more compelling mitigating factors relevant in this case." However, stress, <span class="Italic">per se,</span> generally should not be found to be a mitigating or "relevant" factor where a charge of involvement with an illegal controlled substance has been sustained. <span class="Italic">See generally Canevari v. Dept. of the Treasury</span>, 50 MSPR 311, 316-18 (1991). When an employee gives stress, without further explanation, as a reason for possession of illegal drugs while on duty, it raises the inference that possession of illegal drugs is an acceptable means of coping with stress and may recur whenever the employee experiences stress. Such an inference is not raised when stress is given as a reason for other forms of misconduct, such as excessive absence. Here, however, the sole charge against the appellant is possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) while on duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge has not provided any circumstances indicating the relationship between the stress that the appellant was experiencing because of her personal problems and her possession of marijuana while on duty. We will not infer such a connection without any additional explanation. <span class="Italic">See Hanna v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233, 241 (1989), where the Board found that severe emotional stress is not a mitigating factor absent evidence containing reasoned explanations of how the misconduct was directly related to that mental condition. <span class="Italic">See also Griffin v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 66 MSPR 113, 119-20 (1995) (the administrative judge should not have mitigated the removal of an employee on the ground that the employee was suffering from depression, where the administrative judge made no explicit finding that the employee's medical condition caused or even contributed to his misconduct and set forth no persuasive analysis showing that the factor of the employee's medical depression outweighed all other pertinent factors), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 78 F.3d 603 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge has also not provided any basis to infer that personal problems and "stress" will not necessarily lead to the recurrence of the conduct at issue in this case. In fact, she apparently gave little consideration to the testimony of the deciding official that the appellant had never mentioned her personal problems during his consideration of the proposal to remove her, and had never "offer[ed] any explanation for her actions or otherwise indicate[d] any remorse or embarrassment on her part; instead, she had just attacked other issues."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's apparent failure to consider the deciding official's determination that the appellant did not show remorse contrasts to the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>. There, the Board found that the administrative judge had erred by mitigating the penalty because, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the appellant had demonstrated no remorse for his behavior. <span class="Italic">See</span> 66 MSPR at 120. The Board therein held that the administrative judge's vague statement that "to the extent that the charges...were related to the appellant's depression and to the extent that the appellant has now recovered from his depression, his potential for rehabilitation is much improved," did not constitute a specific finding that the appellant had shown the potential for rehabilitation and, thus, did not support the administrative judge's mitigation of the penalty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above-noted reasons, we hold that where the Board sustains the charge of involvement with an illegal controlled substance on duty, as it has in this case, stress or personal problems experienced by the appellant generally should not be considered as a mitigating or "relevant" factor in determining the reasonableness of an agency's penalty selection, absent a reasoned explanation of the relationship between the appellant's personal circumstances and the charged misconduct, and without further addressing the question of whether the appellant expressed remorse for the conduct and/or otherwise demonstrated a potential for rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's conclusion that the penalty of removal was unreasonable also is based partly on her findings regarding the appellant's alleged emotional difficulties. The appellant and his wife testified that the 1985 death of the appellant's mother due to cancer caused the appellant to suffer chronic depression that interfered with his ability to make appropriate judgments and rendered him apathetic. The administrative judge found that, while the evidence was insufficient to find that the appellant suffered from the medical condition of depression, it did support a finding that he suffered from emotional difficulties and that those difficulties affected his judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant suffered from emotional difficulties and in regarding those alleged difficulties as a mitigating factor. It asserts that the evidence submitted by the appellant to establish his emotional problems was vague, for the most part addressed old matters, and was not corroborated by medical evidence. In addition, it argues that the decision to mitigate the penalty is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Cormier v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 112 (1984), because the appellant failed to show that his actions were beyond his control, and that it is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 233 (1989), because the appellant failed to show that his misconduct was directly related to his mental condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not concur in the agency's characterization of the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">Cormier</span>. In finding in that case that the appellant's emotional problems were insufficient to overcome his history of misconduct, the Board considered the appellant's failure to show that his actions were beyond his control. <span class="Italic">Cormier</span>, 22 MSPR at 115-16. That failure, however, was only one of the factors the Board considered in finding mitigation not warranted. The Board did not hold, as the agency asserts, that emotional problems could not be considered a mitigating factor absent a showing that an appellant's actions were beyond his control. Furthermore, we can find no support for the agency's argument in other Board decisions.... We therefore find that the initial decision is not inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Cormier</span> as the agency has alleged.[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;The agency argues further, citing <span class="Italic">Wellman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 149 (1991), that the administrative judge erred in mitigating the penalty based on assertions that were unsupported by medical evidence. We see nothing in <span class="Italic">Wellman</span> that supports this view. While the presence of medical evidence may lend considerable weight to allegations that emotional difficulties contributed to the misconduct at issue, the absence of such evidence does not preclude consideration of other evidence. Thus, even though the appellant presented no medical evidence, the administrative judge did not err in considering the appellant's other evidence of emotional problems.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the agency also argues that the initial decision is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Hanna</span>. In that case, the Board stated that, absent a showing that the appellant's misconduct was directly related to his alleged mental condition, it would accord the evidence of his mental condition minimal weight in evaluating the choice of penalties. In this case, the administrative judge evidently concluded that the appellant's apparent emotional difficulties were directly related to the poor judgment he exercised in soliciting and accepting the loans in question. For the reasons stated below, we find that the evidence of record does not support such a conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's findings regarding the appellant's emotional difficulties are based largely on the testimony, described above, of the appellant and his wife, and on affidavits signed by the appellant's supervisors and coworkers. The appellant testified that he had "got into a don't-care-ish type attitude about things in general other than particular job situations," that he "fe[lt] as though [his depressed condition] did have a part in the misconduct, in [his] making poor decisions," and that the condition "contributed to [his] financial situation" by giving him a "tend[ency] to put things off,...to not place very much emphasis or importance on certain matters which needed importance." The appellant's wife also testified that the appellant was deeply affected by the death of his mother. In addition, she responded affirmatively when asked whether the appellant "ha[d] a problem making judgments." We note, however, that the appellant also testified that he knew at the time of the misconduct that his actions were inappropriate. This admission, along with the absence from the testimony of more specific indications that the misconduct was directly related to the appellant's emotional problems, supports a finding that the testimony of the appellant and his wife is entitled only to limited weight.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the affidavits on which the administrative judge relied include statements that the appellant appeared to be depressed about his mother's illness and death and that his "poor financial decisions" had not been characteristic of him in the past. These affidavits, like the testimony of the appellant and his wife, lend some support to a finding that the appellant was suffering emotional problems. We note, however, that some of the affidavits seem to be based on observations made years before the appellant engaged in the misconduct at issue. Furthermore, none of the affidavits provide specific evidence regarding the manner in which the appellant's emotional condition may have influenced the misconduct on which his removal was based. We therefore find that their probative value is small.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the issue for decision becomes whether an alleged short term emotional disturbance causing appellant to absent himself from work is a circumstance sufficient to mitigate the penalty of removal for such absence. On the facts of the instant case our answer must be in the negative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was a GS-16 employee, holding the highest ranking position in the project office. It must be presumed that this position not only required the incumbent to perform duties unique in function but also carried with it substantial requirements of responsibility and trust.[5] It is well settled that excessive unauthorized absence from duty is a proper ground for removal, since by its very nature it disrupts the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Indeed, it could be argued that appellant's alleged emotional instability and wanton disregard for fulfilling his duties to the agency exhibit an untrustworthiness which further supports the agency's determination to remove him.</p>
