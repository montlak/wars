<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-91"><span class="space">g.</span> Supplemental, Modified, or Clarified Awards; Request to Arbitrator for Reconsideration</h5>
<p class="noindent">Exceptions to a supplemental award, e.g., an award concerning counsel fees, should be filed within the time period allowed after service of that supplemental award, <span class="Italic">Army Corps of Eng'rs and NFFE Local 639</span>, 17 FLRA 424, 424 n.1 (1985). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 62 FLRA 70, 71 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2425.1(b) of the Authority's Regulations, the time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitrator's award is 30 days beginning on the date the award is served on the filing party. When no exceptions are filed within the 30-day period, the award becomes final and binding and compliance is required. <span class="Italic">E.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, Calif.,</span> 52 FLRA 1471, 1474 (1997). However, when a party seeks clarification of the original award and the arbitrator issues a supplemental award that addresses the original award, exceptions pertaining to the original award in certain circumstances can be timely if they are filed within 30 days of the date of service of the supplemental award. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Washington, D.C.,</span> 59 FLRA 131, 132 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring as to other matters). For such exceptions to be timely, the supplemental award must modify or address the original award "in such a way as to give rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions[.]" <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-45,</span> 55 FLRA 789, 793 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it was not until the supplemental award that the Arbitrator addressed the basis of the order in the original award that the grievants receive written reprimands by explaining that the reprimands were ordered to conform to the progressive discipline requirements of &#x00A7; 7503(a), and not as mitigation. Because the asserted deficiencies in the Agency's exceptions to the ordered reprimands did not arise until this explanation in the supplemental award, the exceptions were timely filed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent">As to a determination of an arbitrator, following a merits award, not to entertain a counsel fee petition, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3749 and USDA, FSIS</span>, 69 FLRA 519, 520 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, when a party seeks clarification of an arbitration award, and the arbitrator then modifies the award in a way that gives rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions, the filing period for exceptions begins with the service of the modification.[22] Accordingly, where a backpay award is silent regarding attorney fees, and a later modification states for the first time that the arbitrator will not consider a request for attorney fees, the timeliness of exceptions to the fee denial is measured from the date of service of the modification.[23] This is consistent with the principle that, under the BPA, an arbitrator has jurisdiction to consider an attorney-fee request at any time during the arbitration or within a reasonable period of time <span class="Italic">after</span> the arbitrator's award of backpay becomes final and binding (absent a governing contractual time limit).[24]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[22]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed. BOP, U.S. Penitentiary, Atwater, Cal.</span>, 66 FLRA 737, 739 (2012).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf. AFGE, Local 44, Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 67 FLRA 721, 723 (2014) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (where a claimed deficiency arises from a fee award, the timeliness of the exceptions is measured from the date of the service of the fee award, not the date of the service of the merits award); <span class="Italic">cf. AFGE, Council 243</span>, 67 FLRA 96, 97 (2012) (where it was "sufficiently clear" from an award that the arbitrator intended to deny attorney fees, exceptions needed to be filed timely relative to that award, not relative to a later (allegedly "clarifying") email).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2425.2(b) of the Authority's Regulations,[28] the time limit for filing exceptions begins to run when the arbitrator serves a final award on the parties.[29] Neither an arbitrator's retention of jurisdiction to assist in the implementation of an award,[30] nor a party's filing of a motion for reconsideration or clarification,[31] affects an award's finality for purposes of filing exceptions. But where an arbitrator modifies an award in response to a party's motion, the time limit for filing exceptions to the modified award begins upon service of the modified award.[32] However, where a party does not except to the original award, the party's exceptions to the modified award will be timely only as to the deficiencies that arise as a result of the modification.[33]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency's first exceptions did not challenge the first award's merits and the supplemental award modified only the remedy granted by the first award. If the Agency had challenged the first award's merits in its first exceptions, then the Arbitrator's modification of the first award's remedy would not have mooted the first exceptions in their entirety, and the portions of the first exceptions going to the merits would still be properly before us. But the Agency did not do so. Accordingly, the Agency's exceptions to the Arbitrator's merits determination are untimely, and we therefore dismiss them.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 61 FLRA 628, 629-30 (2006), noted as to an exception to a supplemental award considered untimely filed, despite what amounted to a request and denial of reconsideration of the supplemental award by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the Arbitrator issued the SA, the Union requested the Arbitrator to reconsider the SA. By letter to the parties dated May 10, 2005, (Arbitrator's May 10 Letter), the Arbitrator responded to the Union's request and the Agency's opposition thereto. The Arbitrator noted that in its request, the Union alleged that the findings in the SA did not comport with the Initial Award and that although the desk audits "were discredited they were nonetheless relied upon to formulate a remedy." Arbitrator's May 10 Letter at 1. The Union also requested that a "final award be issued, with no further retention of jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Agency asserted that there was no merit to the Union's request for reconsideration. However, the Agency did "join in the request that a final decision issue concerning the entire case, including the remedy." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 2425.1(b) of the Authority's Regulations the time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitrator's award begins on the date the award is served on the filing party. It is not uncommon for an arbitrator to retain jurisdiction for a period of time to resolve questions or problems that might arise concerning the award. However, retention for such purposes does not render an award interlocutory or extend the time limit for filing exceptions. <span class="Italic">Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 15 FLRA 181, 182 (1984). The Authority has held, however, that where a party seeks clarification of an award from an arbitrator, and the arbitrator in rendering such clarification of the original award actually modifies it, the time limit for filing exceptions to the modified award begins upon service of that award on the excepting party. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Labor, Washington, D.C.</span>, 59 FLRA 131, 132 (2003). The arbitrator must modify the award in such a way as to give rise to the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions. <span class="Italic">United States Customs Service, Region I, Boston, Mass.</span>, 15 FLRA 816, 817 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Union asserts that the award did not become final until May 10, 2005, and thus, the exceptions filed on June 8, 2005 are timely. The Agency requests that the exceptions be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the SA, the Arbitrator noted that pursuant to a remand in the Initial Award, the parties were unable to resolve questions of back pay or retroactive adjustment in the grades of the grievants, and the matter was returned to the Arbitrator "to provide a specific remedy consistent with the findings and conclusions of the [Initial Award]. In the SA, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the desk audit report determined that the positions filled by the grievants are properly classified as a GS-7, Information Services Assistant; and (2) that such classification should be applied retroactively to the grievants as of July 2002. The Arbitrator did not compute the amount of back pay stating that in order to do so it was necessary to determine the difference in pay the grievants received as a GS-6, and what they would have received as a GS-7 between July 2002 and the present. The Arbitrator left it to the parties to determine the amount and retained jurisdiction to issue the specific amount if they could not do so. The SA thus resolved the parties' outstanding issues and left nothing to be done except the specific calculation of the amount of grievants' back pay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the Arbitrator's May 10 Letter, the Arbitrator did not modify the SA in any way so as to give rise to the deficiencies alleged in the Union's exceptions. In that letter, the Arbitrator denied the Union's request for reconsideration and indicated that the "underlying [a]ward and the [SA] are final, and the parties may pursue whatever further relief, if any, is available. The Union's exceptions challenge the Arbitrator's findings in the SA--as they concern the desk audit report and the retroactive date for the awarding of back pay--and not his determinations in the May 10 Letter. Further, to the extent that the Union's claim that the SA was not a final award may be construed as an assertion that the award was interlocutory, such claim is unavailing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 FLRA 358, 361 (2005) (exception to an award of back pay in which the arbitrator retained jurisdiction to assist the parties in determining the amount of back pay and interest was not interlocutory). As the SA resolved the issues presented to the Arbitrator, the time limit for filing exceptions to that award began upon service of that award on the excepting party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the time limit for filing exceptions to the award in this case began on the date the SA was served on the parties and had to be postmarked by the United States Postal Service or received in person or by commercial delivery at the Authority no later than May 2, 2005 to be timely. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2425.1(b). The Union's exceptions were filed with the Authority on June 8, 2005 and are, therefore, untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">A clarified award does not extend the time for filing exceptions to the underlying award; only when an arbitrator's response to a clarification request gives rise to the deficiency alleged in the exception does the filing period for exceptions begin with the arbitrator's response. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 199 and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Pub. Debt</span>, 35 FLRA 668, 671 (1990) (relying on <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div.</span>, 22 FLRA 605, 606 (1986)). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Womack Army Medical Center and AFGE Local 1770</span>, 70 FLRA 984, 984-87 (2018) (Member Abbott concurring; Chairman Kiko dissenting), discusses the impact on timeliness of exceptions when a clarification to an award is issued:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The sole question before us is whether the Agency filed its exceptions timely.&#x2003;The grievant sought unpaid retention incentives that the Agency paid to other employees. In his first award, Arbitrator Samuel J. Nicholas, Jr. sustained the grievance and awarded backpay for the unpaid retention incentives for 2010 to 2014. In his second award, the Arbitrator extended the recovery period to include 2015, but did not otherwise revise his award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the deficiencies alleged in the exceptions arose from the first award, and the Agency filed its exceptions more than thirty days after the Arbitrator served the first award, we dismiss the Agency's exceptions because they are untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Background and Arbitrator's Award</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2009, the Agency hired the grievant, a radiological technologist, to work in the Agency's radiology department. The Agency paid the grievant a retention incentive in 2009, but not in subsequent years. Sometime in 2015, the grievant discovered that the Agency had paid retention incentives to other radiological technologists in the radiology department every year. As a result, the Union filed a grievance alleging that the Agency had failed to properly compensate the grievant from 2010 to 2015. The grievance was unresolved, and the parties submitted the matter to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the parties were unable to agree on an issue, the Arbitrator framed the issues as: (1) Did the Agency "violate any rule of law or policy provision" by failing to award the grievant a yearly retention bonus, and (2) if the Agency "was in violation of established protocol or controlling policy," what is the appropriate remedy?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In his first award, issued on May 24, 2017 (original award), the Arbitrator sustained the grievance and awarded the grievant backpay for the retention incentives she would have received from 2010 to 2014. After the Union asked for clarification, the Arbitrator issued a second award on June 5, 2017 (clarified award), that extended the recovery period to include 2015, but did not otherwise revise his original award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 3, 2017, the Agency filed exceptions. The Union filed an opposition to the Agency's exceptions on July 28, 2017.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Agency's exceptions are untimely.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency failed to timely except to the original award, and that the clarified award does not extend the filing period for exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1832"></span>The time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award is thirty days "after the date of service of the award."[2] The Authority may not extend or waive this time limit.[3]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2429.23(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that when a party asks an arbitrator to clarify his or her award, the arbitrator's response does not extend the time period for filing exceptions.[4] But the Authority has also held that "only when an arbitrator's response to a clarification request gives rise to the deficienc[ies] alleged in the exception[s] does the filing period for exceptions begin with the service of the arbitrator's response."[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 3749</span>, 69 FLRA 519, 520-21 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Admin</span>., 42 FLRA 664, 669 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Archives</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Archives</span>, 42 FLRA at 669.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The original award, which the Arbitrator served by email on May 24, 2017, found that the grievant was entitled to retroactive retention incentives and directed the Agency to provide the grievant retention incentives for 2010 to 2014, but did not address 2015. The Union then requested that the Arbitrator clarify whether he intended to include 2015 in the recovery period. By email on June 5, 2017, the Arbitrator notified the parties that he had "erred in his mathematical calculation of the years" and attached the clarified award--solely correcting the recovery period to include 2015.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The deficiencies alleged in the Agency's exceptions arose from the original award, not from the clarified award.[10] In the original award, the Arbitrator found that the grievant was entitled to retroactive retention incentives. In the clarified award, the Arbitrator merely reiterated the first ruling and corrected a typographical error by extending the end of the recovery period from 2014 to 2015. The exceptions do not challenge the only matter--the one-year recovery period extension--that arose from the clarified award, nor do they distinguish 2015 from the other years for which the Arbitrator ordered retroactive retention incentives.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Compare Archives</span>, 42 FLRA at 669 (dismissing as untimely an exception challenging merits of underlying arbitration award directing grievant's retroactive promotion where party did not file exception until after arbitrator clarified backpay dates), <span class="Italic">with U.S. Dep't of the Army, Corps of Eng'rs, Nw. Div. &#x0026; Portland Dist</span>., 60 FLRA 595, 596 (2005) (granting as timely an exception that challenges an arbitrator's finding that a position could not be contracted out, a finding that the Arbitrator first articulates in a clarified award, where an earlier arbitration award merely directed agency to fill disputed position).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Agency's exceptions appeared to be untimely, the Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication issued an order to show cause why the Agency's exceptions should not be dismissed as untimely. In its response to the show-cause order, the Agency argues that excepting to the original award would have been "an impermissible interlocutory appeal" and that the clarified award "was the first final, appealable award." The Agency argues that the original award was not final because it did not address the issue of retention incentives for 2015.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's interlocutory-appeal contention, the original award was a final award. At arbitration, the parties disputed whether the grievant was entitled to a remedy for the Agency's failure to provide her retention incentives. The original award completely resolved that issue, so timely exceptions to that award would not have been interlocutory.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Agency must have filed its exceptions no later than June 23, 2017--within thirty days after the Arbitrator served the original award--in order to be considered timely. But the Agency filed its exceptions on July 3, 2017. Therefore, we find the exceptions untimely, and dismiss them.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In this case, it was clear in the Arbitrator's May 24, 2017, award that he found a violation and awarded a remedy through 2014. That award was served on the Agency that same day. Therefore, the re-issuance of the award on June 5, 2018, with no changes or explanations other than the correction of 2014 to 2015, was nothing more than an editorial correction. It certainly did not constitute a new or modified award that could extend the Agency's deadline for filing exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To hold otherwise would establish a vague precedent that in effect would permit any party to self-extend the statutory thirty-day filing period for filing exceptions simply by asking an Arbitrator to clarify any point of her award no matter how minor or technical. Such an interpretation is not consistent with effective and efficient Government.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Chairman Kiko, dissenting:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties to this case asked the Arbitrator to decide whether the Agency improperly failed to pay the grievant retention bonuses from 2010 through 2015.&#x2003;On May 24, 2017, the Arbitrator served the first award. In it, he found that the grievant was entitled to retention bonuses for the years 2010 <span class="Italic">through 2014</span>. Thus, the first award left the question of whether the grievant should receive retention bonuses through 2015 partly unresolved.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union emailed the Arbitrator and asked that he address the issue of the grievant's 2015 retention bonus. At that point, it was reasonable for the Agency to await a second award. On June 5, 2017, the Arbitrator served the second award. The second award found the grievant entitled to retention bonuses from 2010 <span class="Italic">through 2015</span>. Thus, the second award marked the <span class="Italic">first time</span> that the Arbitrator completely resolved the question that the parties put before him. Only then was the award final and subject to review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For these reasons, I would find that the second award supplanted the first award for purposes of the Agency's right to file exceptions.[7] Because there is no dispute that the exceptions are timely as measured from the issuance of the second award, I would consider the exceptions on the merits.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In its response to the show-cause order, the Union asks the Authority to reverse its precedent that states a motion for reconsideration does not affect an award's finality for exception-filing purposes. The Union asserts that federal courts treat motions for reconsideration and motions for clarification differently, treating the former as a post-trial motion that makes a decision final only once the motion is denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We see no basis for reversing the Authority's well-established precedent on this issue. For purposes of assessing whether arbitration exceptions are timely, the pivotal determination is what the arbitrator <span class="Italic">does</span> in response to a post-award motion--not what that motion is labeled. If the arbitrator's response to a motion does not modify the previous award in a way that gives rise to the exceptions, then the filing period begins with the previous award--not the arbitrator's response to the motion,[27] however that motion is captioned.</p>

The Union argues the Arbitrator's statement "he...wasn't relying on the existence of a 'trend'" is "a definite change of position" that modifies the fee award. The Union claims the Arbitrator's finding that a trend did not exist is central to his denial of fees, and that the Arbitrator relied on a nonfact because he relied on a "trend" of cases instead of factual evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the reconsideration order's discussion of a trend did not modify the fee award. Rather, the Arbitrator merely reiterated that the fee award's "reference to a 'trend' was not a reason to deny" the fee petition. In fact, in its exceptions, the Union concedes that the reconsideration order's discussion of a trend "reiterates" the fee award's findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union does not allege the reconsideration order modified the fee award in any other way, and the exceptions do not challenge any findings that arose solely from the reconsideration order. As such, the Union was required to file its exceptions within thirty days of the fee award. Because it did not do so, we dismiss its exceptions as untimely.[33]</p>
