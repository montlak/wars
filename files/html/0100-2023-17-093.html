<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-94"><span class="space">1.</span> Reemployment Priority List Before RIF Effective Date</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Modifying earlier law, <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 502 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>), decided that an individual who signs up (or who is obstructed in his efforts then to join) the reemployment priority list (RPL) prior to a RIF, may appeal loss of those rights even if the individual is not ultimately separated by RIF. <span class="Italic">Sturdy</span> originally appeared before the Board in <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 80 MSPR 273, 276 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Sturdy I</span>), reaching an opposite result from the 2001 decision. The later result was reached after remand from the Federal Circuit and receipt of an advisory opinion from OPM suggesting Board jurisdiction. The Board determined in <span class="Italic">Sturdy II</span>, 88 MSPR at 506-10 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-19 (followed on remand by a nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Sturdy v. Dept. of Army</span>, 97 MSPR 146 (2004), affirming a determination that there was no violation of the appellant's reemployment rights):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The RPL regulations are based on section 15 of the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, presently codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3315.[2] <span class="Italic">See</span> 53 Fed. Reg. 45,065, 45,065 (1988). Section 3315 provides that "[a] preference eligible who has been separated or furloughed without delinquency or misconduct, on request, is entitled to have his name placed on appropriate registers and employment lists for every position for which his qualifications have been established...." Section 3315 is silent regarding appeal rights, however. Thus, Congress has not directly spoken to the jurisdictional issue before us, and we cannot look to the governing statute in interpreting our jurisdiction over a "reemployment priority rights" appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The RPL regulations are also based on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), which provides that, when an individual fully recovers from a compensable injury after I year, his last employing agency must "make all reasonable efforts to place, and accord priority to placing, the employee in his former or equivalent position." 53 Fed. Reg. 408, 408 (1988). Recovery from a compensable injury is not involved in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction over a "reemployment priority rights" appeal is derived solely from OPM's exercise of its implementing authority. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kohfield v. Department of the Navy,</span> 75 MSPR 1, 4 (1997) (the Board's jurisdiction over a RIF appeal is derived solely from OPM's RIF regulations); <span class="Italic">Gaxiola v. Department of the</span> Air <span class="Italic">Force,</span> 6 MSPB 432, 6 MSPR 515, 519 (1981) (OPM has the power to create the right of appeal to the Board by regulation). Under OPM's RPL regulations at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her <span class="Italic">reemployment priority</span> <span class="Italic">rights</span> under this subpart [B of part 330] have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(Emphasis added.) The RPL regulations do not expressly define the term "reemployment priority rights." Because the Board's jurisdiction under section 330.209 turns on the meaning of "reemployment priority rights," we must examine the RPL regulations as a whole to determine the meaning of "reemployment priority rights."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 330.201(a) of the RPL regulations states: "The reemployment priority list (RPL) is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their former competitive service employees <span class="Italic">separated by reduction in force (RIF)....</span>" (Emphasis added.) In addition, section 330.201(b), (c) provides that an RPL (or a comparable, OPM-approved placement program) must be established and maintained for each commuting area in which the agency "separates" certain employees by RIF. Section 330.206(a)(3) provides that "[a]n eligible employee may be entered on the RPL only for the commuting area in which separated." Section 330.206(a)(2) provides that "[a]n employee is considered for positions having the same type of work schedule as the position from which separated." And section 330.207(b) provides that "[a] person has no greater priority for the grade or position from which separated than any other person on the list who is qualified for the vacancy." These provisions suggest that an employee's "reemployment priority rights" vest upon his separation by RIF. <span class="Italic">See Freeman v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 2 MSPB 388, 2 MSPR 224, 226-27 (1980) ("the very name of the right under discussion, a 'Reemployment Priority right,' clearly implies a right to return to employment" after an actual separation since "[o]ne can only return after one is no longer employed").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.202(a)(1) provides that registration on the RPL may take place as soon as a specific notice of RIF separation or a Certification of Expected RIF Separation has been issued. (A specific notice of RIF separation must be issued at least 60 days before the effective date of the separation, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.801(a)(1), and a Certification of Expected RIF Separation may be issued up to 6 months before the effective date of the separation, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.807(a).) <span class="Italic">See also</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3). Section 330.202(a)(1) provides that an employee may "specify the conditions under which he or she will accept employment, including...positions at the same representative rate and type of work schedule as the position from which the employee was or will be separated And section 330.206(a)(1) provides that an eligible employee "is entitled to consideration for positions...that...have no greater promotion potential than the position from which the employee was or will be separated Moreover, an individual who is properly enrolled in the RPL must be given appropriate job consideration. 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.206-.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the haphazard and inconsistent use of "separated" versus "was or will be separated" throughout the RPL regulations, it is clear that an employee may enroll in the RPL and be placed from it before his actual RIF separation. Thus, an eligible employee has rights under the RPL once he is enrolled in it, regardless of whether he is separated by RIF. The question is whether such RPL rights are equivalent to "reemployment priority rights" appealable under section 330.209. For the reasons discussed, we find that the RPL regulations are ambiguous regarding the meaning of "reemployment priority rights." <span class="Italic">See Brown</span> &#x0026; <span class="Italic">Williamson</span>, 120 S. Ct. at 1300-01.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to 1981, the RIF regulations provided that an RPL shall be maintained for each commuting area in which the agency "separates employees...under this part...." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.1001(a) (1980). The RPL regulations provided that an RPL "shall consist of (1) Former employees...who were separated" by RIF. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.201(e) (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective in 1981, the RIF regulations were revised to provide that "the name of each...employee who <span class="Italic">receives a specific notice of</span> <span class="Italic">separation...</span>under this part is entered on the reemployment Priority list." 45 Fed. Reg. at 48,652, 48,653; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.1002(a) (1981) (emphasis added). The RPL regulations still provided, however, that an RPL "shall consist of: (1) Former employees...separated" by RIF. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.201(e) (1981). In 1988, OPM "consolidate[d] all RPL provisions under Part 330 to improve ease of use." 53 Fed. Reg. 408, 408-09 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> 53 Fed. Reg. 45,065 (1988). The consolidated RPL regulations provided that an employee is eligible to apply for the RPL if, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, he has <span class="Italic">"received a specific notice</span> of [RIF] separation," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.203(a)(3) (1989) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In May 1992, OPM issued interim regulations providing for early warning of expected RIF separations. 57 Fed. Reg. 21,889 (1992). The early warning <span id="Page_3105"></span>was given in the form of a Certification of Expected Separation issued up to 6 months prior to the expected separation date, and employees were allowed to enroll in the RPL upon their receipt of the Certification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 21,889. These interim regulations became final regulations in 1995, when OPM revised the RPL regulations upon sunsetting the Federal Personnel Manual. 60 Fed. Reg. 3,055 (1995). The 1995 revisions included addition of the current language under section 330.201(a) that the RPL is "the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their former competitive service employees separated by reduction in force (RIF)...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3,058. The RPL regulations have not been revised since 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, contrary to the assertion by the Department of Justice before the court that, prior to 1992, RPL enrollment was "restricted...to persons already actually separated by RIF," RPL enrollment before RIF separation was expressly permitted by regulation in 1981. The 1992 revision of the RPL regulations merely permitted even earlier enrollment, by allowing enrollment upon receipt of a Certification of Expected Separation. Upon reviewing the regulatory history, we find that it does not resolve the issue of whether separation by RIF is a jurisdictional requirement for a "reemployment priority rights" appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM states in its advisory opinion that separation by RIF is not a jurisdictional requirement for a Board appeal under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209. Where, as here, the governing statute is silent and the implementing regulations are ambiguous on the issue to be resolved, the implementing agency's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to deference<span class="Italic">. See Wassenaar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 21 F.3d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the RPL regulations permit employees to enroll in and be placed from the RPL before their RIF separations, so that such early enrollees have rights under the RPL before their RIF separations. While the regulations provide that the RPL "is the mechanism agencies use to give reemployment consideration to their former competitive service employees <span class="Italic">separated by</span> reduction in force," 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.201(a) (emphasis added), the regulations do not indicate that the RPL is exclusively for the benefit of separated employees. In addition, the regulations do not specifically distinguish between the appeal rights of separated and non-separated employees. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 330.209. Furthermore, when OPM revised its regulations in 1992 to specifically allow employees to enroll in the RPL upon receipt of a Certification of Expected Separation, OPM indicated that programs such as the RPL should be used to increase the chances that displaced employees will find other employment and avoid or minimize any period of unemployment. 57 Fed. Reg. 21,889 (1992). While the RPL may focus primarily on separated employees, OPM has also indicated that the RPL provides current employees with a means to minimize the disruption caused by a pending RIF. Thus, OPM's interpretation, which would allow employees to appeal violations of their rights under the RPL regardless of whether they were separated by RIF, is neither plainly erroneous nor inconsistent with the regulations. Indeed, public policy may support OPM's interpretation in that employees should be afforded the right to enforce their RPL rights by filing Board appeals, without awaiting their actual RIF separations. We therefore find that OPM's advisory opinion is entitled to deference. Accordingly, we hold that separation by RIF is not a jurisdictional requirement for a "reemployment priority rights" appeal.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;After the regulatory change in 1981 permitting enrollment in the RPL prior to a RIF separation, the Board issued decisions stating that a right to file a reemployment priority rights appeal vests only after a RIF separation. <span class="Italic">Bartlett v.
