<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-40"><span class="space">2.</span> Issues Raised Initially in FLRA Decision or Proceedings</h4>
<p class="noindent">If FLRA raises an issue on its own volition, a party may raise the issue in court even though that party did not brief the issue to FLRA because that party did not know the issue would be raised. FLRA will have had the opportunity to address the issue it raised on its own accord, and its informed judgment on that issue can readily be examined by the reviewing court. <span class="Italic">USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 879 F.2d 655, 659-660 (9th Cir. 1989); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (court may excuse failure to raise issue below if FLRA first raises the issue and then only when its past decisions suggested futility of raising issue anew before FLRA); <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 994 F.2d 868, 872-73 <span id="page_2555"></span>(D.C. Cir. 1993) (enforcement proceeding: issue could be first addressed in court that was first raised by FLRA in its decision); <span class="Italic">FLRA v. DOJ</span>, 994 F.2d 868 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (when issue was raised by FLRA in the order that led to judicial review).</p>
<p class="noindent">An exception to the rule of exhaustion is not often allowed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 7 F.3d 243, 245-46 (D.C. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before reaching the merits of the government's argument, we are obliged to determine whether we may hear the petition. Section 7123(c) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute states that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court [of appeals], unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." 5 U.S.C. 7123(c) (1988). The government candidly admits that it had not "explicitly address[ed] application of the proposal to supervisory employees." It urges, however, that it had <span class="Italic">implicitly</span> raised the supervisory issue because it had objected to the proposals on the grounds that they included "all employees." Moreover, petitioner insists that where--as here--the FLRA raises an issue itself and decides that issue in an order, the requirements of section 7123(c) are met. The government asserts that the agency's failure to raise the supervisory employees issue is excused by extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not think the government's contention that the agency's generalized objection to the proposal's use of the phrase "all employees" fairly brought the supervisory issue to the Authority's attention. After all, the petitioner's argument was focused on the impropriety of the union's proposal covering another bargaining unit. It was for that reason that the agency objected to the inclusion of "all employees" within the proposals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To be sure, section 7123(c) gives us authority to hear arguments not raised before the FLRA if we conclude that the government's failure to do so is justified by extraordinary circumstances. It might well be that even in the absence of a government claim to that effect, we would be authorized to find extraordinary circumstances on our own. As the Supreme Court has noted, section 7123(c) "speaks to courts" and asks that courts determine whether they have the jurisdiction-like authority to hear an argument. <span class="Italic">EEOC v. FLRA</span>, 476 U.S. 19, 23, 106 S. Ct. 1678, 1680, 90 L. Ed.2d 19 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government does contend, however, that since the FLRA raised the supervisory issue, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, section 7123(c)'s requirements are satisfied. Although the Supreme Court has determined that a petitioner is not excused from filing a petition for reconsideration merely because the FLRA raises and decides an issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, <span class="Italic">id</span>., we have held that "when combined with the 'almost <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>' nature of the FLRA's decision...the patent futility of a rehearing petition constitutes an extraordinary circumstance." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, 2 F.3d 1190, 1196 (D.C. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Interior Minerals Management Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1992). We thought the FLRA had acted <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>in that case because it regarded its own precedent as so strong that it did not even entertain the possibility of a successful counter argument. Under those limited circumstances, the 'almost' <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> nature of the FLRA's resolution of the issue simply emphasized the patent futility of the NLRB making a motion for reconsideration. That situation does not present itself here; it is our own recent decision in <span class="Italic">Cherry Point</span>, not settled FLRA precedent, that the Authority addressed <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The government did not claim in its brief that it would have been futile to move for reconsideration, although at oral argument government's counsel did make a rather unpersuasive claim to that effect. "[T]he most we could have done in a reconsideration motion was to say, 'Hey, what about <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span>. You misconstrued <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span> and <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point's</span> discussion of the words seek or purport.'" Exactly; the Authority's reasons for distinguishing <span class="Italic">Cherry</span> <span class="Italic">Point</span> seem to us rather tenuous. We therefore suspect that if the government had provided the FLRA the cogent arguments presented to this court, the FLRA may well have reconsidered its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, because we lack the authority to hear the agency's objections relating to the supervisory employees, we dismiss the agency's petition, and we grant the FLRA's cross-petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-136 v. FLRA</span>, 363 F.3d 468, 479-80 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (following remand, 60 FLRA 446 (2004)), required, except on a showing of futility, that a party seek reconsideration from FLRA before raising in court an objection to an issue raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>by FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Medical Center never argued--either before the ALJ or in its exceptions filed with the Authority--that its decision to park patients in the employee lot was an exercise of its management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). The Union claims that the Authority's <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> consideration of the management rights issue was forbidden by FLRA regulations. Section 7123(c) bars us from addressing this claim, because the Union failed to raise it below and no "extraordinary circumstance" excuses this failure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where the Authority makes a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determination, the parties will not have had an opportunity to address the relevant issue. Nevertheless, &#x00A7; 7123(c) precludes us from considering a pertinent objection if the petitioner has not raised the objection before the Authority in a request for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Commerce v. FLRA,</span> 7 F.3d 243, 245-46 (D.C. Cir. 1993). An exception to this rule is recognized when a request for reconsideration would be "patently futile" in light of recent Authority decisions squarely addressing the issue in question. <span class="Italic">See NLRB v. FLRA,</span> 2 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (D.C. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Interior Minerals Mgmt. Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 969 F.2d 1158, 1161 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The Union argues that a similar exception is warranted in the instant case, because the FLRA's dissenting member challenged the propriety of the Authority raising the &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) argument <span class="Italic">sua sponte,</span> thus affording the Authority an opportunity to address the issue. In other words, the Union suggests that, if a dissenting member of the Authority could not persuade his colleagues, it would have been futile for the Union to pursue a petition for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument implicitly presupposes that a party's position is always coterminous with a dissenting opinion. This is obviously incorrect. Indeed, it does not appear in this case that the dissent squarely raised the specific argument now asserted by the Union. The dissent argued that consideration of arguments not raised in the Medical Center's exceptions "violate[d] basic principles of appellate review, and...denie[d] the General Counsel its right to respond." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 58 F.L.R.A. at 438. But the dissent never suggested that <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> consideration of arguments violates the procedural regulations (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2423.40(d), 2429.5) upon which the Union premises its claim before this court. The Union also appears to assume that the persuasive power of a party's argument can never exceed the quality of a dissenting opinion. We reject this suggestion as well. Section 7123(c) requires a <span class="Italic">party</span> to present its own views to the Authority in order to preserve a claim for judicial review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recently held that &#x00A7; 10(e) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(e)--which is an analog of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c)--precluded us from considering an objection the petitioner did not raise in proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board, despite the fact that the same objection was raised by a dissenting member of the Board. <span class="Italic">Contractors' Labor Pool, Inc. v. NLRB,</span> 323 F.3d 1051, 1061 (D.C. Cir. 2003). The relevant language of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(e) and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c) is virtually identical, and we see no reason to interpret the provisions differently in this context. <span class="Italic">See EEOC,</span> 476 U.S. at 23, 106 S. Ct. at 1680-81 (relying on the Court's past interpretation of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 160(e) to interpret 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c)). Accordingly, we find that the dissent below did not excuse the Union's failure to raise its objections in a request for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">FLRA v. NASA</span>, 120 F.3d 1208, 1215-16 (11th Cir. 1997), also addressed, and came to a different result, as to the ability of an appellant to develop issues in court that first surfaced in an FLRA decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because NASA-HQ did not raise these arguments before the Authority, we cannot consider them "unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c). We conclude that extraordinary circumstances are present in this case. The Authority raised the issue of NASA-HQ's liability <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>when no issues relating to NASA-HQ were before the Authority and filed for enforcement of its order on the same day the order was issued. Although NASA-HQ should have petitioned the Authority for reconsideration of its ruling on this issue, <span class="Italic">see </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.17, we find that the circumstances of this case justify our consideration of the arguments raised by NASA-HQ. <span class="Italic">Cf. EEOC v. FLRA </span>476 U.S. 19, 23, 106 S. Ct. 1678, 1681, 90 L. Ed.2d 19 (1986) (suggesting that <span class="Italic">sua sponte </span>treatment of issue by Authority may excuse failure to request reconsideration); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA </span>2 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (failure to file for rehearing was excusable because of "almost <span class="Italic">sua sponte" </span>nature of Authority's decision and because motion for reconsideration would have been futile). In reviewing the Authority's determination with respect to NASA-HQ, we are mindful that we shall not set aside Authority action unless it is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c).</p>
<p class="noindent">Issues are raised not through incantation of magic words, but by fair presentation of the issues before FLRA, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 754 F.3d 1031, 1039-41 (D.C. Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We next consider the Authority's claim that the Court lacks jurisdiction over NTEU's petition because "the issue on which [NTEU] now seeks judicial review--whether OPM's investigators are representatives of the IRS when interviewing covered employees <span class="Italic">in their first year of service</span>"--was not presented to the Authority. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA</span>, No. 12-1199 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 14, 2013). Section 7123(c) of the FSLMRS provides that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c); <span class="Italic">see also Am. Fed'n of State, Cnty. &#x0026; Mun. Emps. Capital Area Council 26 v. FLRA</span>, 395 F.3d 443, 451 (D.C. Cir. 2005). We have enforced section 7123(c) strictly, recognizing that if a party were permitted to raise an argument for the first time in its petition for review, "the initial adjudicatory role Congress gave to the Authority would be transferred <span id="page_2556"></span>in large measure to this court, in plain departure from the statutory plan." <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 707 F.2d 574, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A party is not required to invoke "magic words" in order to adequately raise an argument before the Authority. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 672 F.3d 1095, 1102 (D.C. Cir. 2012). Instead, an argument is preserved if the party has "fairly brought" the argument "to the Authority's attention." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Commerce v. FLRA</span>, 7 F.3d 243, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The Union advanced two primary arguments before the Authority. First, it argued that the denial of <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights for <span class="Italic">all</span> covered and excepted IRS personnel constitutes a violation of the Statute and the CBA because OPM investigators act as IRS representatives during all interviews of IRS personnel. In support of this argument, NTEU reasoned that, because "[i]t is IRS'[s] responsibility to make suitability determinations of applicants and individuals in their first year of employment," OPM investigators conduct interviews of <span class="Italic">all</span> personnel on behalf of the IRS and therefore act as IRS representatives during the interviews. Union's Exceptions to Arbitrator's Award 27-28, <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union</span>, No. 0-AR-4765 (F.L.R.A. June 13, 2011) (JA 174-75); <span class="Italic">see also id.</span> at 28 ("Thus, while OPM has the regulatory authority to conduct the investigations, it does so in order to permit [the] IRS to make the suitability adjudications required of it by regulation."). In the alternative, NTEU asserted before the Authority that the IRS's failure to ensure representational rights for excepted personnel violates both the Statute and the CBA because OPM investigators act as IRS representatives at least when they interview them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its brief to us, the Union has narrowed its argument, asserting that the IRS committed an unfair labor practice when it failed to ensure representational rights during suitability interviews of covered individuals "in their first year of employment," <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> covered appointees. In support, the Union uses the same reasoning it argued to the Authority, claiming that, because "suitability determinations of appointees in covered positions are an IRS function," OPM investigators conduct interviews of covered appointees <span class="Italic">for</span> the IRS and therefore act as IRS representatives. In response, the Authority argues that the phrase, "'in their first year of employment,' introduces a new concept not previously argued to the Authority" and therefore prevents us from adjudicating NTEU's petition. Br. for Resp't 10-11 (describing argument in Union's brief as "more than a new 'twist' " on argument made to FLRA and "a new argument altogether").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We disagree.&#x2003;NTEU's brief asserts a narrower version of the argument it made to the Authority. As explained above, the Union argued to the FLRA that, because the IRS has authority to make suitability determinations for applicants and appointees to covered positions, OPM investigators conduct interviews of <span class="Italic">all</span> IRS personnel for the IRS and therefore act as IRS representatives during all interviews. Given that covered appointees are a subclass of all IRS personnel, the first argument presented to the Authority "necessarily include[d]" NTEU's claim here that OPM investigators conduct interviews of covered appointees for the IRS and thus act as IRS representatives during such interviews. <span class="Italic">Trump Plaza Assocs. v. NLRB</span>, 679 F.3d 822, 830 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (argument that statements were "adequately disseminated to affect [a union] election necessarily includes the argument that" statements were "adequately disseminated under [NLRB] precedent"). In fact, the reasoning set forth in the Union's brief is virtually identical to the reasoning the Union presented to the Authority; it has simply used that reasoning here to support a more limited claim.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;To put it differently, the Union raises the same argument in its brief that it presented to the Authority but directs that argument to only a portion of the Authority decision--the portion pertaining to covered appointees. This, of course, the Statute permits the Union to do. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 551(13) (reviewable "'agency action' includes the whole <span class="Italic">or a part of</span> an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act" (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(c) (incorporating APA).</p>
<p class="noindent">Similarly, a reviewing court looked to the substance of arguments raised before FLRA, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210622158">1 F.4th 1120</a>, 1125 (D.C. Cir. 2021):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, we have jurisdiction to consider the Union's argument that the FLRA misinterpreted the Proposal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a). Section 7123(c) of the FSLMRS provides that "[n]o objection that has not been urged before the Authority, or its designee, shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge the objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7123(c). "We have enforced section 7123(c) strictly, recognizing that if a party were permitted to raise an argument for the first time in its petition for review, 'the initial adjudicatory role Congress gave to the Authority would be transferred in large measure to this court, in plain departure from the statutory plan.'" <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. FLRA,</span> 754 F.3d 1031, 1040 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA,</span> 707 F.2d 574, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). But "[a] party is not required to invoke 'magic words' in order to adequately raise an argument before the Authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Com. v. FLRA,</span> 672 F.3d 1095, 1102 (D.C. Cir. 2012)). "Instead, an argument is preserved if the party has 'fairly brought' the argument 'to the Authority's attention.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Com. v. FLRA,</span> 7 F.3d 243, 245 (D.C. Cir. 1993)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's interpretation of the Proposal was adequately raised before the FLRA. In its brief before the FLRA, the Union stated it "readily admits that there is no guarantee that an employee will be granted telework under the [CBA], as an employee must satisfy all the existing eligibility standards in Sections 20.02, 20.03, and 20.06(1)." J.A. 170 n.5 (Union's Response to Agency's Statement of Position). As noted, however, the FLRA majority interpreted the Proposal to "dictate[ ] to management how often the [FNS] can require an employee to perform work at the duty station." <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union,</span> 71 F.L.R.A. at 707. The FLRA's characterization of the Proposal as a "presumptive entitlement" to telework that "dictates to management" telework frequency conflicts with the Union's explanation that the Proposal provides "no guarantee" of telework to any employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 704 n.11, 707; J.A. 170 n.5. Accordingly, the Union's misinterpretation argument is properly before us.</p>
