<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-120"><span class="space">2.</span> Remand; Resubmission; Ambiguous or Unclear Award</h4>
<p class="noindent">FLRA may remand or vacate an award. In the words of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-6</span>, 40 FLRA 84, 86-87 (1991): "[W]hen the Authority remands an award to the parties, the Authority's decision will specify that the arbitrator's award is remanded; similarly when an award is set aside, in whole or in part, the award is vacated as to the portion or portions set aside." In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-6</span>, 40 FLRA 275, 281 (1991), an arbitration award was vacated as to counsel fees. On the union's exceptions to a subsequent award from the arbitrator concerning a fee application, FLRA summarized its law on the effect of an order setting aside an award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]hen the Authority sets aside a portion of an arbitration award, that portion of the award is voided and vacated. [A]ll future proceedings with respect to the matter set aside are barred unless the parties jointly agree otherwise. Therefore, the matter involved could not be reopened or reconsidered by the arbitrator absent joint approval of the parties....</p>
<p class="noindent">Under <span class="Italic">Army Transp. Ctr., Ft. Eustis and NAGE Local R4-106</span>, 34 FLRA 601, 603-04 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When the Authority determines under section 7122 of the Statute that an arbitrator's award is deficient and, as a result, sets aside the award in whole or in part, the award is dismissed as to the portion or portions set aside. In contrast, when the Authority remands an award to the parties, the Authority's decision will specify that the arbitrator's award is remanded....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...In an appropriate case, we will remand an arbitrator's award to the parties with the direction that they resubmit the award to the arbitrator for clarification....&#8197;[A] claim that the Arbitrator could now render a legally sufficient decision does not establish a basis on which to remand this case to the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 36 FLRA 233, 235-36 (1990), added:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n an appropriate case, we will remand an award to the parties with the direction that they resubmit the award to the arbitrator for clarification....&#8197;Appropriate cases include those where it is not clear whether an arbitrator found a contract violation or whether the requirements for awarding backpay have been satisfied....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Arbitrator's award is not ambiguous. The Arbitrator clearly found a violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. Moreover, it is clear that the requirements of the Back Pay Act were not satisfied. Consequently, there is no basis for remanding the award to the parties or to the Arbitrator for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent">Speaking of an arbitrator's incorrect conclusion that a grievance was not arbitrable because of the management rights provision of the Statute, <span class="Italic">FEA, Stateside Reg. and DODEA</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-6.html">73 FLRA 32</a>, 34 (2022):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority has repeatedly held that the management rights provisions of &#x00A7; 7106 do not provide a basis for finding a grievance non-arbitrable.[27] Therefore, the Arbitrator erred by finding that the grievance was not arbitrable based on &#x00A7; 7106(a).[28] Accordingly, we grant the Union's contrary-to-law exception, and set aside the Arbitrator's finding that the grievance was not substantively arbitrable.</p>

<p class="noindent">In a dispute over entitlement to career ladder promotions, involving an award that the agency essentially improperly failed properly to negotiate changes in the promotion system, FLRA found lacking a causal relationship between the contract violation and the retroactive promotion remedy ordered by the arbitrator. FLRA considered whether it was required to remand the matter to the parties and to the arbitrator, <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland Reg'l Office and AFGE Local 2823</span>, 59 FLRA 248, 251-52 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By setting aside only the remedy, we leave undisturbed the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement, and therefore committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. The question then becomes whether in this circumstance the Authority should direct further action, such as remanding the matter to the parties for further proceedings to give the arbitrator another opportunity to issue a legal remedy for the violation that he found.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, we note that the Back Pay Act does not mandate a remedy for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2718 v. INS</span>, 768 F.2d 348, 351 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 32 FLRA 771, 774-75 (1988). Likewise, arbitrators are accorded broad discretion in fashioning appropriate remedies, and an arbitrator is not required to provide a remedy for every violation of a collective bargaining agreement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., AFGE Local 2274</span>, 57 FLRA 586, 589 (2001). Clearly, when an arbitrator awards a remedy, the Statute requires that the remedy must be consistent with law. Accordingly, the Authority will find deficient any remedy awarded by an arbitrator that an appealing party establishes is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Authority finds that an award is deficient, &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute plainly empowers the Authority to take such action and make such recommendations as it considers "necessary" in a particular case, as long as such action is consistent with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Accordingly, the question presented here is what action by the Authority concerning the award is necessary under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under recent Authority precedent, the Authority has generally remanded matters to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, when the Authority has found the arbitrator's remedy deficient, but has left unaffected the violation for which the remedy was granted. However, a review of the Authority's precedent demonstrates that this has not been the Authority's consistent practice over the years. In fact, the Authority has taken a variety of different actions in such circumstances.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, where the Authority determined that an arbitrator's remedy, but not the finding of a contract violation, was deficient, the Authority simply struck the remedy<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Veterans Admin., Winston-Salem, N.C.</span>, 27 FLRA 44 (1987) (<span class="Italic">VA</span>); <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn.</span>, 19 FLRA 535 (1985) (<span class="Italic">VAMC</span>). In some of these cases, the Authority reminded the parties that they were empowered to agree to an appropriate remedy for the unaffected violation, and that if they were unable to agree, the matter of an appropriate remedy could be resubmitted to the original arbitrator or could be referred to arbitration<span class="Italic">. See VA</span>, 27 FLRA at 46; <span class="Italic">VAMC, </span>19 FLRA at 537 n.2. More recently, the Authority began generally to remand such cases to the parties for resubmission to the original arbitrator, absent settlement<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 54 FLRA 1365 (1998). However, in some instances, the Authority has modified an arbitrator's award without remanding it, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Paducah, Ky.</span>, 58 FLRA 124, 126-27 (2002); <span class="Italic">Local R-1-185, NAGE</span>, 25 FLRA 509, 512 (1987), or remanded the case to the parties with direction to use an arbitrator of their choice, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., AFGE Local 1997</span>, 53 FLRA 342 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the necessary as well as appropriate action in this particular case is to set aside the remedy without a remand for further proceedings. As the Authority did in <span class="Italic">VA </span>and <span class="Italic">VAMC </span>and similar cases, it is generally appropriate to leave any further action concerning such an award in the hands of the parties<span class="Italic">. See United Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc.</span>, 484 U.S. 29, 40 n.10 (1987) (When a court finds an award deficient, "as a rule the court...should simply vacate the award, thus leaving open the possibility of further proceedings if they are permitted under the terms of the agreement."). The parties, not the Authority, are typically in the best position to determine whether and how to deal with a deficient remedy ordered by an arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the "necessary" action that &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute directs the Authority to take upon finding an award deficient is an individualized judgment to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case. That action can take many different forms: setting aside the deficient remedy without further proceedings, modifying the remedy, remanding the case to the parties for submission to the same or different arbitrator, or possibly other variations. The guiding principle as to what particular action is necessary is whether an action, under the facts and circumstances presented, would promote the purposes and policies of the Statute. In the instant case, we find no facts or circumstances warranting a remand.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, it is clear that by this point in time, the Authority has developed a substantial body of arbitration case precedent that enables parties and arbitrators to know whether or not particular remedies would be lawful in given situations. We strongly encourage parties to arbitration proceedings to address not only whether an alleged violation occurred, but also to focus on the legal requirements applicable to any remedies sought if the arbitrator sustains the grievance. Similarly, arbitrators should be aware of and take into account legal requirements when fashioning appropriate remedies. Further, if exceptions to an award are filed with the Authority, the parties are encouraged to address what action the Authority should take under &#x00A7; 7122(a) if the Authority were to find the arbitrator's remedy deficient, but not the violation for which relief was granted.</p>
<p class="noindent">A remand occurs when "the Authority is unable to determine whether an arbitrator's award is deficient...for a clarification of the basis of the award." <span class="Italic">FTC and AFGE Local 2211</span>, 53 FLRA 1782, 1787 (1998); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2054 and VA Central Arkansas VHS</span>, 63 FLRA 169, 172-73 (2009) (remanding because arbitrator did not provide sufficiency analysis of denial of counsel fees and ruling concerning union's ULP allegation of failure to provide notice to union of formal meetings with unit employees being interviewed for the underlying arbitration case); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC Detroit and AFGE Local 933</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-067.html">60 FLRA 306</a>, 311 (2004) (remanding award for clarification because arbitrator found reassignment violated contract, but arbitrator did not specify law or contract provision that was violated), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 61 FLRA 371 (2005); <span class="Italic">VA Johnson Med.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Council 220 and SSA</span>, 60 FLRA 1, 4 (2004), remanded the award for resubmission to the arbitrator to clarify the basis for a remedy:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also did not specify the basis and rationale for ordering that one grievant "be made whole for the pay differential for money expended on a hardship transfer," the remedy provided in the award. <span id="page_1865"></span>Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5724 and 5724(a), the government is responsible for paying the relocation expenses of an employee who is relocated "in the interest of the government" but is not responsible for relocation expenses of an employee who is relocated for his/her own convenience. See National Air Traffic Controllers Assoc., 54 FLRA 706, 712-13 (1998). In the absence of any statement by the Arbitrator articulating the basis and rationale for awarding that remedy, the legality of the award cannot be ascertained. Consequently, that portion of the award must also be remanded to the parties, absent settlement, for resubmission to the Arbitrator to clarify the basis and rationale for this remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">A party may request, and FLRA may authorize, absent objection by the other party, that the remand be to an arbitrator of the parties' choice. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NLRBPA and NLRB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-10.html">73 FLRA 50</a> (2022).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award is not deficient as ambiguous if the intent of the award can reasonably be determined. In <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Local 238</span>, 63 FLRA 30, 33 (2008), the arbitrator determined that the agency violated the parties' contract by unilaterally changing past practice and refusing to negotiate. The arbitrator directed that the parties bargain in good faith over the matter in dispute. Although the award did not specify the extent of bargaining, there was no indication that the arbitrator intended anything other than bargaining required by 5 USC 7131(d). The award was not ambiguous. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA OHA, Falls Church</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-092.html">60 FLRA 461</a>, 465 (2004), determined that the arbitrator's failure to conduct a balancing test required to determine whether a contractually-negotiated arrangement was appropriate did not render the award deficient; instead, FLRA determined whether the arbitrator's conclusion was consistent with governing law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Over the dissent of Member Pope, FLRA set aside an award, rather than remand the grievance, when the arbitrator found a contract violation involved a missed overtime opportunity but the arbitrator did not make findings under the Back Pay Act to show that the grievant would have received the overtime had the agency not violated its contract, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 59 FLRA 932, 934 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the award or the record supports a conclusion that the Agency's admitted violation of the MOU resulted in grievant actually losing pay. As such, the award of back pay violates the Back Pay Act and is deficient as contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Beaumont, Tex., </span>59 FLRA 466, 468 (2003) (<span class="Italic">BOP Beaumont</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a remand was appropriate in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Hous. and Urban Dev., </span>59 FLRA 243 (2003) (<span class="Italic">HUD</span>), that case is distinguishable from the present case. In<span class="Italic"> HUD</span>, the Arbitrator "made a finding of fact when he determined that sufficient work was available...[for] two of the three grievants" and determined that but for the agency's violation of the collective bargaining agreement, the grievants would have been promoted. <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, 59 FLRA at 246. Because the arbitrator awarded all three grievants promotion with back pay, despite finding that there was only enough work for two of the grievants to be promoted, the Authority remanded for the arbitrator to "determine, if possible, which two of the three GS-13 grievants would have been promoted." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The present case, like<span class="Italic"> BOP Beaumont</span>, presents a situation where nothing in the Arbitrator's award or the record supports a conclusion that there was a causal connection between the Agency's violation of the collective bargaining agreement and the award. The Arbitrator never found that "but for" the Agency's actions the grievant would have been available and would have accepted the overtime assignment. In <span class="Italic">BOP Beaumont</span>, the Authority set aside an award granting a promotion with back pay and back pay for overtime, shift differential and Sunday work as contrary to the Back Pay Act because the arbitrator never found that the grievant applied for or would have been selected for the promotion if the agency had not violated the agreement or that the grievant would have been offered or available for overtime assignments, shift differentials and Sunday work. <span class="Italic">BOP Beaumont</span>, 59 FLRA at 468. Given the above, we set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">At times FLRA shows impatience with remands and vacates an award on exceptions (with no further remand) if an earlier remand clearly failed to accomplish the intended purpose, <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI Bastrop and AFGE Local 3828</span>, 70 FLRA 592, 594 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator provided no additional factual findings to which we can defer and which we utilize to conduct the required <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, we are presented with a legal conclusion ("directly related") that has no factual findings in support.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that a vacuous legal conclusion, one that has no factual findings to support it, is an erroneous legal conclusion. Therefore, that portion of the award in which the Arbitrator pronounced the grievants' passage through security screening to be directly related to their principal activities and one with which the grievants could not dispense is contrary to law, namely the legal standard as given by <span class="Italic">Integrity Staffing</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding the award contrary to law, we do not remand this case for a second time to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator. Unlike previous cases where the Authority has remanded cases for a second time, the Arbitrator here provided <span class="Italic">no</span> further factual findings or analysis following the first remand upon which the Authority could rule. Instead, the Arbitrator's "findings" were simply a recitation of the arguments made by the Union in its briefs on remand--which, for the reasons stated above, are insufficient to support the Arbitrator's legal conclusion. A further remand would give the Union--the party with the burden of proof to demonstrate that these screenings are compensable--a second opportunity to prove its case to the Arbitrator when it failed to do so on remand the first time. For these reasons, we find that a second remand would be inappropriate in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "two strikes and you're out" approach was reaffirmed in <span class="Italic">VA St. Petersburg Regional Office and AFGE Local 1594</span>, 71 FLRA 1, 2 (2019) (Member DuBester dissenting), denying reconsideration to an earlier decision vacating without further remand when one remand on a single issue failed to obtain an acceptable result for FLRA from an arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, by not remanding the case yet again for an appropriate remedy, the Authority failed to follow Authority precedent and so violated the APA. After the Authority first found the remedy contrary to law in <span class="Italic">VA I</span>, it remanded the case to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for an appropriate remedy. On remand, the Union requested only one remedy: that the Agency "allow [the Union vice president] to undergo the PIV credentialing process." Where an arbitrator has already failed to grant an appropriate remedy on remand based on a party's sole requested remedy, it is not appropriate to remand that case a second time.[19] Consequently, the Authority followed its precedent when it did not remand the case to the parties in these circumstances....</p>

Aviation Admin., Salt Lake City, Utah</span>, 63 FLRA 673, 676 (2009). As we have left undisturbed the Arbitrator's finding of liability regarding home leave but have set aside the entire remedy with respect to that violation, we remand the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to formulate an alternative remedy. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 65 FLRA 433, 436 (2011) (concluding that, because the entire remedy for the merits award was set aside, the award should be remanded to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, to formulate an alternative remedy); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">We note the Union's request that the Authority "overturn [the award], find the [Union's] claims arbitrable, and order the parties to proceed to arbitration." To the extent that the Union is requesting the Authority to direct an arbitrator to resolve the merits of the grievance, we note that the arbitrator on remand could find the grievance nonarbitrable on other grounds. For example, the arbitrator could determine that the grievance is nonarbitrable based on the procedural issues framed but left unresolved at arbitration, such as whether the grievance was presented by the right party, to the proper party, or in the proper forum. Thus, we deny the Union's request in this regard. As such, we also deny the Agency's arguments regarding mootness and ripeness, as they are responsive to the Union's request.</p>

<p class="noindent">If a portion of a remedy established by an award is set aside, but some relief remains for the contract violations, FLRA appears to be disinclined to remand the case for development of a substitute for the portion of the remedy that was vacated, <span class="Italic">DHHS, FDA and NTEU, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-056.html">60 FLRA 250</a>, 252-53 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1866"></span>Here, the Agency argues, and the Union concedes, that there is no statutory basis for the award of monetary damages to the Union. Thus, as it is undisputed that there is no statutory basis for the award of monetary damages to the Union, we conclude that the portion of the award providing money damages to the Union violates the doctrine of sovereign immunity and is deficient as contrary to law. Accordingly, we set aside that portion of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that, although there is no statutory basis for the remedy of monetary damages, the award should be remanded. In this regard, the Union asserts that in cases where the underlying violation is upheld but the remedy is set aside, the Authority has remanded awards to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator to determine an alternative appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">No remand is warranted in this case.&#x2003;As an initial matter, we note that, contrary to the Union's assertion, only part of the remedy for the underlying violation (the remedy of monetary damages) has been set aside. The other part of the Arbitrator's remedy, which directs the Agency to cease and desist from scheduling meetings in a manner that requires non-workday travel when it is administratively feasible to do otherwise, remains in effect. As such, this is not a case in which there is an unremedied violation, and, therefore, there is no basis for a remand in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Complex, Beaumont, Tex., </span>59 FLRA 466, 468 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part as to other matters)<span class="Italic"> (DOJ Beaumont) (citing, among others, United States Dep't of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Medical Center Carswell, Fort Worth, Tex.</span>, 58 FLRA 210, 212 (2002) (<span class="Italic">DOJ Carswell</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, insofar as the Union contends that the Authority always remands awards where the underlying violation is upheld but the remedy for the violation is set aside, such a contention is incorrect. In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Cleveland Reg'l Office, Cleveland, Ohio, </span>59 FLRA 248 (2003) (Member Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>), the Authority addressed what actions it would take in cases where it set aside the remedy but left undisturbed an arbitrator's finding of an underlying contractual violation. The Authority stated that "[t]he question then becomes whether in this circumstance the Authority should direct further action,<span class="Italic"> </span>such as remanding the matter to the parties for further proceedings to give the arbitrator another opportunity to issue a legal remedy for the violation that he found." <span class="Italic">VA Cleveland</span>, 59 FLRA at 251-52. The Authority concluded that the action it would take under the Statute would require "an individualized judgment to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 252. In this regard, the Authority stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">That action can take many different forms: setting aside the deficient remedy without further proceedings, modifying the remedy, remanding the case to the parties for submission to the same or different arbitrator, or possibly other variations. The guiding principle as to what particular action is necessary is whether an action, under the facts and circumstances presented, would promote the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Union is incorrect in contending that a remand is warranted in this case simply because the remedy of monetary damages is set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, USP Leavenworth and AFGE Local 919</span>, 59 FLRA 593, 599 (2004) ("[W]e find that as the portion of the remedy is contrary to law and, as other remedies remain, there is no basis in Authority precedent for remanding this part of the award."), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 59 FLRA 803 (2004).</p>
<p class="noindent">The rule that an unambiguous, deficient award will not be remanded for clarification was reiterated in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Ogden Air Logistics Ctr., Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 46 FLRA 377, 380 (1992). Other matters may, however, call for remand. There may be the question of who is supposed to handle the case on remand. FLRA announced, on a request for clarification, in <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots, Marine Div., Panama Canal Pilots Branch</span>, 34 FLRA 740, 741-42, 743-44 (1990), involving an award initially reviewed by FLRA and remanded with the instruction, "we remand the Arbitrator's award to the parties with the direction that they resubmit the award to arbitration..." for further proceedings consistent with this decision:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the Union's request for clarification..., we remand the grievance at issue to the parties for submission to an arbitrator of their choice. The parties are not required to resubmit the grievance to the author of the award, nor are they precluded from doing so if they so choose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no statute or regulation which requires that an arbitration award be resubmitted to its author.&#x2003;In most cases, the Authority remands an arbitration award to the parties for resubmission to its author because a particular aspect of an award requires clarification or interpretation....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, the remand is not for the purpose of clarification or interpretation of the award. The award was confined solely to a discussion of the constitutional aspects of the dispute. Therefore, a remand in this case is necessary to permit initial consideration of the issue originally submitted to arbitration--whether there is just cause under the parties' agreement for the proposed suspension. There is no indication whatsoever in the record that the Arbitrator considered this issue....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inasmuch as the issues discussed above were not addressed by the Arbitrator, it is unnecessary to limit the parties' choice of an arbitrator on remand....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not unsympathetic to the Union's contention that a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceeding probably would involve an additional expenditure of time and money that would not be required if the award were resubmitted to its author. We recognize that a goal of arbitration is to enable unions and management to resolve disputes speedily and economically. Nonetheless, we do not believe that it is the Authority's proper role to select arbitrators for parties unless the circumstances so dictate....</p>
<p class="noindent">When FLRA wants clarification from the author of the award, it can "remand the award to the parties for the purpose of seeking a clarification of the award from the Arbitrator." FLRA does not send the case back to the arbitrator; it goes back to the parties who must then entice the arbitrator's reappearance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Commerce, PTO and POPA</span>, 34 FLRA 992, 999 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS, San Diego and AFGE INS Council</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v51/51-089.html">51 FLRA 1094</a>, 1107 (1996) ("The Authority will remand an award to the parties for the purpose of obtaining a clarification from the arbitrator in circumstances where an ambiguity in the award...prevents the Authority from determining whether the award is deficient."). That occurred when an arbitrator's finding on environmental differential pay entitlement was set aside because of a factual error and remanded for clarification of the facts. FLRA directed that the "parties are directed to resubmit the award to the Arbitrator, either jointly or separately, to obtain clarification of the award." <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, 6th Infantry Div., Ft. Richardson and AFGE Local 1834, Fort Wainwright</span>, 35 FLRA 42, 47 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Navy Pub. Works Ctr. and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 59 FLRA 551 (2003) (remanding for resubmission to arbitrator on specific issues (whether misconduct occurred as alleged and, if so, what penalty was appropriate) so that FLRA would have sufficient information to resolve exceptions); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1592 and Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB</span>, 44 FLRA 147, 154 (1992) (temporary promotion claim: remanding to parties to obtain clarification of award from arbitrator concerning his interpretation of contract).</p>
<p class="noindent">Or FLRA may direct the parties to resubmit the case to "an arbitrator of their choice." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Council 220</span>, 41 FLRA 224, 233 (1991) (arbitrator incorrectly applied negotiability law to contract and ULP issues). If the arbitrator disclaims an interest in a remand, FLRA may suggest to the parties submission to another arbitrator if the parties cannot settle the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alabama ACT and DOD, Alabama NG</span>, 56 FLRA 231, 235 (2000) (referencing Rule 18 of the American Arbitration Association); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">NLRBPA and NLRB</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v73/73-10.html">73 FLRA 50</a> (2022) (granting union request, with no objection from the agency, that the remand be to an arbitrator of the parties' choice). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-398.html#sec9-398">Awards of Counsel Fees</a>," on FLRA treatment of deficient awards concerning counsel fee applications.]</p>
<p class="noindent">Should FLRA remand for better analysis by the arbitrator of governing legal authority, e.g., application of the <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas</span> criteria in an EEO case, the arbitrator is not required to rehear or reopen the record for additional evidence if the arbitrator is satisfied that the record is sufficient for her decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3614 and EEOC</span>, 61 FLRA 719, 723-24 (2006) (remand order did not require hearing and arbitrator did err by resolving factual issue without hearing); <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 48 FLRA 1337, 1342 (1994), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, 44 FLRA 1223 (1992) [discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-207.html#sec9-207">Discrimination</a>"].</p>
<p class="noindent">A remand occurs when an arbitrator mistakenly finds a grievance not to be substantively arbitrable, <span class="Italic">FOP New Jersey Lodge 173 and Dept. of Army, Army Garrison Ft. Monmouth</span>, 58 FLRA 384, 386 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an arbitrator has erred in finding a grievance not substantively arbitrable, the Authority consistently has remanded the matter for the arbitrator to address the merits. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 2010,</span> 55 FLRA 533, 535 (1999); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3258, </span>53 FLRA at 1330; and <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1636, </span>48 FLRA 511, 515 (1993). While the Union requests that the Authority direct the Arbitrator to rescind the financial assessment on remand (or rescind it without remand), there is no basis in the record for determining that financial assessment is inappropriate based solely on a finding that the Agency lacked "just cause" for the suspension. In this regard, there is no basis to conclude that the standards for "just cause" and financial assessment are the same, such that finding the Agency lacked just cause to suspend the grievant compels a conclusion that financial assessment is inappropriate. As such, and consistent with Authority precedent, we remand the financial penalty issue to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement.</p>
<p class="noindent">When an award is returned to the arbitrator, it is up to the arbitrator to determine whether a remedy is required and what that remedy will be--even if FLRA determines that the arbitrator should have determined that the agency committed a ULP, <span class="Italic">GSA Region 9 and AFGE Council 236</span>, 48 FLRA 1348, 1356 (1994) (following remand, 53 FLRA 925 (1997)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find, contrary to the Arbitrator, that the Union was <span id="page_1867"></span>entitled to notification of and an opportunity for representation at the settlement negotiations and discussions. However, we will not order a remedy. In choosing to file a grievance, the Union chose the judgment and discretion of the Arbitrator, and we will not disturb that choice. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1273 and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Boise, Idaho</span>, 44 FLRA 707, 715 (1992) (arbitrator properly retained jurisdiction to decide statutory remedial issues because the union had exercised its statutory option as to the procedures under which it could raise such matters when it filed the grievance). Therefore, we will remand this portion of the award to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator to fashion a remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA expects that the arbitrator will decide the issue framed for remand and not expand on that review, unless the parties agree that additional issues or claims will be decided on remand. FLRA was critical of one arbitrator who, on remand, essentially called on FLRA to reconsider its earlier decision setting aside a portion of his award, and who went beyond the confines of the remand to decide other issues, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC Guaynabo and AFGE Local 4052</span>, 67 FLRA 417, 420 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Arbitrator noted that the Union's request for home leave had "merit" and "urge[d]" the Authority to adopt it. The Arbitrator stated that the "adoption" of his remedy of home leave, however, "<span class="Italic">depends on</span> the Authority's decision to reconsider its ruling on [h]ome [l]eave" in <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>. That is, the Union would be entitled to its requested remedy <span class="Italic">only</span> if the Authority reconsidered this ruling.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We decline to reconsider the holding of <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>. As the Agency notes in its opposition, the legal framework that governs the use of home leave has not changed since <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>. Thus, we see no reason why our conclusion regarding home leave should be modified or set aside. In addition, we note that the Arbitrator is not a "party to the proceeding before the Authority," and, therefore, cannot move for reconsideration under &#x00A7; 2429.17 of the Authority's Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the Arbitrator's remedy of home leave was explicitly conditioned on our reconsideration of <span class="Italic">BOP I</span>, and because we have declined to reconsider our decision in that case, the question of remedy remains.[44] Accordingly, we must once again remand this matter to the parties, and the Arbitrator, if necessary, for the sole purpose of formulating an alternative remedy to home leave.[45]</p>

<p class="noindent">If FLRA sets aside a portion or all of a remedy included in an award, its adjudication does not preclude the parties from agreeing on an appropriate remedy for a contract violation, or from agreeing to resubmit the issue of an appropriate remedy to the arbitrator whose award was reviewed, or to another arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ.

<p class="noindent-1">Although in its recent remands to the parties, the Authority has directed that the matter be resubmitted, absent settlement, to the original arbitrator, in many cases, the Authority has routinely remanded to the parties with the direction to resubmit the matter, absent settlement, to an arbitrator of their choice<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a)(2) of the Statute provides that the Authority, on finding that an award is deficient, "may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules or regulations." While the customary practice in remanding awards contemplates that, absent settlement, the awards will be resubmitted to the same arbitrator who initially adjudicated those matters, the Authority has, in unusual cases, required that, absent settlement, the dispute be submitted to an arbitrator other than the arbitrator who initially made the award. <span class="Italic">See e.g. American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees and Social Security Administration,</span> 29 FLRA 1568, 1580 (1987) (separate opinion of Members Calhoun and Frazier) (parties ordered, absent settlement, to submit dispute to "neutral" arbitrator, because dispute "one of long-standing and evident rancor" and because of self-interest of original arbitrator); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="noindent-1">The instant case is an unusual case that warrants such a remedial order.&#x2003;In particular, the role of the Arbitrator in this case was to enforce compliance with two bilateral settlement agreements made by the parties. The Arbitrator has now issued five separate compliance awards involving issues that are escalating in number and tone. Moreover, the nature of the Arbitrator's statements in Award V, and the Agency's interpretations of them, may raise the question of his continuing ability to assist the parties to resolve their disputes and improve their labor-management relationship. As a result, if the parties are unable to settle this matter on remand, and either party objects to resubmission of this matter to the Arbitrator, then the parties are directed to select a different arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA authorized a remand submission to another arbitrator when the original arbitrator disregarded FLRA's instructions on an earlier remand, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, MDC Guaynabo and AFGE Local 4052</span>, 67 FLRA 417, 420 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When remanding a case, the Authority may also "take such action and make such recommendations concerning [an arbitration] award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules or regulations."[46] Pursuant to this authority--and because the Arbitrator's disregard of the issue he was to address on remand raises a question regarding his ability to resolve the remaining issue--we remand this matter to the parties with the option that either may object to resubmission of this matter to the Arbitrator. In the event of such an objection, the parties will jointly seek a new arbitrator.[47] This new arbitrator, or the current Arbitrator, should the parties choose to retain him, will be limited to addressing one issue: what is an appropriate alternative remedy to home leave. To be clear, no other issue is properly before him unless the parties <span class="Italic">jointly</span> agree to place other matters before him for resolution.[48]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Normally, where the Authority is unable to determine whether an award is contrary to law, the Authority remands the award to the parties for further findings by the arbitrator, absent settlement.[22] However, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute permits <span id="page_1868"></span>the Authority "to take such action and make such recommendations concerning [an arbitration] award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations."[23] In unusual circumstances, these actions have included permitting the parties to choose a different arbitrator, absent settlement, upon remand.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in light of this case's circumstances, including that this is now the second remand, we will give the parties the option of seeking a different arbitrator should one party object to returning this case to the original arbitrator upon remand. The arbitrator should address the issues originally remanded in <span class="Italic">AFGE I</span>, namely: (1) whether the grievant is a qualified individual who could perform the essential functions of the position in question, with or without a reasonable accommodation; and (2) if so, whether the grievant was discriminated against because of his disability; that is, whether the Agency failed to reasonably accommodate a qualified individual with a known disability or whether the Agency demonstrates that the requested accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the Agency.</p>

<p class="noindent">When a remand results in a second award and another set of exceptions, those exceptions cannot challenge the bases for FLRA's first decision.
