<p class="Body-Text">The defense of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> can be waived, although under limited circumstances involving a clear prior ruling by the Board, the Board may raise the issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte,</span> <span class="Italic">Stearn v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 280 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, a final judgment on the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in that action. <span class="Italic">Federated Dep't Stores,</span> <span class="Italic">Inc. v. Moitie,</span> 452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.C. 2424, 69 L. Ed.2d 103 (1981). The doctrine serves to "relieve parties of the cost and vexation of multiple lawsuits, conserve judicial resources, and...encourage reliance on adjudication." <span class="Italic">Allen v. McCurry,</span> 449 U.S. 90, 94, 101 S.C. 411, 66 L. Ed.2d 308 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where a party has notice that a regulation is being applied, an attack on the validity of that regulation is an issue that can be raised in an ensuing action. Here, petitioners were placed on notice in all three appeals that the Navy was applying 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e) by clear statements in the memoranda denying LEO credit. Petitioners' challenge to the validity of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e) thus could have been raised in their initial appeals to the Board. Despite the fact that petitioners did not raise the issue at any point during the initial proceedings before the administrative law judge, nor in their petition for review of the resulting initial decision, the petitioners were aware of the Navy's reliance on the regulation and could have challenged its validity at that time. <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> thus was available to the Navy as a defense to all three of the enforcement actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Board has held that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is waived if not timely raised<span class="Italic">. Castle v. Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 417, 423 n.6 (1995); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c). In practice before the Board, a defense is timely raised at any point before the end of the conference held to define the issues in the case. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(b) (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Bremby and Stearn enforcement petition actions, the Navy failed to timely raise the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> defense. Notwithstanding this, the Board made a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. The Supreme Court has recently noted that such <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> findings of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> might be appropriate in "special circumstances. Most notably, 'if a court is on notice that it has <span class="Italic">previously decided</span> the issue presented, the court may dismiss the action <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, even though the defense has not been raised."' <span class="Italic">Arizona v. California</span>, 530 U.S. 392, 412, 120 S.C. 2304, 147 L. Ed.2d 374 (2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Sioux Nation</span>, 448 U.S. 371, 432, 100 S.C. 2716, 65 L. Ed.2d 844 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)) (emphasis added). However, "[w]here no judicial resources have been spent on the resolution of a question, trial courts must be cautious about raising a preclusion bar <span class="Italic">sua sponte,</span> thereby eroding the system of party presentation so basic to our system of adjudication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 412-13, 100 S.C. 2716. Such "special circumstances," which would justify a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determination of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, are not present in this case. While the challenge to the regulation "could have been raised," in fact it was not and <span id="Page_1528"></span>the Board did not actually decide the question of the validity of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.906(e) in the first appeal. Because the Navy failed to affirmatively plead, and thus waived, the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, defense, and because the Board had not actually ruled on the issue in the previous litigation, we find the "special circumstances" needed to justify the Board's <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> absent in the Bremby and Stearn appeals. Thus, the Board's dismissal of these appeals on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> grounds was in error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following up on <span class="Italic">Stearn</span>, the Board <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> raised <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to bar an IRA appeal presenting a whistleblower reprisal defense that could have been earlier asserted in an adverse action appeal, <span class="Italic">Sabersky v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 210, 213-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2002), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Sabersky v. DOJ</span>, 61 Fed. Appx. 676 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We acknowledge that the agency did not raise the issue of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> before the administrative judge or in response to the appellant's petition for review. However, we may raise the issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte. Cf. Stanton v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals,</span> 127 F.3d 72, 77 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (a party's failure to raise <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> does not prevent appellate court from considering issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte); accord McClain v. Apodaca,</span> 793 F.2d 1031 (9th Cir. 1986). We note the recent decision of <span class="Italic">Stearn v. Department of the Navy,</span> 280 F.3d 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2002), in which the court held that the Board had erred in <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> raising <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> and declining to consider an argument on that ground, where no "special circumstances" were found to justify such an action. The Federal Circuit looked to <span class="Italic">Arizona v. California,</span> 530 U.S. 392, 412, 120 S.C. 2304, 147 L. Ed.2d 374 (2000), in which the Court acknowledged that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is partly based on the "avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste." In declining to apply the doctrine <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, the Court held that a court might properly raise <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in special circumstances, "[m]ost notably, 'if a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue presented."' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, the Court advised that "[w]here no judicial resources have been spent on the resolution of a question, trial courts must be cautious about raising a preclusion bar <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, thereby eroding the principle of party presentation so basic to our system of adjudication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 412-13, 120 S.C. 2304. In <span class="Italic">Stearn</span> the appellants brought an enforcement proceeding in which their central argument challenged the validity of a federal regulation, an issue which had not been raised or considered in an earlier phase of their appeal. The agency failed to timely argue <span class="Italic">res judicata,</span> and the Federal Circuit ruled that the defense had therefore been waived, and finding no special circumstances, reversed the Board's decision to apply <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> <span class="Italic">sua sponte.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike in <span class="Italic">Stearn</span> in which the court was asked to decide a purely legal question which had not been considered before, here the appellant essentially <span class="Italic">seek</span>s a readjudication of his removal, clothed in a new legal theory. The same AJ heard both appeals, and was therefore on notice that the Board had previously adjudicated the propriety of the appellant's removal. As a result, this appeal presents the sort of "special circumstances" which justify <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> dismissal based on <span class="Italic">res judicata.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sabersky v. DOJ</span>, 61 Fed. Appx. 676, 677-80 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP), decided that the Board should not have raised <span class="Italic">res judicata sua sponte</span>, but the error was insufficient to warrant a different result:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...We conclude that it was error for the Board to raise the issue of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. We further conclude, however, that the Board's error in this regard was harmless, and we therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing the appeal. The application of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is a matter of law that we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">United Techs. Corp. v. Chromalloy Gas Turbine Corp.</span>, 189 F.3d 1338, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Under that doctrine, a final judgment on the merits prevents the same parties from relitigating claims or issues that were or could have been raised in a prior proceeding. <span class="Italic">Federated Dep't Stores v. Moitie</span>, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981); <span class="Italic">Stearn v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 280 F.3d 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002). A whistleblower claim can be raised in an employee's challenge to a removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.2(b). Like other defenses, the failure to raise a whistleblower claim as a defense in the original removal appeal ordinarily bars the employee from raising it in a subsequent challenge to the removal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Spears v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 766 F.2d 520, 523 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("Having previously appealed her removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board on nondiscrimination grounds and lost, Spears is barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> from subsequently challenging her termination on the allegation of discrimination.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with the Board's invocation of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is that the government did not raise the issue before the Board; instead, the Board raised the issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>. The Supreme Court has explained that tribunals normally should not base their decisions on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> if the parties have not raised that issue, although the Court has noted that a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> "might be appropriate in special circumstances." <span class="Italic">Arizona v. California</span>, 530 U.S. 392, 412 (2000). "Most notably, 'if a court is on notice that it has previously decided the issue presented, the court may dismiss the action <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, even though the defense has not been raised."' <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court further stated, however, that "[w]here no judicial resources have been spent on the resolution of a question, trial courts must be cautious about raising a preclusion bar <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, thereby eroding the principle of party presentation so basic to our system of adjudication." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 412-13. We have likewise held that the Merit Systems Protection Board should not invoke <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> when the Board has not ruled on the same issue in the prior appeal. <span class="Italic">See Stearn v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 280 F.3d 1376, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2002) ("While the challenge to the regulation 'could have been raised,' in fact it was not and the Board did not actually decide the question of the validity of [the regulation] in the first appeal. Because the Navy failed to affirmatively plead, and thus waived, the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> defense, and because the Board had not actually ruled on the issue in the previous litigation, we find the 'special circumstances' needed to justify the Board's <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> absent....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board found that this appeal presented the requisite special circumstances for a <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> dismissal and sought to distinguish <span class="Italic">Stearn</span>. The Board stated that "[u]nlike in <span class="Italic">Stearn</span>, in which the court was asked to decide a purely legal question which had not been considered before, here the appellant essentially <span class="Italic">seek</span>s a readjudication of his removal, clothed in a new legal theory. The same [administrative judge] heard both appeals, and was therefore on notice that the Board had previously adjudicated the propriety of the appellant's removal." The government advances essentially the same argument on appeal, contending that "[T]he board correctly found that Mr. Sabersky did not present, for example, a purely legal question, or challenge the validity of a regulation.... Instead, Mr. Sabersky was essentially <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing merely to relitigate the facts and circumstances underlying his removal, his intention to present a new legal theory notwithstanding." We conclude, however, that the requisite special circumstances were not present in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board characterizes the issue decided by the Board in the initial appeal too broadly. The Board indicates that the issue decided was the propriety of Mr. Sabersky's removal. However, the issue actually decided in the initial appeal was whether preponderant evidence supported the agency's conclusion that Mr. Sabersky was insubordinate and whether his conduct justified his removal. In contrast, the determinative issues with respect to a whistleblowing claim include whether the appellant made a protected disclosure as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and whether the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 (e)(1); <span class="Italic">Kewley v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs.</span>, 153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Neither of those issues was decided in Mr. Sabersky's initial appeal. It is not sufficient that the administrative judge in the initial appeal found "that the agency has supported its charge by preponderant evidence" and "that appellant was insubordinate, as charged, and that his insubordination resulted in his being dismissed from the training academy." The judge reviewed the evidence only for a preponderance of evidence, but there is a different burden of proof in a whistleblowing case once a disclosure is found to be a contributing factor to the adverse action in question. In that situation, the burden of proof shifts to the agency to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of the disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e); <span class="Italic">Kewley</span>, 153 F.3d at 1361. Accordingly, we conclude that the issues in this whistleblower appeal were not decided in the previous litigation before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, we do not believe that <span class="Italic">Arizona</span> and <span class="Italic">Stearn</span> were limited to purely legal questions, as the Board suggested. Rather, the Supreme Court, focusing on the "avoidance of unnecessary judicial waste," sought to prevent "the prospect of redoing a matter once decided." <span class="Italic">Arizona</span>, 530 U.S. at 394-95. That matter could be either a factual issue or a pure issue of law, but if the issue was not actually decided in the previous appeal, the policy of avoiding "redoing a matter" would not be served. In this case, as previously discussed, the Board's resources were not expended in the first appeal on the issues that were presented by the second.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we hold that the Board erred in ruling on the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue without hearing from the parties, we further conclude that the Board's error was harmless under the circumstances of this case, and we therefore affirm the Board's decision dismissing the appeal. Although Mr. Sabersky contends that the Board erred by addressing the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, there is no hint in any of his various filings in this court as to how the Board's procedural error prejudiced him. He does not suggest how the case might have been resolved differently if the government had raised the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue before the Board and he had had an opportunity contest the applicability of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to his case. Nor does he suggest any argument he might have made to the Board to show that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> should not apply to this case. In fact, this case presents what appears to be a straightforward application of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, and it is difficult to imagine how a finding of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> could be avoided on the facts presented here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his second appeal, Mr. Sabersky sought the same relief as in the first: reversal of his removal action. The underlying claim, that he was improperly removed, was the same in both appeals, and the first appeal clearly raised and decided that issue against him. In his second appeal, <span id="Page_1529"></span>he sought relief from the same decision on a different theory. His theory that he was removed because of prior acts of whistleblowing was presumably available to him at the time he filed his first appeal, and he does not suggest that there was any reason he could not have raised his whistleblower claim at the time he filed his initial appeal. Accordingly, Mr. Sabersky has failed to give us any reason to believe that the Board might have reached a different conclusion as to the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue if the government had raised the issue before the Board. Accordingly, this is an appropriate case in which to apply the principle, set forth in 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2111, that in any appeal, a court of appeals "shall give judgment after an examination of the record without regard to errors or defects which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Giove v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 230 F.3d 1333, 1338-39 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Because we are fully persuaded that the Board's error in addressing the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> issue <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> did not affect Mr. Sabersky's substantial rights, we affirm the Board's ruling dismissing Mr. Sabersky's appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">McCoy v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 160, 168 n.4, 2008 MSPB 37 (2008), the agency's defense of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> was considered waived when it was not raised by the agency in a cross-PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the proceeding below, the agency argued that this appeal was barred by the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> as a result of a prior Board decision, which dismissed the appellant's appeal as withdrawn. The agency, however, has not timely filed a cross-petition for review raising the defense of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>. The Board has held that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is waived if not timely raised. <span class="Italic">Castle v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 417, 423 n.6 (1995). Accordingly, we find that the <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> defense has been waived for the purposes of this appeal. Further, the Board's regulation at 5 CFR 1201.114(b) provides that the Board normally will consider only issues raised in a timely filed petition for review or cross-petition for review. The Board has applied this regulation in cases where an issue was raised below but was not raised in a timely filed petition for review or cross-petition for review. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fowler v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 M.S.P.R. 8, 15 (1997) and<span class="Italic"> Lambert v. Army,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 688, 699 (1990),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). We find it appropriate to apply the regulation here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Castle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 68 MSPR 417, 423 (1995), cited in <span class="Italic">McCoy</span>, stated in note 6:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency did not raise the affirmative defense of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> in this proceeding. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1B James W. Moore <span class="Italic">et al</span>., <span class="Italic">Moore's Federal Practice</span> &#x00B6; 0.408[1] (2d ed. 1993) and PFRF, Tab 3. <span class="Italic">See also Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> is not a jurisdictional bar to repetitive litigation, and if not timely raised is waived. <span class="Italic">See</span> Moore <span class="Italic">et al.,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span> &#x00B6; 0.408[1]; <span class="Italic">see also Mycka v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 56 M.S.P.R. 675, 679 (1993) (dismissal based on <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> is not on grounds of lack of jurisdiction; rather, <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> provides a basis to dismiss an appeal over which the Board has jurisdiction). In any event, having dismissed on the threshold issue of jurisdiction, we need not explore the applicability of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to this case.</p>
