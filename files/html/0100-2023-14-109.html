<h5 class="h5" id="sec7-107"><span class="space">d.</span> Pending Challenge to Past Discipline</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In litigation carried through (but not ending with) a Supreme Court decision, it was determined that the Board is not precluded from considering in a current adverse action appeal past disciplinary action that is subject to a pending grievance. The Supreme Court, while not expressly embracing the Board's <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> analysis, did not reject it. The short of it is that the Board may, under an appropriate standard of review (and <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> constitutes that standard), consider in the penalty analysis past discipline subject to a current challenge. The Court determined in <span class="Italic">USPS v. Gregory,</span> 122 S. Ct. 431, 434-36 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]&#x2003;Board Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) upheld respondent's termination, concluding that the Postal Service had shown that respondent overestimated her overtime beyond permissible limits on September 13 and that her termination was reasonable in light of this violation and her prior violations. Although the three prior disciplinary actions were the subject of pending grievances, the ALJ analyzed them independently, following the approach set forth in <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Department of Air Force</span>, 8 MSPB 658, 9 M.S.P.R. 335 (1981). <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> provides for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of prior disciplinary actions unless: "(1) [the employee] was informed of the action in writing; (2) the action is a matter of record; and (3) [the employee] was given the opportunity to dispute the charges to a higher level than the authority that imposed the discipline." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 660-661, 9 M.S.P.R. 335. If these conditions are met, Board review of prior disciplinary action is limited to determining whether the action is clearly erroneous. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 660. After finding that respondent's three prior disciplinary actions met <span class="Italic">Bolling's</span> three conditions, the ALJ concluded that there was no clear evidence of error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent petitioned the Board for review of the ALJ's decision. While this appeal was pending, an arbitrator resolved respondent's first grievance (relating to the April 7 incident) in her favor, and ordered that the letter of warning be expunged. Respondent did not advise the Board of that ruling. The Board then denied her request for review of the ALJ's determination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Respondent petitioned for review of the Board's decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(a). That court affirmed the Board's decision to uphold the ALJ's factual findings with respect to the September 13 incident. 212 F.3d, at 1299. Taking judicial notice of the fact that one of the three disciplinary actions underlying respondent's termination had been overturned in arbitration, and noting that respondent's two remaining grievances were still pending, it reversed the Board's determination that the penalty was reasonable. <span class="Italic">Ibid</span>. While recognizing that disciplinary history is an "important factor" in assessing any penalty, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 1300, the Federal Circuit held that "prior disciplinary actions that are subject to ongoing proceedings may not be used to support" a penalty's reasonableness. <span class="Italic">id.,</span> at 1298. It therefore vacated the Board's decision in part and remanded for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1300. We granted <span class="Italic">certiorari</span>, 531 U.S. 1143, 121 S. Ct. 1076, 148 L. Ed.2d 954 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit's statutory review of the substance of Board decisions <span id="Page_2419"></span>is limited to determining whether they are unsupported by substantial evidence or are "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). Like its counterpart in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2), the arbitrary and capricious standard is extremely narrow, <span class="Italic">Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,</span> 401 U.S. 402, 416, 91 S. Ct. 814, 28 L. Ed.2d 136 (1971), and allows the Board wide latitude in fulfilling its obligation to review agency disciplinary actions. It is not for the Federal Circuit to substitute its own judgment for that of the Board. <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</span>, 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 77 L. Ed.2d 443 (1983). The role of judicial review is only to ascertain if the Board has met the minimum standards set forth in the statute. We conclude that the Board need not adopt the Federal Circuit's rule in order to meet these standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Postal Service argues that the Board's independent review of prior disciplinary actions is sufficient to meet its statutory obligations. The adequacy of the Board's particular review mechanism--<span class="Italic">Bolling</span> review, <span class="Italic">see Bolling v. Department of Air Force</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, is not before us. The Federal Circuit said nothing about <span class="Italic">Bolling</span>, instead adopting a sweeping rule that the Board may never rely on prior disciplinary actions subject to ongoing grievance procedures, regardless of the sort of independent review the Board provides. Respondent likewise asks this Court only to uphold the Federal Circuit's rule forbidding independent Board review. She does not seek a ruling requiring a different Board review mechanism, nor did she do so before the Federal Circuit. Her brief in that court neither mentioned <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> nor its standard, arguing only that the Board should hold off its review altogether pending the outcome of collectively-bargained grievance proceedings. Moreover, even if the adequacy of <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> review were before us, we lack sufficient briefing on its specific functioning in this case. We thus consider only whether the Board may permissibly review prior disciplinary actions subject to ongoing grievance procedures independently, not whether the particular way in which it does so meets the statutory standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is certainly nothing arbitrary about the Board's decision to independently review prior disciplinary violations. Neither the Federal Circuit nor respondent has suggested that the Board has applied this policy inconsistently--indeed, the Board has taken this same approach for 19 years. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Department of Air Force,</span> 9 MSPB 714, 10 M.S.P.R. 498 (1982). Nor have they argued that the Board lacks reasons for its approach. Following the Federal Circuit's rule would require the Board either to wait until challenges to disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings are completed before rendering its decision, or to ignore altogether the violations being challenged in grievance in determining the reasonableness of the penalty. The former may cause undue delay. The latter would, in many cases, effectively preclude agencies from relying on an employee's disciplinary history, which the Federal Circuit itself acknowledged to be an "important factor" in any disciplinary decision. 212 F.3d, at 1300. Nor is independent review by the Board contrary to any law. The Federal Circuit cited no provision of the CSRA or any other statute to justify its new rule. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1299-1300. At oral argument in this Court, respondent's counsel pointed to the Federal Circuit's statement that, if pending grievances were later overturned in arbitration, "the foundation of the Board's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> analysis would be compromised." <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> at 1300 (citing <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981)). The Board's <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> decision set out a general framework for reviewing agency disciplinary actions. Because <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> at one point specifically discussed 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B), the CSRA provision placing the burden of proof on the employing agency to justify its disciplinary action, counsel claimed, the Federal Circuit must have thought the Board's policy violates that section. We do not read the Federal Circuit's citation of <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> as an implicit reference to &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B), particularly given that the Federal Circuit's opinion nowhere mentions that section's standard. Rather, we interpret the Federal Circuit's reference to <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> as a way of describing the entire process of Board review of disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More important, any suggestion that the Board's decision to independently review prior disciplinary actions violates &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B)'s preponderance of the evidence standard would be incorrect. To the extent that that standard places the burden upon employing agencies to justify all of the violations--including those dealt with in prior disciplinary actions--that are the basis for the penalty, the Board has its own mechanism for allowing agencies to meet that burden. Insofar as <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> review is adequate to meet this burden of proof, an employing agency may meet its statutory burden to justify prior actions by prevailing either in grievance or before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Amicus</span> National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) argues that independent Board review of prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance violates the CSRA's general statutory scheme. Employees covered by the CSRA may elect Board review only for disciplinary actions of a certain seriousness, such as termination, suspension for more than 14 days, or a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512-7513. For more minor actions, workers may only seek review through negotiated grievance procedures, if they exist. &#x00A7; 7121. According to NTEU, this scheme deprives the Board of the statutory authority to review minor disciplinary actions like the three that were pending in this case. It is true that the CSRA contemplates that at least some eligible employees (those represented by unions) will have two different forums for challenging disciplinary actions, depending in part on their seriousness. If the Board had attempted to review respondent's first disciplinary action before she was terminated, it would have exceeded its statutory authority. In this case, however, the Board was asked to review respondent's termination, something it clearly has authority to do. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512-7513. Because this termination was based on a series of disciplinary actions, some of which are minor, the Board's authority to review the termination must also include the authority to review each of the prior disciplinary actions to establish the reasonableness of the penalty as a whole.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Independent Board review of disciplinary actions pending in grievance proceedings may at times result in the Board reaching a different conclusion than the arbitrator. It may also result in a terminated employee never reaching a resolution of her grievance at all, because some collective bargaining agreements require unions to withdraw grievances when an employee's termination becomes final before the Board. Rather than being inconsistent with the statutory scheme, however, these possibilities are the result of the parallel structures of review set forth in the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such results are not necessarily unfair. Any employee who appeals a disciplinary action to the Board receives independent Board review. If the Board's mechanism for reviewing prior disciplinary actions is itself adequate, the review such an employee receives is fair. Although the fairness of the Board's own procedure is not before us, we note that a presumption of regularity attaches to the actions of government agencies, <span class="Italic">United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc</span>., 272 U.S. 1, 14-15, 47 S. Ct. 1, 71 L. Ed. 131 (1926), and that some deference to agency disciplinary actions is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board independently reviews prior disciplinary actions pending in grievance, it also has a policy of not rely upon disciplinary actions that have already been overturned in grievance proceeding at the time of Board review. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of Air Force</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 429, 431 (1984). As one of respondent's disciplinary actions was overturned in arbitration before the Board rendered its decision, the Postal Service concedes that a remand to the Federal Circuit is necessary to determine the effect of this reversal on respondent's termination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On remand, the Federal Circuit returned <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> to the Board for further consideration of the penalty, based on intervening events affecting the validity of the past discipline relied on by the employer to support Gregory's removal, <span class="Italic">Gregory v. USPS</span>, 30 Fed. Appx. 955, 957-58 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we concluded in our earlier decision, we affirm the Board's decision that Gregory committed the offense of overestimation of overtime charged in the fourth episode of the case. That charge led to the agency's decision to remove Gregory. The question thus is not whether Gregory committed that offense, but rather what is the correct penalty for it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the Board would not consider the first incident as relevant to the penalty to be administered (since Gregory prevailed on that charge), <span class="Italic">see Jones, supra,</span> the posture of the case is whether the penalty of removal is warranted based on the other two incidents and the final "removal" incident. Because the agency has agreed to continue the grievances on the second and third incidents, it is premature for this court to determine if removal is appropriate on the record as it now stands. Indeed, assessment of the correct penalty for proven violations in the first instance is a matter for decision first by the Board, not by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Postal Service will complete adjudication of the two remaining grieved issues, the case is in a somewhat unusual posture. We read the Supreme Court's decision to permit the Board to consider previous alleged but unproven offenses when assessing a penalty for a proven violation. As the Supreme Court noted, the Board's policy is to ignore previous alleged offenses if unproven. As Justice Ginsburg noted in her concurring opinion, the Board's regulations grant it the authority to reopen an appeal and reconsider its decision "at any time." <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 439, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.118 (2001) ("The Board may reopen an appeal and reconsider a decision of [an administrative judge] on its own motion at any time, regardless of any other provisions of this part."). In its brief to the Supreme Court, the Postal Service agreed that the Board is authorized to reopen an appeal "in the event that the employee's prior disciplinary record has been revised as the result of a successful grievance."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present circumstances, Gregory is entitled to completion of the two pending grievances. Whether the Board prefers to make a decision now on its view of the correct penalty for the one proven offense, or whether the Board prefers to make that decision after the two grievances are concluded, is a matter for exercise of the Board's sound discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We express no view on Justice Ginsburg's comment that "[t]here is every reason to believe that the Board would reopen to reconsider a decision that credited a prior disciplinary action later overturned in arbitration." <span id="Page_2420"></span><span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, 122 S. Ct. at 439. Nor do we comment on her observation that it "might well be 'arbitrary and capricious' in such a situation for the Board to disregard the employee's revised record and refuse to reopen." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Marking a reversal of preexisting Board law, <span class="Italic">Gregory v. USPS</span>, 212 F.3d 1296, 1299-1300 (Fed. Cir. 2000), <span class="Italic">on remand</span>, 88 MSPR 394 (2001), determined, before Supreme Court review, that the Board (and, impliedly, an employer) may not rely on past discipline, for purposes of aggregation of penalties, under a current challenge. <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> was modified in <span class="Italic">Blank v. Dept. of Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225, 1230 (Fed.

USDA</span>, 88 MSPR 565, 575 &#x00B6; 30 (2001) (same analysis as <span class="Italic">Powell</span>). If the penalty was found unreasonable because prior discipline could not be considered under the Board's position in <span class="Italic">Gregory</span> before Supreme Court review, the AJ was to redetermine the penalty or determine whether to remand the case to the agency for further consideration of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See Gregory v.

<p class="Body-Text">The law before the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Gregory</span>, and the law as it now stands following Supreme Court review, was and is that an agency may rely on a prior disciplinary action even if it is being appealed. <span class="Italic">Jeffers v.

A pending grievance regarding the past disciplinary action is considered a challenge to that previous action, warranting a determination by the AJ as to whether the action was clearly erroneous. <span class="Italic">Morgan v.
