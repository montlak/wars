<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-170"><span class="space">b.</span> Performance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Deficient adjudications may furnish the good cause necessary to support action against an ALJ. Performance is a component of the good cause equation, <span class="Italic">SSA v. Anyel</span>, 58 MSPR 261, 263-70 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent is an administrative law judge with the agency. On May 15, 1991, the agency filed with the Board's Office of the Clerk a notice proposing the respondent's removal under 5 USC 7521 for the following reasons: (1) She failed to demonstrate an acceptable level of professional competence, legal knowledge, and informed judgment in the performance of her adjudicative functions, and (2) she frequently failed to adequately extend to <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimants the right to representation during hearings held before her. After holding a hearing in the case, the CALJ issued a recommended decision in which he found that the agency had failed to show good cause warranting action under charge I; that it had supported charge II by preponderant evidence; that the respondent had failed to substantiate various allegations of error she had raised; and that the sustained charge warranted a 90-day suspension, rather than the removal the agency had proposed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency generally may remove or suspend an administrative law judge "only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board." 5 USC 7521. The issue before us, therefore, is whether the agency in this case has shown good cause for removing or suspending the respondent.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In its <span class="Italic">amicus</span> brief, the FALJC notes that the <span class="Italic">Administrative Law Judge Program Handbook</span> (ALJ Program Handbook), which OPM issued in May 1989, includes the following provision: "Agencies bring disciplinary or removal actions against Administrative Law Judges...only following efforts to resolve matters informally with the judge without formal disciplinary action," ALJ Program Handbook at 16.... While the use of the term "only" in the statement quoted above could be regarded as supporting the view that the provision is mandatory, the statement as a whole--including the absence of a term such as "may" or "shall" after "Agencies"--indicates that the provision is simply a descriptive statement, rather than a requirement OPM intended to impose on employing agencies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (to determine whether provision of manual is mandatory or precatory, court must determine agency's intent in authoring it). We note further that the handbook's foreword includes no suggestion that it was intended to impose additional procedural requirements on employing agencies. Instead, it expresses the hope that the handbook will serve as "a useful <span class="Italic">reference</span> resource," and it indicates that the document "incorporates in one document a <span class="Italic">review</span> of the provisions of law, regulation and policy governing the appointment, pay, and tenure of Administrative Law Judges in the Federal service." ALJ Program Handbook at ii. Finally, we note that the inclusion in the handbook of an appendix entitled "Administrative Law Judge Provisions in Regulations" further indicates that the provision at issue here--which is not mentioned in that appendix--was not intended to have the effect of a regulatory requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 28-32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its first charge, the agency asserted that, from July 31, 1990, through March 1, 1991, its Appeals Council had reviewed 211 of the respondent's decisions at the request of parties to those decisions, and that, in 186 of those cases, the Appeals Council had identified substantive errors that required actions such as vacating the decisions, reversing them, and/or remanding the cases for further proceedings, including new decisions. It asserted further that, even if cases in which the Appeals Council had received new and material evidence that was not presented at the hearing level were omitted from consideration, the respondent still had committed reversible error in 158 of the 186 cases, and that this total comprised over 74% of the decisions by the respondent that the Appeals Council had reviewed during the period of time identified above. In addition, it alleged that the decisions that had been found to be deficient showed that the respondent had acted in a manner inconsistent with relevant law by failing to develop evidence on behalf of <span class="Italic">pro se</span> claimants, failing to accord appropriate weight to the reports and opinions of treating physicians, and failing to properly evaluate subjective complaints of pain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CALJ concluded that the agency had failed to show that action was warranted under this charge. This conclusion was based on two findings. First the CALJ found that, even if the Appeals Council's reversal and remand rates were higher with respect to the respondent's cases than with respect to other administrative law judges' cases, this difference would not show good cause for bringing an action under 5 USC 7521 because (1) the grounds for reversals and remands related to other administrative law judges' cases were not known and (2) the decisions of other administrative law judges in the respondent's organization were reversed, and their cases remanded, for reasons comparable to those for which the respondent's decisions were reversed and for which her cases were remanded. Second, he found that a finding that a high rate of reversals and remands constituted good cause for disciplining the respondent would improperly chill her decision-making independence and that of other administrative law judges. For the reasons stated below, we do not concur in the CALJ's reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find first that the gravamen of charge I is that the respondent's decisions, including her development and weighing of the evidence in her cases, were deficient. It is not, as the CALJ has suggested, simply that, in a large proportion of her cases, the Appeals Council either remanded the cases or reversed her decisions. Although the agency noted this large proportion in its letter of charges, it did so only to support its allegation that the respondent frequently committed significant errors....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the CALJ also relied on (1) the absence of evidence related to the reasons for the Appeals Council's reversal of other administrative law judges' decisions and for its remand of their cases and (2) evidence that the bases for those reversals and remands were comparable to the bases for the reversals and remands related to the respondent's cases. Those reasons appear to us to be somewhat contradictory. We need not determine, however, whether the record indicates that the respondent's alleged errors are comparable to those of other administrative law judges. The absence of evidence establishing that the respondent's errors were more serious than those of other administrative law judges does not preclude a finding that the agency has shown good cause for bringing an action against the respondent under 5 USC 7521. Although the respondent may be able to show that the agency tolerated equally serious errors by other administrative law judges, and that it improperly singled her out by bringing this action against her, any such evidence would be presented as an affirmative defense by the respondent.[5] <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Drummer v. General Services Administration</span>, 22 MSPR 432, 434 (1984) (when an appellant in an adverse action case raises the allegation of disparate treatment in comparison with other, specified employees, an agency must prove a legitimate reason for the difference by preponderant evidence). The agency is not required to show, as part <span id="Page_2248"></span>of its case in chief, that the respondent's errors were more egregious than those of other administrative law judges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Even if the respondent were to show that other administrative law judges errors were comparable, evidence that the respondent committed those errors at a significantly higher rate than other administrative law judges could support a finding that the respondent was not improperly singled out. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Seay v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 24 MSPR 688, 692 (1984) (Board sustained removal under 5 USC chapter 43 based on appellant's high error rate).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We note further, in connection with this matter, that the CALJ stated that the respondent's "higher remand or reversal rates are to be expected" because she "hears more cases than her colleagues" and because "particular focus has been given to her decisions" since a class action related to her cases was filed. This statement is not persuasive. While the absolute number of errors found in a group of decisions may increase as the numbers of decisions issued and reviewed increase, an increase in the numbers of decisions issued and reviewed would not necessarily have any effect on the proportion of decisions found to be erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CALJ's finding that allowing the agency to discipline the respondent on the basis of a high reversal or remand rate would have an improper chilling effect on the decision-making independence of administrative law judges also is unpersuasive. First, we need not decide whether disciplining an administrative law judge solely on the basis of a high reversal or remand rate could be regarded as having a chilling effect on administrative law judges. As we have indicated above, charge I is based on the respondent's allegedly high rate of significant adjudicatory error, rather than on a high reversal or remand rate. For the reasons stated below, we find that a high rate of significant adjudicatory error can establish good cause for disciplining an administrative law judge under 5 USC 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory requirement that "good cause" for the removal or suspension of an administrative law judge be established before that action is taken was enacted as part of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Pub. L. No. 79-404, 11, 60 Stat. 237, 244 (1946). In enacting this legislation, Congress refrained from including a definition of the term "good cause"; evidently, it intended to allow "reviewing courts" to interpret the term in a manner consistent with "the context of the provision in which it is found, and the purpose of the entire section and bill." <span class="Italic">See</span> APA: Legislative History (hereinafter APA Legislative History), at 215 (statement of Senator McCarran, a sponsor of the legislation); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1561-62 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 479 U.S. 985, 107 S. Ct. 573, 93 L. Ed.2d 577 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the Board nor the courts have directly addressed the issue of whether an administrative law judge's high rate of adjudicatory error can constitute good cause for removal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Administrative Law Judges v. Heckler</span>, 594 F. Supp. 1132, 1142 (D.C. Cir. 1984) ("[s]hould disciplinary action [under 5 USC 7521] ever be instituted against an ALJ who failed to maintain an acceptable level of decisions [sic] correctness, the MSPB would have to determine whether that constituted 'good cause' under the statute").... The Board has held, however, that an administrative law judge may be removed on the basis of his or her performance, including performance during the course of an adjudicatory proceeding. <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Glover</span>, 23 MSPR 57, 76 (1984); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR 321, 330 (1984).... It has noted that the administrative law judges system was created by the APA "to assure claimants of fair and impartial treatment from individuals insulated from agency pressure," <span class="Italic">Glover</span>, 23 MSPR at 76, and that exempting administrative law judges from any performance-based action "could easily erode [the] public confidence" in administrative adjudications that the APA "was designed, in large part, to maintain," <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR at 330.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same reasons support a conclusion that adjudicatory errors can establish good cause for an action under 5 USC 7521. Although one of the purposes of the APA was to "render [employees performing the functions now performed by administrative law judges] independent and secure in their tenure and compensation," APA Legislative History at 215 (statement in Senate Report), the independence and security of administrative law judges was not the ultimate purpose of the legislation. Instead, changes in the tenure of administrative law judges, along with other changes brought about by the APA, were intended to "result in a greater assurance of justice at the hands of administrative agencies." "[T]he ideal toward which this legislation look[ed] and move[d]" was to "bring about a government of law rather than of men."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "'qualified right' of decisional independence" given to administrative law judges by the APA--i.e., the increased independence from agency pressure to decide a particular case, or a particular percentage of cases, in a particular way--furthers the goals identified above by allowing administrative law judges to issue decisions consistent with the law, rather than decisions influenced by pressure to reach a particular result. "Independence" consisting of freedom to ignore binding agency interpretations of law, however, would not further those goals; instead, it would lead to a system under which the outcome of a case before an administrative law judge would depend on the identity of the administrative law judge assigned, rather than on applicable law. Such a result would be inconsistent with the goal of "bring[ing] about a government of law rather than of men." Moreover, while individual judgmental errors can be corrected on appeal, as the CALJ noted, the agency has a legitimate interest in having cases decided correctly at their earlier stages. As the agency has noted, appellate review provides only a case-by-case remedy for those who choose to invoke it; it does not provide an adequate remedy for a continuing failure to apply law and agency policy properly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that charge I, if substantiated, could establish good cause for action against the respondent under 5 USC 7521. This case therefore must be remanded for consideration of the merits of that charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The remand in <span class="Italic">Anyel</span> also resulted in the Board directing that the respondent judge be permitted to use discovery to obtain case files of his decisions and appeals of Board decisions pertaining to his cases. Through that material, the respondent and the Board would be better able to determine the validity of the agency's claims of substandard adjudication by the ALJ. The case was settled following remand. <span class="Italic">SSA v. Anyel</span>, 66 MSPR 328, 331 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Brennan</span>, 19 MSPR 335, 338 (1984), determined that before an ALJ could be removed for substandard production, statistical evidence offered by the agency must measure comparative productivity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA v. Balaban</span>, 20 MSPR 675, 676 (1984); <span class="Italic">SSA v. Goodman</span>, 19 MSPR 321, 328-32 (1984) (statistical information was not probative because it did not show that the respondent's caseload was representative of cases reflected in average national disposition rates). Of the argument that low productivity could not constitute good cause for removal of an ALJ, now modified or seemingly overruled by <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. SSA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3113.Opinion.8-28-2015.1.PDF">800 F.3d 1332</a> (Fed. Cir. 2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>, <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he purposes of the APA's safeguards do place limitations on the parameters of the good cause standard. However, these limitations are not related to the performance or conduct-based nature of the charge. If the agency is basing its charge on reasons which constitute an improper interference with the performance by an ALJ of his or her judicial functions, the charge cannot constitute good cause. Whether it is, is a question of fact to be decided in the context of each specific case. However, if it is not, then the purposes served by Congress' establishment of a right of decisional independence are not implicated. In such cases, the Board can consider whether the evidence, of poor performance or of misconduct, establishes good cause for the proposed disciplinary action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has also argued that the exclusion of ALJs from the coverage of chapter 43 of title 5 precludes the bringing of performance-based actions against ALJs under section 7521. Chapter 43 requires agencies to establish performance appraisal systems and authorizes them to take actions against employees for "unacceptable performance." ALJs are excepted from the coverage of chapter 43. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4301(2)(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Every performance-based action is not a chapter 43 action. <span class="Italic">Wells v. Harris</span>, 1 MSPB 199 (1979). "Unacceptable performance" is a statutory term with a defined and limited meaning. It describes a particular type of poor performance--failure to meet the established performance standards in one or more critical elements of an employee's position. Where such "unacceptable performance" exists, the agency, after giving proper notice and after providing the employee with an opportunity to improve, can reduce the employee in grade or remove him. The agency's action will be sustainable under the lower, substantial evidence standard of proof provided for such chapter 43 actions in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(C)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The exclusion of ALJs from the coverage of chapter 43 continued the insulation of ALJs from agency involvement in pay, classification, and tenure decisions. In our view, it would be illogical to interpret that exclusion as an expression of a further Congressional intent to remove performance from consideration under section 7521. The independence granted to ALJs by the Administrative Procedure Act was designed, in large part, to maintain public confidence in the process through which Social Security benefits are allocated. <span class="Italic">Nash v. Califano,</span> 613 F.2d 10, 16 (2d Cir. 1980). A blanket exemption of ALJs from performance-based actions could easily erode that public confidence. Moreover, the distinction between poor performance and misconduct can be illusory. For example, a case based upon a charge that work is of unacceptable quality is a performance-based action. On the other hand, if the agency charged that the same poor work resulted from the employee's failure to follow instructions, the case would present a misconduct charge based upon insubordination. Given the basic incompatibility of the interpretation urged upon us with the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act and the ultimate reliance of that interpretation upon a non-existent definitional clarity, we cannot conclude that Congress intended, by <span id="Page_2249"></span>excluding ALJs from chapter 43's coverage, also to limit the coverage of section 7521.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">SSA v. Shapiro</span>, CB-7521-11-0024-T-1 (NP 3/4/2014) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. SSA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/14-3113.Opinion.8-28-2015.1.PDF">800 F.3d 1332</a> (Fed. Cir. 2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>), found allegedly deficient performance sufficient to warrant an ALJ's removal when the performance was defined in comparison to judges with similar dockets. The lengthy decision should be read for the Board's view of the facts relating to production. As to the application of <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> and kindred cases, <span class="Italic">Shapiro</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, the Board explained that one way in which the national average disposition number may be relevant is if the agency establishes that "<span class="Italic">approximately</span> the same amount of time [is] required to render <span class="Italic">most</span> final dispositions." 19 M.S.P.R. at 332 (emphasis added). The Board noted that, alternatively, "it might be reasonable to conclude that the raw statistical data introduced was meaningful to the issue of respondent's comparative productivity if the complexities presented by the mix of cases assigned to the respondent mirrored the complexities of those included in the national average." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, Administrative Law Judge Smith relied upon the latter approach to find that the cases assigned to the respondent were essentially the same or similar, in terms of file size, complexity, legal and factual issues, and time requirements as those assigned to all other administrative law judges, and that the respondent's performance was markedly below a comparable level of productivity from other judges. <span class="Italic">See</span> Hearing Transcript (HT) at 169-72 (testimony of a regional chief administrative law judge that SSA cases within Region 2 were mostly the same); HT at 626-27 (testimony of a different regional chief administrative law judge that the vast majority of cases are basically the same and can be resolved relatively quickly); HT at 1026, 1110-11, 1120 (testimony of a chief administrative law judge that administrative law judges see the same impairments "over and over again," cases are mostly the same, and in her 28 years of experience with SSA's hearing operation she has not seen a vast difference between cases). The respondent has shown no error in Administrative Law Judge Smith's findings in this regard, which were based in part on his assessment of the demeanor of the testimony of the administrative law judges who reviewed the respondent's cases. <span class="Italic">See also Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so); HT at 1420 (testimony of the respondent that he had no reason to think that administrative law judges were given different types of cases). Thus, the respondent's claim that the petitioner did not show that SSA cases generally take the same amount of time does not demonstrate error in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the respondent contends that the petitioner only compared the similarity of his cases to those of other administrative law judges between January 2008 and July 2008, the vast majority of the respondent's cases during the 2008-2010 time period were assigned to him in 2008, when the review was conducted. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 69, Exhibit 34 at 1-10; HT at 1619 (the respondent's testimony that he had 257 cases assigned in 2008, 16 in 2009, and 59 in 2010). <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> did not require that every case assigned to the respondent be compared to every case assigned to other administrative law judges. 19 M.S.P.R. at 322. Under these circumstances, we find that a preponderance of the evidence supports the decision of Administrative Law Judge Smith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the respondent contends that the initial decision erroneously found that his performance was significantly below a comparable level of productivity. In this regard, the respondent asserts that the petitioner's statistical expert was confused in addressing the comparative timeliness of the respondent's work, that Administrative Law Judge Smith disregarded the respondent's testimony that he performed his duties appropriately and improperly placed the burden on the respondent of establishing the similarity of his cases to those of other administrative law judges, and that other administrative law judges may not have performed the record development required by their cases, as evidenced by a September 13, 2012 Minority Staff Report of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations relating to improving the quality of social security disability benefit award decisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11-13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, however, Administrative Law Judge Smith did not rely upon a timeliness standard in sustaining the charge of Unacceptable Performance. In addition, Administrative Law Judge Smith noted the respondent's testimony that he performed his duties appropriately but discounted it in light of the speculative nature of the argument and the lack of quantifiable evidence relating to the precision or care with which the respondent and the other administrative law judges handled their respective cases. Further, Administrative Law Judge Smith did not place the burden of proof regarding the charges on the respondent but merely noted that the respondent's argument that his unique handling of cases rendered meaningless a comparison with the cases assigned to other administrative law judges did not comport with the requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> that a factual predicate be established for such distinctions. The Minority Staff Report, which was based on an analysis of 300 case files of individuals who were awarded disability benefits from three counties in Virginia, Alabama, and Oklahoma, specifically indicated that its findings "cannot be statistically extrapolated into a nationwide analysis of SSA disability cases," <span class="Italic">id</span>., and does not establish that the administrative law judges to which the respondent was compared did not properly develop their cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent also claims that Administrative Law Judge Smith did not properly apply <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> to the facts in this case. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 330, that there is no "generic prohibition" to the filing of a charge of unacceptable performance against an administrative law judge. The Board also disagreed with the agency's view that it could not order the respondent in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> to take reasonable steps to improve his productivity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 331. Nevertheless, the Board explained its reasoning for finding that the agency did not prove good cause in Goodman as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Department attempted to establish good cause primarily through the introduction of a comparison, over a 2 1/2 year period, of the case disposition rate of all its ALJs with the respondent's case disposition statistics. This evidence established that respondent's dispositions were approximately half of the national average. However, the Department did not establish that its statistical evidence was relevant to the determinative factual issue, which was whether respondent's performance was sufficiently below a reasonable level of productivity to warrant his removal. <span class="Italic">See Capaci v. Katz and Besthoff, Inc</span>., 525 F. Supp. 317, 342 (E.D. La. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that, in order for it to find that Goodman's productivity was unacceptably low, it would have to infer that the nationwide average constituted a measurement, or a guide to a measurement, of reasonable productivity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this regard, it noted that "it might be reasonable to conclude that the raw statistical data introduced was meaningful to the issue of respondent's comparative productivity if the complexities presented by the mix of cases assigned to the respondent mirrored the complexities of those included in the national average." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 332. The Board concluded that no evidence was offered regarding the time required to render dispositions or comparing the respondent's assignments with those included in the national average. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, by contrast, the petitioner did introduce evidence comparing the respondent's assignments with the assignments given to other administrative law judges. Administrative Law Judge Smith found persuasive such testimonial evidence, which established that the cases assigned to the respondent were essentially the same or similar in terms of file size, complexity, legal and evidentiary and/or factual issues, and time requirements as the cases assigned to all other judges in the New York City and Region II hearing offices. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>. The respondent has not shown that Administrative Law Judge Smith erred in relying upon this evidence. <span class="Italic">See Social Security Administration v. Brennan</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 335, 337 n.3 (if cases assigned to the respondent administrative law judge "paralleled those assigned other ALJs," the nationwide average could provide a guide for measuring reasonable productivity), <span class="Italic">clarified on other grounds</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 35 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In another component of <span class="Italic">Shapiro</span>, the Board determined that SSA failed to prove a proper standard and supporting evidence relating to the charge that Shapiro failed to provide timely hearings and dispositions when his performance depended, in part, on the efforts of the staff assigned to him:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As Administrative Law Judge Smith found, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 331-32, that statistical evidence introduced to support a showing of good cause must show that the respondent's performance was sufficiently below a reasonable level of productivity to warrant the action and that such a showing could be made if the mix of cases assigned to the respondent mirrored those included in the average. Here, the petitioner did not show that, among other things, the time taken by support staff for the respondent was the same or similar to the times included in the reported times for other judges. Graham involved a charge of failure to maintain medical credentials based on the suspension of the appellant's clinical privileges after reviews of the appellant's work led the credential committee to believe that the appellant was providing substandard care and failing to examine patients. 46 M.S.P.R. at 229. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Graham</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. at 233-35, that, although the establishment of valid performance standards is an important substantive right of an employee under chapter 43, there is no comparable provision requiring the establishment of valid performance standards for long-term measurement of performance under chapter 75, and measurement of performance in actions brought under chapter 75 will frequently be <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> in nature. <span class="Italic">Graham</span> is distinguishable because it involved a removal action taken under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 235, and not the good cause standard for administrative law judges as described in <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner also asserts that Administrative Law Judge Smith <span id="Page_2250"></span>incorrectly required it to prove that the respondent was solely responsible for the processing time of his cases because that was not an element of its charge and that average processing times were relevant and determinative. We discern no error in these findings by Administrative Law Judge Smith. Under the charge of Unacceptable Performance, the petitioner asserted that the respondent was required to provide timely and legally sufficient hearings and decisions and that he did not provide such timely hearings and decisions because he provided certain claimants with hearings and decisions in a specified number of days after the time the claims were assigned to him. As Administrative Law Judge Smith found, the clear implication from these specifications is that the respondent was solely responsible for the amount of time that had passed since the claim was assigned to him and that it was his performance alone that was unacceptable, not the implied performance of support staff. <span class="Italic">See Prather v. Department of Justice</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 137, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-29 (2011) (an agency is required to prove only the essence of its charge); <span class="Italic">Rosenberg v. Department of Transportation</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6; 17 (2007) (same).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed the Board on appeal, departing from earlier analysis in the <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> decision and allowing removal of an ALJ for failing to manage his docket properly by failing to issue timely decisions in assigned cases, <span class="Italic">Shapiro v. SSA</span>, 800 F.3d 1332, 1336-40 (Fed. Cir. 2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agency may remove Mr. Shapiro "only for good cause established and determined by the [Board] ...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a). "Congress intentionally failed to define 'good cause'" leaving it "to be given meaning through judicial interpretation." <span class="Italic">Brennan v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 787 F.2d 1559, 1561-62 (Fed. Cir. 1986). "And we have made clear that, as a general matter, we defer to the Board's reasonable interpretation of 'good cause' because 'the Board has exclusive rulemaking and adjudicatory authority with respect to section 7521.'" <span class="Italic">Berlin v. Dep't of Labor</span>, 772 F.3d 890, 894 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting <span class="Italic">Long v. Soc. Sec. Admin.</span>, 635 F.3d 526, 534 (Fed. Cir. 2011)). Because Mr. Shapiro does not contest that "unacceptable performance" or a lack of production can constitute good cause for removal, we need only determine whether substantial evidence supports the Board's conclusion that the Agency showed by a preponderance of the evidence that this charge was met. <span class="Italic">See Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1561.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Shapiro first argues that the Agency failed to establish "good cause" for removal because the Agency did not prove the precise charge asserted. However, this argument is predicated on the mistaken assumption that removal of an ALJ for "good cause" under &#x00A7; 7521 must comply with the precedent and requirements of &#x00A7; 7512 cases governing removal of employees under the "efficiency of the service" standard. But that is plainly not the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(E) ("This subchapter...does not apply to...an action initiated under section 1215 or 7521 of this title."). Under the governing regulations, a complaint seeking removal of an ALJ need only "describe with particularity the facts that support the proposed agency action," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.138, and the Board may only discipline an ALJ for "good cause," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 1201.140(b). This is in contrast to the regulations governing &#x00A7; 7512 actions, which require a notice to "state the specific reason(s) for the proposed actions," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(1), and state that the agency may "consider only the reasons specified in the notice of the proposed action...," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at &#x00A7; 752.404(g)(1). Thus, in the context of &#x00A7; 7521, "[t]he purpose of an agency's notice of charges is to put an employee on notice of the allegations against him in sufficient detail to apprise him of the allegations he must refute or acts he must justify." <span class="Italic">Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1561.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Mr. Shapiro had ample notice of the charges brought against him. Charge I, labeled "Unacceptable Performance," plainly put Mr. Shapiro on notice that his "performance has been unacceptable, in that...[i]n or about FY2008-2010, [he] did not acceptably manage his cases." And Mr. Shapiro testified that he understood this to mean that the Agency was seeking to remove him from his position due to his perceived mismanagement of cases, including his failure to "produce very many decisions." The Board, on the presiding ALJ's recommendation, found good cause for removal because Mr. Shapiro was unable to effectively manage his docket. There is no indication that this did not comply with the governing regulations. And given that the hearing was recessed to allow for Mr. Shapiro to conduct additional discovery, it is beyond debate that Mr. Shapiro was "afforded notice 'both of the charges and of the employer's evidence' and an 'opportunity to respond' before [he was] removed from employment," as required to satisfy due process. <span class="Italic">Ward v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Shapiro next argues that the Board erred in its good cause determination by relying on a comparison of his production statistics to regional averages, in contravention of the rule announced by the Board in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Goodman</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 321, 331 (1984).

We agree with <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> to the extent that it requires a proper foundation for the type of comparative statistics employed here. But to the extent <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> requires some type of heightened evidentiary proof before an agency can rely upon comparative production statistics to prove good cause for removal, we decline to follow it. When an agency establishes that an individual ALJ's case disposition rate is so significantly lower than the rate of similarly situated ALJs in his own region, that evidence, absent some contradictory showing that the statistics do not present a valid comparison, can support a finding of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, the Board was concerned with the use of comparative statistics to establish that an ALJ's "performance was sufficiently below a reasonable level of productivity to warrant his removal." <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. at 331-32. The Board found that, absent evidence that "the same amount of time was required to render most final dispositions" and "the complexities presented by the mix of cases assigned to the respondent mirrored the complexities of those included" in the compared disposition rates, such a comparison would be based only on speculation and therefore could not support a finding of good cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because "no evidence was offered regarding the time required to render dispositions or comparing respondent's assignments with those included in the national average," the Board found that the agency failed to meet its burden of establishing good cause for removal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 332.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Brennan</span>, 19 M.S.P.R. 335 (1984), decided the same day as <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, the Board rejected evidence that an ALJ's case disposition rate was "not within the range of the average productivity of all ALJs employed by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 337 n.2. This was because "the national average included different types of dispositions, such as dismissals, short form reversals, and affirmances both on the written record and after a hearing" and there was no evidence presented that the ALJ's caseload mirrored that case makeup. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 337.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Goodman</span> and its progeny have been described as a "pyrrhic victory for the [Agency] " because it "won the right to bring charges against low producing ALJs but was handed a virtually insurmountable burden of proof." Jeffrey S. Lubbers, <span class="Italic">The Federal Administrative Judiciary: Establishing an Appropriate System of Performance Evaluation for ALJs</span>, 7 Admin. L.J. Am. U. 589, 599-600 (1994). The proceedings below reflect that sentiment. The record reveals a long history of poor performance and the Agency's "unprecedented and extraordinary efforts" to assist Mr. Shapiro. Indeed, the presiding ALJ found the Agency "demonstrated extraordinary patience and expended extraordinary effort to assist [Mr. Shapiro] ...in the performance of his duties." Similarly, counsel for the Agency stated at oral argument that the Agency delayed initiating removal proceedings because of a perception that <span class="Italic">Goodman</span> did not, in fact, permit the removal of an ALJ for productivity reasons. It is therefore not surprising that, when it came time to evaluate the statistics presented during the removal proceedings, the presiding ALJ found: "Doubtless because of <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>, the Agency went to exceptional lengths to establish that during [the relevant time period], the cases assigned to [Mr. Shapiro] were essentially the same or similar, in terms of file size, complexity, legal and evidentiary and/or factual issues, and time requirements as those cases assigned to all other judges in the New York City and Region II hearing offices."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No fewer than four ALJs provided testimony that they reviewed Mr. Shapiro's docket during the relevant timeframe. The region chief "personally reviewed...[Mr. Shapiro's] assigned cases" and concluded that the cases were the same or similar to those handled by other judges within the region. Mr. Shapiro's supervisor gave similar testimony, testifying that the Agency's ALJs "see the same types of cases 'over and over again.'" (citation omitted). Indeed, Mr. Shapiro himself conceded that "I have no reason to think that any of us [ALJs] are given a different type" of case. Especially in light of this concession, it is particularly inappropriate to require the Agency to undergo the herculean effort of providing testimony from four ALJs that an ALJ's caseload was the same or similar to that of any other ALJ in the region before the fact finder can rely on any comparative statistics, as the Agency perceived to be required by <span class="Italic">Goodman</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree that there must be a showing that the proffered production statistics are relevant to the determination--i.e., that they reflect the average disposition rate for a particular region across the same time period. But in extreme cases like this, where Mr. Shapiro's production is, at best, roughly a quarter of that performed by the rest of the ALJs in his region, that standing alone is highly relevant and potentially preponderant evidence that he failed to manage his cases acceptably. Absent some suggestion that the character of an individual ALJ's docket dramatically differs from that of his colleagues, or any other factors that might undermine the reliability of the comparative statistics, the Board is free to give such statistics appropriate weight when determining whether the Agency has met its burden to prove the charges alleged by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Brennan</span>, 787 F.2d at 1561.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the presiding ALJ assessed the credibility of the witnesses and concluded that the cases assigned to Mr. Shapiro were "essentially <span id="Page_2251"></span>the same or similar...as those cases assigned to all other judges in the New York City and/or Region II hearing offices." The Board adopted these findings, recognizing that they were based in part on a credibility determination. We see no reason to deviate from these findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Long</span>, 635 F.3d at 530-31.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Because we find that the comparative statistics relied on by the Board provide substantial evidence for a finding of good cause in this case, we decline to reach Mr. Shapiro's invitation to require agencies to prove specific examples of "poor case management."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Shapiro also argues that even if the identified cases are the same or similar, the comparative statistics relied on by the Board are flawed because they ignore the role played by support staff in the rate of disposition; and they fail to account for the fact that Mr. Shapiro had far fewer cases than the average ALJ used in the comparison. Neither of these arguments is sufficient to undermine the Board's findings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mr. Shapiro did not identify any evidence of record suggesting his support staff played a major role in his decreased performance numbers. At best, there is some evidence in the record suggesting that support staff played a role in the timely disposition of cases. But nothing in the record provides a legally sufficient basis for overturning the presiding ALJ's finding that timeliness is not necessarily tied to production numbers. J.A. 171 n.29 ("Although it might be anecdotally true that an ALJ who is untimely in scheduling hearings or producing dispositions might also schedule fewer hearings or produce fewer dispositions, one does not necessarily follow the other."). Moreover, even if Mr. Shapiro were correct that support staff played a role in his inability to manage his docket, there is no evidence in the record to support an assumption that his support staff was so far below the norm as to account for a disparity of over 400 cases from the average for three straight years. Indeed, as the Board recognized, Mr. Shapiro conceded that "because of his techniques and approach to case processing, he might be able to produce only 200 cases per year, far below the [Agency's] goal of 500-700 dispositions per administrative law judge per year."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, even if there were a bottleneck caused by support staff, the Board did not disturb the presiding ALJ's finding that "a prudent ALJ, aware that staff deficiencies contributed to slow case development and a low disposition rate, should ask for additional cases to compensate for those delays...." And, as a result of the numerous counselling sessions and improvement efforts by the Agency, Mr. Shapiro was no doubt aware of the Agency's expectation that he should have decided more cases per year. But during these sessions, Mr. Shapiro only once asked for additional cases. The Agency complied but his production numbers continued to be unacceptable. Thus, substantial evidence supports the Board's adoption of the presiding ALJ's conclusion that "even if [Mr. Shapiro] had been given a full complement of cases, he could not (or would not) have been able to meet the desired quantity."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no error in the Board's removal of Mr. Shapiro based on a charge of "unacceptable performance." The Board's decision is supported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the Agency properly used comparative statistics in this case to establish that Mr. Shapiro's performance was substantially below that of his peers. And, the Board complied with the governing regulations, as Mr. Shapiro was given adequate notice of the charges alleged along with an opportunity to respond. Accordingly, the Board's decision to remove Mr. Shapiro for good cause is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">SSA v. Abrams</span>, CB-7521-13-0008-T-1 (NP 11/17/2022), relying on <span class="italic">Shapiro, supra</span>, discounted arguments concerning comparator ALJs when productivity of the respondent was evaluated as well below required levels:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also have considered the respondent's assertion that the cases assigned to her were not substantially the same or similar to the cases assigned to every other ALJ in the Chicago Hearing Office. PFR File, Tab 3 at 16 (citing <span class="italic">Shapiro v. Social Security Administration</span>, 800 F.3d 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2015), for the proposition that SSA was required to show the average disposition rate for a particular region across the same time period). The respondent's reliance on Shapiro is not persuasive. Importantly, the court in Shapiro held that, "in extreme cases...where [the respondent's] production is, at best, roughly a quarter of that performed by the rest of the ALJs in his region, that [fact] standing alone is highly relevant and potentially preponderant evidence that he failed to manage his cases acceptably." <span class="italic">Shapiro</span>, 800 F.3d at 1339. Similarly, we find that the exponentially higher length of time that many of the respondent's cases languished in ALPO status constitutes relevant evidence that she did not acceptably manage her cases. Accordingly, we affirm the ALJ's decision in this regard.</p>
