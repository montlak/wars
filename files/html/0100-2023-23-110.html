<h4 class="h4" id="sec16-109"><span id="Page_4923"></span><span class="space">2.</span> Adjustment to AWOL Charge</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An early decision, <span class="Italic">Barger v. DOJ</span>, 8 MSPR 654, 655 (1981), concluded that the Board does not direct an agency to adjust an employee's leave balances when it sets aside an AWOL charge, although the Board left open the possibility that "such an order would be appropriate under a set of circumstances not present here." In <span class="Italic">Bradley v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 394, 397 n.4 (1987), at issue was whether the appellant was entitled to conversion of AWOL to sick leave (and related correction of records) when he demonstrated that his removal, based on AWOL that should not have been charged against him, constituted disability discrimination. While directing adjustment of leave accounts and records, the Board was careful to state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By this finding, we do not suggest that prevailing employees are, in every case, entitled to have their leave restored or their leave status changed. On the contrary, it is inappropriate, under normal circumstances, for an administrative judge to order an agency to change an employee's sick or annual leave status. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barger v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPR 170, 176 (1982). Our contrary decision in this case reflects the remedial "make whole" objective of Title VII, and is based on the administrative judge's factual finding that the agency unlawfully discriminated against appellant by improperly withdrawing an effective accommodation to his handicap.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on adjustments required to AWOL charges in <span class="Italic">Maki v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 449, 457-60 (1989), involving appellant's argument that a removal rescinded by the agency was not moot because it had not reversed the AWOL that was one of the charges supporting the removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held...that it is generally inappropriate for an administrative judge to direct an agency to change an employee's AWOL status or leave status because this status is not, in itself, an appealable action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Barger v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPR 170, 176 (1982); <span class="Italic">Bradley v. US Postal Service</span>, 35 MSPR 394, 397 n.4 (1987). Where, as here, the agency's placement of the employee in an AWOL status preceded the removal action, the cancellation of the action returns the appellant to the same AWOL status she would have been in if the removal action had never occurred. To require cancellation of an appellant's pre-removal AWOL status would violate the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> principle since it would place the appellant in a clearly more advantageous position than he or she would have enjoyed if the removal action had not occurred....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board held in <span class="Italic">Barger</span> that it would generally be improper for an administrative judge to require an agency to change an employee's leave status, it "did not rule out the possibility that such an order would be appropriate under certain circumstances."... Subsequent Board decisions have recognized, in effect, three exceptions to the <span class="Italic">Barger</span> rule, although the Board has not always explicitly identified its decisions as applying an exception....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first exception involves cases where the Board finds that a period of nonduty and nonpay status (such as enforced leave or AWOL) constitutes an improper suspension which must be reversed. In those cases the Board has ordered the agency to cancel the nonduty, nonpay status and to place the appellant on active duty for the period in question. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Woodall v. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</span>, 28 MSPR 192, 196-97 (1985). In this type of case, the leave status at issue did not precede the alleged suspension action, but rather, the dates of the enforced leave and the suspension action were co-extensive.... Thus, the Board's cancellation of the enforced leave in <span class="Italic">Woodall</span> and similar cases is required to return the employee to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, since, but for the improper suspension action, the employee would not have been placed on enforced leave....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second exception to the rule that the Board will not order a change in an employee's leave status is represented by a case in which the Board found that the leave status in question, AWOL and sick leave, was a direct result of discriminatory actions taken by the agency because of the appellant's handicap.... The...change [in] appellant's leave status was consistent with the "make whole" objective of the anti-discrimination law violated by the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A third exception to the rule that the Board will not order an agency to change an appellant's leave status is represented by cases where the Board reverses a personnel action and orders an agency to award back pay and benefits, including leave, which the employee would have earned but for the unwarranted personnel action. These cases focus on the leave which an appellant should have earned between the date on which the action was effected and the date on which it was cancelled....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the preceding examples show, the gravamen of the cases in which the Board has made exceptions to the <span class="Italic">Barger</span> rule and directed an agency to change or otherwise affect an appellant's leave is that this remedy was necessary to effect the "make whole" objective of an anti-discrimination law or to implement the related principle of returning an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, i.e., placing the appellant in, as nearly as possible, the same situation he or she would have been in if the action in question had not occurred. The remedy which the appellant seeks in this case--cancellation of her pre-removal AWOL status--not only does not fit within any of these exceptions but would also violate the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> principle which at once provides the overriding rationale for the exceptions and represents a fundamental legal principle which the Board is required to observe in enforcing its orders....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the enforcement case of <span class="Italic">Norton v. VA</span>, PH-0752-08-0442-C-1 (NP 5/19/2011), determining in the earlier merits decision that the appellant was not properly charged with AWOL when he should have been granted sick leave, the compliance question was whether the appellant should have been paid for the time represented by the unwarranted AWOL charge or whether the agency properly placed him in sick leave status. The appellant was properly charged sick leave and, because an underlying finding that the agency had not discriminated against the appellant based on disability was not challenged on PFR, the Board declined to revisit the disability issue in the enforcement PFR:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In effecting the appellant's removal on May 16, 2008, the agency had charged that he was absent without leave (AWOL) during January 23-March 11, 2008; the administrative judge found that the AWOL charge was not proven because the appellant was incapacitated during the period at issue and the agency had unreasonably denied his request for sick leave. Following the Board's decision, the agency placed the appellant on sick leave and then leave without pay for the period at issue. The administrative judge found that this was make-whole relief, reasoning that the period of AWOL preceded the removal action and so cancellation of it was not part of the back pay and benefits to which the appellant was entitled. Further, the administrative judge found that the appellant was not entitled to back pay because he was not ready, willing and able to work during the period of January 23-March 11, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant asserts that the provision of sick leave, rather than back pay, is inconsistent with the Board's order, which afforded him back pay during the period of his improper termination "and, by extrapolation, for the times that the agency had held the appellant to be AWOL." He asserts that permitting the agency to provide the sick leave that it wrongly denied him in 2008 does not constitute make-whole relief. In this regard, the appellant argues that the administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Maki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 449 (1989), and <span class="Italic">Barger v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. 170 (1982), is misplaced. The appellant also argues that had the agency provided him with sick leave initially he might have gotten better sooner and so not providing back pay "would be entirely speculative, and punitive." He also asserts that he could have worked had he been provided with reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant is correct that the administrative judge erred in her reliance on <span class="Italic">Maki</span> and <span class="Italic">Barger</span> to conclude that the Board could not order a change in the appellant's AWOL status because the period of AWOL preceded the date of his reinstatement to duty. The administrative judge found that the appellant's period of AWOL does not fall within an exception to the <span class="Italic">Barger</span> rule that the Board will not order an agency to change an appellant's leave status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Barger</span> states that, "Because AWOL is not an appealable action, it would be inappropriate, under normal circumstances, for a presiding official to order an agency to change an employee's leave status." 11 M.S.P.R. at 176. <span class="Italic">Barger</span>, however, first states that "the reasons for an agency's decision to deny leave are reviewable by a presiding official in an appeal from a disciplinary action, within our jurisdiction, based on AWOL." <span class="Italic">Id. Maki</span> also states that for the Board to have jurisdiction over an agency action placing an employee in AWOL status, the appellant must show that the action constituted a constructive suspension "or raise the AWOL in connection with an otherwise appealable action." 41 M.S.P.R. at 454. Further, <span class="Italic">Maki</span> explains that "the gravamen of the cases in which the Board has made exceptions to the <span class="Italic">Barger</span> rule and directed an agency to change or otherwise affect an appellant's leave is that this remedy was necessary to...[return] an appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>, i.e., placing the appellant in, as nearly as possible, the same situation he or she would have been in if the action in question had not occurred." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 459.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant appealed the agency's removal which was based in part on the charge of AWOL for January 23-March 11, 2008; therefore, the Board has jurisdiction to review the agency's action in placing the appellant in an AWOL status. <span class="Italic">Maki,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. at 454; <span class="Italic">Barger</span>, 11 M.S.P.R. at 176. Further, it is an appropriate part of make-whole relief for the Board to order a change in the appellant's AWOL status, having found that the agency's AWOL charge was not sustained and therefore that the appellant's removal could not be affirmed. <span class="Italic">Maki,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. at 459.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, however, the purpose of make-whole relief is to return the appellant to the position he would have been in if the agency's action had not been taken. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Smith v. Department of the Army,</span> 458 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (the Board has broad authority to remedy noncompliance to ensure that employees are returned to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> had an unlawful agency action not occurred). In this case, the appellant had requested and the agency had denied his request for sick leave for the period in question. The appropriate action, therefore, was for the agency to change the period of AWOL to sick leave to the <span id="Page_4924"></span>extent that such leave was available to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Maki,</span> 41 M.S.P.R. at 459. This is precisely the action taken by the agency. Accordingly, while the administrative judge was incorrect in finding that <span class="Italic">Maki</span> and <span class="Italic">Barger</span> prevent the Board from changing the appellant's leave status from AWOL for January 23-March 11, 2008, her error is harmless, because the agency took the appropriate, make-whole action. <span class="Italic">Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision)<span class="Italic">.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the Back Pay Act and the Office of Personnel Management's implementing regulations provide that an employee is not entitled to back pay for any period during which he was not ready, willing and able to perform his duties due to an incapacitating illness or injury or other reasons unrelated to the unjustified personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596; <span class="Italic">Donovan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 6 (2006); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(c). In this case, the administrative judge found that the medical evidence presented by the appellant showed that he was incapacitated during January 23-March 11, 2008, and that he had legitimately requested sick leave for that period of time. Therefore, the administrative judge correctly concluded in her decision on the petition for enforcement that the appellant was not ready, willing and able to work and, accordingly, that he was not entitled to back pay for the period at issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's reasonable accommodation argument appears to relate to the accommodation request he made while employed regarding relocation of his duty station. The appellant objected to the new, lengthy commute following the relocation because of his polymyalgia rheumatica and the stress associated with the change, and he requested to return to his original duty station.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the appellant raised an affirmative defense of disability discrimination asserting in part that his removal was discriminatory based on "his physical inability to travel to his new assigned job site." The administrative judge found that the appellant was not a person with a disability within the meaning of the law. The appellant did not file a petition for review of the initial decision reversing his removal in order to challenge the finding on disability discrimination. The Board's decision dismissing the agency's petition for review therefore became the final Board decision on the matters raised in the appeal. The appellant asserted in his petition for enforcement that he was incapacitated during the period for which he was charged AWOL because he was denied reasonable accommodation. The administrative judge did not specifically address this matter in the compliance initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim in the petition for enforcement appears to be an attempt to relitigate his disability discrimination claim. We find, however, that the law of the case doctrine is applicable and prevents relitigation of the claim in this petition for enforcement. The law of the case doctrine "limits relitigation of an issue once that issue has been decided...in a different stage of the same litigation." <span class="Italic">Nease v. Department of the Army,</span> 103 M.S.P.R. 118, &#x00B6; 10 (2006); <span class="Italic">see Seas v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 569, 573 (1998) (the Board invoked the law of the case doctrine and declined to reconsider its prior findings regarding the merits of the agency's charges). Here, the Board has issued a final decision finding that the appellant is not a person with a disability. The administrative judge, therefore, was bound by this determination in considering the petition for enforcement unless one of the exceptions to the law of the case doctrine applied. <span class="Italic">Mangano v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 24 (2008); <span class="Italic">McCarty v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 45, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). These exceptions, the availability of new and substantially different evidence, a contrary decision of law by controlling authority that applies to the question at issue, or a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice, are absent here. <span class="Italic">Mangano</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 658, &#x00B6; 24. The administrative judge, therefore, was bound by the Board's finding on this issue.</p>
