<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. And NTEU</span>, 59 FLRA 703, 708-11 (2004), <span class="Italic">pet. For review den.</span>, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 414 F.3d 50 (D.C. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>, involved a dispute, arising in the context of review of an arbitration award involving the "National Inspectional Assignment Policy" (NIAP), over whether the union could tie a request for impact bargaining to a request for negotiations of ground rules for a term agreement. FLRA decided that the impact bargaining request could be no broader than the circumstances that motivated it, and FLRA concluded that the request was nonnegotiable because it was too broad:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency excepts to the Arbitrator's award under &#x00A7; 7122(a)(1) of the Statute on the ground that the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that it improperly implemented the revised NIAP without completing bargaining.[15] As the Agency's exception concerns whether the award is contrary to law, the Authority's review is <span class="Italic">de novo. See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. V. FLRA,</span> 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law<span class="Italic">. See United States DoD, Dept's of the Army and Air Force, Ala. National Guard, Northport, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;The Arbitrator framed the issue in this case as whether the Agency's implementation of the revised NIAP violated &#x00A7; 7116 of the Statute, the NIAP, or the parties' agreement. The Arbitrator did not specifically find that the Agency's action constituted a violation of the Statute, the NIAP, or the parties' agreement. However, the parties address the award as if he had found a violation of the Statute, supporting their exceptions and oppositions with references to the Statute and to Authority case law. Accordingly, the analysis will proceed solely in terms of whether the Arbitrator properly found a violation of the Statute and will not address the possible violations of the NIAP or the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency proposed a specific change in unit employees' conditions of employment pursuant to the exercise of its management rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute while the parties were contemplating negotiation of a new term agreement. The Authority has not heretofore dealt with issues relating to the parties' bargaining obligations in such circumstances. The specific issue herein is the Agency's legal ability, if any, to refuse to bargain over the Union's proposed ground rule requiring the Agency to combine its proposed impact and implementation bargaining obligation with the negotiation of a term agreement. If the Agency could lawfully refuse to bargain over whether to combine the two negotiation situations into one set of negotiations, then the Union's refusal to engage further in impact and implementation bargaining would permit the Agency to unilaterally implement its proposed change to conditions of employment. Conversely, the Agency would commit an unfair labor practice by its unilateral implementation of the revised NIAP, if it was required to bargain over the proposed ground rule providing for the combination of the two negotiation situations into one set of negotiations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Union's proposed ground rule constitutes a permissive subject of bargaining and, consequently, that the Agency was under no obligation to bargain on that subject as a precondition to impact and implementation of the revised NIAP. We emphasize, however, that the result herein is not intended to preclude parties from combining bargaining over the impact and implementation of a particular exercise of a management right with bargaining over a term agreement. Because combining bargaining over these two matters is a permissive matter, parties are free to explore various alternatives to achieve that purpose. Rather, this case stands for the proposition that an agency cannot be compelled to bargain over combining impact and implementation and term bargaining and it has the right to insist that such bargaining proceed on separate tracks.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;In this regard, review of the revised NIAP indicates that it constitutes, among other things, criteria governing employee work assignments, under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, and staffing patterns, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). The Arbitrator's statement that the Agency was not entitled to revise the NIAP "solely as an exercise of its management rights[,]" indicates that he found the Agency had an obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP. The Agency did not deny that it had such an obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[17]&#x2003;The fact that the Agency's action in this case took place after the expiration of the NLA does not affect the scope of the Agency's impact and implementation bargaining obligation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority has made clear that, "[w]here a bargaining obligation arises by virtue of an agency changing conditions of employment, the [a]gency is required to bargain only over negotiable proposals addressing those changes." <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Health and Human Services, SSA, Baltimore, Md.</span>, 39 FLRA 258, 262 (1991) (<span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, SSA, Baltimore, Md.</span>, 31 FLRA 651, 656 (1988)). Consistent with that principle, where, pursuant to a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a) or &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1), an agency proposes to change the conditions of employment of unit employees, its bargaining obligation is limited to only those procedures, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2), and appropriate arrangements, under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), that address the particular change proposed<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held, in<span class="Italic"> FLRA v. United States Dep't of Justice</span>, 994 F.2d 868 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice</span>), that the agency did not violate the Statute by failing to bargain over a matter that was outside the scope of impact and implementation bargaining. The case involved an Authority enforcement action seeking compliance with its order requiring impact and implementation bargaining over the agency's action decentralizing its operations and relocating and remodeling facilities used in those operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court stated, initially, that "impact and implementation bargaining arises as an exception to the management's rights doctrine created by section 7106(a)." 994 F.2d at 871. According to the court, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and (3) provides that &#x00A7; 7106(a) "does not preclude an agency and a labor organization from negotiating 'procedures which management officials of the agency will observe in exercising authority' under that section or 'appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of [such] authority.'" 994 F.2d at 872 (citing <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 962 F.2d at 50). The court concluded that "by case law and statutory reference, the term 'impact and implementation' includes only" procedures under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) and appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3)<span class="Italic">.

The court held that "the creation of an office for the [u]nion has nothing to do with the procedures used by management for the resource and personnel allocation involved in the decentralization of the unit<span class="Italic">."

<p class="noindent-1">Because the union's office space proposal did not concern either the procedures governing management's decision, pursuant to its rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a), to decentralize its operations, or appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by that decision, the court concluded that it was outside the scope of the agency's obligation to bargain over the impact and implementation of that decision. The court concluded that, by refusing to bargain over that proposal, the agency had not violated the Authority's order and denied the petition for enforcement. We agree with the court's analysis of the scope of impact and implementation bargaining under the Statute and adopt its rationale and its holding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This limitation on the scope of impact and implementation bargaining is no different when the question, as here, concerns an agency's obligation to bargain over the ground rules for negotiating over the impact and implementation of an exercise of a management right. It is well established that the duty to bargain extends to ground rules for negotiations because "the negotiation of ground rules is part of the collective bargaining process and the mutual obligation of the parties to negotiate in good faith...." <span class="Italic">Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital, Columbia, Mo.</span>, 16 FLRA 944, 945 (1984). However, this principle has an important qualification attached. The Authority has emphasized that since "the obligation to bargain over ground rules 'is inseparable from the parties' mutual obligation to bargain in good faith,...a party may not insist on bargaining over ground rules which do not enable the parties to fulfill their mutual obligation.'" <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, HQ, AFLC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 36 FLRA 912, 916 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson I</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force, HQ, AFLC, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio</span>, 36 FLRA 524, 533 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson II</span>)). In other words, the duty to bargain over ground rules must be consistent with the parties' obligation to bargain in a particular case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Issue in this case is whether the Union's proposed ground rule is consistent with the parties' mutual impact and implementation bargaining obligations.[18] More specifically, the question is whether the Union's proposed ground rule addresses only procedures or appropriate arrangements relating to the change in conditions of employment proposed by the Agency with respect to the NIAP. Clearly, it does not. The Union proposed, as a condition precedent to bargaining over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP, that the Agency agree to bargain that matter as a part of bargaining over a new term agreement. Based on the record, there is no question but that bargaining over a new term agreement would extend beyond the narrow scope of issues related to the procedures and appropriate arrangements governing implementation of the revised NIAP. Although the Union identified provisions of the NLA that related to the NIAP that it wished to discuss in term negotiations, it also demanded to bargain over other, unrelated provisions of the NLA as well<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, JE H. For that reason, the Union's proposed ground rule exceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining and the Agency had no obligation to bargain over that ground rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;Although the Union submitted specific proposals related to the revised NIAP, it conditioned bargaining over those proposals on agreement to its proposed ground rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, because the Union's proposed ground rule would constitute a waiver of the Agency's right to bargain only over those procedures and appropriate arrangements that address the revised NIAP, it is a permissive subject of bargaining<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., United States Food and Drug Admin., Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Regions</span>, 53 FLRA 1269, 1274 (1998); <span class="Italic">FDIC, HQ</span>, 18 FLRA 768, 771 (1985) (proposal requiring party to waive a statutory right is a permissive matter). Further, because the Union's proposed ground rule constitutes a permissive matter, the Agency had a right not only to refuse to bargain to impasse over the matter, but also to implement the revised NIAP without completing bargaining.[19] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bu. Of Prisons, FCI Danbury, Danbury, </span>Conn., 55 FLRA 201, 206 (1999) ("A party's right to terminate unilaterally a permissive bargaining subject is not contingent on first satisfying a bargaining obligation as to the substance, impact or implementation of the change."); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Lexington, Ky.</span>, 54 FLRA 429, 435 (1998); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, Washington, D.C. and Dep't of Health and Human Services, Region X, Seattle, Wash.</span>, 19 FLRA 73, 74 (1985)<span class="Italic">. See also United States Dep't of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 58 FLRA 33, 34 (2002) (if pending proposals are outside duty to bargain, an agency does not violate the Statute by implementing a change without bargaining over those proposals). More particularly, because the Union had conditioned bargaining over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP on the Agency bargaining over a new term agreement, a matter outside the scope of the Agency's impact and implementation bargaining obligation, the Agency did not violate the Statute by implementing the revised NIAP on October 1, 2001.[20] <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA, Baltimore</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[19]&#x2003;We note, in this regard, that the Arbitrator's finding that the parties were not at impasse is of no consequence to this analysis. Because the Union's proposed ground rule was a permissive subject of bargaining, it could not require the Agency to bargain over the matter at all, let alone bargain over it to impasse. In any event, we note that the Union, at least, believed that the parties were at impasse over the ground rules proposal because it sought the assistance of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and the Panel to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[20]&#x2003;Nothing in this decision is intended to suggest that an agency <span id="page_598"></span>may unilaterally modify provisions of an expired agreement relating to mandatory subjects of bargaining and the facts of this case do not present such an issue.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the following observation by the court in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">By ascribing certain management rights to agencies, but tempering those rights through the requirement of impact and implementation bargaining, Congress sought to strike a compromise between an agency's need to manage itself efficiently and the employees' right to participate in the decisions that affect them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>, 962 F.2d at 50 n.1 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 819 F.2d 306, 308 (D.C. Cir. 1987)). The court went on to observe that the "balance struck by Congress is a delicate one" that would be "easily upset by an untoward shift of power to either party[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">A rule <span class="Italic">requiring</span> agencies to bargain a ground rule conditioning impact and implementation bargaining on the negotiation of a term agreement in these circumstances would frustrate the compromise reached by Congress in enacting &#x00A7; 7106. In particular, a rule of this nature would not give full effect to the place of management rights in the statutory scheme because it would tie the exercise of a right to objectives that have nothing to do with the purposes for which the right was being exercised<span class="Italic">. See Dep't of Justice</span>, 994 F.2d at 872 (citing <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Interior</span>, court notes it has declined to extend scope of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) to include proposals that not designed for purpose of addressing adverse impact of exercise of management right). In short, Congress established the appropriate weight to be given management rights in impact and implementation bargaining by requiring that it be focused solely on the reasonably foreseeable changes resulting from the exercise of a management right<span class="Italic">. Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conversely, if unions could condition impact and implementation bargaining on the negotiation of unrelated matters, the increased bargaining power available would exceed the latitude given unions by Congress in that scheme. The resultant delay would serve no useful purpose in accomplishing the statutory goal of an effective and efficient Government<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Dep't of the Treasury, BATF v. FLRA</span>, 857 F.2d 819, 822 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (time required to implement proposed process inconsistent not only with management right, but with the Statute's "larger goal of promoting 'an effective and efficient Government'"). The Authority has recognized the adverse consequences of such ground rules bargaining: "ground rules proposals must, at a minimum, be designed to further, not impede, the bargaining for which the ground rules are proposed." <span class="Italic">Wright-Patterson II</span>, 36 FLRA at 533. Moreover, it would be exceedingly anomalous if a union could achieve through ground rules bargaining an expansion of negotiations that it could not accomplish through bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This principle is designed to protect the bargaining process, consistent with the purpose of the Statute that collective bargaining facilitates the public interest in an effective and efficient Government. Moreover, it is a principle that protects the interests of both parties, as such a tactic could be employed by either party<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Wright-Patterson I</span> and<span class="Italic"> II</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Agency did not violate the Statute in implementing the revised NIAP. The implementation of the revised NIAP constituted the Agency's exercise of its rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) and &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. As such, the Agency was not obligated to bargain over its decision. Rather, the Agency was obligated to bargain only over procedures which the Agency would observe in implementing the revised NIAP (&#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) of the Statute) and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the Agency's decision to implement the revised NIAP (&#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute). Stated otherwise, the Union's right to bargain in this case was limited to the impact and implementation of the proposed changes in the NIAP.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's ground rule proposal conditioned negotiations over the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP on first bargaining over the expired master collective bargaining agreement. This proposal was not a matter falling within &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2) or &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute with respect to the implementation of the revised NIAP. As such, the proposal constituted a permissive subject of bargaining as to which the Agency could have elected, but was not obligated, to bargain. The Agency's implementation of the revised NIAP, in the face of a proposal over which it was not obligated to bargain, was, therefore, not a violation of the Statute. Because the Arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that the Agency improperly implemented the revised NIAP, his award must be set aside.[21]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;In view of this result, it is not necessary to address the parties' other exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 414 F.3d 50, 60-61 (D.C. Cir. 2005), affirmed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Authority's conclusion that the "limitation on the scope of impact and implementation bargaining" in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice </span>is "no different when the question...concerns an agency's obligation to bargain over the ground rules for negotiating over the impact and implementation of an exercise of a management right," <span class="Italic">Customs Order</span>, 59 FLRA at 709, derives from our declaration in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Justice </span>that a "'proposal must address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right.'" 994 F.2d at 872 (quoting &#x0026; citing <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992)). As the Authority recognized, it "would be exceedingly anomalous" if the NTEU could use a ground rule proposal to expand the scope of negotiations beyond that of impact and implementation bargaining itself. <span class="Italic">Customs Order</span>, 59 FLRA at 711. Furthermore, we cannot help but note that the Authority's interpretation is wholly consistent with other precedent. Its observation fifteen years ago that "ground rules proposals must, at a minimum, be designed to further, not impede, <span class="Italic">the bargaining for which the ground rules are proposed</span>," <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Air Force Headquarters, Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (Respondent) &#x0026; AFGE, Council 214 (Charging Party)</span>, 36 FLRA 524, 533 (1990) (emphasis added), is simply another way of stating that "the duty to bargain over ground rules must be consistent with the parties' obligation to bargain in a particular case." <span class="Italic">Customs Order</span>, 59 FLRA at 709.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Authority's interpretation of the mutual statutory duty to bargain in good faith makes sense even without resort to supporting precedent. Notwithstanding the NTEU's contrary characterization, the Authority did not conclude that an agency is never obligated to bargain over a ground rule proposal to combine negotiations; rather, it held only that Customs was under no such duty to do so in this instance because the NTEU's "proposed ground rule exceeded the scope of impact and implementation bargaining." <span class="Italic">Customs Order</span>, 59 FLRA at 710. The Authority's holding, as it noted, advances statutory objectives we also recognize. In the past, we have stated that "[b]y ascribing certain management rights to agencies, but tempering those rights through the requirements of impact and implementation bargaining" the Congress balanced "the agency's need to manage itself efficiently and the employees' right to participate in the decisions that affect them." <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy</span>, 962 F.2d at 50 n.1. We described the balance as a "delicate" one, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, and we think the Authority reasonably determined that the balance would be upset if the NTEU could use a ground rule proposal to require Customs to negotiate on matters unrelated to the impact and implementation of the revised NIAP. Not only would the inevitably resulting delay in implementing the revised NIAP frustrate the Statute's "larger goal of promoting 'an effective and efficient government,'" <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury, </span>857 F.2d at 822 (quoting &#x0026; citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(b)), but requiring Customs to bargain over such a proposal would diminish the role of management rights in the statutory scheme by conditioning their exercise on bargaining over matters having nothing to do with the exercise of the rights themselves. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dep't of Justice</span>, 994 F.3d at 872 (To fall within subparagraph (b)(3) "proposal must address adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a protected management right."). Because it is clear to us, as it was to the Authority, that bargaining over the terms of a new NLA would necessarily extend further and take longer than bargaining over the impact and implementation of Customs' revised NIAP, we conclude that the Authority reasonably upheld both the Customs' refusal to consider NTEU's proposal to bargain over the two matters simultaneously as well as Customs' implementation of the revised NIAP.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) seeks review of a decision of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA or Authority) upholding an arbitration award in favor of the United States Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (Customs). <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 143,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. No. 167 (May 16, 2005) (<span class="Italic">FLRA Dec</span>.). Before October 2001 Customs was bound under <span id="page_599"></span>the terms of its 1995 National Inspectional Assignment Policy (NIAP) and a National Labor Agreement (NLA) to bargain with NTEU Chapter 143 (Chapter 143) over changes in rotation and regular days off (RDOs) for its El Paso, Texas passenger customs inspectors. In its decision the FLRA concluded that Customs effectively revoked its consent to bargain over rotation and RDOs in 2001 when it implemented its revised NIAP (RNIAP), which by its terms superseded both the 1995 NIAP and the NLA, which had expired in 1999. Because the FLRA's decision is not arbitrary, capricious or otherwise contrary to law, we deny the NTEU's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a continuing dispute between the NTEU and Customs over the extent of Customs' obligation to bargain over changes wrought pursuant to the RNIAP. Although the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq</span>., "generally obligates an agency to negotiate with its employees' bargaining representative over 'conditions of employment,'<span class="Italic"> id. </span>&#x00A7; 7103(a)(12)--i.e., 'personnel policies, practices, and matters...affecting working conditions,' <span class="Italic">id. </span>&#x00A7; 7103(a)(14)," section 7106 of the Statute" 'reserv[es] to management officials the authority to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, make budget, organization, and work assignments.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

Further, as the FLRA has interpreted the Statute, the mandatory bargaining obligation over impact and implementation attaches only at "the level of exclusive recognition," which in the case of bargaining between Customs and the NTEU is at the national level, so that bargaining over impact and implementation below that level is permissive. <span class="Italic">See NTEU Chapter 137,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. 483, 486 (2004) <span class="Italic">(citing U.S. Food &#x0026; Drug Admin.,</span> 53 F.L.R.A. 1269, 1274 (1998); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Defense Dependents Sch.,</span> 12 F.L.R.A. 52, 53 (1983)).</p>

In accordance with the executive order, the 1995 NIAP required that such subjects as workweek length, work hours, scheduling, staffing levels and days off be negotiated and determined at the local level. <span class="Italic">See</span> NIAP &#x00A7; 5(A), JA 158-62. Accordingly, Customs agreed in the NLA to bargain locally over various permissive subjects of bargaining, including, specifically, work station rotation. NLA Article 20, section 15.B specifically provided that Customs "will give timely notice and the opportunity to bargain...when a change is to be made in an established rotation system which has an impact, or one which is [sic] reasonably foreseeable, on conditions of employment," JA 235, and Article 37, section 6.B stipulated that "[p]roposed changes which apply within one (1) organizational office"--such as the El Paso rotation system--"will be negotiated within that office," that is, at the local level, JA 243. Thus, under the NLA, recurring rotation regimes that applied only locally were required to be negotiated locally. The NLA expired in 1999.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On February 17, 2001 Executive Order 12871 was revoked by Executive Order 13203, 66 Fed. Reg. 11,227 (Feb. 17, 2001), which directed that all executive agencies "promptly move to rescind any orders, rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing or enforcing Executive Order 12871."[2] On August 2, 2001 Customs sent the NTEU a copy of the RNIAP along with a cover letter announcing that Customs had decided "to exercise its statutory right to terminate and no longer be bound by the provisions in the national agreement in which we agreed to bargain over matters covered by 5 USC 7106 (b)(1)." Section 4 of the RNIAP expressly provides that it "supersedes and replaces [the 1995 NIAP] as well as all local agreements that address matters contained within [the RNIAP]. Section 3 more broadly states that the RNIAP's "policies and procedures...take precedence over any and all other agreements, policies, or other documents or practices executed or applied by the parties previously, <span class="Italic">at either the national or local levels,</span> concerning the matters covered within this Handbook." Section 3 also states that "[n]o further obligation to consult, confer, or negotiate, either upon the substance or impact and implementation of any decision or action, shall arise upon the exercise of any provision, procedure, right or responsibility addressed or contained within this Handbook." Section 5 then directs that "agency managers," in accordance with "workload," "operational needs" and/or "budgetary limitations," are to make decisions regarding such "Scheduling" and "Staffing Levels" matters as "Length of Workweek," "Work Hours," "Days Off," "Scheduling," "Staffing Levels," "Staffing Flexibility" and "Shift Swaps." Customs' cover letter states the RNIAP is to take effect on September 30, 2001.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;The order expressly stated: "Nothing in this order shall abrogate any collective bargaining agreements in effect on the date of this order." 66 Fed. Reg. at 11,227.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 3, 2001 the El Paso Port Director notified Chapter 143 of a change in personnel rotation and RDOs. Up to that time, each Customs passenger inspector in El Paso was rotated among three bridges there--serving for two weeks at each bridge, then starting the sequence over--and received a four-day weekend every three weeks. Under the new policy, each passenger inspector was to be assigned to a single bridge for a one-year term and to receive a four-day weekend only every five to six weeks. On October 4, 2001 the NTEU filed a request to bargain over the change pursuant to the NLA, which Customs denied. On October 7, 2001 Customs implemented the RNIAP. The NTEU filed a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5). When Customs failed to respond, the NTEU invoked arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The arbitrator issued an award in favor of Customs, rejecting the NTEU's contentions that the RNIAP violates Articles 20 and 37 of the NLA because, the arbitrator concluded, these provisions were "trumped" by the FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Treasury Customs Service, </span>59 F.L.R.A. 703 (2004), <span class="Italic">review denied, NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 414 F.3d 50, 57 (D.C. Cir. 2005), in which the FLRA upheld Customs' implementation of the RNIAP. The arbitrator further found that the RNIAP, unlike its predecessor NIAP, "'did not contain provisions authorizing local bargaining'" and observed that "he was 'bound to the [Authority's] conclusions' as well as case law holding that the obligation to bargain attaches at the level of exclusive recognition." FLRA Dec. at 5 (quoting arbitration award at 15, 16). Accordingly, the arbitrator concluded that "'[w]ithout an obligation to bargain at the local level...there can be no violation of the Statute...for a failure or refusal to bargain.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(quoting arbitration award at 16).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU excepted to the arbitral award and the FLRA denied its exceptions in a decision issued May 16, 2005. In upholding the award, the Authority relied principally on its decisions in <span class="Italic">Customs Service </span>and in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 137,</span> 60 F.L.R.A. 483 (2004),<span class="Italic"> recons. denied,</span> 61 F.L.R.A. 60 (2005). In<span class="Italic"> Chapter 137,</span> the Authority determined that Customs had no obligation to bargain at the local level over a change in local Sunday overtime assignments because RNIAP "section 3 terminated locally negotiated agreements concerning inspectional assignment matters, as well as the Agency's obligation to bargain at the local level regarding such matters." 60 F.L.R.A. at 487.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nonetheless, the Authority further concluded in <span class="Italic">Chapter 137</span> that the fact that section 3 "unilaterally, but lawfully, implemented RNIAP did not extinguish Customs' statutory bargaining obligations at the national level (that is, at the level of exclusive recognition) to bargain over all mandatory subjects of bargaining concerning overtime inspectional assignments." 60 F.L.R.A. at 488. The Authority applied the same reasoning here to local bargaining over bridge assignment rotation and RDOs:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Section 3 of the RNIAP by its terms effectively terminated any previously existing agreement that required the Agency to bargain at the local level over the impact and implementation of decisions concerning the assignment of inspectors. "[S]ection 3 established the RNIAP as the governing policies and procedures with respect to inspectional assignment matters," including, as provided in Article 5 of the RNIAP, the length of the work week, tours of duty, and days off. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 137, </span>60 F.L.R.A. at 487. Therefore, for reasons previously expressed in <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 137, </span>the Agency did not have any obligation to bargain at the local level over the impact and implementation of the changes concerning bridge assignments and RDOs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FLRA Dec.&#x2003;at 15-16. The NTEU filed a timely petition for review of the FLRA's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"[W]hen acting 'within its authority' and 'consistent with the congressional mandate,' the Authority's decision may only be set aside if it is found to be 'arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.'" <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 414 F.3d at 57 <span class="Italic">(quoting Ass'n of Civilian Technicians v. FLRA,</span> 250 F.3d 778, 782 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706(2)(A);<span class="Italic"> Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA, </span>464 U.S. 89, 97 &#x0026; n.7, 98 n.8 1983))) (alteration in <span class="Italic">NTEU). </span>Applying this deferential standard, we uphold the Authority's decision. The NTEU acknowledges that the requirement in NLA Article 37, section 6.B that Custom<span class="Italic">s</span> bargain locally over changes in rotation and RDOs "concerns a permissive subject of bargaining" and "[t]herefore, it became subject to revocation by either party upon the expiration of the national agreement in 1999." Opening Br. 16 <span class="Italic">(citing Fed. Aviation Admin.,</span> 14 F.L.R.A. 644 (1984)). The <span id="page_600"></span>only issue therefore is whether the FLRA reasonably determined that the RNIAP effectively revoked section 6.B. We conclude the Authority's determination was reasonable given the expansive language of RNIAP section 3 preempting all previous agreements and disclaiming all further bargaining obligations on the matters covered in the RNIAP. Nonetheless, the NTEU raises two arguments against revocation. We address, and reject, each one in turn.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the NTEU argues that the FLRA failed to follow its precedent requiring that an agency give explicit notice of intent to terminate a bargaining provision.<span class="Italic"> See U.S. Dep't of Justice, </span>55 F.L.R.A. 201, 205 (1999) ("Authority precedent suggests that to be effective, a party must give notice that explicitly contains a statement of intent to terminate a provision dealing with a permissive bargaining subject."). The NTEU contends the RNIAP falls short of this requirement because it does not specifically identify article 37, section 6.B as being revoked or disclaim a bargaining obligation on the <span class="Italic">local</span> level. As to the former, we find no requirement in FLRA precedent that the employing agency cite the specific provision revoked. Quite the contrary, in <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 23 F.L.R.A. 209 (1986), the Authority concluded that the union effectively revoked a waiver of its right to negotiate, set out in an expired agreement, when its president informed the Federal Aviation Administration that <span class="Italic">"'any prior bargaining authority</span> given to any [union] representative other than [himself was]...revoked with respect to the national unit,'" 23 F.L.R.A. at 210 (emphasis and first alteration added). Similarly, in this case, the Authority's finding of valid revocation relies on the express language of RNIAP section 3, which declares that the RNIAP is to "take precedence over <span class="Italic">any and all other agreements, policies, or other documents or practices </span>executed or applied by the parties previously...concerning the matters covered" and that Customs is to be subject to <span class="Italic">"[n]</span> <span class="Italic">o further obligation </span>to consult, confer, or negotiate." Relying on <span class="Italic">Chapter 137</span> 's construction of this broad language, the FLRA reasonably found that "Section 3 of the RNIAP by its terms effectively terminated any previously existing agreement that required the Agency to bargain at the local level over the impact and implementation of decisions concerning the assignment of inspectors," FLRA Dec. at 15, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Chapter 137</span> also concluded Customs could not lawfully refuse to bargain at the national level ("the level of exclusive recognition") over the impact and implementation of such decisions. In fact, NTEU acknowledges that "the purpose of [the second paragraph of section 3] is to foreclose <span class="Italic">all</span> bargaining over any future management actions take pursuant to RNIAP" so that Customs "would have no duty to bargain--whether at the local or the national level--over the impact and implementation of management actions taken pursuant to RNIAP. It argues, however, that the FLRA's subsequent determination in <span class="Italic">Chapter 137 </span>that Customs cannot avoid its statutory obligation to bargain over impact and implementation at the national level somehow voided its intent, conveyed to NTEU through section 3 of the RNIAP, not to bargain at the local level. The Authority reasonably concluded otherwise in both <span class="Italic">Chapter 137</span> and its decision here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU's fallback position is that, even if section 3 gave effective notice of Customs' intent to revoke its agreement to bargain over matters "covered," "addressed" or "contained" in the RNIAP, because the term "rotation" is not specifically mentioned therein, the obligation to negotiate locally over rotation survives. We reject this argument as well. The NLA defines "rotation" as "[t]he recurring assignment of employees to different work locations, assigned work, shifts, and/or tours of duty within the confines of the employees' post of duty and/or other locations to which the employees are regularly assigned. Under this definition, the bridge rotation at issue, including RDOs, is reasonably encompassed within the subject matter that RNIAP section 5 expressly declares is to be determined by "agency managers" in accordance with "workload," "operational needs" and/or "budgetary limitations," namely, the "length of the workweek and tours of duty," "work hours in each day of the basic workweek," "days off," "scheduling the numbers, types and grades of employees...for any particular tour, shift, location, special team or task," "the number of inspectional personnel assigned to any inspectional activity...on a regular workday or holiday" and "assign[ing] employees from one facility to another." Nor does any of the arbitration hearing evidence cited by NTEU, which is at best ambiguous in its references to rotation, plainly contradict the FLRA's determination that Customs effectively revoked its agreement to negotiate rotation on the local level.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the FLRA reasonably determined that Customs, through the RNIAP, effectively revoked its agreement in the NLA to bargain over rotation and RDOs at the local level, the petition for review is denied.</p>
