<p class="Body-Text">A nonfrivolous allegation that an agency's coercion was based on <span id="Page_2020"></span>discrimination makes an involuntary retirement claim a mixed case. "Under section 1614.302(b), an aggrieved person is entitled initially to file either a mixed case complaint with the agency or an appeal of the same matter with the Board." <span class="Italic">Ball v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 482, 484 (1995). An AJ properly considers facts advanced by an appellant in support of a claim of discrimination as part of the circumstances surrounding an allegedly involuntary retirement, but the AJ should not make specific findings and conclusions on discrimination without a finding that the appellant's retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Tyler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 10 MSPR 439, 440 n.2 (1982) (AJ should not have provided the appellant with notice of the right of EEOC review when the AJ determined that the retirement was voluntary).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An allegation of discrimination alone will not lead to a hearing and merits resolution on an involuntary retirement appeal. There must be factual assertions meeting the test of nonfrivolous allegations. Analysis of the interplay of discrimination and involuntary retirement issues is provided by <span class="Italic">Tripp v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 59 MSPR 458, 461-62 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An administrative judge may properly consider claims of discrimination and retaliation in an alleged involuntary retirement appeal for the limited purpose of determining whether such claims support the appellant's allegation of coercion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burke v. Department of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 434, 438 (1992); <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 50 MSPR 680, 684 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 975 F.2d 870 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we find that the administrative judge otherwise correctly considered the appellant's allegations of discrimination and retaliation in reaching his finding that the appellant's retirement was voluntary and not coerced. Claims of discrimination such as those offered by the appellant that are not accompanied by allegations specifying particular acts of harassment, discrimination, or retaliation are insufficient to support a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of involuntariness and do not entitle the appellant to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 55 MSPR 185, 188-90 (1992). Further, even assuming that the agency's alleged actions were discriminatory and retaliatory, the appellant still failed to show how those actions coerced his retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Burke</span>, 53 MSPR at 439.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf.</span> Carter v. SSA, NY-0752-16-0120-I-1 (NP 10/6/2022) ("The Board addresses allegations of discrimination and retaliation in connection with an alleged involuntary retirement only insofar as those allegations relate to the issue of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Brown v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 469 F. App'x 852 (Fed. Cir. 2011)."); <span class="Italic">Roby v. Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-15-0588-I-1 (NP 9/13/2016) ("We further find that the appellant's vague allegations that the agency violated '29 CFR 1614' and the 'MD 110 EEO Procedure Manual' do not establish that any purported errors in processing or investigating her EEO complaints rendered her retirement involuntary. Moreover, because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's alleged involuntary retirement appeal, we lack authority to adjudicate her claims that the agency violated regulations or procedures in processing and investigating her EEO complaints. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Penna v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6; 13 (2012) (stating that, in the absence of an otherwise appealable action, the Board lacked jurisdiction over claims of harmful error, prohibited personnel practices, and the agency's alleged failure to comply with regulations).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Durden v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 373 (1983), involved a retirement found involuntary by EEOC on a mixed case review of a Board decision. The Commission determined that the appellant was a victim of disability discrimination. The agency failed to reasonably accommodate the employee's disability. MSPB, on remand from EEOC, determined that the employee's retirement was involuntary. The employee had a partial disability, but he had performed satisfactorily in his position for many years. He had a satisfactory appraisal, but he was told by his agency that he should either retire or face adverse action for the inability to perform his job, allegedly demonstrated by a fitness for duty examination. The Board noted, cryptically, that "[w]e do not suggest that a finding of discrimination will always negate voluntariness. Only where, as here, discrimination is the sole reason for the threatened agency action will a finding of involuntariness be made." The Board added that there is an appeal right to EEOC in an appeal involving a discrimination issue that "must be analyzed in order to determine if there exists an otherwise appealable action."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cano v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 284, 287-88 &#x00B6; 7, 2007 MSPB 273 (2007), explained the necessary nexus between claimed discrimination and a constructively adverse retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In applying the voluntariness test to allegations that a retirement was coerced when there has been no threat of an adverse action, the appropriate test is whether, under all of the circumstances, working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the appellant's position would have felt compelled to retire. <span class="Italic">Markon v. Department of State</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 574, 577 (1996). When an appellant raises allegations of discrimination in connection with an involuntariness claim, evidence of discrimination may be considered only in terms of the standard for voluntariness in a particular situation--not whether such evidence meets the test for proof of discrimination or reprisal established under Title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 578. In an involuntary retirement appeal, therefore, evidence of discrimination goes to the ultimate question of coercion, i.e., whether under all of the circumstances working conditions were made so difficult by the agency that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to retire. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. An appellant is entitled to a hearing on the issue of Board jurisdiction over an appeal of an allegedly involuntary retirement only if he makes a nonfrivolous allegation casting doubt on the presumption of voluntariness. <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cano</span> described the particulars of the claim that led to a remand for a merits hearing, 107 MSPR 284, 288-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-14:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below that he prematurely retired due to discrimination, harassment, and emotional and mental abuse. In particular, he claimed that agency managers repeatedly followed him on his route, that a supervisor incorrectly told him that he was wasting his time, and that the supervisor made derogatory remarks relating to his race (Hispanic). The appellant also alleged that the agency issued him a letter of warning for failure to follow instructions, denied his request for overtime and told him that he would be counseled the next day, denied his request for annual leave, even though no other employees were off during the period in question, approved annual leave requests for other City Carriers, and initially denied his request for sick leave after he began to feel ill, sweat profusely, and feel faint while walking his route, but then granted that request after the appellant persisted, though a supervisor indicated that the appellant, but not other employees, would need a doctor's excuse to be released from work that day. The appellant asserted that his wife took him to the emergency room on the day in question, where he was diagnosed with arterial defibrillation and hospitalized for 2 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further claimed that, although the agency suspended him from driving a postal vehicle on August 3, 2005, due to a high blood pressure reading taken during a fitness-for-duty evaluation by a postal service physician, his personal physician indicated on August 4, 2005, that the appellant's blood pressure was under control. The appellant alleged that other employees with similar medical conditions were not required to report for fitness-for-duty evaluations and that, although he was allowed to return to work on August 24, 2005, he was not allowed to drive a postal vehicle or to deliver mail. One week later, after a shop steward filed a grievance, the appellant claimed that he was briefly allowed to deliver the mail on the walking part of his route--approximately one hour's worth--but was never given his full route back. The appellant alleged that he felt he was under a microscope, that he was not being fully utilized, and that his financial security was in jeopardy because his take-home pay had been $970.00 every two weeks, but for 9 weeks, from July 30, 2005, through September 30, 2005, he worked a total of only 198.06 hours. The appellant asserted that the stress he experienced from constant agency scrutiny and financial hardship led to depression, and that he "had planned on retiring at age 65, but, retirement seemed my only feasible option to protect my health and my family's well being."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a subsequent submission, the appellant further asserted that the Postmaster treated him differently than other employees, who had more debilitating medical conditions, by requiring him to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination, and that the agency restricted him to indoor duty for 1 year even though his personal physician wrote several letters stating that his blood pressure was being monitored and under control, and that he was able to return to work. The appellant claimed that those letters from his personal physician were never forwarded to the Associate Medical Director, who therefore concurred in the restriction recommended by the doctor who evaluated the appellant at the fitness-for-duty examination. The appellant asserted that "[i]t was at that point that [he] decided to retire early rather than subject [him] self to the stress of working under scrutiny," given the uncertainty of not knowing if he would work at all. The appellant claimed that, according to the Postmaster, he would be given work as long as there was work to do, and this meant that he "might work 2, 4, or possibly 6 hours." The appellant asserted that, "[s]ince now there was such a discrepancy in pay, [he] ...had to begin thinking about how [he] would make up the extreme difference in pay," a retirement annuity "would be more in keeping with what [his] postal pay had previously been," and "[his] only viable option both mentally and financially was to retire when [he] did."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has alleged, in essence, that he was the victim of disability discrimination because the agency incorrectly regarded him as disabled. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hardy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 387, &#x00B6; 31 (an appellant may establish that he was regarded as disabled by showing that: (1) His employer mistakenly believes that he has an impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities; or (2) his employer mistakenly believes that an actual, nonlimiting impairment substantially limits one or more major life activities), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2007-3112 (Fed. Cir. Oct. 4, 2007) (NP). In this regard, the appellant has alleged that the agency discriminated against him based on a disability by preventing him from performing all of the duties of his City Carrier position, even though his personal physician cleared him to return to work and he could perform all of those duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2021"></span>The appellant has also asserted that the agency did not provide him with enough work, and that this action led to a decrease in his pay that ultimately contributed to his decision to retire. "Deliberate idling" by an agency is a factor that may cause working conditions to become so difficult that a reasonable person would feel compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">See Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 68, &#x00B6; 16 (2004), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 158 Fed. Appx. 267 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Further, the appellant has alleged that the agency harassed him through such actions as treating him differently from similarly situated coworkers, failing to consider medical documentation he submitted showing that he could return to work, making derogatory remarks to him that were based on his race, and initially denying his leave request when he was in obvious physical distress and needed to be hospitalized. <span class="Italic">See Markon</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 580-83 (finding a nonfrivolous allegation of an involuntary retirement where the appellant alleged that the agency treated her less favorably than a more junior coworker based on prohibited discrimination and reprisal). The Board must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 260 F.3d 1336, 1342 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Under the totality of the circumstances set forth above, we find that the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that his working conditions became so difficult that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that this case may implicate the EEOC's regulations relating to whether the appellant posed a "direct threat" to the health or safety of himself or others. <span class="Italic">See McAlexander v. Department of Defense</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 384, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14 (2007). A defense to an allegation of discrimination may include a requirement that an individual not pose a "direct threat" to the health or safety of the individual or others in the workplace. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.15(b)(2). A "direct threat" means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r). The determination that an individual poses a "direct threat" shall be based on an individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safely perform the essential functions of the job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In determining whether an individual would pose a direct threat, the factors to be considered include the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the AJ must afford the parties an opportunity to address on remand the "direct threat" principles set forth above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach to retirements allegedly coerced by discrimination or reprisal was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Burke v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 434, 438-39 (1992), involving a retirement challenged as forced by harassing personnel actions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal, the administrative judge correctly set forth and applied the tripartite test for coercion, i.e., that: (1) One side involuntarily accepted the terms of the other; (2) circumstances presented no other alternative; and (3) those circumstances were the result of coercive acts of the opposite party. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Barthel v. Department of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 245, 251 n.11 (1988). The Board has held that it is proper for an administrative judge to consider an allegation of discrimination in an appeal of an allegedly involuntary resignation "for the limited purpose of determining whether it supported the appellant's allegation of coercion." <span class="Italic">Day v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 50 MSPR 680, 684 (1991). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Price v. United States Postal Service</span>, 50 MSPR 107, 110 (1991) (the Board may make an initial determination on a claim of prohibited discrimination where that claim is asserted as the sole cause of an involuntary action).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also acted properly in ruling that, where an appellant alleged that his retirement was coerced by discrimination and by reprisal for filing discrimination complaints, the appellant was required to show that his working conditions were made so intolerable by the alleged discrimination and reprisal that the employee was "forced" into an involuntary resignation or retirement. <span class="Italic">Bartman v. Allis-Chalmers Corporation</span>, 799 F.2d 311, 314 (7th Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">cert. den.</span>, 479 U.S. 1092, 107 S. Ct. 1304, 94 L. Ed.2d 160 (1987); <span class="Italic">Collins v. Argonne National Laboratory</span>, 757 F. Supp. 934, 937 (N.D. Ill. 1991). If the appellant makes this showing, there has been a constructive discharge because he has been left with no alternative but to leave the place of employment through resignation or retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 571, 573 (1984) (appellant who failed to show that working conditions were so intolerable that he was forced to retire failed to establish that his retirement was coerced as a result of alleged discrimination and reprisal), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 758 F.2d 664 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 471 U.S. 1102, 105 S. Ct. 2329, 85 L. Ed.2d 846 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as the administrative judge found, the appellant failed to return to work even after he was advised in April 1990 that Ehlen, the official allegedly responsible for discriminating against the appellant and for retaliating against him for filing discrimination complaints, was no longer serving as his supervisor. As the administrative judge further noted, the agency specifically advised the appellant in October 1990 that he had a right to withdraw the retirement application he had submitted, if he chose to do so. The appellant nonetheless retired on December 28, 1990, without making any attempt to withdraw the application. Thus, even if Ehlen engaged in the discriminatory and retaliatory activities the appellant has attributed to him, the appellant has not shown that those activities coerced his retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Huey v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3335) (considering, among other factors, the effect of a manager's statement to an employee indicating an interest in soliciting retirements because "we need to get the older employees out of the organization to bring in 'new blood'"; the executive immediately apologized and the retirement did not occur until a year later, so "even without the curative apology, its effects would have been highly attenuated."); <span class="Italic">Glenn v. Soldiers' &#x0026; Airmen's Home</span>, 76 MSPR 572, 581 (1997) (acknowledging <span class="Italic">Tripp</span> as to a resignation appeal; noting that the appellant was entitled to a hearing based on specific allegations of gender-based harassment and discrimination, tolerated by the agency, that allegedly would have caused any reasonable person in her position to feel compelled to resign); <span class="Italic">Yaksich v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 71 MSPR 355, 364 (1996) (interpreting <span class="Italic">Tripp</span>: "An administrative judge may properly consider claims of discrimination in an alleged involuntary action for the limited purpose of determining whether such claims support the appellant's allegation of coercion.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hardmon v. VA</span>, AT-0752-17-0589-I-1 (NP 1/27/2023), declined to fi nd a retirement appealable based on past EEO activity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, regarding the appellant's discrimination claims, the appellant
fi led an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint with the agency
on June 23, 2016, raising, among other things, the proposed suspension,
which led to the 14-day suspension mentioned above. In <span class="Italic">Axsom v.
Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2009), the appellant
had similarly fi led EEO complaints in the months before his allegedly
involuntary resignation, and the Board found that he failed to prove that
the agency was handling the complaints inequitably and that he thus
had the option to challenge the alleged discrimination, harassment,
and retaliation rather than resign. Here, the appellant has not alleged,
and the record does not indicate, that the agency was handling her EEO
complaint inequitably. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">Axsom</span>, the appellant had the option to
challenge the alleged discrimination rather than retire.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant secured a remand for a hearing in <span class="Italic">Ragland v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 58, 62-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (1999), based on allegations that retirement resulted from the discriminatory and intolerable treatment of the appellant by a supervisor:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that duress, coercion, and misrepresentations by the agency forced him into involuntary retirement. He alleges at least 22 specific acts of race and age discrimination and retaliation for filing grievances against his supervisor. With regard to discriminatory acts, he asserts that his supervisor "used part of [his] duties to create a new position...especially for the white male" and that the supervisor transferred all of the appellant's management duties to the white male and appointed the white male Maintenance Manager, despite lack of approval by the hospital commander. With regard to retaliatory acts, he alleges that after he ignored the supervisor's warning against filing another grievance, the supervisor retaliated by imposing stringent leave and attendance restrictions, removing him as Chief of the Services Branch by appointing a white male to replace him, and by giving the white male the single duty of supervising him. He also alleges that the supervisor harassed him by making false allegations that he was responsible for losing government property and then placing an unwarranted reprimand in his personnel records. In addition, the supervisor allegedly: 1) "hid his unlawful transfer of duties and changed the [appellant's] supervisory controls by not submitting any required Standard Form 52 documenting [the] changes to [his] job"; 2) illegally reassigned the appellant's work order clerk to another division, thus crippling his ability to do his job; 3) refused the appellant a performance plan and performance appraisal; 4) denied the appellant access to the Army grievance system; 5) removed him from the job he was hired into without a documented personnel action and replaced him with a new recruit; and 6) various other allegedly illegal managerial acts. The appellant asserts that the supervisor's discriminatory and retaliatory acts caused him "extreme mental anguish and suffering" and created working conditions that he could no longer tolerate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that one way an employee can overcome the presumption of voluntariness of a retirement or resignation is to show that the working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">See Bates v. Department of Justice,</span> 70 MSPR 659, 663 (1996); <span class="Italic">Hurwitz v. Department of the Army,</span> 61 MSPR 436, 439 (1994). Although an agency may exercise its management discretion to reassign employees as necessary for the efficiency of the service, it may not use this discretionary authority as a veil for an improper effort to pressure an employee to resign or retire. <span class="Italic">Harper,</span> 68 MSPR at 601. Discrimination and retaliation <span id="Page_2022"></span>claims in an alleged involuntary resignation or retirement appeal may be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether such claims support the appellant's allegation of coercion. <span class="Italic">Tripp v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 59 MSPR 458 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has asserted sufficient specific acts of discrimination and retaliation to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntary retirement<span class="Italic">. See Hurwitz,</span> 61 MSPR at 439-40 (claims of discrimination accompanied by allegations specifying particular acts of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation are sufficient to support a nonfrivolous allegation of involuntariness entitling the appellant to a jurisdictional hearing).

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henricksen v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 79 MSPR 213, 215 (1998), provides a blueprint of how an appellant can establish proof of intolerable working conditions and discrimination in an involuntary retirement appeal. The AJ excluded evidence that the appellant sought to introduce, leading the Board to a painstaking examination of the employee's proffered evidence of harassment and the significance of that evidence on the appeal. The appellant, a contract specialist, alleged that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">her retirement was involuntary because the agency made her work conditions intolerable in that: (1) It discriminated against her based on her national origin (Cuban), race (Hispanic), and gender (female), and continued to discriminate against her after she contacted an equal employment opportunity (EEO) counselor and filed a formal EEO complaint; (2) it further continued to discriminate against her after she disclosed to agency officials information that evidenced gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, and/or an abuse of authority (in relation to her criticism of an agency subcontract with National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), a government contractor, and vacant office space that NREL was renting at government expense); (3) it harassed her and solicited negative comments about her work from NREL employees whose work she was overseeing; (4) it falsely criticized her work performance based in whole or in part on the negative comments it solicited; and (5) it informed her that it would be "collocating" her office to the contractor's premises, causing her to fear that the contractor's management officials would be able to more closely scrutinize her work and to assist agency officials in removing her....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Henricksen</span> determined that the relevant issue was whether a reasonable person with the employee's specific physical or mental condition would have felt forced to retire, 79 MSPR at 217-23 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-22:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has found that where an employee's working conditions are so intolerable that the employee is forced to resign, the employee's resignation is involuntary and constitutes a constructive removal; the ultimate question to be determined is whether the employee's working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">Bates v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 70 MSPR 659, 662 (1996); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 66 MSPR 421, 423-24 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who alleges that her retirement or resignation was involuntary may show "whether the totality of the circumstances supported the conclusion that she was effectively deprived of free choice in the matter." <span class="Italic">Heining v. General Services Administration,</span> 68 MSPR 513, 519-20 (1995). An appellant's claims that her retirement was coerced by harassment, including prohibited discrimination and reprisal, are appropriate issues for consideration in determining whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Collins v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 55 MSPR 185, 188-90 (1992), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds by Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329-30 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Markon v. Department of State,</span> 71 MSPR 574, 580 (1996). Further, to establish involuntariness, it is not necessary that the appellant prove prohibited discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-16, or reprisal under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). "[R]ather...she need only show that 'working conditions were so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would have felt compelled to resign.'" <span class="Italic">Hernandez v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 412, 417 (1997) (citing <span class="Italic">Bates,</span> 70 MSPR at 663) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hurwitz v. Department of the Army,</span> 61 MSPR 436, 439 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant contends that the administrative judge prevented her from presenting allegedly relevant testimony from the appellant's psychologist, Claudia Carroll, Ph.D., and from NREL employees John Fox, David Trujillo, and John Enoch. The appellant contends that the administrative judge prevented, or at least attempted to prevent, Carroll, the appellant's treating psychologist, from testifying concerning: The appellant's lupus condition; the appellant's reports to her of her work-related stress; the effect of the appellant's allegedly stressful work environment on her lupus; Carroll's treatment of other patients with autoimmune disorders (including lupus); information Carroll received from those patients regarding the effect of stress on lupus; and whether Carroll had any reason not to believe the appellant's accounts of her working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to Trujillo, the appellant contends that, even though the administrative judge had approved him as a witness at the jurisdictional hearing, the administrative judge prevented him from presenting relevant testimony regarding her allegedly constructive removal. She states that Trujillo would have testified that a high-level management employee at NREL informed him and other NREL management officials that agency management officials wanted NREL employees to prepare negative comments regarding her alleged work deficiencies. She states that Trujillo would have testified that he informed her of what he had heard, that she discussed her lupus condition with him, and that she informed him that she felt stressed because she perceived her work place as very hostile and was considering retiring because of work-related stress and her allegedly hostile working conditions. She states that Trujillo would have further testified that he always knew the appellant to be a hard-working, knowledgeable, and conscientious employee with whom he had never had negative interactions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant states that the administrative judge improperly disallowed all testimony from Fox. She claims that Fox would have testified similarly to Trujillo regarding the appellant's work performance. As to Enoch, the appellant states that the administrative judge improperly disallowed testimony from Enoch regarding his conversations with the appellant about her lupus, her future plans, her perception of her work environment as hostile, his observations of her reactions to stressful situations, her work performance, and her interactions with him and other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge impermissibly prevented the appellant from presenting testimonial evidence that would have helped her to meet her burden of showing the Board's jurisdiction over her appeal. Dr. Carroll, who was seeing the appellant for stress that the appellant was experiencing, testified that the appellant had lupus and that this condition, added to the stress at work, made it necessary for the appellant to retire or else this condition "could have killed her." The appellant sought to elicit testimony from Dr. Carroll as to whether a reasonable person with lupus would have felt compelled to resign, but the administrative judge refused, over the appellant's objection, to allow such testimony, ruling that, "[i]f a reasonable healthy person could withstand a course of agency treatment, then...the same standard applie[d] to the appellant." We find that this ruling was error since, in cases of allegedly involuntary retirement, the relevant issue is whether a reasonable person with the employee's specific physical or mental condition would have felt forced to retire. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hernandez,</span> 74 MSPR at 417-18 (the Board considered whether a reasonable person with the appellant's orthopedic problems would have resigned in the face of the agency's actions); <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 523 (testimony that the appellant's doctor advised her to seek other employment because of the stress of her job was material testimony); <span class="Italic">Swift v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 29, 33 (1994) (the appellant's mental condition was material in determining whether someone in his position would have felt compelled to resign under the stressful working conditions he alleged).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's offer of proof of her work performance, the administrative judge, over the appellant's objection, refused to permit her to present testimonial evidence from Enoch regarding her performance (including her interactions with other NREL employees), ruling that "the quality of her performance [was] irrelevant." The administrative judge later ruled that "[e]ven if that was an improper performance appraisal," this still would not be an issue in a involuntary retirement appeal. The basis for the administrative judge's refusal to hear any testimony on performance was expressed as follows: "I don't think people resign or retire because they get poor performance appraisals. And if they do, that doesn't--that doesn't render it involuntary." We find that those rulings were error since, if, as the appellant alleged, her performance was satisfactory, but the agency harassed her and solicited unwarranted negative reports about her from NREL (the contractor she audited), then this would be evidence showing the totality of the circumstances surrounding her retirement. <span class="Italic">See Heining,</span> 68 MSPR at 519-20. A showing that the appellant's performance was satisfactory would also have constituted evidence in support of her claim that the agency's actions were a pretext for discrimination based on sex and national origin, and reprisal. <span class="Italic">See Markon,</span> 71 MSPR at 581 (evidence relating to performance is germane in an allegedly involuntary retirement appeal); <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 523 (a change in performance reviews after whistleblowing activity is relevant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not allow the appellant to call Mr. Fox, a senior contract administrator with NREL, as a witness to testify about the appellant's performance. Coupled with Fox's testimony, the appellant attempted to elicit testimony from Trujillo, another NREL employee, regarding his first-hand knowledge that one of the appellant's supervisors, John Kersten, asked NREL employees, including Ed Green, who was an NREL manager, to send negative reports about the appellant to the agency for the purpose of removing her. The appellant made an extensive offer of proof that Trujillo would testify that he was a team leader at NREL, that he was aware of no performance problems with the <span id="Page_2023"></span>appellant, and that he did not support an effort by NREL management, in conjunction with agency management, to create negative reports about the appellant because she took her oversight role too seriously. The administrative judge allowed no testimony from Trujillo, stating that, even if the agency targeted the appellant by soliciting negative comments about her from NREL management, "[w]hat was wrong with any of that?" He therefore ruled that Trujillo's proffered testimony was irrelevant, despite the fact that he had approved Trujillo as a witness prior to the hearing. We find that this was error inasmuch as the appellant correctly argued that she should have the opportunity to show that the agency's actions were intended to make her working conditions intolerable and that the agency's actions were motivated by impermissible reasons, i.e., discrimination and reprisal. Moreover, Trujillo's proffered testimony would have corroborated the appellant's statement that she heard that Kersten had asked NREL employees to fabricate and submit "negative write-ups" on her to force her separation. We find that this was relevant testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Braun v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 50 F.3d 1005, 1007-08 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (an allegation that a new supervisor "targeted" the appellant, who previously had an established record of good performance, was a point that the appellant should have been allowed to develop); <span class="Italic">Heining</span>, 68 MSPR at 523 (singling out the appellant for "inequitable" treatment was evidence showing the totality of the circumstances).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant sought to introduce testimony that the agency planned to relocate her office to NREL so that certain NREL employees, including Green, could document her performance "in a way to try to get her removed." The appellant wanted to add this proffered testimonial evidence to the totality of the circumstances. The administrative judge ruled, however, that the testimony was irrelevant because "[a]ll of these things are things which agencies routinely do with problem employees." Aside from the administrative judge's finding that the appellant was a "problem employee," even though he refused to allow her to present evidence on her performance, the appellant should have been allowed to develop evidence on why the agency planned to relocate her office, particularly since she made a proffer that the employee who replaced her was not relocated to NREL. <span class="Italic">See Markon,</span> 71 MSPR at 582 (a change in working conditions and duties is relevant to the circumstances under which the appellant was working when she decided to retire).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, relying specifically on <span class="Italic">Markon</span>, sought to present evidence of discrimination and reprisal, but the administrative judge ruled that such evidence could be submitted only if the Board first found that the action was within its jurisdiction. We find that this was error since, as explained above, the Board held in <span class="Italic">Markon,</span> 71 MSPR at 578, 581, that evidence of discrimination and reprisal is relevant in the jurisdictional phase of an involuntary retirement appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant attempted to testify that Kersten asked her to approve NREL contracts that she believed were not accurate and that, when she refused to approve them without more thorough review, he engaged in the pattern of behavior that led to her allegedly involuntary retirement, e.g., solicitation of negative reports from NREL employees, unsatisfactory performance "write-ups," relocation of her office to NREL, etc. The appellant claimed that Kersten's actions were taken in reprisal against her for her disclosure of alleged contract deficiencies and irregularities. The administrative judge disallowed the testimony, stating: "[T]here's legitimate whistleblowing, then there's an employee who is an obstructionist or a troublemaker, and that's the impression I'm getting from her testimony." Nevertheless, the administrative judge stated, with respect to the appellant's claim that she was pressured to approve inadequately documented contracts: "[I]t's easy to see that there are two sides to it; [the appellant] thought it was harassment, the agency thought she was performing improperly." As stated above, the appellant has the burden of showing that a reasonable person in <span class="Italic">her position</span> would have retired under the circumstances. By foreclosing the appellant from testifying about what she perceived was happening to her, i.e., to testify about her "side" of the matter, the administrative judge improperly limited her ability to meet her burden of proof. <span class="Italic">See Markon,</span> 71 MSPR at 581 (the appellant should be allowed to introduce evidence on her assertion that her harassment by agency officials intensified after she made disclosures to the Inspector General about perceived irregularities in the use of compensatory time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge ruled that he would not allow any testimony regarding the appellant's asserted belief that she was making a protected disclosure (waste of funds) when she told Kersten about her concern that the NREL contracts might be improvidently granted if they were too hastily approved. The administrative judge ruled that such testimony was irrelevant because the appellant could not have believed that she was disclosing anything improper or illegal since, according to the administrative judge, she had no right to question her supervisor and, in the government, "[y]ou do what you're told." Again, the administrative judge improperly precluded the appellant from showing that a reasonable person in her position would have felt that she either had to approve, under pressure from Kersten, what she believed were improper contracts or retire. The administrative judge also refused to allow the appellant to testify that a reasonable person in her position would have believed that she would be held responsible if one of the contracts she approved under pressure from Kersten turned out to be illegal. Again, such testimony would have shown the totality of the circumstances under which the appellant was working when she retired, especially when considered together with her assertions that she was less able to tolerate such work-related stress[*] because of her lupus.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] With respect to her allegation of work-related stress, we note that the appellant testified without rebuttal that, even though she had a balance of over 500 hours of sick leave, Kersten "wrote her up" for taking her leave when she could not go to work because of the stress she was under and that he did so to exert added pressure on her<span class="Italic">. See Wilson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 32 MSPR 244, 247 (1987) (denial of annual/sick leave requests, among other factors, casts doubt on the voluntariness of the appellant's retirement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the administrative judge refused to allow the appellant to ask Kersten any questions about why Kersten issued orders prohibiting the appellant from contacting anyone at NREL who was at or above the management level of Green, the procurement manager, and that, if she wanted to contact anyone with supervisory authority at NREL, she had to first obtain Kersten's permission. The administrative judge ruled, without explanation, that such a restriction was "a legitimate management action." Whether or not such restriction was legitimate, we find that it is still part of the totality of circumstances showing what the appellant's working conditions were at the time she decided to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find, based on the reasons discussed above, that, while the administrative judge conducted a jurisdictional hearing based on his determination that the appellant made nonfrivolous allegations of the involuntariness of her retirement, he improperly foreclosed the appellant from pursuing almost all of the evidence she needed to present to meet her burden of showing what the totality of the circumstances were at the time she decided to retire and what a reasonable person in her position would have done. <span class="Italic">See Braun</span>, 50 F.3d at 1007 (quoting <span class="Italic">Scharf v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 710 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1983), and <span class="Italic">Perlman v. United States,</span> 203 Ct. Cl. 397, 490 F.2d 928, 933 (1974) (it is a mistake to focus only on part of the events surrounding the appellant's resignation; rather, the factfinder "must examine 'the surrounding circumstances to test the ability of the employee to exercise free choice'")). Nor did the administrative judge permit the appellant, contrary to <span class="Italic">Markon</span>, to elicit any testimony showing how discrimination and reprisal were part of those circumstances. Thus, although the appellant was afforded a hearing, we find that it was not a meaningful one. Moreover, based on the discussions above, we find that the appellant preserved sufficient objections to the administrative judge's rulings and preserved a general objection to the administrative judge's rulings on the proffered testimony.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, this case must be remanded to the Denver Field Office for further adjudication in relation to the appellant's proffered testimonial evidence discussed above and for a determination as to whether the appellant retired on disability, and, if so, the effect of such disability retirement on her claim of involuntary retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge shall, consistent with this Opinion and Order, afford the appellant a supplemental hearing in order to allow her an opportunity to fully develop her claim of involuntary retirement. The administrative judge shall allow the appellant to present evidence on the totality-of-the-circumstances surrounding the voluntariness of her retirement, including an opportunity to present evidence of: The effect of the appellant's alleged lupus condition and work environment on her stress level; the appellant's performance; the agency's alleged attempts to solicit negative information from NREL employees regarding her work; the agency's relocation of her office to NREL premises; her supervisor's restrictions on her contacts with NREL supervisory officials; and her claims of discrimination and reprisal for whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tadlock v. Powell</span>, 291 F.3d 541, 547 (8th Cir. 2002) (affirming a conclusion of age discrimination resulting from a constructive discharge through the forced retirement of an FDIC manager who was reassigned and reduced in status without sufficient cause).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Maglietti v. MSPB</span>, 414 Fed. Appx. 288, 291 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP), determined that the Board properly decided it lacked jurisdiction over a claim of involuntary retirement when the appellant pursued an EEO case in district court and then entered a settlement that included a provision requiring retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that Ms. Maglietti's decision to settle her sex discrimination lawsuit with the DVA was not the product of coercion. In the settlement agreement, she acknowledged that she was "freely signing this Settlement Agreement without reservation, duress, or coercion on the part of [the DVA] or any other party." When she entered into the settlement agreement, she had a jury verdict in her favor, but that verdict would have been overturned if the court had granted the agency's JMOL motion. Ms. Maglietti had a choice: She could keep her job but risk that the district court would grant <span id="Page_2024"></span>the DVA's JMOL motion. Or, at her option, she could accept payment in satisfaction of her claim and retire from her position with the DVA. She chose the latter. The fact that an employee is faced with a choice between two options, both of which she regards as unpleasant, does not make the ultimate decision inherently involuntary. <span class="Italic">Staats,</span> 99 F.3d at 1125; <span class="Italic">Covington v. Dep't of Health and Human Servs.,</span> 750 F.2d 937, 942 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board stated its disinclination to find a retirement involuntary when discriminatory actions can be independently challenged, <span class="Italic">Morris v. NASA</span>, AT-0752-15-0015-I-1 (NP 8/19/2015) (still noting a challenge may lie to the retirement resulting from the failure of an agency to accommodate a disability):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Further, even assuming he may have had a viable discrimination claim, he has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that a reasonable person would have been compelled to retire instead of challenging the alleged discrimination or other improper agency actions through available procedures. <span class="Italic">See Axsom v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 605, &#x00B6; 17 (2009) (finding that the appellant failed to establish that a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign because the appellant had the option to stand and fight the alleged discrimination, harassment, and retaliation rather than resign); <span class="Italic">see also Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1329 (finding that a resignation would not be involuntary if the employee had a choice whether to resign or contest the validity of the agency action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Discrimination may extend to protections other than the civil rights acts. The Board should have adjudicated a claim in a forced retirement appeal that depended on a USERRA violation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jolley v. MSPB</span>, 636 Fed. Appx. 567 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP).</p>
