<h2 class="h2" id="sec13-65"><span class="space">III.</span> INDIVIDUAL RIGHT OF ACTION</h2>
<p class="Body-Text">As a result of the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act amendments to the Reform Act, the Board acquired jurisdiction over a class of cases known as "Individual Right of Action" (IRA) appeals. Under 5 USC 1221(a), an IRA appeal may be taken to the Board as to any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) (whistleblowing), after a complaint of whistleblowing reprisal is first made with the Office of Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tucker v. DHHS</span>, 73 MSPR 278, 282 (1997). The WPA is meant to further the merit system principle at 5 USC 2301(b)(9), calling for protection of employees against reprisal for whistleblowing activities. The WPA also advances the government-wide standard of conduct, 5 CFR 2635.101(b)(11) (2022), that "[e]mployees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities." The WPA was modified by the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act to add to 5 USC 1221(a) a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), earlier discussed. IRA appeals may include awards of damages against agencies and other remedial actions applied in most otherwise appealable actions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Oram v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP), explained how an IRA case is taken to MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the Board to exercise jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must exhaust all administrative remedies at the Office of Special Counsel--unless the appellant has a right to appeal directly to the Board--and make a non-frivolous allegation that (1) the appellant made a protected disclosure or engaged in a protected activity and (2) the disclosure or activity contributed to the agency's decision to take a personnel action. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a)-(b); <span class="Italic">Hessami v. MSPB</span>, 979 F.3d 1362, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2020).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Traynor v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 386, 389-90 (1994), outlines the elements of an IRA case initiated through OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) He engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, he disclosed information he reasonably believed <span id="Page_3756"></span>evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or substantial and specific danger to public health or safety; (2) the agency took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a "personnel action" as defined in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2) after the July 9, 1989 effective date of the WPA; and (3) he raised the whistleblower issue before the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), and proceedings before OSC have been exhausted. <span class="Italic">See White v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 90, 94 (1994); <span class="Italic">Geyer v. Department of Justice</span>, 63 MSPR 13, 16-17 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that he had a reasonable belief that his disclosure met the criteria of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), an appellant need not prove that the condition reported established gross mismanagement or any of the other situations detailed under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii). Rather, the employee must show that the matter reported was one which a reasonable person in his position would believe evidenced gross mismanagement or any of the other situations specified in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Geyer</span>, at 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the appellant establishes that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal, the merits of the appeal must then be addressed. That is, the administrative judge or the Board must determine whether the appellant has proven, by preponderant evidence, that a disclosure described in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action that was taken against him. If the employee is successful in making such a showing, corrective action must be ordered unless the agency demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action absent the protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>, at 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency based its 1-day suspension action upon three instances "of off duty misconduct of such significance that there [was] an adverse effect upon the [agency]."[4] The agency's action, a 1-day suspension, clearly constitutes a personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2), and it was effective subsequent to the effective date of the WPA. Further, the appellant raised this matter before OSC, and that office has terminated its investigation. The administrative judge also correctly found that the appellant made a protected disclosure. Therefore, the appellant established jurisdiction over this IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The administrative judge found that the appellant had engaged in all of the charged misconduct, but for the alleged failure to cooperate with the security police. The administrative judge made this factual analysis pursuant to his adjudication of the issue of whether the agency had shown, by clear and convincing evidence, that it would have taken the same action even absent the appellant's whistleblowing activity. We have held, however, that the Board does not have general jurisdiction to decide the merits of the underlying personnel action from which an IRA complaint stems, except to the extent that they are relevant or material to the appellant's allegation of retaliation for whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 MSPR 632, 638 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table). Here, we find that the merits of the suspension action are not relevant or material to the appellant's whistleblowing allegation. Thus, we vacate the administrative judge's analysis and findings with regard to the merits of the suspension action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kaeseman v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 236, 239 (1994) (summarizing IRA requirements and noting: "The administrative judge thus erroneously implied that whether the whistleblowing activity was a contributing factor in the personnel action was a jurisdictional issue, whereas, as set forth above, it goes to the merits of an IRA appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There are many IRA cases brought to the Board and to the Federal Circuit. Many are dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, typically when the Board makes a preliminary determination that the activity complained of was not a protected disclosure or, if it was, an OSC complaint was not filed or did not correctly describe the disclosure or the resultant personnel action. A few appellants succeed in their efforts to reverse the effects of whistleblowing reprisal. Their appeals are discussed in the sections that follow. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Russell v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 317 (1997) (reversing a demotion); <span class="Italic">Brewer v. Dept. of Interior,</span> 76 MSPR 363 (1997) (requiring revision of a performance rating); <span class="Italic">Bonggat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 402 (1993) (reassignment and removal were overturned based on a finding of reprisal against the appellant's report of appointment irregularities). There are a few other cases involving successful IRA appellants who prevailed either through initial decisions involving PFRs that were summarily denied, or through settlement agreements, and later, published decisions, that involved collateral claims arising from the underlying IRA cases. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pastor v. VA</span>, 87 MSPR 320, 321 &#x00B6; 3 (2000) (reviewing award of counsel fees and travel costs); <span class="Italic">Roman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 72 MSPR 409 (1996) (reviewing motion for counsel fees and consequential damages). WPA burdens of proof were successfully employed to reverse adverse actions in several appeals. <span class="Italic">Miller v. VA,</span> 92 MSPR 610 (2002) (reversing suspensions and demotions involving two appellants); <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army,</span> 56 MSPR 371 (1993) (reversing a suspension); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v.

Because the WPA was designed to encourage whistleblowing by federal employees and to protect their careers from reprisals when they make protected disclosures, disclosures made after retirement are not protected. <span class="Italic">Alferos v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's corrective action authority over IRA cases was expanded by a 1994 statute amending the Whistleblower Protection Act, Pub. L. 103-424. <span class="Italic">Scott v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 211, 228, 238 (1995) (interpreting Act of October 29, 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-424, &#x00A7; 4(b), 1994 USCCAN (108 Stat.) 4361, 4363 (codified as amended at 5 USC 1221(e)(1) (1994))), discussed procedural changes brought about by the 1994 amendments. As explained in <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, the changes included the "'<span class="Italic">per se</span>' rule that an employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure, and the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action." <span class="Italic">Scott</span> held that the procedural changes were retroactive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In its 1989 <span class="Italic">Annual Report</span>, the Board summarized the changes brought about by the IRA provisions of the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act expands Board jurisdiction by providing a new individual right of action for whistleblowers. Under the CSRA and subsequent OPM regulations, the type of action being appealed and the eligibility of the individual (employee, former employee, or applicant for employment) to appeal the particular action determines whether the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. An action is appealable to the Board if the appeal is authorized by any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the individual right of action provision of the Whistleblower Protection Act, however, it is the allegation that an action was based on the individual's whistleblowing that determines the appeal right to the Board. Since the individual right of action applies with respect to any personnel action that may be the subject of a prohibited personnel practice complaint to the Special Counsel, and to any individual who is covered under the prohibited personnel practices statute [<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 2302(a)], the new law permits appeals to the Board of actions that were not previously appealable, and appeals from individuals that did not previously have appeal rights, if the individual alleges that the action was based on whistleblowing and the other requirements of the individual right of action provision are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this right, a Federal employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may appeal a personnel action allegedly based on whistleblowing to the Board if he or she first files a complaint with the Special Counsel, and the Special Counsel does not seek corrective action from the Board on his or her behalf. Previously, an individual subject to a personnel action allegedly based on whistleblowing, that was not otherwise appealable to the Board, had no recourse if the Special Counsel did not act on his or her behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that the individual seek the Special Counsel's assistance first applies only with respect to personnel actions that are not appealable to the Board under any other law, rule, or regulation. If the action is appealable to the Board, the individual may appeal directly to the Board, regardless of whether whistleblowing is an issue in the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act's provisions applying to these individual right of action cases permit a whistleblower to seek corrective action from the Board within 60 days after being provided notice by the Special Counsel that the investigation of the whistleblower's complaint is being terminated. The whistleblower may also appeal to the Board if 120 days have passed since filing the complaint with the Special Counsel and the Special Counsel has not notified the individual that the office will seek corrective action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act includes a number of procedural protections for whistleblowers. After an individual exercises the right to appeal to the Board, the Special Counsel may not seek corrective action without the individual's consent. A whistleblower appealing to the Board under the individual right of action provision may ask the Board to stay the personnel action. The Board's normal time limits for completion of discovery may be waived to ensure that the whistleblower has sufficient time to obtain needed information. In adjudicating an individual right of action appeal, the Board may not consider a decision by the Special Counsel to terminate an investigation of the whistleblower's complaint. The Board must order corrective action if the individual demonstrates that his or her whistleblowing was "a contributing factor" in the personnel action, unless the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in the absence of the individual's whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act also makes the individual right of action provisions applicable to adverse action appeals to the Board. Since adverse actions are directly appealable to the Board, of course, there is no requirement that the appellant seek corrective action from the Special Counsel first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3757"></span>The Act also amends the statutory definition of the prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8)--taking or failing to take an action based on whistleblowing--to include threatening to take or not take an action. The words "because of" are substituted for "as a reprisal for" before the word "whistleblowing" so that the motivation of the official taking the action need not be established. As a limitation on covered disclosures, the word "gross" is added before "mismanagement" so that the remedies do not become available to individuals who make disclosures of trivial matters.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's FY 2012 Annual Report says of the effect of the 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA contains the most significant changes to whistleblower protections in almost two decades. This legislation amends the WPA to expand the scope of protected disclosures to include disclosures made to the alleged wrongdoer, disclosures that were previously known, and disclosures made in the normal course of duties. In addition, the WPEA does not permit exclusion from coverage based on the motive for the disclosure or its timing, and the exclusion of claims based on disagreements with policy determinations was narrowed greatly. The law also protects the disclosure of "any" violation of any law, rule, or regulation, and adds &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D) to the covered actions over which the Board has appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In essence the IRA is an appeal brought under 5 USC 1221 by an individual seeking corrective action of a personnel action that was either threatened or taken as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b)(8). In <span class="Italic">Harper v. VA</span>, 68 MSPR 594, 602 (1995), the Board stated: "To establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, an appellant must show by preponderant evidence that: (1) He engaged in whistleblower activity by making a disclosure protected under 5 USC 2302(b)(8); (2) the agency took or failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take, a personnel action under 5 USC 2302(a)(2); and (3) he raised the whistleblower issue before OSC, and OSC proceedings have been exhausted." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 447, 455 (1997) (restating the requirements in an IRA appeal by an ALJ); <span class="Italic">Briley v. Nat'l Archives and Records Admin.</span>, 71 MSPR 211, 219 (1996) (adding, at n.3, that the appellant must show by a preponderance of the evidence that she made protected disclosures); <span class="Italic">Bump v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 64 MSPR 326, 332 (1994) ("An appellant is not required to prove jurisdiction to entitle him to a hearing; he need only make a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal."); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 321, 323 (1993) (if the action taken to the Board is not within its ordinary appellate jurisdiction, to establish the Board's jurisdiction over an IRA appeal, the appellant must show that he has raised the matter with OSC, that proceedings before OSC have been exhausted, and that he is appealing from a personnel action taken after the effective date of the WPA). <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/RUSIN_MARK_S_CH_1221_00_0028_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_250380.pdf">92 MSPR 298</a> (2002) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-20-089.html#sec13-81"><span class="Italic">Rusin</span> Model: Nonfrivolous Allegations Establish Jurisdiction; <span class="Italic">Hessami</span></a>"), simplified the jurisdictional analysis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The IRA jurisdiction being limited to a determination of the existence of whistleblowing reprisal, collateral matters such as harmful error, or EEO defenses, are not directly part of the appeal. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DOJ,</span> 104 MSPR 624, 639 &#x00B6; 31, 2007 MSPB 42 (2007) ("IRA appeals under the WPA are not subject to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 or &#x00A7; 7702, however. Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the merits of the personnel action at issue in an IRA appeal and lacks the authority to decide, in conjunction with an IRA appeal, the merits of an appellant's affirmative defenses. <span class="Italic">Marren v. Department of Justice</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 632, 638-39 (1991), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 980 F.2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (Table); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Department of Defense</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 666, 674 (1994) (Board found that it lacked jurisdiction to decide a harmful error claim in the context of an IRA appeal)."). Although the Board states it lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits of, e.g., an adverse action in an IRA appeal (it only being able to determine whether the action resulted from whistleblowing reprisal), in practice a merits determination is made as part of the IRA analysis, involving assessment of the strength of the case or assessment of the agency's "clear and convincing" defense to the appeal, matters subsequently discussed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's WPA jurisdiction, statutorily defined, must be independently assessed by the AJ reviewing the case; jurisdiction is not established by an agency concession. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 539, 555 (1994), <span class="Italic">reaff'd on reconsideration</span>, <span class="Italic">Heining v. GSA</span>, 68 MSPR 513 (1995) ("[t]he agency's concession that the appellant's disclosures were protected under the WPA did not relieve the administrative judge from the obligation of making her own determination regarding whether they were protected under the statute.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Often when the AJ receives an IRA appeal, in addition to the acknowledgment order (or as a part of it) the AJ will issue a separate order that essentially requires the appellant to submit evidence and argument demonstrating jurisdiction. Essentially the Board is issuing its own motion to dismiss, a process that immediately places it into an adversarial relationship with the appellant in the interest of an early jurisdictional determination. AJs' jurisdictional orders will often effectively preclude discovery and even preclude a reply to the agency response to the order. Counsel must monitor these orders carefully and object to them to the extent necessary to secure adjudicatory due process and avoid waiver of objections if a PFR must be filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">IRA claims, like other appeals, can be waived or compromised through settlements. Although a grievance did not bar an IRA claim before the Board, a broadly based settlement of the grievance that "fully resolves any and all matters related" to the issues presented in the grievance could bar Board jurisdiction because the settlement may be deemed to waive a Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laity v. VA</span>, 61 MSPR 256, 261-62 (1994) [discussed in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-116.html#sec2-114">Moot, Withdrawn, and Waived Appeals</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-208.html#sec2-205">Affirmative Defense Order; Requirement of Specific Allegations</a>"; refer to <a href="0100-2023-15-102.html#sec8-101">Chapter 16</a> for settlements; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-100.html#sec1-99">Jurisdictional Issue</a>," concerning statutory remedial election requirements effective after <span class="Italic">Laity</span>; refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-123.html#sec2-121">Settlement</a>."]</p>
