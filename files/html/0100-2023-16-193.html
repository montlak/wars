<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-193"><span class="space">3.</span> Scope of Representation During Investigation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although a union is given a statutory right to participate in formal discussions concerning conditions of employment, it may not usurp the process. The union may ask questions and propose resolutions and remedies; it may not dictate answers or take charge of the proceedings. <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 7 FLRA 371, 387 (1981) (ALJ Decision). Management may have a need to place reasonable limits on the right of the representative to participate during an examination of an employee, to prevent an adversarial confrontation with the representative and to achieve the objective of the examination. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 9 FLRA 458, 474 (1982) (ALJ Decision). But the employer may not preclude representational assistance during a portion of an investigatory interview, e.g., during a portion of the interview that is to be recorded. Despite the employer's interest in getting a good recording, there must be some allowance for interruption by way of comments concerning the form of questions or statements as to possible infringement of employee rights. The employer retains the option to refrain from conducting the examination should it decide that the interview in the presence of a union representative is not efficacious. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region VII, Los Angeles and NTEU</span>, 5 FLRA 297, 307 (1981). On the matter of recording, although a union is privileged to assist an employee during an investigatory interview, the union may not frustrate the interview by insisting, contrary to agency policy, that the union be permitted to record the session. <span class="Italic">INS, San Diego and AFGE</span>, 13 FLRA 591, 605 (1984) (ALJ Decision).</p>
<p class="noindent">An employer commits a ULP by directing the union representative to be silent during the investigatory meeting. The right to representation encompasses the right of the representative to take an "active part" in the defense of the employee. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Safford and AFGE Local 2313</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 440 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Defense Criminal Investigative Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93, 100 (3d Cir. 1988), the court cited Justice Brennan's description of the role of a representative during an investigation, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">from</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251, 260 (1975):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The employer has no duty to bargain with the union representative at an investigatory interview.&#x2003;"The representative is present to assist the employee, and may attempt to clarify the facts or suggest other employees who may have knowledge of them. The employer, however, is free to insist that he is only interested, at that time, in hearing the employee's own account of the matters under investigation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A single employee confronted by an employer investigating whether certain conduct deserves discipline may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors. A knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by eliciting favorable facts, and save the employer production time by getting to the bottom of the incident occasioning the interview. Certainly his presence need not transform the interview into an adversary contest.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU Chap. 208</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-22.html">65 FLRA 79</a>, 84-87 (2010), involving representation during a security clearance interview, affirmed an arbitrator's determination that the agency unduly restricted the role of the union representative during the interview by precluding the representative from counseling the employee about particular questions before answers were provided:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that "the purposes underlying [&#x00A7;] 7114(a)(2)(B) can be achieved only by allowing a union representative to take an active role in assisting a unit employee in presenting facts in his or her defense." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Office of Internal Affairs, Wash., D.C. &#x0026; Phx., Ariz.</span>, 52 FLRA 421, 432 (1996) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (<span class="Italic">Internal Affairs</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 50 FLRA at 607)). "A union representative's right to take an 'active role' includes not only the right to assist the employee in presenting facts but also the right to consult with the employee[.]" <span class="Italic">Internal Affairs</span>, 52 FLRA at 432-33. In this connection, the Authority has held that "for the right to representation to be meaningful, the representative must have freedom to assist, and consult with, the affected employee." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 433 (citation omitted). This is consistent with <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, where the Court stated that: "[a] single employee confronted by an employer investigating whether <span id="Page_1428"></span>certain conduct deserves discipline may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors[;]" and "[a] knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by eliciting favorable facts[.]" <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 262-63.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, "a union's representational rights under [&#x00A7;] 7114(a)(2)(B) may not interfere with an employer's legitimate interest and prerogative in achieving the objective of the examination or compromise its integrity." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 50 FLRA at 607 (citing <span class="Italic">FAA, New Eng. Region, Burlington, Mass.</span>, 35 FLRA 645, 652 (1990)). In <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, the Court, in summarizing the Board's litigative position, stated that an employer "is free to insist that he is only interested, at that time, in hearing the employee's own account of the matter under investigation." 420 U.S. at 260.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This wording from <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>has been interpreted as being "directed toward avoiding a bargaining session or a purely adversary confrontation with the union representative and to assure the employer the opportunity to hear the employee's own account of the incident under investigation." <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Texaco</span>, 659 F.2d 124, 126 (9th Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Texaco</span>). Thus, where a union representative disrupts an interview by engaging in interruptions that are "verbally abusive" and "arrogantly insulting," an employer does not violate <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights by limiting the representative's participation. <span class="Italic">Yellow Freight Sys., Inc.</span>, 317 NLRB 115, 124 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Yellow Freight</span>) (representative "not entitled to disrupt the process by verbally abusive and arrogantly insulting interruptions, by conduct that grossly demeaned [an individual's] managerial status in front of an employee and fellow manager and that consisted of violent desk pounding and shouted obscenities, and finally by point-blank falsely calling [an individual] a liar and...refusing to immediately leave the office."). In addition, an employer does not violate <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights when it limits the union representative's participation after the representative has counseled an employee to answer a question only once and has prevented the employer from questioning the employee by engaging in persistent objections and interruptions. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">N.J. Bell Tel. Co.</span>, 308 NLRB 277 (1992)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority has rejected the position that an employer is entitled to question an employee without <span class="Italic">any </span>interruptions or intervention by the union representative. For example, in <span class="Italic">United States Customs Service, Region VII, Los Angeles, California</span>, 5 FLRA 297 (1981), the Authority adopted a judge's decision in which the judge rejected an argument that an investigator "was entitled to obtain a statement from the employee without interruption from her representative." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 307. Specifically, the judge held that "some interruption, by way of comments re[garding] the form of questions or statements as to possible infringement of employee rights, should properly be expected from the employee's representative." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In this connection, "[t]he employer always retains the option to refrain from conducting the examination in the event it decides that the interview, in the presence of a union representative, is not efficacious." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>In addition, the judge found that even prohibiting the union representative from "pass[ing] notes" to the employee during the interview would impermissibly "circumscribe[&#8197;] the effectiveness of the representative." <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority reached a similar conclusion in <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 9 FLRA 458 (1982). In that decision, the Authority adopted the judge's finding of a <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>violation where, by intimidating the employees and attempting to silence their union representatives, the investigator interfered with protected rights. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 473. The judge found a <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>violation despite the fact that the stewards continued to object, counsel and confer with the unit employees after being told to remain quiet. <span class="Italic">Id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that meaningful representation includes the right to make statements that are part of the official record. In this connection, even where a representative has been permitted to confer with an employee and make statements "off the record," the Authority has found no "meaningful representation[&#8197;]" where there was no indication that off-the-record statements would be considered in making a final determination regarding discipline. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Jackson, Miss.</span>, 48 FLRA 787, 798, 799 (1993), <span class="Italic">on recon. </span>49 FLRA 171, <span class="Italic">recon. denied</span>, 49 FLRA 701 (1994) (<span class="Italic">VAMC Jackson</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board has reached similar conclusions regarding a representative's right to actively participate in an investigatory interview. Specifically, the Board has held that an employer's "right to regulate the role of the representative at the interview...cannot exceed that which is necessary to ensure the 'reasonable prevention of such a collective-bargaining or adversary confrontation with the statutory representative.'" <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 288 NLRB 864, 867 (1988) (citation omitted) (<span class="Italic">USPS</span>). The principle that the employer may regulate the role of the union representative "does not state that the employer may bar the union representative from any participation[,]" which would be "wholly contrary to other language in the <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>opinion which explains that the representative should be able to take an active role in assisting the employee to present the facts." <span class="Italic">Texaco</span>, 659 F.2d at 126. Accordingly, the Board has found a <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>violation when an interviewer silenced the union representative whenever the representative interrupted the interviewer's questioning of the employee. <span class="Italic">USPS</span>, 288 NLRB at 868. <span class="Italic">See also San Antonio Portland Cement Co.</span>, 277 NLRB 338, 339 (1985) (employer violated <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights by "cut[ting] off [union representative's] attempt to elicit information from employee and telling representative that he was "merely [present] as a witness and was not supposed to speak[&#8197;]"); <span class="Italic">Greyhound Lines, Inc.</span>, 273 NLRB 1443, 1448 (1985) (employer violated <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights by telling union representative that he must remain silent during interview); <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 254 NLRB 703, 707 (1981) (employer violated <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights where union representative was "not permitted to consult with nor counsel [the employee] in any way or to make any utterance <span class="Italic">during the questioning</span>[&#8197;]") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, allowing the Union representative to counsel the employee while questions were pending was necessary to afford meaningful representation, particularly given the Arbitrator's finding that, once the employee had answered the question without assistance from the Union representative, he could not "further answer the question[.]" In this connection, as stated previously, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) allows a union representative to "take an active role in <span class="Italic">assisting a unit employee in presenting facts </span>in his or her defense.'" <span class="Italic">Internal Affairs</span>, 52 FLRA at 432 (emphasis added). This is consistent with the policies underlying <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, which, as stated above, include the considerations that an employee "may be too fearful or inarticulate to relate accurately the incident being investigated, or too ignorant to raise extenuating factors[,]" and that "[a] knowledgeable union representative could assist the employer by <span class="Italic">eliciting favorable facts</span>[.]" <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, 420 U.S. at 263 (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">Accord Texaco</span>, 659 F.2d at 126 (representative entitled to "take an active role in <span class="Italic">assisting the employee to present the facts[</span><span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">]</span>") (emphasis added). In addition, as stated previously, there is no "meaningful representation[&#8197;]" when there is no indication that statements made by an employee with a union representative's assistance will be part of the official record that the employer considers in deciding whether discipline is warranted. <span class="Italic">VAMC Jackson</span>, 48 FLRA at 799.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By not allowing the Union representative to counsel the employee before he answered questions, and then precluding the employee from adding to his answers after he had answered them without assistance, the Agency did not allow the Union representative to assist the employee in presenting facts in his own defense. Any counseling that the Agency permitted after the answers were completed did not preserve the Union representative's ability to provide meaningful representation to the employee, as required by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that it did not impose limitations on the Union representative until the representative "substantially interfered with" the Agency's "right and interest in obtaining spontaneous answers" from the employee. However, the Union argues that the evidence was disputed with respect to whether the Agency imposed the limitations prior to, or during, the interview, and that, in either case, "the majority of the interview was clearly conducted under" the restrictions imposed by the Agency. The Arbitrator did not make a factual finding that the Agency imposed its restrictions only after the start of the interview or after the Union representative interrupted the questioning. In addition, the Agency asserts that it is "not challenging the Arbitrator's factual determination[s]" regarding the interview. Accordingly, there is no basis for the Authority to make a factual finding, not present in the award, that the Agency imposed the limitations only after the Union representative substantially interfered with the questioning.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that the Agency imposed the limitations only after the Union representative intervened in some manner, the Agency's allegations regarding the nature of the alleged interventions do not support finding that the Union representative engaged in impermissible conduct during the interview. According to the Agency, the Union representative "directed the employee's attention to text in documents by pointing[,]" and also engaged in "trying to stop [the employee] from answering questions, leaning over and cupping his hand, and whispering in [the employee's] ear and trying to actually answer questions for [the employee]." However, the Agency does not corroborate this claim with any specific examples, and the Arbitrator did not make any findings that the representative acted as alleged. With regard to pointing to documents, the Union acknowledges that this occurred "at one point during the examination," but states that the document had been written by the employee himself and that the Union representative pointed to it only to "tr[y] to remind [the employee] to discuss a particular fact so that [he] could provide a more complete answer." With regard to whispering in the employee's ear, the Union acknowledges that the Union representative whispered "advice" because he was "trying to ensure his answer's more complete; correct; accurate; and, more importantly, favorable aspects that he was not completely answering" would be mentioned.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These circumstances provide no basis for finding that the Union representative: engaged in interruptions that were "verbally abusive" <span id="Page_1429"></span>and "arrogantly insulting," <span class="Italic">Yellow Freight</span>, 317 NLRB at 124; counseled the employee to answer questions only once, <span class="Italic">id.</span>; prevented the Agency from questioning the employee by engaging in persistent objections and interruptions, <span class="Italic">id.</span>; or attempted to convert the interview into "a bargaining session or a purely adversary confrontation[.]" <span class="Italic">Texaco</span>, 659 F.2d at 126. In addition, although the Union representative attempted to assist the employee in answering questions, he did not preclude the Agency from "hear[ing] the employee's own account of the incident under investigation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Further, as discussed previously, given the fact that the employee was not permitted to elaborate upon his initial answers to the Agency's questions, the only opportunity that the Union representative had to meaningfully elicit favorable facts from the employee was while questions were pending. Finally, <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 707 F.2d 574, cited by the Agency, does not support setting aside the Arbitrator's finding of a violation, as that decision did not involve <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>rights under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Section 7106 of the Statute </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the finding of a <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>violation is contrary to management's rights to determine internal security practices and discipline employees under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute. However, the Authority has stated that &#x00A7; 7106 "cannot be read as being so dominant that it negates congressionally-mandated, fundamental rights found in other parts of the Statute[,]" including "the <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>right to representation under [&#x00A7;] 7114(a)(2)(B)." <span class="Italic">Prisons</span>, 55 FLRA at 1259 n.14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we have denied the exceptions to the Arbitrator's finding of a <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>violation, finding that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7106 would effectively "negate[&#8197;]" the finding of that violation. <span class="Italic">Id. NRC</span>, 25 F.3d 229, cited by the Agency, is inapposite because it involved an issue regarding whether proposals conflicted with the Inspector General Act, not &#x00A7; 7106 or &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. For these reasons, and consistent with <span class="Italic">Prisons</span>, we deny the Agency's exceptions regarding &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute.</p>

It is clear from the legislative history that this statutory requirement is intended to provide rights to Federal sector bargaining unit employees consistent with those provided in the private sector by the National Labor Relations Board (Board) in interpreting and applying the National Labor Relations Act and the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board v. J</span>. <span class="Italic">Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251 (1974) (<span class="Italic">Weingarten). See</span> 124 Cong.

<p class="noindent-1">In accordance with the principles embodied in <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span>, the Authority has consistently held that the purposes underlying section 7114(a)(2)(B) can be achieved only by allowing a union representative to take an active role in assisting a unit employee in presenting facts in his or her defense. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Department of Justice</span>, <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, Safford, Arizona</span>, 35 FLRA 431, 440 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Safford</span>). Thus, the Authority found an unfair labor practice in <span class="Italic">Safford</span> when a union representative was told to remain silent at an examination<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. This pronouncement is in line with the Authority's longstanding position finding an investigator's unduly aggressive and intimidating behavior during an investigative interview to be unlawful. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 9 FLRA 458 (1982).

Federal Aviation Administration, New England Region</span>, <span class="Italic">Burlington, Massachusetts</span>, 35 FLRA 645, 652 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has recognized that section 7114(a)(2)(B) rights have their origin in private sector labor law, and in interpreting the Statute, has looked to the Board's development of the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, New York District Office, New York, New York</span>, 46 FLRA 1210, 1218-21 (1993) (<span class="Italic">INS District Office</span>), <span class="Italic">rev. denied sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1917 v.

In this regard, the Board has, on several occasions, addressed the role of a union representative at a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board has found unfair labor practices when a union representative was prevented from actively participating in an investigatory interview.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">National Labor Relations Board </span>v. <span class="Italic">Texaco, Inc.</span>, 659 F.2d 124, 126-27 (9th Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Texaco</span>), the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a Board finding of an unfair labor practice, and held that by relegating the union representative "to the role of a passive observer" the company did not afford the employee the representation to which he was entitled. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 288 NLRB 864, 868 (1988) (<span class="Italic">Postal Service I</span>), the Board found a violation where the union representative was frustrated in his attempts to assist a unit employee because the interviewer expected that the union representative's role be comparable to that of a witness rather than a participant and therefore silenced the union representative whenever he interrupted the interviewer's questioning of the employee. Finally, the Board found a violation in <span class="Italic">Greyhound Lines, Inc.</span>, 273 NLRB 1443, 1448 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Greyhound</span>) where an interrogator advised a union representative at the commencement of an interview that "although he could be present as a witness he would have to remain silent and not participate."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Board, however, reached a different conclusion in <span class="Italic">United States Postal Service</span>, 303 NLRB 463 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Postal Service II</span>), a case presenting somewhat similar facts as are present in the instant case. There, a bargaining unit employee was the subject of an investigatory examination. Before the union representative arrived, an investigator informed the employee that the representative "would be present only as a witness and instructed [the employee] not to speak to nor look at the union representative...." <span id="Page_1430"></span><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 470. The Board affirmed the ALJ's finding that no violation had occurred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Postal Service II</span> ALJ noted that the union representative "expressed herself on several occasions during the interview on [the employee's] behalf, and the postal inspectors listened to her, and interrupted her only after they understood the point she was making<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. The ALJ found that "even though (the union representative] was instructed to be seated behind the employee in a chair away from the table, whenever it became necessary for her to inspect [the employee's] ledger book which was on the table, she stood up and walked to the table so she could better observe the particular part of the ledger book that the postal inspector was referring to, and the postal inspectors did not object to her doing so<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Finding that under certain circumstances the pre-interview admonition to the employee "might very well constitute a violation of Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, insofar as it was reasonably calculated to interfere with [the employee's] right to [the union representative's] participation in the interview," the ALJ nevertheless determined that in this case no violation had occurred because "[the union representative], without objection, was permitted to participate in the interview on [the employees] behalf and in fact did participate on his behalf...<span class="Italic">." Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Application of the Case Law</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that NASA, OIG investigator Dill's conduct of the examination of employee P prevented union representative Tays from actively participating in the examination, in violation of the Statute and Authority precedent. <span class="Italic">See Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 440. As the Statute and the above case law indicate, the Authority has uniformly held that a union representative must be given the opportunity to actively participate in an examination of a unit employee conducted pursuant to section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. In this case, it is clear from the outset of the examination that Dill prevented Tays from playing an active role in the examination. He established intrusive ground rules which relegated Tays to the role of a mere "witness" at the examination. When Tays objected to the nature of the ground rules, Dill reiterated them, and threatened to cancel the examination and move it to another location if Tays did not comply with his rules. Dill's actions in this case were attempts to preclude representative Tays from actively participating in the interview and thus run afoul of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the Statute was violated, we have considered the fact that Tays disregarded Dill's ground rules and, at least to some extent, participated in P's examination. However, we find that the statutory violation occurred when the overly restrictive ground rules were announced.[6] An attempt to restrict the union's role at a section 7114(a)(2)(B) examination to that of a witness is not in accordance with the Statute or the decisions of the Authority. We agree with the Judge's conclusion that it is immaterial whether Tays, in fact, was able to fulfill his statutory responsibilities, as an agency cannot impose unduly restrictive limitations on a union representative and later seek to escape responsibility by taking advantage of the representative's conduct under the circumstances. Were the agency so entitled, a union representative would be placed in the untenable position of either complying with the ground rules, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Safford</span>, 35 FLRA at 431, and thereby failing to fulfill the exclusive representative's statutory responsibilities, or objecting to the ground rules, thus subjecting the representative to charges of disruption or insubordination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;In response to Tays' objection, had Dill withdrawn or properly revised the ground rules to permit active representation, a different case would be presented. Instead, however, the violation was exacerbated by Dill's reiteration of the ground rules in responding to Tays' objection.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding Tays' attempts at representation during the interview, we find that the imposition of overly restrictive ground rules and the manner in which this interview was conducted had a chilling effect upon the union's exercise of its rights under section 7114(a)(2)(B). Tays testified that the union had no role and that at times P would not listen to him, instead listening only to his attorney.[8] Contrary to the Respondent NASA, OIG's exceptions, we do not find these to be the mere subjective perceptions of representative Tays; rather, we conclude that Dill's insistence upon imposing the restrictive ground rules he announced would reasonably tend to have a coercive or intimidating impact upon any individual seeking to represent an exclusive representative. Additionally, bargaining unit members who become aware of the manner in which this examination was conducted could reasonably conclude that requesting union representation pursuant to section 7114(a)(2)(B) would be futile.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The union's interest at a section 7114(a)(2)(B) examination is not vindicated by the presence of an employee's private counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1941, AFL-CIO v.

Circuit suggested in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> that the record did not support a violation because the union representative admitted that there was nothing else that he "wanted to do or planned on doing that [he] couldn't do" in representing the unit employee at the examination. The record testimony distinguishes this case. Here, Tays testified that during the examination: the OIG agents had "run the meeting the way they wanted; the union had no role"; the conditions "really affected me" and the way P reacted to Tays' questions or comments; and the atmosphere was "chilling," "an oppressive environment."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the Statute was violated in this case, we have considered the NLRB's <span class="Italic">Postal Service II</span> decision wherein the Board found no statutory impropriety under somewhat similar circumstances. There are significant factual variances which distinguish the two cases and justify different results. In <span class="Italic">Postal Service II</span>, the pre-interview rules imposed restrictions on the <span class="Italic">employee's</span> participation at the examination and were announced prior to the union representative's arrival; as a result, the union representative presumably was unaware of the ground rules. In contrast, in this case, the ground rules restricted the <span class="Italic">union</span> <span class="Italic">representative's</span> participation in the examination and were read to the union representative at the examination. Moreover, when Tays attempted to explain his role and to clarify the ground rules, investigator Dill ignored his plea, reiterated the ground rules, and threatened to cancel the examination and move it to another location. In <span class="Italic">Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service II</span>, the examiner listened to the representative and did not interrupt her until the point she was making was understood. This conduct of an interrogation is contrasted with Dill's view that Tays' request to see documents was a "distinct interruption of the interview process" and with Dill's understanding of the limited role Tays played as a witness--he was "just there."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, finding a violation in this case is entirely consistent with the Board's holdings in <span class="Italic">Texaco</span>, <span class="Italic">Postal Service I</span>, and <span class="Italic">Greyhound</span>, discussed above. In each of those cases, as here, the Board held that a union representative was illegally relegated to the role of a silent or passive observer or witness.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 171</span>, 52 FLRA 421, 432-38 (1996), explained that, although circumstances may require, the law does not provide an absolute entitlement to private conferences between an employee and his union representative outside the room where an examination is conducted:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(2)(B) contains no mention of an employee's right to confer privately with a union representative, either with or without the investigator present, during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. Therefore, if such a right exists, it must logically exist as a consequence of the basic right to union representation that section 7114(a)(2)(B) does guarantee. "[T]he Authority has consistently held that the purposes underlying section 7114(a)(2)(B) can be achieved only by allowing a union representative to take an active role in assisting a unit employee in presenting facts in his or her defense." <span class="Italic">Headquarters, National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 50 FLRA 601, 607 (1995)....&#8197;A union representative's right to take an "active role" includes not only the right to assist the employee in presenting facts but also the right to consult with the employee: "We have long held that for the right to representation to be meaningful, the representative must have freedom to assist, and consult with, the affected employee." <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Jackson</span>, <span class="Italic">Mississippi</span>, 48 FLRA 787, 799 (1993)<span class="Italic">.

<p class="noindent-1">The only Authority decision addressing the issue of private conferences between an employee and a union representative during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination is <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> [46 FLRA 1526 (1993)]. In <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, the Authority adopted, without specifically addressing, the Judge's conclusion that the respondent violated the Statute by refusing a request that an employee and his union representative be permitted to leave the interview room and consult in private during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination. According to the Judge, the investigator "stated that [the union representative] could speak to [the employee] in the room, but he and [the employee] could not have any 'private conferences'" and could not "confer privately outside of the room where the questioning occurred." <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span>, 46 FLRA at 1565. The Judge concluded that the investigator violated the Statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">There is no indication in the record that a brief conference between the Union representative and the employee outside the hearing of the investigator would have been unduly disruptive, would have interfered with the objective of the examination, or would <span id="Page_1431"></span>have compromised the integrity of the investigation. Indeed, based on the Union representatives' purpose in wanting two brief conferences, the knowledgeable union representative could have assisted the investigator "by eliciting favorable facts." Therefore, I conclude that the full rights of representation under the Statute were not granted in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1569, quoting from <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc.</span>, 420 U.S. 251, 263 (1975). As mentioned above, the Authority adopted the Judge's findings and conclusions without discussion or modification. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1528. Although the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently vacated the Authority's decision and remanded the case, it did so on grounds that are not relevant here. Nowhere in its decision did the court rule, implicitly or explicitly, on the point at issue in this case. Thus, whether or not the Authority's <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> decision "no longer exists," as the Respondents assert, is irrelevant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This does not, however, mean that the General Counsel is necessarily correct in stating that <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> establishes a general right to conduct private conferences outside the presence of the investigator so long as such conferences are not unduly disruptive. The Judge's decision in <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> gives no indication of any intention to establish a rule of law extending beyond the facts of that case....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, contrary to the General Counsel's argument, <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> does not, on its face, hold that section 7114(a)(2)(B) entitles an employee and a union representative to confer privately outside the interview room during a <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examination unless the conference would unduly disrupt the examination. In other words, <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> does not establish a <span class="Italic">per se</span>, single-factor rule under which private conferences must be permitted absent "undue" disruption. Nor does <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> establish that any right to confer privately necessarily includes a right to leave the interview room. Accordingly, and also contrary to the General Counsel's argument, there is no basis on which to conclude that the Judge misapplied <span class="Italic">Twin Cities</span> in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel cites no other authority for the proposition that a request to leave the interview room in order to conduct a private conference must be evaluated solely on the basis of whether it would disrupt an examination.&#x2003;Our research likewise fails to disclose any authority, in the public or private sectors, for this proposition. To adopt such a proposition now would be to extend to employees and their representatives, in effect, a right to interrupt <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> examinations upon request in order to leave the site of the examination and conduct private conferences (absent "undue" disruption) even when the conferences are unnecessary to protect any of the rights guaranteed under section 7114(a)(2)(B). Accordingly, we are persuaded that the approach used by the Judge in this case--evaluating the Respondents' actions to determine whether they interfered with active and effective participation by the Union representative in the employee's defense--is the proper approach to resolving the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the question to be decided in this case is whether the General Counsel satisfied the burden of proving that the Respondents violated the Statute by refusing to permit the employee and the Union representative to confer outside the examination room, at their request, or whether the record supports the Judge's conclusion that, by these actions, the Union representative was not "prevented from taking the active role...envisioned by" section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. This question, in turn, requires careful examination of the Judge's finding that the employee and the Union representative had sufficient opportunity to confer, when they desired, inside the interview room, as well as during their scheduled breaks outside it, and that it was therefore unnecessary to allow them to leave the room when they requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he record does not indicate how either request to confer outside the interview room, if granted, would have enhanced the Union representatives' ability to effectively represent the employee. In addition to the facts discussed above, the employee's responses to the investigator's questions do not show that he was prevented from protecting his interests in responding to questions asked during the course of the interview, which largely pertained to the allegations of which he was notified 3 weeks before the interview. Further, the affidavit signed by the employee and his representative at the end of the interview, which sets forth the questions asked by the investigator and the employee's answers, shows that the employee did not answer any of the questions asked him with respect to the employee's family. Indeed, he asserted, in reply to the second such question, that "I do not know what they did or did not do. Any time you ask me a question about my family this is the same answer I am going to provide, because my family does not work for the Bureau of Prisons." We can find no clear indication in the record that the employee received less effective representation than that to which he was entitled under the Statute because he and the Union representative were not permitted to leave the interview room and confer when they requested.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The evidence, taken as a whole, persuaded the Judge that the employee and his representative were not denied any rights guaranteed them by the Statute merely because they were not permitted to leave the interview room when they asked to do so. Our review of the record confirms that the General Counsel has not established the necessary connection between the requested recesses and the ability of the Union representative to actively and effectively represent the employee. In fact, as mentioned previously, the General Counsel, who bears the burden of proof on this point, denies that any such connection is necessary.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the General Counsel's argument that the circumstances of the examination were "inherently coercive" because the employee and his Union representative were interrupted by the investigator "on every occasion when they tried to confer" in the interview room, we note that both the employee and the Union representative testified to this effect, but neither indicated whether they had requested permission to confer or simply started talking. Nor did they indicate whether they ever objected to the interruptions. In any event, as set forth above, the Judge credited the contrary testimony of the investigators, one of whom stated that the employee and the Union representative were told after they asked to leave the interview room that they could "confer inside the room." On at least this occasion, as the Judge found, they were not interrupted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel also argues that the employee and his Union representative were coerced by being forced to sit only a few inches in front of the desk behind which the investigator sat.&#x2003;However, the General Counsel does not dispute the Judge's finding that they never moved to the rear of the room to confer, even when the investigator was absent. Instead, the General Counsel contends only that the employee and the Union representative never received "permission to confer in the back of the room at any time." The record does not indicate whether the employee and the Union representative ever asked for such permission. In addition, the General Counsel does not explain why, as asserted, had they asked to confer in the back of the room, the employee and the Union representative would have been limited to discussing questions that had already been answered.</p>
