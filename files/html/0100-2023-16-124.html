<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-124"><span class="space">a.</span> ULP Process Unavailable for Merits Review of Award</h4>
<p class="noindent">A party to an arbitrator's award must comply with the award when timely filed exceptions to the award are denied by the Authority. Failure then to comply with the award violates &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8). In subsequent ULP proceedings, the issue is whether the award was complied with when the exceptions were denied. FLRA will not relitigate in the ULP proceeding the denial of the exceptions or the propriety of the award on grounds not raised in the exceptions. <span class="Italic">Wyoming Air Nat'l Guard and NAGE Local R14-76</span>, 27 FLRA 759, 762-63 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA 749, 757-58 (1991) (FLRA has jurisdiction to direct compliance of an arbitration award concerning a matter that would have been reviewable by the Federal Circuit pursuant to 5 USC 7121(f), 7122(a), 7703). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VAMC, Allen Park and AFGE Local 933</span>, 49 FLRA 405, 406 (1994) (agency committed ULP by not abiding by arbitration awards; however, FLRA modified one of two awards at issue to clarify the remedy directed by the arbitrator). Perforce, the same obligation applies if the award is final because no timely exceptions were filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Carswell AFB and AFGE Local 1364</span>, 38 FLRA 99 (1990). In <span class="Italic">Carswell AFB</span>, FLRA opined, 38 FLRA at 107, "[t]o the extent that the Respondent argues that the clear wording of the award...is inconsistent with applicable law, rules, or regulations, we reject that argument because it should have been raised as an exception to the...award...."</p>
<p class="noindent">The rule precluding use of ULP proceedings to challenge final arbitration awards was restated, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 67 FLRA 632, 634-35 (2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent argues that implementing the <span class="Italic">status-quo</span> remedy would: interfere with its management right to determine internal-security practices under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(1) of the Statute; disrupt the efficiency and effectiveness of the Respondent's operations; and create an unsafe environment for staff, inmates, and the general public. The Respondent made this argument before the arbitrator, who nevertheless included the <span class="Italic">status-quo</span> remedy in the award. But the Respondent never filed exceptions to the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitration award becomes final and binding "for all purposes,"[38] and cannot be challenged by any means, if exceptions are not filed within the required period.[39] The Authority has consistently held that it will not review the merits of an arbitration award in a ULP proceeding,[40] because "to allow a respondent to litigate matters that go to the merits of the award would circumvent [c]ongressional intent with respect to statutory review procedures and the finality of arbitration awards."[41] Consequently, in a ULP proceeding regarding a failure to comply with an arbitration award, a party cannot do what the Respondent is attempting to do here: use an exception to the Judge's decision enforcing the award to challenge the merits of the award, including the <span class="Italic">status-quo</span> remedy.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, DOD Dependents Sch</span>., 54 FLRA 773, 782 (1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force v. FLRA</span>, 775 F.2d 727, 735 (6th Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7122(b) ("If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the [thirty]-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA, Nw. Mountain Region, Renton, Wash.</span>, 55 FLRA 293, 296 (1999) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Adjutant Gen. Publ'ns Ctr., St. Louis, Mo</span>., 22 FLRA 200, 206 (1986)).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">When a party fails to file timely exceptions to an arbitration award under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the award becomes final and binding, and the agency must take such actions as are required by the award and cannot challenge the terms of that award. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, DOD Dependents Schs.,</span> 54 FLRA 773, 782 (1998); <span class="Italic">U.S. DOD, Def. Distrib. Region E., New Cumberland, Pa.,</span> 51 FLRA 155, 159 (1995). Consistent with this principle, when a party fails to except to an arbitrator's finding on a particular issue, the party cannot, in exceptions to a later award, collaterally attack the previously unexcepted-to findings. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Ralph H.

Thus, where an agency could have made a management-rights argument in its exceptions to an initial award, it cannot later collaterally attack the arbitrator's finding on the relevant issue. <span class="Italic">VA,</span> 57 FLRA at 75.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, when an arbitrator has issued more than one award concerning a matter, the timeliness of an exception is calculated on the basis of the award that gives rise to the deficiency alleged in the exception. <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Fed.

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed previously, in the original award, the Arbitrator found that <span id="Page_1346"></span>the grievant "should have been permitted to retain his law enforcement commission," and directed the Agency to "[r]einstate the grievant's law enforcement commission retroactive to the date it was revoked." In the compliance award, the Arbitrator found that the grievant's law-enforcement commission had been an active commission. The Agency does not dispute this finding or argue that the original award was unclear with respect to what type of commission the Agency was required to reinstate. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">BOP,</span> 64 FLRA 437, the deficiency giving rise to the exception was set forth in the original award, not the compliance award. The Agency's exception, effectively arguing that it cannot reinstate the commission to an active status, constitutes an improper collateral attack on the original award. Thus, we deny the exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not contest that it failed to fully comply with the award, and it defends its noncompliance on only one substantive basis. Specifically, the Agency asserts that the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Institution, Marianna, Florida</span> (<span class="Italic">FCI</span>)[36] "required" the Judge "to consider the Agency's compliance based upon a 'reasonable construction of the award.'"[37] In this regard, the Agency alleges that the remedy from the second award--directing the Agency to "create or modify its computer programs or other procedures by which all bargaining[-]unit employees receive with every payment a clear, fully understandable explanation of what is included"--was ambiguous.[38]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator issued the second award in 2003. By challenging the remedy from that award as ambiguous, the Agency is effectively contesting an eighteen-year-old arbitration award. As noted above, the Agency filed exceptions to the second award, and, in 2004, the Authority denied those exceptions.[42] In its 2004 exceptions, the Agency raised several arguments <span class="Italic">specifically related</span> to the remedy requiring the Agency to "create or modify its computer programs or other procedures."[43] However, at that time, the Agency did not allege that this awarded remedy was incomplete, <span class="Italic">ambiguous</span>, or contradictory to make implementation impossible.[44] Its attempt to do so through this ULP proceeding, as a basis for defending its failure to comply with the awards, represents a collateral attack on a final and binding arbitration award.[45] Accordingly, consistent with the statutory review procedures mentioned above, we reject the Agency's sole exception to the merits of the Judge's decision.[46]</p>

To the extent that the Agency's exceptions challenge the merits of those awards, we reject those challenges for the same reason that we reject the Agency's arguments pertaining to the second award. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of VA, Northport VA Hosp., Northport, N.Y</span>., 67 FLRA 325, 326 (2014) (dismissing exceptions because they were not filed before the award became final and binding).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Although unnecessary, we consider the Agency's ambiguity argument and find it unavailing for at least two reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, contrary to the Agency's assertion, the Judge was not "required" to measure the Agency's compliance based on the Agency's interpretation of the awards. <span class="Italic">FCI</span> plainly states that the reasonable-construction test for compliance applies only "[w]hen the award is ambiguous."[48] And here, the Judge found that while the 2003 award may have been ambiguous as issued, the Arbitrator's March 2010 letter (or third award) "specified <span class="Italic">exactly</span> what [the Agency] needed to. . .provide[ ]" to employees in order to comply with the awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[48]&#x2003;FCI, 59 FLRA at 4; <span class="Italic">see also Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin, Compliance Ctr., Austin, Tex</span>., 44 FLRA 1306, 1316 (1992) ("Where an arbitration award is ambiguous, the Authority examines whether the agency's construction of the award is reasonable in determining whether the agency adequately complied with the award.").</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DHHS, HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 35 FLRA 491, 496 (1990), noted that a party risks a ULP finding for failing to abide by an arbitration award if exceptions were denied. A request for reconsideration of FLRA's ruling on exceptions, coupled with a request for a stay of the award pending the determination of the reconsideration request, did not operate as a stay, but a cautionary note:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although a party is required to comply with an arbitration award to which the Authority has denied exceptions during the pendency of a request for reconsideration of that denial and a request for a stay, not every failure by a party to comply with an arbitration award during the pendency of such requests constitutes an unfair labor practice. The purpose and policies of the Statute are not effectuated by finding an unfair labor practice without regard to the Authority's decision on the request for reconsideration or the request for a stay. If the Authority subsequently reconsiders its decision and vacates that part of the arbitrator's award with which the party has failed or refused to comply, that party will not be found to have committed an unfair labor practice. Similarly, if the Authority grants a stay of its decision, finding that noncompliance during the pendency of the request was warranted, the party failing or refusing to comply also will not be found to have committed an unfair labor practice. However, a party that refuses to comply with an arbitration award during the pendency of such requests does so at its peril. If it refuses to comply and the Authority does not subsequently grant a stay or vacate the applicable aspects of the award, the refusal or failure to comply will constitute an unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency may not add conditions to an arbitration award that has not been challenged through exceptions. If a remedy establishes, for example, specific actions that management must take to the satisfaction of the union, the agency unlawfully fails to adhere to the award and commits a ULP if management does not prove that it has carried out those actions. Extrinsic conditions may not be established to determine whether the union is being reasonable in its response to management's actions taken as a result of the award. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and Nat'l Council of Social Sec. Field Operations Locals, Council 220, AFGE</span>, 23 FLRA 891, 893 (1986). An agency commits a ULP by establishing preconditions to the fulfillment of a remedy directed by an arbitrator after the award became final following denial of exceptions. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661</span>, 20 FLRA 39, 43 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Broadcasting Bd. of Gov. and AFGE Local 1812</span>, 68 FLRA 342, 344-45 (2015) (Member Pizzella concurring), implied that FLRA could consider the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to entertain a grievance when the award was subject to ULP enforcement proceedings after exceptions were earlier denied. FLRA determined the award was within the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It involved application of a contract provision concerning hiring procedures and was not precluded by statute:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Turning to the first of these arguments, the Respondent argues that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over the grievance because "an arbitrator...only ha[s] jurisdiction over statutes with the purpose of affecting employment and not those only incidentally affecting employment and working conditions of employees." The Respondent further argues that the grievance involved the Smith-Mundt Act, which "was not issued for the purpose of affecting conditions of unit employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, this argument ignores the arbitrator's conclusions and the Authority's review of the awards. In addition to finding that the Respondent violated the Smith-Mundt Act, the arbitrator found that the Respondent had violated the parties' agreement--a decision made under his jurisdiction granted by that agreement and not based on a violation of any statute.[22] In <span class="Italic">Broadcasting Board of Governors</span>, the Authority did not address any statutory violations because the "contractual violation constitute[d] a separate and independent basis for [the arbitrator's] awards."[23] Where an arbitrator bases an award on separate and independent grounds, a party must establish that all grounds are deficient in order to demonstrate that the award is deficient.<span id="Page_1347"></span>[24] However, the contractual basis for an award cannot be challenged in a ULP proceeding alleging the failure to comply with an arbitrator's award.[25] Because the Respondent does not, and indeed may not, challenge the separate and independent contractual grounds for the awards, its first argument has failed to show that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction. Therefore, we reject this argument.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;Member Pizzella notes that the Authority has not decided, and does decide not here, whether a violation of the Smith-Mundt Act is a matter that can be grieved under the Statute. As such, this case does not implicate the concerns of overreach into other statutes that he expressed in <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. ICE</span>, 67 FLRA 501, 507-08 (2014) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella) and <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1547</span>, 67 FLRA 523, 532 (2014) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Pizzella).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Respondent argues that &#x00A7; 335.103(d) "serves as a legal bar to the grievance and the arbitrator's...jurisdiction." Section 335.103(d) states that "nonselection from among a group of properly ranked and certified candidates is not an appropriate basis for a...grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In part, the Respondent argues that "[t]he [merits] award and remedy allow[&#8197;] bargaining[-]unit employees on properly ranked U.S. citizen certificates to be given the position they applied for despite the fact there are other qualified U.S. candidates on the certificate" and that "[t]he [merits] award and remedy [award] require the Respondent to select only bargaining[-]unit employees from the uncontested properly ranked citizen certificates." These arguments, however, merely collaterally challenge the remedy, not the arbitrator's jurisdiction over the grievance. As the GC correctly notes, "[t]he arbitrator's remedy award d[oes] not transform a grievance [that] was grievable in the first instance into one that [is] not grievable." In short, these arguments simply constitute an impermissible collateral attack on the merits of the awards. Consequently, we reject these arguments.[32]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[32]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 766.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent also argues that &#x00A7; 335.103(d) acts as a jurisdictional bar because "[t]he grievance...[is] contending that [bargaining-unit employees] were not selected from [a] certificate, which has other qualified candidates," and "[t]he grievance...permit[s] complaints about nonselections from rankings and ratings of citizen certificates" in violation of &#x00A7; 335.103. The Respondent premises this argument on the allegation that the Judge misinterpreted the parties' agreement. The Respondent alleges that the Judge erred by suggesting that bargaining-unit employees "are entitled to an automatic preference for a vacant position." Based on this allegedly incorrect interpretation of the parties' agreement, the Judge determined that, because bargaining&#8209;unit employees were not given a preference, the certificate was not properly ranked and certified and, "[t]herefore, the prohibition of...&#x00A7; 335.103(d) [was] inapplicable."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite the Respondent's interpretation of the parties' agreement, the Judge's reliance on the Respondent's "contractual obligation to select and promote suitably qualified candidates from within the bargaining unit whenever possible" comports with the arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement. The arbitrator stated that the parties' agreement includes a "policy to promote from within whenever possible."[38] Therefore, this exception challenges the arbitrator's interpretation of the parties' agreement, not his jurisdiction. As such, this exception is an impermissible collateral attack on the awards.[39] Accordingly, we deny it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BBG I</span>, 66 FLRA at 381 (quoting Merits Award at 10).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 766.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Respondent argues that the grievance involved an initial hiring, which is excluded from the grievance procedure by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. Section 7121(c)(4) of the Statute excludes "any examination, certification, or appointment" from a grievance procedure. The Authority has held that the term "appointment" in this section relates only to the initial entry of an applicant into federal service and does not affect the arbitrability of claims regarding the hiring of grievants who were already federal employees when they applied for the position.[40]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[40]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">USDA, Rural Dev. Centralized Servicing Ctr., St. Louis, Mo</span>., 57 FLRA 166, 168 (2001).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent first argues that the grievance involved appointments because the grievance alleged that the Respondent "had been hiring non-[U.S.] citizens in spite of the existence of suitabl[e] U.S. citizens." However, despite the Respondent's characterization of the grievance, it concerned the failure to promote and select bargaining-unit employees, not appointments. The grievance addressed "[a]ll [a]ffected [b]argaining[-u]nit [e]mployees" who were not selected for or promoted to positions--not appointments within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4) of the Statute. Because the grievance concerns an action affecting current federal employees, &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4) of the Statute does not bar it.[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 1636</span>, 48 FLRA 511, 514 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent further argues that the arbitrator's awards concerned appointments because the remedy "formulated how the Respondent would fill all vacant positions, including initial appointments and non-bargaining[-]unit positions." The Respondent also points to the fact that both the ULP complaint and the Judge's decision state that a general schedule (GS)-9 vacancy announcement violated the arbitrator's awards as evidence that the awards involved initial appointments. According to the Respondent, the GS-9 position is "[c]learly...an entry level position" and therefore an initial appointment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As with the second exception, a challenge to the arbitrator's remedy fails to challenge his jurisdiction to arbitrate the dispute; it merely impermissibly collaterally attacks the merits of the awards.[46] Because this exception fails to demonstrate that the arbitrator lacked jurisdiction, we deny it.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[46]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 41 FLRA at 766.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In conclusion, the Judge properly ruled that the Respondent committed a ULP when it violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Statute by failing to comply with the final and binding awards.</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Pizzella concurred in <span class="Italic">Broadcasting Bd.</span>, noting that, with but limited exceptions, FLRA should not review an arbitrator's jurisdiction over a grievance in a ULP proceeding, 68 FLRA at 347-48:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I join my colleagues in concluding that the Chief Administrative Law Judge (the Judge) properly ruled that the Respondent committed an unfair labor practice (ULP) by violating &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) in failing to comply with the arbitrator's awards. I write separately to note alternate grounds for denying the Respondent's exceptions. While I agree with my colleagues' analysis of the merits of the Respondents' exceptions, I would find it unnecessary to reach the merits of the exceptions. I would find that the Respondent cannot bring these jurisdictional claims before the Authority at this juncture because the Respondent had the right of direct review of the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the ULP alleging the Respondent's failure to comply with the earlier arbitration awards, the Respondent challenges the jurisdiction of the arbitrator over the grievance. Although the Authority has repeatedly held that the Authority's jurisdiction may be challenged at any stage of its proceedings,[2] the Authority has not held that the same is true for an arbitrator's jurisdiction. On the contrary, it is well established that once an arbitration award is final, a party may not use a ULP charge to collaterally attack it.[3] The Authority has held that allowing such a collateral attack would circumvent congressional intent with respect to statutory review procedures and the finality of arbitration awards.[4] Nonetheless, the Authority has recognized an exception to this general rule in certain limited situations involving challenges to an arbitrator's statutory jurisdiction.[5] Specifically, the Authority has allowed collateral statutory challenges to an arbitrator's jurisdiction "where a party wishing to challenge an arbitrator's jurisdiction has no <span class="Italic">right</span> of direct review."[6] This narrow exception, however, does not apply here. The Respondent not only had a right of direct review of the arbitrator's award but exercised it.[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent relies on <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of VA, Medical Center, Asheville, North Carolina</span> (<span class="Italic">Medical Center</span>), for the broad proposition that it has "a legal right to bring jurisdictional claims" challenging the arbitrator's jurisdiction during this ULP proceeding because the complaint focuses <span id="Page_1348"></span>on the Respondent's failure to implement the award.[8] However, <span class="Italic">Medical Center</span> only addressed a challenge to the Authority's jurisdiction--not the arbitrator's jurisdiction--and provides no basis for allowing a challenge to the arbitrator's jurisdiction here.[9] The Respondent has provided no rationale for creating a new exception that permits a challenge to an arbitrator's jurisdiction during an enforcement action where it has a right of direct review. I would decline to create such an exception. Consequently, I would find that the Respondent cannot raise these arguments here, and would deny the exceptions for that reason.</p>

<p class="noindent">An agency must comply with an unexcepted award, even if the award includes a directive that may be contrary to law, e.g., a directive to pay interest. <span class="Italic">Military Sealift Command and Nat'l Maritime Union</span>, 21 FLRA 941, 943 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., New York Region and NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 999 (1986) (award directing payment of travel expenses).</p>
<p class="noindent">Once an arbitrator rules on an issue and set of facts, the award is binding on the parties unless timely exceptions are filed or unless there is renegotiation by the parties or reconsideration by the arbitrator. The agency may not refuse to comply with the hope that the union will file another grievance leading to another arbitration and relitigation of the original issues. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Portsmouth FEMTC</span>, 17 FLRA 40, 50 (1985) (ALJ Decision). But legitimate reexamination of an award may be permissible. An arbitrator's award, issued in favor of the union, determined that the parties could join two issues before an arbitrator in one hearing rather than presenting the cases separately. After the award was issued, the agency filed a grievance over the related issue of whether it could pursue consolidated grievances in arbitration. The union filed a ULP charge. The ALJ commented, recommending dismissal of the complaint, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hq., Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson AFB and AFGE Council 214</span>, 24 FLRA 875, 883-84 (1986) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Conceivably, a course of conduct might become so egregious that further resort to the grievance procedure over the same issue might be improper, a question I specifically do not decide; but assuredly not on the basis of a single prior arbitrator's decision especially not on the basis of an arbitration decision which neither decided, nor purported to decide, the right to combine grievances for arbitration at an activity level....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But more basic, arbitrators are not bound by <span class="Italic">stare decisis</span>. An arbitrator may follow arbitral precedent but is under no compunction to do so and examples are legion where arbitrators have departed from arbitral precedent involving the same issues. Certainly, Respondent has every right to engage in elucidative litigation, at least at the activity level, to test the parameters of consolidation of grievances for arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA affirmed the recommended decision of its ALJ, 24 FLRA at 875 n.*:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While we agree with the Judge that, under the circumstances, utilization of the grievance procedure does not constitute an unfair labor practice, we also note that we specifically do not decide whether a course of conduct might become so egregious that further resort to the grievance procedure over the same issue might be improper.</p>
<p class="noindent">An unusual question arose concerning compliance with an arbitration award involving a grievance, ultimately sustained, challenging a reprimand. After the reprimand was issued, the agency suspended the grievant, basing its suspension in part on a theory of progressive discipline supported, in part, by the reprimand. The arbitrator's award setting aside the reprimand was not challenged through exceptions. The issue was whether the agency undermined the arbitration award by failing to rescind the later suspension after the arbitrator determined that the reprimand could not be used against the grievant in any manner. FLRA determined that the agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (8). As a remedy it directed that the agency remove any reference to the reprimand in the suspension and that it reconsider the suspension. The agency was then free to decide whether to reaffirm the suspension. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Field Operations, New York Region and AFGE Local 2369</span>, 23 FLRA 304 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Army Health Clinic, Ft. Ritchie and NFFE Local 1153</span>, 9 FLRA 935, 947 (1982) (agency committed ULP when it based disciplinary action against employee in part on earlier reprimand that arbitrator ordered removed from the employee's record; agency was directed to notify MSPB of actions taken by agency to comply with arbitration award).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA is disinclined to find a ULP when a party reasonably fails to comply with an ambiguous award. In <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 4036</span>, 59 FLRA 3, 4-5 (2003), the question was whether the agency failed to comply with an award that the agency deemed to be too ambiguous to follow. FLRA favored the agency's position, declined to remand the case to an arbitrator for further elaboration of the award, and dismissed the ULP complaint:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Judge noted, the standard for determining whether an agency has adequately complied with an arbitration award depends, in part, on the clarity of the award<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Austin Compliance Ctr., Austin, Tex.</span>, 44 FLRA 1306, 1315 (1992). When the award is ambiguous, the test of compliance is whether the agency's action is consistent with a reasonable construction of the award<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bur. of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Marion, Ill.</span>, 53 FLRA 55, 60 (1997)<span class="Italic">. See also Dep't of the Treasury</span>, 25 FLRA at 72 ("the adequacy of compliance with an arbitration award will be determined by whether the [r]espondent's construction of the award is reasonable, which would depend on whether the construction is consistent with the entire award and consistent with applicable rules and regulations").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge correctly found that the award in this case is ambiguous.&#x2003;As noted above, the arbitrator did not define the meaning of the terms "good cause" and "administrative convenience." Further, the arbitrator did not provide specific instructions on what actions the Respondent was required to take to comply with the award. Additionally, while finding that the Respondent's failure to fill all posts constituted a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the parties' agreement, the arbitrator also refused to fault management's judgment in keeping certain posts unfilled, a finding that is at odds with a <span class="Italic">per se</span> violation of the agreement.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We reject the General Counsel's assertion that, "if the award is ambiguous, the Authority should not have the discretion to interpret the award, but should require the parties to resort to further clarification from the [a]rbitrator." The issue before the Authority is compliance with the award and the record provides a sufficient basis on which to make that determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a judge's factual findings are supported, the Authority looks to the preponderance of the record evidence<span class="Italic">. See Air Force Materiel Command, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 53 FLRA 1092, 1093 ((1998) (Authority looks to whether "the [j]udge's factual findings and the record as a whole" support the judge's conclusions)<span class="Italic">. See also United States Army Armament Research Development and Engineering Ctr., Picatinny Arsenal, N.J.</span>, 52 FLRA 527 (1996) (Authority reviewed entire record in affirming judge's determination that respondent complied with award). In addition, the General Counsel maintains the burden of proving all of the allegations of the complaint<span class="Italic">. See United States Dep't of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 54 FLRA 360, 370 (1998), <span class="Italic">petition denied</span>, <span class="Italic">NAGE v. FLRA</span>, 179 F.3d 946 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (the General Counsel bears the burden of establishing each and every element of an alleged unfair labor practice in order to establish a violation of the Statute).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent excepts to the Judge's findings that its actions were not consistent with a reasonable construction of the award and to the Judge's conclusion that its conduct violated the Statute. The Judge's findings and conclusions to which the Respondent excepts were based on her review of the entire record. On review of that record, we find that it does not support the Judge's determination that the Respondent failed to comply with the award. Consequently, we find that the General Counsel has not established that the Respondent violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">General claims of inability to comply with an award are unlikely to excuse noncompliance with a nonexcepted, final award, as FLRA pointed out in a involving acquisition of parking space from the City of Denver, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 55 FLRA 293, 297 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In claiming that it did not commit an unfair labor practice, the Respondent contends that it made attempts to comply with the award, but that Denver would not allow it to comply. These arguments, in effect, challenge the Arbitrator's final and binding award and, therefore, are not properly before us in this proceeding. In essence, the Respondent raises the same claim asserted by the agency in exceptions to an award in <span class="Italic">U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Immigration and Naturalization Service and American</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Government Employees, AFL CIO, Local</span> <span class="Italic">1917, </span>20 FLRA 391 (1985). In that case, the arbitrator directed the agency to take specific actions that were within the purview of GSA, the New Jersey/New York Port Authority, and the airlines at JFK International Airport. The agency claimed that the award was deficient because the agency did not have the authority to take the actions ordered by the arbitrator or to compel GSA, the Port Authority, or the airlines to take such actions. The Authority found that the award was deficient because the arbitrator could not direct the agency to take actions that were within the purview of a third party. As the Respondent's arguments similarly concern its authority to comply with the award, such arguments constitute a collateral attack on the award and will not be reviewed [4] by the Authority in a proceeding to enforce the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Private sector cases under section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act strongly support the principle that a court will not allow a respondent to raise a claim that an award is not enforceable because it directs the respondent to take action that is beyond the respondent's power and ability to do, when the respondent could have raised the defense within the prescribed period. For example, in <span class="Italic">Service Employees International Union, Local No. 36, AFL-CIO v. Office Center Services, Inc., </span>670 F.2d 404 (3d Cir. 1982), the Third Circuit addressed an employer's appeal of a District Court grant of summary judgment affirming an arbitration award. In the District Court proceeding, the union had sought enforcement <span id="Page_1349"></span>of an arbitration award rendered in its favor, when the employer had let lapse the applicable period for moving to vacate the award. The employer had argued as an affirmative defense, along with other defenses, that the award was not enforceable because it directed the employer to take action that was beyond its power and ability. In affirming summary judgment, the Appeals Court held that the employer's failure to raise its affirmative defenses in an action to vacate, modify, or correct the award barred raising them in a subsequent proceeding to enforce the award. Likewise, under the facts of the instant case, the Respondent may not defend its failure to comply with the award, in a ULP proceeding to enforce the award, on grounds that implementation is impossible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent chose not to file exceptions to the Arbitrator's award, despite the fact that it was aware of the difficulties in implementing the award during the 30-day period in which exceptions could have been <span class="Italic">filed. </span>Consequently, the award became final and binding. The Respondent cannot now be permitted to attack the award in this unfair labor practice proceeding because permitting such an attack would nullify the statutory scheme Congress created. As the Judge correctly found, the Respondent's claim that it is not able to comply with the award constitutes an impermissible collateral attack on the award itself, and we reject it as such.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Respondent's claims that it should be relieved of liability because the ULP charge allegedly was filed prematurely, or because the Respondent was attempting to comply within a context that it claims to be complex. Specifically, the Respondent excepts to the Judge's statements directed to its failure to seek the Arbitrator's assistance and its failure to consult with the Union regarding alternative solutions to the award, stating that such communications would have been futile. In support of its claims, the Respondent relies upon <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>22 FLRA 270, wherein the Authority dismissed a complaint alleging, in part, that an agency failed to comply with an arbitration award. In <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>the Authority adopted the administrative law judge's decision that, in light of all the facts and circumstances presented, the agency had acted promptly in implementing the award. Those facts and circumstances included compliance with various actions, not all of which had clear time frames. <span class="Italic">SSA </span>is factually distinguishable from the instant case for several reasons. First, the arbitrator in that case issued both an interim award and, five months later, a final award. The bifurcation of the award created difficulties in implementation. Second, the agency promptly complied with the only portion of the award that had a clear time frame. Third, compliance with the final award was complicated by the agency's compliance with the interim award. Here, as noted, compliance with the award, which concededly was "clear and unambiguous" was never achieved. Accordingly, non-compliance is not excused by the circumstances of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">If noncompliance with an arbitration award is directed by a higher level of the agency than the activity subject to the award, the ULP will be found as to the higher-level organization. As a part of the remedy, the higher-level organization will be ordered to direct its subordinate activity to comply with the award. <span class="Italic">DOJ and AFGE Council of Prison Locals, Local 1661</span>, 20 FLRA 39, 43 (1985).
