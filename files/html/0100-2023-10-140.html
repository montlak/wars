<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-141"><span class="space">8.</span> Contract Bar</h4>
<p class="noindent">An existing collective bargaining contract may bar an election. Under 5 USC 7111(f):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;Exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(3)&#x2003;if there is then in effect a lawful written collective bargaining agreement between the agency involved and an exclusive representative (other than the labor organization seeking exclusive recognition) covering any employees included in the unit specified in the petition, unless--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(A)&#x2003;the collective bargaining agreement has been in effect for more than 3 years, or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(B)&#x2003;the petition for exclusive recognition is filed not more than 105 days and not less than 60 days before the expiration date of the collective bargaining agreement[.]</p>
<p class="noindent">The FLRA regulation, 5 CFR 2422.12 (2022), implementing the statutory provision defining the contract bar, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What circumstances does the Region consider to determine whether your petition is timely filed?</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Election bar.</span> Where there is no certified exclusive representative, a petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months of a valid election involving the same unit or a subdivision of the same unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Certification bar.</span> Where there is a certified exclusive representative of employees, a petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed within twelve (12) months after the certification of the exclusive representative of the employees in an appropriate unit. If a collective bargaining agreement covering the claimed unit is pending agency head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) or is in effect, paragraphs (c), (d), or (e) of this section apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Bar during 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) agency head review.</span> A petition seeking an election will not be considered timely if filed during the period of agency head review under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c). This bar expires upon either the passage of thirty (30) days absent agency head action, or upon the date of any timely agency head action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contract bar where the contract is for three (3) years or less.</span> Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of three (3) years or less from the date it became effective, a petition seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contract bar where the contract is for more than three (3) years.</span> Where a collective bargaining agreement is in effect covering the claimed unit and has a term of more than three (3) years from the date on which it became effective, a petition seeking an election will be considered timely if filed not more than one hundred and five (105) and not less than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the initial three (3) year period, and any time after the expiration of the initial three (3) year period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(f)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Unusual circumstances.</span> A petition seeking an election or a determination relating to representation matters may be filed at any time when unusual circumstances exist that substantially affect the unit or majority representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Premature extension.</span> Where a collective bargaining agreement with a term of three (3) years or less has been extended before sixty (60) days before its expiration date, the extension will not serve as a basis for dismissal of a petition seeking an election filed in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contract requirements.</span> Collective bargaining agreements, including agreements that go into effect under 5 U.S.C. 7114(c) and those that automatically renew without further action by the parties, are not a bar to a petition seeking an election under this section unless a clear effective date, renewal date where applicable, duration, and termination date are ascertainable from the agreement and relevant accompanying documentation.</p>
<p class="noindent">Generally the contract bar rule prevents an election sought by another union <span id="page_129"></span>that wants to raid the existing unit. The rule also applies, however, to an agency petition that questions the continued majority status of the union, unless there are unusual circumstances that substantially affect the unit or the majority representation. <span class="Italic">Dept. of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Passport Servs. and NFFE Local 1998</span>, 35 FLRA 1163, 165-66 (1990). For the effect of a contract bar on a decertification petition, refer to discussion earlier in this chapter of <span class="Italic">NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr. and AFGE</span>, 67 FLRA 670 (2014) (Member Pizzella concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties may have concluded their negotiations, reduced their agreement to writing and be just about to sign it, but an election petition filed before the actual signature of the contract, as it makes its way to agency head review, is timely and not barred by the negotiated but unsigned agreement. <span class="Italic">DOD, Illinois NG and LIUNA</span>, 68 FLRA 199 (2015). A contract bar may arise when the contract is signed on the same day a representation petition is filed, unless there is written notice of the petition to the employer before the contract is signed, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Hood and NFFE</span>, 51 FLRA 934, 939-44 (1996):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Authority precedent does not address the question of whether a contract bars an election petition that is filed on the same day the contract is executed, there is private sector precedent on this point. Under relevant private sector precedent, an executed contract generally bars an election petition filed on the same day as execution<span class="Italic">. Deluxe Metal Furniture</span>, 121 NLRB at 999.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The contract bar concept originated under the National Labor Relations Act where contract bar rules were developed through National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) case law. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., NLRB v. Circle A &#x0026; W Products Co.</span>, 647 F.2d 924, 926 (9th Cir. 1981) (<span class="Italic">Circle A &#x0026; W</span>) ("The [contract bar] rule does not find its source in the express language of the statute, nor is it judicially compelled."). In the private sector, the contract bar permits an existing collective bargaining agreement not exceeding a specified period (currently 3 years) to bar a petition for redetermination of representation in most instances. <span class="Italic">E.g., id</span>. The purpose of the contract bar in the private sector is to provide a balance between the competing statutory objectives of (1) stability in industrial relations, and (2) employee freedom of choice in selecting bargaining representatives. <span class="Italic">Leedom v. IBEW</span>, 278 F.2d 237, 242 (D.C. Cir. 1960).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the purpose and function of the contract bar are the same in both the Federal and private sectors, it is appropriate to consider private sector precedent and to follow a similar approach in interpreting and applying contract bar provisions under the Statute. <span class="Italic">Cf. Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Port Hueneme, California</span>, 50 FLRA 363, 367 (1995) (as differences that relate to successorship principles in private and Federal sectors are not significant, it is appropriate to bring the approach for determining successorship in the Federal sector into closer alignment with private sector treatment of the issue). Accordingly, consistent with the private sector rule established in <span class="Italic">Deluxe</span> <span class="Italic">Metal Furniture</span>, we will find that...an executed contract bars an election petition that is filed on the same day as execution if all that remains for effectuation of the agreement is agency head review.[8] As in the private sector, this rule encompasses the entire day on which execution of the collective bargaining agreement occurs. This rule is preferable to an approach requiring parties to establish as an evidentiary matter the precise moment in time when execution and filing occur because such approach would be prone to disputes that could cause delays in representation matters. For this reason, we reject NFFE's suggestion that the existence of a bar should be decided by whether execution or the filing of the petition occurs first and we adopt instead an approach that is a long-standing one in the private sector and has withstood the test of time. We emphasize that the rule we are adopting is limited to the uncommon circumstance where a petition is filed on the same day as a contract is executed covering the same employees as the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;The requirement in <span class="Italic">Deluxe Metal Furniture</span> that a contract be effective immediately or retroactively in order to bar a petition filed on the same day that the agreement is executed is not relevant in the Federal sector where, as a consequence of the requirement under section 7114(c) of the Statute that executed agreements be subject to agency-head review, a contract cannot be effective immediately or retroactively upon execution. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., West Point Elementary School Teachers</span> <span class="Italic">Association, NEA and United States Military Academy, West Point</span> <span class="Italic">Elementary School</span>, 34 FLRA 1008, 1021 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Deluxe Metal Furniture</span>, the NLRB carved one exception to the general rule that an executed agreement prevails over an election petition filed on the same day as execution. Under this exception, the agreement does not bar the petition if at the time of execution the employer has notice that a petition has been filed. This exception provides a means by which a non-incumbent union can defeat efforts by an agency and incumbent exclusive representative to thwart employee freedom of choice by colluding in the negotiation and execution of an agreement in order to bar a rival election petition. The exception thereby permits consideration of employee choice in circumstances where it appears particularly compelling. We find that applying a similar exception effectuates the policy underpinnings of the contract bar that were articulated in the legislative history of the Statute. That is, qualifying the general rule with an appropriate notice exception provides balance between the interests of stability in collective bargaining relationships and employee choice of representative. <span class="Italic">Cf. Circle A &#x0026; W</span>, 647 F.2d at 926 ("Where the objectives of contract stability and adequate employee representation conflict, the Board must exercise its discretion to reach an appropriate balance, but it must give explicit recognition to both sides of this balance.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To this end, we adopt a notice exception similar to that applied in <span class="Italic">Deluxe Metal Furniture</span>. In the interests of (1) providing parties with clear guidance as to what is expected of them in filing representation petitions and (2) reducing the potential for disputes that will delay the resolution of representation issues, we set forth the following requirements that the notice must meet in order to defeat a collective bargaining agreement that would otherwise operate as a bar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The notice must be in writing and convey that the petitioning union has taken all steps necessary to file a petition with the Authority.[9] The notice must be served on a person having authority over agency negotiations, which could extend to and include the head of the agency, and must be received on the same day that the petition is filed [10] but prior to the point at which the collective bargaining agreement is executed. Receipt of the notice must be verifiable through documentary evidence.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;A copy of the petition would suffice.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[10]&#x2003;Under both the current and revised regulations, a petition is deemed filed when it is received by the appropriate Regional Director. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.2(e)(4); 60 Fed. Reg. 67288, 67293 (1995) (to be codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.5(c)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Among other things, a copy of the notice showing time and date of receipt would constitute adequate verification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we conclude that where a petition is filed on the same day that an agreement is executed, and all that remains is agency-head review pursuant to section 7114(c), the agreement will bar the petition unless at the time of execution the agency received notice, which meets the above specifications, that all steps necessary to file a petition had been taken.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject NFFE's claim that the Agency head's subsequent disapproval of the agreement removed the contract as a bar to the petition in this case. The petition was filed prior to the date on which the Agency head disapproved the agreement and, consequently, the agreement served to bar the petition at the time of filing. <span class="Italic">See Harpers Ferry</span>, 15 FLRA at 789 (when an executed agreement is disapproved by an agency head pursuant to section 7114(c), it no longer serves as a bar to petitions filed during the interim period between disapproval and successful conclusion of a subsequent agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject NFFE's contention that unusual circumstances precluded the agreement reached on November 4 from operating as a bar. Even assuming that the Agency was aware that the filing of a petition was imminent, the speed with which the agreement was negotiated and executed, standing alone, does not establish an unusual circumstance. Moreover, review of the agreement reached reveals that with some exceptions it mirrored the predecessor agreement between the Agency and AFGE and contained substantial terms and conditions of employment sufficient to stabilize the bargaining relationship between the parties. That the negotiations and the resulting agreement may not have encompassed all possible conditions of employment does not preclude the agreement from operating as a lawful collective bargaining agreement that can bar the filing of a petition for exclusive recognition. <span class="Italic">See SSA I</span>, 44 FLRA at 238-40. As to NFFE's claim that some commanders signed a blank sheet of paper, the record shows that the commanders were not members of the bargaining team; therefore, the fact that they may have signed the agreement reached by their duly authorized bargaining representatives without fully reviewing it does not raise a question about the validity of the agreement.[14]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;In view of the fact that the commanders were not on the bargaining team, we need not address whether similar actions by bargaining team members would support a finding that contract negotiations were a sham or what the legal consequence of such a finding would be.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject NFFE's contention that it provided notice of the filing of the petition, which precluded the executed agreement from operating as a bar. In this regard, NFFE claims that an employee informed an Agency representative in a telephone conversation on November 2, 1994, that a sufficient showing of interest had been collected and would be delivered to a representative who would then file the petition.[15] This claimed notice does not constitute notification to the Agency that NFFE had taken all steps necessary to file a petition with the Authority and, thus, was not adequate to preclude the collective bargaining agreement from <span id="page_130"></span>operating as a bar to the petition.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[15]&#x2003;The Agency representative who allegedly received this notice testified that he did not recall being told that adequate signatures had been obtained for a showing of interest. However, resolution of this factual dispute is unnecessary to the disposition of this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">The effective date of the agreement controls whether an election petition is barred by an existing contract. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, N. Atl. Serv. Ctr. and NTEU and AFGE Local 2078</span>, 3 FLRA 386, 387 (1980). That policy is reflected in 5 CFR 2422.12(d) (2022) [formerly 2422.3(d)]. Under &#x00A7; 2422.12(h) [formerly 2422.3(i)], agreements that go into effect automatically under &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the Statute, and that do not contain the date the agreement became effective, do not constitute a bar to an election petition. <span class="Italic">DHHS, Philadelphia Reg'l Office, Region III and NTEU</span>, 12 FLRA 167, 170 (1983). If a contract that was negotiated provides for approval by a designated manager and the local union president, the agreement cannot serve as a contract bar without that approval. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 169.
