<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-76"><span class="space">b.</span> Lautenberg Amendment</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A law enforcement officer whose position requires the ability to carry a firearm may be removed if that privilege is lost because of his or her conviction of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence," a term defined by 18 USC 921(a)(33). The disability is imposed through the Lautenberg Amendment, a statute described in <span class="Italic">White v. DOJ</span>, 328 F.3d 1361, 1363-73 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal requires two different inquiries. First, as a threshold matter, we must analyze and construe the operative term of &#x00A7; 922(g)(9), "of domestic violence," which is defined in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33), to determine whether &#x00A7; 922(g)(9) applied to and, therefore, constrained White. This threshold inquiry actually has two sub-parts: (A) construing the meaning of the statutory definition; and (B) determining factually its applicability to White. Beyond this threshold matter, the second inquiry, and the real heart of this case, is whether or not the Board's decision affirming the Warden's removal of White was otherwise proper. Although affected by the results of our first inquiry, this second inquiry requires separate analysis under personnel law, as this is an appeal over a personnel action, and not a criminal conviction under &#x00A7; 922.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first address whether White's conviction for simple assault rather than domestic violence meets the definition in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33) of "a misdemeanor crime of <span class="Italic">domestic</span> violence" as that term is used in &#x00A7; 922 (emphasis added), given the ample, separate proof that the victim of White's assault <span id="Page_2523"></span>was his long-time paramour. If so, then he is constrained by &#x00A7; 922. White, however, argues that he is not so constrained in view of his "acquittal" on the charge of misdemeanor domestic violence (Virginia Code Section 18.2-57.2) and guilty plea only to the reduced charge of misdemeanor simple assault (Virginia Code Section 18.2-57). We conclude that he is mistaken. Reviewing the grammar of &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) and reading the statute in light of clear and explicit legislative history compel us to conclude, as have other circuits, that the statute includes convictions for crimes that do not incorporate a domestic relationship <span class="Italic">as an element</span>, so long as the agency's proof establishes a domestic relationship as described in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii), because in light of the legislative history the only statutorily-required element is violence or the threat thereof.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 922(g)(9) prohibits certain convicts from receipt or possession of a firearm, providing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(g)&#x2003;It shall be unlawful for any person--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(9)&#x2003;who has been convicted in any court of a <span class="Italic">misdemeanor crime of domestic violence</span>,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or <span class="Italic">to receive any firearm</span> or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 922(g)(9) (2000) (emphases added). A "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 921(a)(33) as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(33)(A)&#x2003;Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" means an offense that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">has, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force</span>, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon, <span class="Italic">committed</span> by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, <span class="Italic">by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse</span>, parent, or guardian, <span class="Italic">or by a person similarly situated</span> to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 921(a)(33) (2000) (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires that a domestic relationship be an element of the crime is not a question of first impression nationally, but it is for our court. The government has brought to our attention a significant and consistent body of case law in other circuits addressing that very issue. For example, in <span class="Italic">United States v. Barnes</span>, 295 F.3d 1354, 1360-61 (D.C. Cir. 2002), the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit set forth an exhaustive linguistic analysis of the text of the statute to determine whether the plain meaning of the text requires that the offense on which &#x00A7; 922(g)(9) criminal liability is predicated must itself include, as an element, the domestic relationship described in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii). The use in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) of the singular word "element" instead of the plural, and the impossibility of the clause in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) beginning with "committed" to be construed as modifying the clause beginning with "the use or attempted use" are among the grammatical indications cited by the court. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1358, 1360. Specifically the court reasoned that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[it]&#x2003;must determine if "committed by" <span class="Italic">can</span>, consistent with its meaning, modify "use of force." The verb "commit" means "to do (something wrong or reprehensible), to perpetrate, be guilty of (a crime or <span class="Italic">offence</span>, etc.)." <span class="Italic">Oxford English Dictionary</span> 559 (2d ed. 1989) (emphasis added). The use of force is not "committed," "done" or "perpetrated." An "<span class="Italic">offense</span>" is "committed" or "perpetrated." And here, the offense of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" must be committed by a person in one of the specific relationships. Subpart (ii) of section 921(a)(33)(A) is not a complete sentence--subsection 921(a)(33)(A) is itself one sentence that begins with "except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (C), the term 'misdemeanor crime of domestic violence' means an offense that--" and continues through subparts (i) and (ii). In short, a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" means an offense that is a misdemeanor, has, as an element, the use of force and was committed by a person with the requisite relationship. An illustration using simpler language demonstrates the point. If the statute read</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">"larceny means an offense that has, as an element, monetary gain, committed by a person...,"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">it would be obvious that "committed" modifies "offense" and that monetary gain is the only "element." Just as "monetary gain" is not "committed," the "use of force" is not "committed." The "offense" is "committed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1360 (emphasis in original and footnotes omitted). The court then relied on the analysis that "[t]he fact that the Congress somewhat awkwardly included the 'committed by' phrase in subpart (ii) (instead of adding a subpart (iii)) is not significant in view of the unnatural reading that would result if 'committed by' were construed to modify 'use of force.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1361. The court, thus, deemed itself compelled to conclude that "section 921(a)(33)(A)'s language plainly requires only one element, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, the use of force." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1362.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> court also considered, first, the purpose of the statute--concluding that the defendant's construction would "render the law a nullity in a majority of the states as well as at the Federal level" because their penal codes do not define any crimes having a domestic relationship as an element--and, second, the explanation of Senator Lautenberg in offering the amendment that became this provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1364. Senator Lautenberg explained the "as an element language" was directed to the force component of &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in order to replace the language "crime of violence," which was seen as too vague:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under the final agreement, the ban applies to crimes that have, as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force, or the threatened use of a deadly weapon. This is an improvement over the earlier version, which did not explicitly include within the ban crimes involving an attempt to use force, or the threatened use of a weapon, if such an attempt or threat did not also involve actual physical violence. In my view, anyone who attempts or threatens violence against a loved one has demonstrated that he or she poses an unacceptable risk, and should be prohibited from possessing firearms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">142 Cong. Rec. 26675 (1996). Senator Lautenberg also directly addressed the applicability of &#x00A7; 922 to crimes not having a domestic relationship as an element in saying:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr. President, the final agreement does not merely make it against the law for someone convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence from possessing firearms. It also incorporates this new category of offenders into the Brady law, which provides for a waiting period for handgun purchases. Under the Brady law, local law enforcement authorities are required to make reasonable efforts to ensure that those who are seeking to purchase a handgun are not prohibited under Federal law from doing so. Mr. President, convictions for domestic violence-related crimes often are for crimes, <span class="Italic">such as assault, that are not explicitly identified as related to domestic violence</span>. Therefore, it will not always be possible for law enforcement authorities to determine from the face of someone's criminal record whether a particular misdemeanor conviction involves domestic violence, as defined in the new law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Senator Lautenberg's statements are relevant because he was the author of the disputed language in his amendment to the bill. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 26674. His statements are entitled to probative weight as to the meaning of the terms he employed in the amendment, as statements by a non-authoring congressperson would not be.[1] Based on these two grounds along with the grammatical analysis, the court concluded that &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) requires only that the use of force or threat thereof must be an element of the predicate offense. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1368.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Even though courts should be "extremely wary of testimony before committee hearings and debates on the floor of Congress," we may make an exception for "precise analyses of statutory phrases by the sponsors of the proposed laws." <span class="Italic">See S &#x0026; E Contracts, Inc. v. U.S.</span>, 406 U.S. 1, 13 n.9, 92 S. Ct. 1411, 31 L. Ed. 2d 658 (1972). <span class="Italic">See also Glaxo Operations UK Ltd. v. Quigg</span>, 894 F.2d 392, 398 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (acknowledging that a sponsor's remarks should be afforded some weight as to the meaning of a bill but that this weight is only justified when the remarks are directed to the intended meaning of particular words in a statute) (citing <span class="Italic">Regan v. Wald</span>, 468 U.S. 222, 237, 104 S. Ct. 3026, 82 L. Ed. 2d 171 (1984)); <span class="Italic">State of New Mexico v. United States</span>, 831 F.2d 265, 269 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (holding that absent contradictory evidence in the legislative history, comments on the floor about the deletion of an amendment by a senator who was both the chairman of the Senate committee that originally considered the relevant act and a conference committee member are the best indication of congressional intent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We can see no error in the <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> analysis of either the plain meaning of the statute or the intent of Congress in enacting the statute. Nor has White identified any. Indeed, although <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> was heavily relied upon in the government's response brief, White's reply brief failed to distinguish or even cite it. Although only persuasive, not binding, authority to us, we find the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> convincing. Moreover, while <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> is a criminal case, not a personnel case as ours is, we nevertheless find it applicable here. Therefore, we adopt the reasoning of <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, as we are free to do, rather than deferring to it as precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We too hold that &#x00A7; 921(a)(33) requires only that the use or attempted use of physical force (or the threatened use of a deadly weapon) be an element of the predicate misdemeanor offense, and the existence of a domestic relationship need not be an element.[2] Rather, it may be proven independently during the personnel action litigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2524"></span>[2]&#x2003;This holding in no way relieves a prosecutor's burden to prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a criminal defendant had a domestic relationship as defined in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) in order to win a conviction under &#x00A7; 922(g)(9). Petitioner's citation of the rule that "[t]he Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he is charged," <span class="Italic">United States v. Gaudin</span>, 515 U.S. 506, 522-23 (1995), is, therefore, also inapt. White is not a criminal defendant, but simply a federal employee removed from his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next question then is whether the criminal statute as construed applies to White in his capacity as a federal employee. White appears to argue that on its face &#x00A7; 921 is unconstitutionally vague (and therefore void) because, he urges, it fails to put a person of ordinary intelligence on notice regarding what behavior is proscribed. He also specifically argues that, as applied to him, the Board's interpretation of the statutes is unconstitutionally vague and violates White's right to due process because the phrasing of &#x00A7; 921 "does not give a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know that although he was acquitted of the misdemeanor crime of domestic violence he is deemed to have been convicted of that very crime."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other circuits have also already addressed such arguments, and, again, more than satisfactorily. An alternate possible interpretation of the statutory text "does not by itself establish vagueness"; rather, the test is "whether it 'either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.'" <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 295 F.3d at 1366 (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Lanier</span>, 520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 137 L. Ed. 2d 432 (1997)). We see no such problem with this statute. Rather, we agree with the <span class="Italic">Barnes</span> and <span class="Italic">Smith</span> courts that "we would be hard pressed to find an individual of common, or even not so common, intelligence who could not determine whether he was in one of the enumerated relationships when he committed a misdemeanor crime including an element of physical force," and that the statute is, therefore, not void for vagueness. <span class="Italic">Barnes</span>, 295 F.3d at 1366 (quoting Smith, 171 F.3d at 623). We conclude that &#x00A7; 921(a)(33) is sufficiently clear to require us to reject White's facial vagueness attack.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">White presented hearsay evidence during the Board hearing that persons employed by the Virginia State Police informally informed him that he could carry a weapon. Initial Decision, slip op. at 9. This "evidence" is irrelevant to the question of vagueness for numerous reasons, but the most important of these reasons is that the subjective understanding of a couple of persons (who, in this case, may or may not have known all of the relevant facts) has never been a test of unconstitutional vagueness of a statute. White offers no precedent suggesting otherwise. Similarly, White's actual purchase of a weapon also lacks any probative value regarding the question of whether or not he was legally permitted to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, contrary to White's argument about the statute as applied to him, no one at any stage of these personnel proceedings has relied on any other conviction or "deemed [him] to have been convicted" of the original misdemeanor that was amended by the prosecutor from domestic assault to simple assault. The only conviction the Board relied upon to conclude that White is prohibited from possessing or receiving a firearm is the one for simple assault. This is entirely appropriate. As <span class="Italic">Smith</span> explains, the existence in the state penal code of an alternate misdemeanor that specifically incorporates a domestic relationship element does not make &#x00A7; 921 vague because "[t]he fact that [the defendant] could have been convicted under two misdemeanor statutes, one of which was arguably more applicable to the proscribed conduct, does not negate notice that conviction under the other similarly relevant misdemeanor statute could also serve as a predicate offense for &#x00A7; 922(g)(9)." 171 F.3d at 623. Thus, we too conclude that this statute is not unconstitutionally vague simply because Virginia too has two assault offenses, either of which fits White's conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">White also argues that the Board's finding that White "cohabitated with the victim as a spouse" or was "a person similarly situated to a spouse" was unsupported by substantial evidence. This argument is almost frivolous because the factual finding about White's relationship with Ms. Miles is overwhelmingly supported. The Board cited Ms. Miles' uncontradicted testimony that she lived with White continuously from August 1998 to June 1999 in the only residence either maintained, and thereafter maintained an intermittent relationship with him until the February 2000 incident, including a period from November 1999 to February 2000 in which White stayed "up to 5 days/nights a week with her," although maintaining a separate residence. This suggests continuous, complete cohabitation for at least ten months, and substantial cohabitation for close to a year and a half prior to the assault. The Board also referred to numerous details of Miles' testimony that tended to show that the nature of the relationship was "as a spouse," or at least similar to a spousal relationship, including expectations of fidelity and monogamy, shared expenses, shared household responsibilities, social activities in common, and discussions about having children. The Board also specifically found that although the petitioner did testify during the Board hearing, he "did not address, much less deny, the factual statements that were made by Ms. Miles in her testimony concerning the period of August 1998 to June 1999 during which she stated that they [lived] together."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having concluded that &#x00A7; 922 does constrain White, we now turn to the correctness of the Board's conclusion that the Warden's decision to remove White was lawful. In order to sustain a removal based on the interaction of a prior simple assault conviction with &#x00A7; 922 of the federal penal code for any employee who is required at work to carry a firearm, an agency, if challenged before the Board, must simply prove the domestic nature (here, spouse-like) of the employee's relationship with the victim as of the time of the assault, or anytime before the assault. We hold that the Board correctly sustained the Warden's decision that White's legal disability to lawfully possess a firearm constituted a "Loss of Qualifications" and warranted removal. The Board's decision was correct both because it was supported by substantial evidence and because it was "in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c) (2000). Specifically, all of the circumstances of White's conviction and relationship with Ms. Miles constitute substantial evidence supporting the Board's decision to sustain the removal. The Warden was not obligated to wait for White actually to commit or be investigated or arrested for a violation of &#x00A7; 922 to conclude that he was not permitted by law to carry a firearm. In fact, it was incumbent on the Warden to remove any person who is unable to perform the full range of required duties because he or she is prohibited under &#x00A7; 922(g) from possessing a firearm, as here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner argues that the Board's decision was not in accordance with law because he cannot be found guilty of a "misdemeanor crime of domestic violence" (as defined in &#x00A7; 921(a)(33)) because he was "acquitted" of the Virginia state charge of misdemeanor domestic violence. Petitioner's argument is misdirected because the Board did not purport to find him guilty of <span class="Italic">any</span> offense. The Board's conclusion that the Warden correctly determined that petitioner was prohibited from carrying a firearm (because in carrying a firearm he would be committing a criminal act as a result of his earlier conviction) was based on a correct understanding of the law. Specifically, the Board held that "the appellant failed to meet a condition of, or qualification for, employment by being unable [sic, meaning legal disability] to possess any firearm or ammunition," and as a result, "the agency established by preponderant evidence the merits of its charge." Initial Decision, slip op. at 12. The Board's decision actually did not assume that the petitioner would be convictable for violating &#x00A7; 922. The legal prohibition, in any event, makes his removal lawful since he was obligated to be qualified to possess a firearm by his job requirements. The Board's decision did not rest on the domestic violence offense of which he was "acquitted." Contrary to what White argues then, there was no violation of due process, or unconstitutional double-jeopardy effect. Even assuming that White had been "acquitted" of one offense, moreover, does not make his removal based on conviction of another "wrongful," as the <span class="Italic">Smith</span> court noted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]f White's argument is centered not on deficiencies in the proof about his job requirements, but rather concerns the interstate commerce requirement of the statute, then the argument is simply on its face unconvincing. If White is suggesting that the Warden provide White a firearm and ammunition that never traveled in interstate commerce, such an argument must be rejected as wholly impractical. Not only would it be virtually impossible to find firearms or ammunition that did not have the very minimal contacts with interstate commerce required by &#x00A7; 922(g)(9), but also, in requiring correctional officers to be qualified to carry a gun, the Department of Justice must have also assumed that these correctional officers would be able to use and possess any gun or any ammunition because, as a practical matter, those who are expected to use firearms in emergency situations cannot be under the obligation to first ascertain the provenance of the firearms or ammunition given to them and to then decline to use all but a few....</p>
