<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-204"><span class="space">5.</span> Evidence of Reprisal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In an IRA case, the appellant is entitled to demonstrate that a dispute of material fact exists requiring an evidentiary hearing for resolution. The hearing, or any factual determination in an IRA case, is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, and it is error for the AJ to make findings adverse to the appellant based on statements in an OSC closure letter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pashun v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 374, 380 (1997) (appellant in an IRA case has the right to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review of OSC findings, including those affecting Board jurisdiction); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USDA</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 55 (1994) (citing <span class="Italic">Beam v. OPM,</span> 61 MSPR 54, 60 (1994), for the proposition that an appellant does not have a right to an evidentiary hearing on issues involving no dispute of material fact, but if the appeal is within the jurisdiction of the Board, he will be allowed to attempt to show that there is a material dispute on the merits requiring an evidentiary hearing for resolution). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-208.html#sec13-202">Agency's Clear and Convincing Evidence; <span class="Italic">Carr</span> Factors</a>," for analysis of conflicting evidence offered in support of or defense to IRA appeals.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is seldom direct evidence of reprisal, as the Federal Circuit observed in <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 1237, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not surprised that there is no direct evidence here of reprisal. The legislative history of the WPA acknowledges that such evidence would be "rare." S. Rep. No. 413, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1988). After all, "supervisors do not usually write down or tell other employees of their intent to take prohibited reprisal against an employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Whereas the presence of direct evidence may be fatal to the case of a charged supervisor, its absence therefore does not weigh as heavily against the Special Counsel's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board in the instant case drew a reasonable inference, which we may not disturb.... This finding required the Board to synthesize sometimes incongruent testimony and to make credibility determinations. We may not upset the Board's reasonable choices so long as they are supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The counterpart to the lack of direct evidence is a case built on circumstantial or inferential evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jones v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP No. 2017-1055) (VEOA, USERRA: "This court appreciates that '[b]ecause employers rarely concede an improper motivation for their employment actions,...[the] burden to establish that...military service...was a motive in the challenged action [may be met] by submitting evidence from which such a motive <span class="Italic">may be fairly inferred</span>.' <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 812 F.3d 1364, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (emphasis added)." <span class="Italic">See Alarid v. Dept. of Army</span>, SF-0752-14-0256-B-2 (NP 3/13/2023) ("In assessing whether the agency has met its burden by clear and convincing evidence, the Board must consider all the pertinent evidence in the record, and it must not exclude or ignore countervailing evidence by only looking at the evidence that supports the agency's position. <span class="Italic">See Herman v. Department of Justice</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 15 (2013) (citing <span class="Italic">Whitmore v. Department of Labor</span>, 680 F.3d 1353, 1367-70 (Fed. Cir. 2012)).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A former Special Counsel developed a course for agency managers entitled "How To Avoid Committing Prohibited Personnel Practices in the Reagan Era: An OSC Seminar." For the course, OSC developed a manual of the same title. Although the manual was criticized by some for disclosing OSC investigative techniques, it provided insight into the types of proof that may be used in establishing reprisal. After explaining what constituted a protected disclosure, the manual provided succinct examples of circumstantial proof:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">NOTE: Retaliatory motive may be shown through circumstantial evidence. The following are commonly examined during an investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Proximity in time between the protected disclosure and the personnel action. Where there is a close proximity and the agency officials involved knew of the protected disclosures an inference of retaliatory motive arises.... However, the time interval is only one factor in finding retaliation....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">As an example of how a court and the Board examine the components of a reprisal case, the Federal Circuit affirmed a Board finding of lack of reprisal against an employee who filed a grievance and then a lawsuit against a supervisor and the agency. The Board concluded that the employee would have been removed even if the protected activity had not taken place. The relevant factors were: the appellant's performance deficiencies preceded his protected activity; those deficiencies were considered serious by the deciding official; the appellant was difficult to handle; there was close scrutiny of his situation by the proposing and deciding officials (who were unconnected with the protected activity); the severe sanction of removal was imposed only after alternatives were considered and rejected; there was no evidence of disparate treatment of the appellant; and although the supervisor continued to evaluate the employee, the actual decisions were made by others who were untainted by the employee's protected activity. <span class="Italic">Carsello v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3291). For another decision analyzing performance trends, prior misconduct, and allegations of misconduct, refer to <span class="Italic">Crist v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 35 (1991).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lednar v. SSA</span>, 82 MSPR 364 (1999), involved an appellant with an emotional disturbance who was discharged for a pattern of rude behavior. The appellant made protected disclosures, known to the deciding official and close enough in time to the disciplinary action that a link could be inferred. The AJ determined that the agency should have either accommodated the appellant's problem or removed him for disability rather than for misconduct. The AJ reasoned that the agency's inappropriate reaction evidenced reprisal. The Board set aside the AJ's determination. The Board concluded, without much reasoning, that the appellant's misconduct warranted removal and that removal would have occurred without the appellant's protected activity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 93 MSPR 166, 173 &#x00B6; 15 (2002) (agency demonstrated that it would have terminated the appellant had there been no whistleblowing when the appellant did not complete required job training and failed to report to a position assigned by detail, instead reporting to another position in violation of instructions regarding her detail).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant may attempt to establish reprisal by showing agency patterns or trends in the treatment of similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Wagner v. EPA</span>, 54 MSPR 447, 453 (1992) (relying on <span class="Italic">Umshler v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 44 MSPR 628, 631, 634 (1990)). An inference of reprisal arising from the timing of an action following a complaint may be rebutted if another, similarly situated employee who also files a complaint is not the victim of adverse action. <span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 39 MSPR 217, 223 (1988) (RIF of one of the two library employees who had filed EEO complaints). The conduct of an agency investigation may indicate whether reprisal was a factor, particularly if the investigation was carried out in an irregular fashion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Geyer v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 682, 688 (1996) (no dramatic irregularity in the inquiry into the appellant's alleged misconduct). The agency's failure to provide comparator evidence that could be probative may lead to a determination that the challenged personnel action resulted from whistleblowing reprisal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Miller v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20161202112">842 F.3d 1252</a> (Fed. Cir. 2016) (agency could have, but did not, show whether, beyond the confines of a single institution, it routinely reassigned personnel who worked in a unit where they might affect the outcome of an ongoing IG investigation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson v. Farm Credit Admin.</span>, 51 MSPR 569, 581-85 (1991), examined in detail WPA reprisal claims. Appellant, a GS-14 Financial Analyst, was removed for unacceptable performance. The Board determined that his removal was unsupported due to inadequate performance standards and that the appellant was dismissed in retaliation for the appellant's protected activity. The appellant opposed the FCA Chairman's decision that certain information about the financial condition of the Farm Credit System should not be revealed to Congress. The appellant told the Chairman that it was "irresponsible" not to reveal to Congress the fact that the System needed financial assistance because Congress had earlier reorganized FCA when its officials failed to keep Congress fully informed. The Board explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant made clear to top agency officials, including the Chairman, his position that the financial data upon which he relied, which was developed by a committee of experts, depicted a truer picture of the financial situation of the agency than the picture painted by the Chairman. The appellant's position, although contrary to that of the Chairman, was reasonable. Based on his expertise and that of others who generated the financial information, he had reason to believe that the numbers were accurate. Further, the appellant's expressions of disagreement with the Chairman's views consistently were based on the appellant's understanding of congressional desire to be kept fully advised of the financial status of the Farm Credit System.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant's expression of his view may not itself have been intended as a disclosure of waste, fraud, or abuse, the Board finds that the record as a whole establishes that, based on that statement regarding his view of the appropriate financial model to report to Congress, and the appellant's later actions, the Chairman perceived the appellant as a whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly determined that the accused official, the Chairman, knew of the appellant's protected activity. It is undisputed that the appellant argued his position about the financial plight of the Farm Credit System directly to the Chairman. Thus, the administrative <span id="Page_4008"></span>judge correctly found that the second prong of the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> test had been met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proposing and deciding officials were aware of the appellant's protected disclosure. The appellant's third-line supervisor informed his first line supervisor, the proposing official, of the protected activity and of the Chairman's reaction to it. The deciding official was also aware of the protected activity and that the appellant's position with respect to the extent of the financial need of the Farm Credit System was not accepted. Under these circumstances, it is immaterial that the Chairman, who supplied the only direct evidence of retaliation by stating that the appellant should be fired for his protected activity, did not play a formal role in the appellant's removal. Where the head of the agency has expressed a desire to have an employee fired, one may assume that officials serving him, knowing his view, could have retaliated in deference to his authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstantial evidence of retaliation by officials who were not the direct targets of the appellant's protected disclosures outweighs the presumption of their obligation to act in good faith to uphold the law. Agency officials who were unaware of the Chairman's feelings about the appellant uniformly respected the appellant's work....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant's supervisor consistently exercised her discretion against the appellant. She ignored the appellant's outstanding interim review in her performance rating. Also, she maintained her harsh judgment of the appellant's first draft of the calculation of bond premiums assignment despite circumstances around the drafting of that assignment weighing in the appellant's favor.... Finally, the appellant's supervisor did not allow her unacceptable rating to be tempered by an acknowledgment that the program developed by the appellant allowed others to follow similar supervisor directions more quickly than any other program available in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite evidence that the appellant's unacceptable performance was limited by the appellant's immediate correction of his error and the fact that the error did not affect the work of any other employee, the deciding official meted out the harshest possible penalty, that suggested by the Chairman. Additionally...the appellant's supervisor made critical for the appellant an element that was not critical for others working under the same performance standards, and she stated that she took this action because of the reprimand given the appellant in direct response to the Chairman's statement that he should be fired. Thus, the administrative judge properly found that the intensity of the motive to retaliate outweighed the inadequacy of the performance of the appellant's duties....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the Board finds that not only does the record show nexus between the retaliatory motive and the appellant's removal, but the retaliatory motive was the genesis of the charge of unsatisfactory performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the Board finds that the agency did not show by preponderant evidence that it would have removed the appellant absent the retaliatory motive.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For other examples of factually intensive balancing of protected activity and charges against the appellant, leading to a finding of reprisal against an individual who protested financial settlements of unmeritorious EEO complaints, refer to <span class="Italic">Garst v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 371, 377 (1993), applying IRA burdens of proof, and to <span class="Italic">Geyer v. DOJ</span>, 70 MSPR 682, 698 (1996), reversing an AJ's determination that the appellant was the victim of reprisal despite the assumption that whistleblowing may have contributed to his removal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grubb v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 96 MSPR 377, 401 &#x00B6; 60 (2004) (factor weighing against reprisal was the agency's <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> consideration of her arguments why her retained grade and pay benefits should not be terminated; "[h]ad the agency been motivated by improper animus, it could have rejected the appellant's arguments entirely"); <span class="Italic">Rutberg v. OSHRC</span>, 78 MSPR 130, 144 (1998) (reversing a finding of reprisal in the RIF of an ALJ; a review of the extensive record revealed weak evidence of a retaliatory motive by agency decisionmakers who were not the targets of allegations of wrongdoing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board finds some evidence of reprisal without extensive factfinding, <span class="Italic">Smith v. USDA</span>, 64 MSPR 46, 65 (1994) (remanding for further analysis of causation under the WPA):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence thus shows that the agency officials who made the decision to withhold the appellant's within-grade increase considered the appellant to be a whistleblower, and that they made the decision to withhold the within-grade increase less than a year after they became aware of the appellant's protected activity. The evidence further shows that one of the officials knew that the appellant's whistleblowing had led to discipline of agency employees, and that another official felt that his career was threatened by the appellant's whistleblowing. Based on this evidence, we AFFIRM the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's whistleblowing was a contributing factor in the withholding of his within-grade increase.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reprisal is usually established, or not established, through circumstantial evidence. Direct evidence may exist, however, as in <span class="Italic">Powell v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 00-3079). Ms. Powell alleged that she was a whistleblower who suffered reprisal through an adverse action. The agency's deciding official stated in the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> (mitigation) analysis included in his decision letter that the factors he considered included the "tensions caused by Ms. Powell's unfounded allegations of misconduct against her supervisor." The court remanded the case to the arbitrator for application of the proper legal analytical standard. As to circumstantial evidence, under <span class="Italic">Fellhoelter v. USDA</span>, 568 F.3d 965, 971 (Fed. Cir. 2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because direct evidence of a deciding official's retaliatory motive is rare, petitioners are entitled to rely on circumstantial evidence giving rise to an inference of impermissible intent. <span class="Italic">See Webster v. Dep't of Army,</span> 911 F.2d 679, 689-90 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">see also Sheehan v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 240 F.3d 1009, 1014 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In some cases, evidence of retaliatory motive is also relevant to the petitioner's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case; for example, evidence of an employee's assertions of misconduct by a supervisor can be relevant to whether the employee has made a protected disclosure and also whether the supervisor has a strong motivation to retaliate.</p>
