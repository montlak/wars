<p class="Body-Text">Threatening one's subordinate or one's supervisor with frivolous legal action represents poor judgment. <span class="Italic">Coons v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 15 MSPR 1, 4-5 (1983) (appellant was charged with interfering in an investigation of him for an appearance of a conflict of interest when he told witnesses suspected of being his accusers that "he would find out who was behind this and 'sue the bastards,' not caring who won or lost, only to cost those involved a large amount of money"; "threatening one's subordinate and one's supervisor with frivolous legal action is conduct that represents poor judgment, especially from a person who is a supervisor of approximately eighty persons"); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Coppola v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 307, 317 (1991) ("It is one thing to tell an employee that he might lose his job if he is convicted of physically assaulting another Postal Service employee. It is quite another matter for a postal manager to tell an employee that he (the manager) personally will take steps to have the employee arrested, and will then use that arrest as a basis for an adverse personnel action."). <span class="Italic">Hoag v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 449, 456 (1993), appeared to consider as evidence of reprisal a supervisor's expression of intent to sue a subordinate he believed to be a whistleblower.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expanded on its analysis of threats of legal action, <span class="Italic">Alsedek v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 229, 239 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant admonished his employees to tell the truth. Regardless of how vehemently this was done or in what setting, it does not amount to intimidation, as it was the duty of all parties to tell the truth. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garst</span>, 56 MSPR at 380. Furthermore, the appellant's comments regarding retaining an attorney and possibly filing a civil suit do not constitute intimidation. The appellant clearly has the right to take such actions, and it cannot have been a surprise to learn that he would hire an attorney to represent him in these proceedings. Although the witnesses may not have thought of the possibility of a civil suit, the appellant's informing his employees that he might take an action that is within his rights cannot be construed as intimidation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not contain evidence showing that the appellant suggested that an employee either not testify or not testify truthfully. Nor does it contain evidence showing that the appellant directed any personal threats toward an employee or intimated that adverse consequences would befall a particular employee should testimony be unfavorable. Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in sustaining this charge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Threatening to release information concerning mismanagement to the press, i.e., a threat to blow the whistle, may enjoy limited protection if the agency then seizes on this threat to invoke discipline. <span class="Italic">Berube v. GSA</span>, 30 MSPR 581, 596-99 (1986), noted as to a threat to blow the whistle and attempts to secure a favorable settlement by a suggestion of forebearance from whistleblowing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Charge 2 concerns statements made by the appellant to Administrator Carmen in January of 1983, when appellant was about to be detailed out of the position of Regional Administrator. It alleges that appellant attempted to "coerce" Administrator Carmen by threatening to "go to the press" unless the Administrator "permitted [him] to continue serving in the position of Regional Administrator." The presiding official found that since the threat did not stem from "a concern by the appellant for the public," but constituted, instead, "menacing behavior for his personal benefit," the appellant's conduct was not protected by the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was in error. Congress intended whistleblowers to be protected if they reasonably believed in their protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett</span>, 26 MSPR 60 (1985). We have held that "regardless of a whistleblower's alleged personal motivations, the law's protections do extend to employees who reasonably believe in their charges." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 70, n.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, the law is silent with regard to whether an announced intention to make protected disclosures is similarly protected. However, we have held in an appeal rights reprisal case, that it would frustrate the purposes of the Reform Act's protections if employees could be retaliated against for announcing their intention to exercise a protected right. <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Harvey</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 595 (1984). That holding was based upon the fact that retaliation, in these circumstances, "would have a chilling effect on employees' exercise of their...rights." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 606. The same rationale is applicable to the interpretation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Whistleblowing protections, therefore, encompass protection for an announced intention to make protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant charge presents an additional issue which the Board has not previously addressed. The charge is not predicated solely upon the appellant's allegedly improper motives or upon his stated intentions to make protected disclosures. It is based, in addition, on appellant's demand that unless he was not detailed, he would make such disclosures. In effect, the appellant said, "I will blow the whistle unless I am allowed to remain as Regional Administrator." That demand raises the question of whether whistleblowing protections should apply when employees ask for something in exchange for not making protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously interpreted and guaranteed the protections of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and (9) in order to effectuate the purposes of the law. The same consideration needs to be addressed in judging the appellant's conduct in this case; i.e., would expanding the protections to an employee who asks for a <span class="Italic">quid pro quo</span>--in exchange for not blowing the whistle in the press about mismanagement in which he reasonably believes--effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). The answer to that question turns on what has been requested in exchange for the proposed silence. If the employee said, "I will blow the whistle unless the mismanagement, fraud or abuse is corrected," that request should be protected since it directly relates to the substance of the whistleblowing. However, if the employee said, "I will blow the whistle about a contractor's unlawful activity unless I am promoted," that request should not be protected since it bears no relationship to the substance of the threatened whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Charge 2, the appellant's demand did directly relate to alleged mismanagement. The agency had initiated a nationwide personnel reduction program which was not mandated by law. The appellant reasonably believed that such a policy would adversely affect the agency's ability to provide services. Immediately after making a documented presentation to management officials regarding objections to that policy, appellant was informed of his first detail. Under those circumstances, we conclude that the unidentified disclosures which the appellant threatened to make regarded the same policy objections which he had been voicing internally and which he believed were the basis for his reassignment by detail. Thus, Charge 2 is predicated upon conduct which, in order to effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), must be regarded as protected. Therefore, the charge cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Count 5 also concerns allegedly coercive statements made to the Administrator. In July of 1983, an unsatisfactory rating was issued to the appellant by his supervisor. If that rating were upheld by a performance review board, it could have formed the basis for appellant's removal from the SES. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4314(b)(3). Appellant then hired an attorney. Charge 5 alleges that in a meeting with the Administrator, the attorney asserted that the appellant would "not continue to wage a campaign against the agency in the news media" if certain conditions relating to the poor performance rating were met by the agency. Those conditions were that the appellant be allowed to retain his position of record; that he be detailed to one of four specific executive positions; that he receive a fully satisfactory rating; that he be given a letter of recommendation <span id="Page_2705"></span>to assist him in seeking outside employment; and that, upon obtaining such employment, "he be reassigned outside the commuting area" so that he could refuse the reassignment, becoming automatically eligible for an immediate annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that a sham geographic reassignment was requested in exchange for not making protected disclosures distinguishes this demand from that in Charge 2. This demand is also distinguishable since it is not at all clear that the substance of the unidentified disclosures, which the appellant would have refrained from making, bore any relationship to what was being requested on behalf of the appellant. The appellant sought to forestall a performance based action by offering to trade silence for a better rating. We cannot conclude that the appellant, given his appalling performance on the two details, had a reasonable belief that that rating was connected to anything other than the quality of his work. Absent the appellant showing a relationship between what he asked for and the substance of the intended whistleblowing, it would not further Congress' intent to encourage whistleblowing for us to find that his behavior was protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). As we noted in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Starrett,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 60, 70 n.7 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Employees cannot immunize themselves from agency actions merely by donning the clothes of a whistleblower. (<span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 8 (1978), reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2730-2731, "nor would the bill protect employees who claim to be whistleblowers in order to avoid [an] adverse action....") Supportable adverse actions not predicated upon protected activity may always be taken against employees. While the law encourages and protects whistleblowing, it does not give whistleblowers a license to perform unsatisfactorily or to engage in misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if we were able to discern a connection between the intended disclosures and the demanded conditions, the conduct would still not have been protected under these facts. Admittedly, some of the conditions demanded by the attorney were not unlawful by themselves. However, they were contained in a proposed overall solution to the appellant's performance-related problems, and all of the conditions were part and parcel of an unlawful scheme under which the appellant, once he obtained outside employment, could claim an unwarranted entitlement to an annuity through the artifice of a sham reassignment. Congress did not intend to authorize whistleblowers' demands that laws be violated. Therefore, where a request for an unlawful benefit is made in exchange for silence, we find that it would not effectuate the purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) to extend its protections as a shield to insulate employees from the consequences of demanding illegal actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we find that Charge 5 does not describe protected whistleblowing activity, we conclude, however, that the alleged conduct was still not actionable. The attorney was attempting to settle appellant's performance dispute with the agency. Public policy encourages settlements and would be generally disserved by allowing demands made in settlement negotiations to form a separate basis for an agency action. Such policy considerations could, of course, be overridden had the attorney engaged in truly threatening and/or criminal behavior. However, here the agency was not placed in any real or imagined danger by the request for an unlawful reassignment in exchange for appellant not making protected disclosures. It could, as it did, deny the request. Under these circumstances, no useful purpose would be served by allowing the attorney's actions to form the basis for a separate charge of misconduct or malfeasance against the appellant. This is particularly true where, as here, there is no direct evidence of the appellant's involvement in the allegedly wrongful behavior, since he was not present at the meeting and both he and his attorney denied that the appellant had any role in the actions taken by the attorney at that meeting. Charge 5 is, therefore, not sustained.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">From the FLRA, there is some discussion on threats of lawsuits. Threats of lawsuits by supervisors against employees in the unit were considered in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Louisville Dist., IRS and NTEU</span>, 20 FLRA 660 (1985). The threat of a lawsuit by a supervisor, contained in a lawyer's letter to the union and a unit employee, explicitly recognized the right to pursue grievances and objected to disparaging statements being made about the supervisor outside normal channels. The concerns expressed in the letter stemmed from what the Authority determined to be serious allegations of misconduct that the supervisor would want to refute. Those allegations were made both outside and inside normal channels to members of the supervisory hierarchy and to fellow employees of the supervisor. The allegations against the supervisor had detrimental effect on the workplace. The threat of the lawsuit did not constitute a ULP. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> distinguished an NLRB decision, <span class="Italic">Clyde Taylor Co.</span>, 127 NLRB 103 (1960): there the threat to file a lawsuit was conditioned on continuation of a ULP charge and was direct interference with protected activity.<span class="Italic"> See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD, DCMA Orlando and AFGE Local 3953</span>, 59 FLRA 223 (2003) (determining to be protected the threat by a union official to sue a manager as a result of the manager's inquiries into the union official's protected activities); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Aviation Ctr. and AFGE Local 1815</span>, 46 FLRA 535, 545-46 (1992) (ALJ Decision) (threat to sue an employee for slander was not a ULP when the threat was not conditioned upon the employee's withdrawal of charge and there was no actual discouragement of the employee's pursuit of protected activity).
