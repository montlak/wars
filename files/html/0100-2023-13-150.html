<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-149"><span class="space">b.</span> Prior Law: Reasonable Cause to Believe</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier law, interpreting an earlier (pre-1984) version of 5 CFR 831.1203(c), was that an agency could not separate by adverse action an employee who met the service requirements for disability retirement and whose mental condition impaired his judgment and ability to make decisions, if that condition was known or should be known to the agency, without first either advising the employee of his right to apply for disability retirement or applying for disability retirement on his behalf. <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 526, 528, 4 MSPB 44 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Shepard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 325, 327-28 (1981) (agency was not required to file on behalf of the appellant when the appellant previously filed an application that was denied by OPM); <span class="Italic">Rolig v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 502, 504-05 (1981) (stating the rule and noting that under the circumstances of the case, the agency was not required to file a request for reconsideration of an OPM denial of disability retirement, although there might be circumstances requiring that step before the employee was separated).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The obligation of an agency toward an employee with a mental disability was either to apply for disability on behalf of the employee or advise the employee of the right to file, prior to removing the employee. <span class="Italic">Swanson v. DLA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2404). If the employee's mental condition impaired his judgment and ability to make decisions, it was not sufficient for the agency only to suggest to the employee that he voluntarily apply for disability retirement. The employer had to initiate the application. <span class="Italic">Goldsborough v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 521, 523, 6 MSPB 437 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 207, 208, 4 MSPB 285 (1980) (agency was to proceed first to retire an employee on a disability annuity, before proceeding with a removal action, when the agency had knowledge that the employee may be mentally impaired and unable to rationally consider filing for disability himself). Before the agency attempted to remove the employee for cause, it was to file for disability retirement for an employee considered mentally impaired. <span class="Italic">Morris v. VA</span>, 6 MSPR 68, 70, 6 MSPB 69 (1981). If the employee's misconduct was suspected to be the product of mental disability, the agency was to initiate involuntary retirement rather than adverse action procedures, even though the employee had been examined months before and had been found to suffer no mental illness. <span class="Italic">Jarze v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 4 MSPR 164, 167, 4 MSPB 247 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement of knowledge of mental impairment was characterized by the Board as an "obvious awareness" of the employee's mental condition, "ample reason for believing" that the employee was suffering from mental or physical disorders, or "information which would lead a reasonable person to believe that the possibility of total mental disability existed." The requirement did not depend upon an actual diagnosis of a specific mental condition. Nor was it necessary to show a direct causal link between the suspected disability and service deficiencies before the employer was under a duty to advise the employee to apply for disability retirement or to apply on his behalf. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Morgan</span>, 263 F.2d 903 (D.C. Cir. 1959); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Elber v. VA</span>, 12 MSPR 350, 351 (1982) (citing <span class="Italic">Hill</span>); <span class="Italic">Brink v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 358, 360, 4 MSPB 419 (1980) ("[A]n agency is under an obligation to determine through the use of a fitness for duty examination whether an employee is totally disabled, and to apply on the employee's behalf for disability retirement if the employee is unable or unwilling to do so.... Yet a prerequisite for such an obligation is the reasonable belief on the part of the responsible agency officials that the employee may be totally disabled."). [Refer to the <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> decision and others later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-13-150.html#sec6-149">Prior Law: Reasonable Cause to Believe</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A supervisor's awareness that an employee might have emotional problems was not a sufficient basis for requiring the agency to compel a mental fitness examination and to initiate disability retirement for the employee, before taking adverse action. The regulations governing mental fitness examinations were intended to protect the employees from unwarranted examinations. Before the agency was to direct the examination and initiate retirement in lieu of adverse action, reasonable cause was necessary for believing that the employee's deficiencies were related to mental illness or disease and that the employee met service requirements for disability annuity. <span class="Italic">Payne v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 217, 219, 6 MSPB 189 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board refined the agency's duty under pre-1984 OPM regulations to assist employees with mental impairments in <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 115, 118 (1982), stating a conservative approach later reversed in court. Relying on what was then a general requirement that an agency refer an eligible mentally disabled employee for retirement or initiate retirement for that employee, and recognizing that the agency was under a duty to use a fitness for duty examination to determine whether the disability was due to mental or emotional conditions, nonetheless, the Board determined, there is a fine line between behavior that is vicious or intemperate and behavior having its roots in mental disease or injury (although the Board did not suggest how agencies were supposed to discern that dividing line without a fitness examination). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brink v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 358, 361-62, 4 MSPB 419 (1980) (using the same analysis and focusing on what agency officials knew); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Risner v. FAA</span>, 7 MSPR 480, 485 n.1, 7 MSPB 342 (1981) ("The possibility of mental illness is always present in cases where employees are removed for aberrant conduct."). Under <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>, the agency action should be considered in light of what the agency knew at the time action was taken against the employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's opinion in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span> did not sit well with the court of appeals. The court remanded the case for reconsideration, pointing out that the agency cannot be expected to make a medical diagnosis that disability does or does not exist; this function belongs to OPM and to the physicians employed by OPM to review disability retirement applications. The standard to be used was the "reason to believe" test; often, the court noted, the only way to establish that a mental disability exists is through a psychiatric examination. Refusal of the examination by the employee should lead the agency to file a disability application and permit OPM processing. <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1983). On remand, the Board ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 107, 108 (1984). <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Carlson v. Customs Serv.</span>, 692 F.2d 85 (9th Cir. 1982) (interpreting the [now defunct] FPM Ch 752-1, subch. S1-3a5(a) instructions concerning the use of a fitness examination to determine potential impairment of an employee as to whom an agency could have a duty to initiate retirement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lizut,</span> the Board decided that the obligation to refer the appellant for a fitness examination arose if the agency noted disruptive behavior by the employee, if the agency had already referred the employee <span id="Page_2200"></span>to an assistance program, and if the employer was aware that a physician suspected emotional difficulties. OPM's statement in the late FPM that the employee, if able, should initiate disability retirement was guidance and did not relieve the agency of its responsibility to act for the employee. <span class="Italic">Knapp v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 24 MSPR 605, 609 n.2 (1984). An agency should have initiated retirement proceedings for an employee who complained to the U.S. Attorney that agency officials were conspiring to kill him; management officials considered the employee to be unstable, and the agency referred the employee to a psychological service. <span class="Italic">Reckard v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 25 MSPR 151, 154 (1984). An agency could not remove an employee rather than referring him for disability retirement after the employee threatened coworkers with a knife. Agency inspectors who interviewed the appellant concerning the charges concluded that he appeared slightly emotionally disturbed; additionally, the appellant told the agency that he was a psychiatric outpatient. The case was remanded to the regional office for reconsideration. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 314, 316-17 (1984). In another appeal, an employee presented a letter to his supervisor from a behavioral consultant from whom the appellant sought help concerning feelings of insecurity, anxiety, and memory difficulties. The supervisor knew that the appellant was seeing a psychiatrist, ordered a fitness for duty examination, but removed the appellant before receiving the results. The removal was reversed. <span class="Italic">Bohlken v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 25 MSPR 209, 211-12 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem identified in <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>--trying to distinguish the employee with mental impairment from the employee who is mentally well and responsible for serious misconduct--proved to be a problem for the courts as well. In one nonprecedential decision, <span class="Italic">Webb v. GPO</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-1513), there was evidence of an appellant's violent behavior and some employees and supervisors viewed the appellant as acting abnormally (while others did not), but the court concluded that the agency had not erred by firing the employee rather than referring him for retirement proceedings. That an employee had serious problems getting along with his superiors and his fellow employees could show emotional difficulties, but these problems did not necessarily suggest that he was totally disabled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Faulk v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-727) (removal for a threat, abusive language, and poor performance). Perhaps more than aberrational conduct needed to be present: a past history of psychiatric problems, visits by the employee to an agency psychologist or counselor, self-referral by the employee for medical evaluation, or conduct that clearly suggested to the layman the employee's inability to act rationally or relate rationally to his environment. The question of when an agency was to attempt to use disability retirement rather than adverse action procedures for persons whose behavior seemed aberrational was addressed, to a degree, in <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-755), marking a conceptual departure from <span class="Italic">Lizut</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner contends that the FDA was obligated to conduct a psychiatric fitness-for-duty examination as soon as it had any reason to believe that she may have been totally disabled for useful and efficient service. She cites a number of incidents that occurred between 1979 and 1982, the most serious of which involved her locking herself in her supervisor's office one day until she was removed by security guards, as indicia that the FDA had reason to believe that she may have been totally disabled for work in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner's argument misconstrues the nature of agencies' obligations to file applications for disability retirement. Under 5 CFR 831.1203(a), agencies <span class="Italic">may</span> direct an employee to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination if they have reason to believe that he may be totally disabled for service. They are not <span class="Italic">required</span> to direct an employee to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination whenever they have any suspicion that an employee may be totally disabled--instead, they are directed by this regulation to take great care to require such an examination only when "it appears to be necessary." <span class="Italic">Brink v. VA</span>, 4 MSPB 419, 420 (1980). Indeed, the only requirement for agencies is that they must file an application for disability retirement if they are of the <span class="Italic">opinion</span> that an employee is totally disabled from useful and efficient service. 5 CFR 831.1203(c)(1); <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Army</span>, 717 F.2d 1391, 1394 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the FDA never indicated its opinion or expressed any reason to believe that petitioner was totally disabled from service. Moreover, the record shows that the Board was not arbitrary or capricious in finding insufficient evidence to charge the agency with knowledge of a handicapping condition that could render her totally disabled for service. For example, it is clear from the record that the agency was advised by examining psychiatrists that even after petitioner's most serious disturbances, she was medically fit to return to work.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If existing medical evidence revealed a mental impairment, the agency was not required to order a fitness examination to confirm what it already knew. <span class="Italic">Rhodes v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 21 MSPR 193, 195 (1984) ("Appellant has not suggested how any supplemental medical evidence would have affected the agency's evaluation of the situation."). If agency medical reports and those of appellant's physician indicated no basis for requesting a psychiatric examination, despite occasional inappropriate statements by appellant to her coworkers, the agency was not required to send the appellant for a fitness examination for a possible disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">Lohr v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 24 MSPR 383, 387 (1984). If physicians were of the opinion that the appellant could work, the agency had no duty to file for disability retirement on an employee's behalf. <span class="Italic">Miller v. DHHS</span>, 23 MSPR 128, 135 (1984) ("Appellant's supervisors and managers consistently testified that they believed the appellant to be rational and that she merely had difficulty in accepting supervision and direction."). If an employee was removed for physical inability to perform his job, it was not harmful error for the agency to take that action without a medical examination by its own physician or a Public Health Service physician. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 335, 336-37, 5 MSPB 360 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Iese v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 94, 95 n.* (1985) (agency did not err by failing to administer a fitness exam when the information from the appellant's physician, and the absence of a dispute by the appellant concerning the evidence, supported the agency's action).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency could discount inconclusive evidence of mental disability. As to a claim of mental disability related to actions preceding removal, the Board properly gave a psychiatric report little probative value when it was based on only one interview, did not indicate that it relied on any testing of the petitioner, and did not find that the employee appeared to be grossly disturbed. <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3039); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Kotichas v. VA</span>, 14 MSPR 193, 195-96 (1982) (discounting a medical evaluation based on the appellant's statements during an oral reply to an adverse action rather than upon a medical examination). Although an agency could be required to file for disability retirement for an unwilling employee, there was no reasonable belief by agency officials that the employee was totally disabled when the agency had only one psychiatrist's report recommending a change in jobs and when the employee refused to report for a fitness examination. The agency could not have reasonably concluded that the appellant was totally disabled. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 294, 298-99 (1983). On appeal in <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, the court determined that even if the agency should have applied for disability retirement on behalf of the employee, the issue was mooted by the employee's own submission of a retirement application to OPM. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-570).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agency errors under prior law did not automatically void a termination action. <span class="Italic">Abatecola v. VA</span>, 29 MSPR 601, 610 n.5 (1986), applied a harmful error standard:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency was obligated to file for the appellant's retirement under [5 CFR 831.1203(a)], its failure to do so did not constitute harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Department of the Army</span>, 29 MSPR 598, 601 (1986). We note, however, that the appellant may file a disability retirement application on his own behalf within one year after his separation from the service. 5 CFR 831.501(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was not harmful error for an agency to fail to initiate an application for disability, in lieu of an adverse action, for an individual with a physical disability if the agency was not aware of any evidence that the appellant could not act rationally and file his own application for retirement. <span class="Italic">Holt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 448, 450-51, 5 MSPB 453 (1981). Should an agency believe that an appellant's behavior might be caused by illness but not believe that it was due to a mental disorder, and should the agency order the employee to a general fitness examination that the employee refused, then the agency had a basis for removing the employee. There was no duty for the agency to file a disability application for the employee. <span class="Italic">Risner v. FAA</span>, 7 MSPR 480, 486, 7 MSPB 342 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current regulations, earlier discussed, an agency may only seek retirement for an employee if the agency has issued a decision removing the employee. Under prior law, if an agency application did not lead to retirement, the agency could initiate removal on the basis of misconduct, poor performance, or inability to work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Goldsborough v. USPS</span>, 6 MSPR 521, 523 n.1, 6 MSPB 437 (1981). The employer's case proceeded just as any other. The employee defended the charges and asserted affirmative defenses, e.g., discrimination for lack of reasonable accommodation.</p>
