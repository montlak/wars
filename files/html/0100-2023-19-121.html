<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-117"><span class="space">3.</span> Proof of Disease</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant who asserts an alcoholism defense must prove alcoholism by more than anecdotal evidence. The protection is available to those afflicted by alcoholism as a disease. An incident or two of intoxication while on duty does not demonstrate that the employee is an alcoholic in need of treatment or accommodation; a pattern may be needed to demonstrate the illness<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Lott v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 513, 514, 7 MSPB 367 (1981). However, the appellant was not required to demonstrate more than the existence of a drinking problem to establish an alcohol condition within the meaning of 29 USC 701. <span class="Italic">Downing v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 16 MSPR 388, 390 (1983). For appellants with drug problems, there must be proof of addiction. The Board found no drug-related disability of an appellant who did not consider himself disabled, did not consider marijuana harmful, and was currently using the drug. The assertion that the employee was disabled because of a drug problem was insufficient to prove his claim. <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 466, 472 (1985). Under earlier law, a medical diagnosis was not required to trigger the accommodative responsibility of the agency to an alcoholic employee; it was sufficient that the agency had reason to believe, through reports of the employee's behavior, that the employee had a drinking problem affecting his work. <span class="Italic">Avritch v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 542, 544 (1985). The employee was not required to demonstrate a diagnosis to a medical certainty to establish alcoholism, only that a drinking problem existed<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Corral v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 209, 211 (1987) (concerning a pattern of Monday and Friday absences; a supervisor had referred the appellant to an alcoholism counselor); <span class="Italic">Cohen v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 555, 555 n.* (1986) (summarizing cases involving alcoholism claims). Now medical proof is required.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing both drug and alcohol abuse, the Board attempted to distinguish between casual and addictive drug use in <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 228-29 (1988), involving removal of an employee charged with selling drugs on agency premises:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we find that previous cases did not clearly put appellants on notice of what is necessary to establish a handicap of drug or alcohol abuse, we offer the following specific guidance to the administrative judge and the parties concerning this issue. Further evidence may be submitted by the parties concerning whether the appellant has a handicapping condition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the appellant is handicapped, the administrative judge should carefully consider whether the appellant is simply a drug user who, although he may have been intoxicated at the time of his misconduct, is not handicapped, or a drug abuser who is addicted to drugs and therefore suffers from a handicapping condition. The Rehabilitation [29 USC 791] and Abuse [42 USC 290ee-1] Acts were intended to provide assistance to individuals who, because of the long-term effects of drug abuse, have lost the ability to control their behavior. They were not intended to protect those who misuse alcohol and drugs occasionally, but who retain control of their actions and must be held accountable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This distinction has been recognized implicitly by Congress in defining "addict" in several provisions of the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966. These provisions describe an addict as: "any individual who habitually uses any narcotic drug...so as to endanger the public morals, health, safety, or welfare, or who is so far addicted to the use of such narcotic drugs as to have lost the power of self-control with reference to his addiction." <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC 2901(a); 42 USC 3411(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that to establish that he is in fact a drug abuser or addict, the appellant must provide evidence: 1) from himself concerning his pattern of drug use and its effect on him and 2) from experts in the field as to whether that pattern along with the other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant constitutes the handicap of drug abuse. Of course, the appellant should also submit any other relevant evidence or testimony concerning his drug use.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We caution, however, that testimony from the appellant and his family, friends, and co-workers as to drug use, while helpful, will not generally be sufficient by itself to prove the appellant's affirmative defense. Rather, the appellant must present expert evidence as to the existence of a drug dependency at the time of the misconduct at issue. This expert evidence may include: 1) objective clinical findings such as test results and observations of physical signs; 2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and 3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation, such as a qualified Employee Assistance Program Counselor. Weight will not be afforded to expert opinions which are simply conclusory statements; rather they must indicate the specific factors upon which they are based.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span> test is dual. The employee's burden is to produce both evidence from himself concerning his pattern of drug or alcohol use and its effect on him, and evidence from experts in the field as to whether that pattern of alcohol use and the other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant constitute the disability of alcohol abuse. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 50, 60 (1991) (the appellant's own evidence was insufficient without expert medical evidence).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">McCaffrey</span>, the Board looks for physicians' letters or similar proof containing medical findings or conclusions showing that the appellant is disabled. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. DLA</span>, 63 MSPR 551, 556 (1994) ("[P]hysician's letters contained no medical findings or conclusions showing that the appellant was handicapped."). Summarizing its case law, the Board declined to rely upon the appellant's testimony that during the period of AWOL leading to his removal, he "did do some drugs, but not very much at all." <span class="Italic">Randle v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 574, 578 (1991), advised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish that he is a handicapped person with regard to drug abuse or alcoholism, the appellant must provide evidence from himself concerning his pattern of drug or alcohol use and its effect on him, and from experts in the field as to whether that pattern, along with other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant, constitutes the handicap of drug abuse or alcoholism....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To establish a drug addiction, an appellant must present expert evidence as to the existence of a claimed drug dependency at the time of the misconduct at issue. The evidence may include the following: objective clinical findings, e.g., test results and observation of physical signs; medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and evaluation and assessment by a nonmedical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">Tierney v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 153, 156 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Toone v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 262, 264-65 (1988)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To demonstrate drug addiction, as opposed to occasional drug use, the appellant is expected to present expert evidence as to the existence of his drug dependency at the time of the misconduct. <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 668, 671 (1990). The requirement is strict, <span class="Italic">Noguera v. USPS</span>, 45 MSPR 156, 160 n.3 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claim of being "intoxicated"...when he admitted he stole the Decamiller letter is unsupported by any specific evidence of actual cocaine use on or immediately before that date, or by any co-worker testimony that his conduct was abnormal on that date. Similarly, there is no corroborating medical or diagnostic evidence that the appellant took cocaine on or immediately before April 22, 1987, when he admittedly stole the Kermit Bradley test letter. The appellant's testimony that he used cocaine each day at work is insufficient to establish that he was actually under the influence of cocaine on either March 7 or April 22. Similarly, Dr. Zeporyn's statement that the appellant was "in fact intoxicated on cocaine" on the days of his misconduct lacks supporting medical test corroboration and is based upon a diagnostic examination one year after the date of the theft.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Avant v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 60 MSPR 467, 477-78 (1994), found unconvincing medical testimony that depended upon an appellant's self-reports:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also proffered the testimony of Dr. Michael Bohan, Medical Director, The Harbours Chemical Dependency Treatment Program, Norfolk Psychiatric Center, Norfolk, Virginia, where the appellant was hospitalized in February and March 1992. The administrative judge recognized Dr. Bohan as an expert in the field of addiction medicine without objection from the agency. Dr. Bohan testified that he was not the appellant's primary physician, but that he saw the appellant every day while he was in treatment for his chemical dependency. He further testified that, in his expert medical opinion, the appellant was dependent on alcohol and drugs during the relevant time period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove an affirmative defense of handicap discrimination based on alcohol and drug abuse, testimony from the appellant and his family, friends, and coworkers as to his drug and alcohol use, while helpful, is generally not sufficient by itself to establish the affirmative defense. Rather, the appellant must present expert evidence as to the existence of a drug or alcohol dependency at the time of the misconduct at issue. This expert evidence may include: (1) objective clinical findings such as test results and observation of physical signs; (2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a non-medical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation, such as a qualified Employee Assistance Program Counselor. Weight will not be afforded to expert opinions which are simply conclusory statements; rather, they must indicate the specific factors upon which they are based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Dr. Bohan testified that he first met the appellant in February 1992. He admitted that he was not the appellant's primary physician. Further, his conclusion that the appellant was dependent on alcohol <span id="Page_3537"></span>and drugs from October 22, 1991, to December 12, 1991, was based exclusively on the appellant's self-reports, not on any clinical evaluations of observations of the appellant's physical symptoms. Thus, Dr. Bohan's conclusory testimony is entitled to little weight.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 65 MSPR 245, 251-52 (1994) (discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-067.html#sec12-63">Causal Connection</a>") .[Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-034.html#sec4-35">Physical Evidence</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The same proof is expected of an appellant claiming alcoholism as a disabling condition. Following <span class="Italic">McCaffrey v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 224, 229-30 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Brinkley v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 685 (1988), concerning drug dependency, <span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 554, 558-59 (1988), declared of claimed alcoholism:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]o establish an alcohol...handicap, an appellant must provide (1) evidence showing a pattern of...use and its ill effects and (2) evidence from medical or diagnostic experts as to whether that pattern along with other symptoms demonstrated by the appellant constitutes the handicap of...alcohol abuse....&#8197;[E]xpert evidence may include (1) objective clinical findings such as test results and observation of physical signs; (2) medical diagnoses based on evaluation; and (3) evaluation and assessment by a nonmedical expert in the field of drug rehabilitation, such as a qualified Employee Assistance Program Counselor.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the final diagnosis is a "drinking problem" and not alcoholism, the Board may decide that a disabling condition is not established. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 554, 559 (1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's burden of proof on the question of his condition (but not causation of misconduct) is satisfied by the agency's stipulation or agreement to facts demonstrating that the appellant suffered from alcoholism. <span class="Italic">Chick v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 275, 278 (1991) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Holley v. DHHS</span>, 46 MSPR 80, 84 (1990)). In <span class="Italic">Chick</span>, the stipulation was in the form of an agreed statement of facts showing that the appellant met several times with an EAP counselor who suggested that the appellant seek help for his alcohol problem by agreeing to commit himself to a rehabilitation program. Proof of alcoholism may also be established by testimony of an employee-relations specialist who concluded that the employee was an alcoholic. <span class="Italic">Rivers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 54 MSPR 128, 132-33 (1992) (also noting the discharge summaries following the appellant's attendance at a rehabilitation program and the testimony of the appellant concerning the discontinuation of alcohol use and attendance at AA and NA meetings; affirming dismissal, however, for the lack of a causal relationship between the disease and the failure to notify the shop of absences or to submit the required medical certification concerning absences). The Board appears to accept evidence in the form of physician's letters. <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 203, 209 n.5 (1993) (accepting the conclusion of a labor arbitrator based on a doctor's letter).</p>
