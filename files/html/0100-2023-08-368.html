<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-360"><span class="space">i.</span> Category Rating System</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Category rating is authorized by 5 USC 3319:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;The Office, in exercising its authority under section 3304, or an agency to which the Office has delegated examining authority under section 1104 (a)(2), may establish category rating systems for evaluating applicants for positions in the competitive service, under 2 or more quality categories based on merit consistent with regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, rather than assigned individual numerical ratings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Within each quality category established under subsection (a), preference-eligibles shall be listed ahead of individuals who are not preference eligibles. For other than scientific and professional positions at GS-9 of the General Schedule (equivalent or higher), qualified preference-eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more shall be listed in the highest quality category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Selection.--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;In General.--An appointing official may select any applicant in the highest quality category or, if fewer than 3 candidates have been assigned to the highest quality category, in a merged category consisting of the highest and the second highest quality categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;Use by Other Appointing Officials.--Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, appointing officials other than the appointing official described in paragraph (1) (in this subsection referred to as the "other appointing official") may select an applicant for an appointment to a position that is--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A) in the same occupational series as the position for which the certification of eligibles was issued (in this subsection referred to as the "original position"); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B) at a similar grade level as the original position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;Applicability.--An appointing authority requesting a certificate of eligibles may share the certificate with another appointing authority only if the announcement of the original position provided notice that the resulting list of eligible candidates may be used by another appointing authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(4)&#x2003;Requirements.--The selection of an individual under paragraph (2)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; shall be made in accordance with this subsection; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; subject to paragraph (5), may be made without any additional posting under section 3327.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(5)&#x2003;Internal Notice.--Before selecting an individual under paragraph (2), and subject to the requirements of any collective bargaining obligation of the other appointing authority (within the meaning given that term in section 3318(b)(1)), the other appointing official shall--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; provide notice of the available position to employees of the appointing authority employing the other appointing official;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; provide up to 10 business days for employees of the other appointing authority to apply for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; review the qualifications of employees submitting an application.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(6)&#x2003;Collective Bargaining Obligations.--Nothing in this subsection limits any collective bargaining obligation of an agency under chapter 71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(7)&#x2003;Preference Eligibles.--Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the appointing official may not pass over a preference-eligible in the same category from which selection is made, unless the requirements of section 3317(b) or 3318(c), as applicable, are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Each agency that establishes a category rating system under this section shall submit in each of the 3 years following that establishment, a report to Congress on that system including information on--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;the number of employees hired under that system;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;the impact that system has had on the hiring of veterans and minorities, including those who are American Indian or Alaska Natives, Asian, Black or African American, and native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;the way in which managers were trained in the administration of that system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe such regulations as it considers necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations implementing the statute provide, 5 CFR Part 337 (2022):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">This subpart implements the category rating and selection procedures at 5 U.S.C. 3319.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In this subpart:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; Category rating is synonymous with alternative rating as described at 5 U.S.C. 3319, and is a process of evaluating qualified eligibles by quality categories rather than by assigning individual numeric scores. The agency assesses candidates against job-related criteria and then places them into two or more pre-defined categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; Quality categories are groupings of individuals with similar levels of job-related competencies or similar levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">337.303 <span class="Italic">Agency responsibilities</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To use a category rating procedure, agencies must:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003; Establish a system for evaluating applicants that provides for two or more quality categories;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003; Define each quality category through job analysis conducted in accordance with the "Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures" at 29 CFR part 1607 and part 300 of this chapter.

<p class="Body-Text">The category rating system is described by an OPM Fact Sheet:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Category Rating Fact Sheet</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Presidential Memorandum--Improving the Federal Recruitment and Hiring Process</span> issued on May 11, 2010, requires agencies to use the category rating approach (as authorized by section 3319 of title 5, United States Code) to assess and select job applicants for positions filled through competitive examining. Agencies would evaluate candidates and place them into two or more pre-determined quality categories. For additional guidance on using category rating, please refer to Chapter 5 of the <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook</span> on OPM's website at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/deu">www.opm.gov/deu</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. What is the purpose of category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. The purpose of category rating is to increase the number of qualified applicants an agency has to choose from for selection while preserving veterans' preference rights. The category rating approach gives agencies the flexibility to assess and select from among applicants in the highest quality category without regard to the "rule of three."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Are agencies required to use category rating for all competitive examinations or can they continue to use the traditional "rule of three?"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Yes. The Presidential Memorandum directs agencies to use the category rating approach in place of the "rule of three" approach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. What does an agency need to have in place before implementing category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. An agency is required to have a category rating policy in place that describes how applicants will be evaluated and placed in two or more quality categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. How are quality categories defined?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Quality categories are defined through job analysis. The categories should be written to reflect the requirements to perform the job successfully and to distinguish differences in the quality of candidates' job-related competencies or knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). Each category has eligible candidates who have demonstrated through an assessment(s) similar levels of proficiency on the critical job-related competencies/KSAs. Some factors to consider when developing categories may include:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Breadth and scope of competencies/KSAs;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Increased levels of difficulty or complexity of competencies/KSAs;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Successful performance on the job; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Level of the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The highest quality category definition should not be written in broad terms solely to increase the number of eligible candidates who may be considered for selection. Instead, the highest quality category definition should be written to identify the best qualified individuals for the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Example: Agency uses two quality categories: Highly Qualified and Qualified. In filling a Human Resources Specialist, GS-201-14, policy position, the agency might define the Highly Qualified category as experience in a senior level HR position writing regulations or agency policy or providing guidance to an agency on staffing, downsizing, realignment, classification, or compensation. The Qualified category might include senior level HR operations experience in staffing, downsizing, realignments, classification, or compensation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More information on how to define quality categories, including examples, is located in the <span class="Italic">Delegated Examining Operations Handbook</span> in Chapter 5, Section B, Rating Procedures (Category Rating) on OPM's web site at <a href="http://www.opm.gov/deu">http://www.opm.gov/deu</a> [now at <a href="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf">https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/competitive-hiring/deo_handbook.pdf</a>] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. May agencies use category rating to fill any job that uses an assessment(s) that generates a numerical score?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Yes. Agencies may use test scores as part of the job-related criteria used to place candidates into categories, as long as the test assesses job-related KSAs/competencies. When establishing a category definition with numerical scores, agencies must be consistent with the technical standards in the <span class="Italic">Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures</span> (see 29 CFR Part 1607) with respect to the development of any applicant assessment procedure and comply with the laws, regulations, and policies of merit selection (see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2301 and 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_668"></span>Q. How are candidates selected under category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Agencies make selections from within the highest quality category regardless of the number of candidates (i.e., the rule of three does not apply). However, preference eligibles receive absolute preference within each category. If a preference eligible is in the category, an agency may not select a non-preference eligible unless the agency requests to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318, and the request is approved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If there are fewer than three candidates in the highest quality category, agencies may combine the highest category with the next lower category and make selections from the merged category. The newly merged category would then constitute the highest quality category. Preference eligibles must be listed ahead of non-preference eligibles in the newly merged category. Once again, as long as a preference eligible remains in the merged category, an agency may not select a non-preference eligible unless the agency receives approval to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. When does veterans' preference apply?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Veterans' preference applies after the candidates are assessed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. How are preference eligibles given preference in selection under category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Preference eligibles who meet the qualification requirements are assessed and placed in the appropriate quality categories. Preference eligibles receive veterans' preference by being listed ahead of non-preference eligibles within the same quality category in which they are placed. No preference points, i.e., 5 or 10 points, are added to the preference eligibles' rating. An agency may not select a non-preference eligible if there is a preference eligible in the same category unless the agency receives approval to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. How do preference eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability receive preference in selection?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Preference eligibles who meet the qualification requirements for the position and who have a compensable service-connected disability of at least 10 percent must be listed in the highest quality category (except in the case of scientific or professional positions at the GS-9 level or higher). As noted above, an agency may not select a non-preference eligible over a preference eligible in the same category unless the agency receives approval to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Are the procedures used to pass over a preference eligible under category rating the same as those used in traditional numeric rating, ranking, and selection?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Yes. The procedures used to pass over a preference eligible under category rating are the same as those used in the traditional "rule of three" process. In the traditional and category rating processes, an agency may not select a non-preference eligible over a higher ranked preference eligible or a preference eligible within the same category, respectively, unless the agency receives approval to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3318.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. May an agency apply the "three consideration" rule under category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. No. The "three consideration" rule that is prescribed in 5 CFR 332.405 does not apply in category rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Does the hiring manager have to interview all the candidates within the category?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. OPM does not require the hiring manager to interview everyone within a category. All candidates within a category are considered equally qualified. The hiring manager may interview one or more applicants. Managers should refer to their agency-specific policy on this issue because it may vary by agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Can an applicant appeal his or her rating under category rating?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Yes. Applicants will have the same right of appeal (reconsideration) on an examination rating as they do now. The agency must explain to the applicant why the applicant was placed in a particular category (see 5 CFR 300.104(b)). Each agency is required to have an appeal/reconsideration procedure in place.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Are agencies required to evaluate their category rating process?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Yes. Agencies who have not already implemented their category rating policy must submit a report to Congress in each of the 3 years following the implementation of their policy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. What are agencies required to send to Congress?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. Under 5 U.S.C. 3319(d), agencies must include the following information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the number of employees hired under category rating;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the impact category rating has had on the hiring of veterans and minorities, including those who are American Indian or Alaska Natives, Asian, Black or African American, and native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the way in which managers were trained in the administration of category rating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Q. Who in Congress is sent the report?</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A. The reports are sent to the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Application of the passover process, later discussed, is described in the OPM Delegated Examining Operations Handbook (May 2019), p. 6-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A selecting official may select any eligible candidate(s) in the highest quality category; except, the selecting official may not select a non-preference eligible over a preference eligible unless the agency submits a request to pass over the preference eligible in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 3318, and the request is approved. If there are only preference eligibles or only non-preference eligibles in the highest quality category, the selecting official may select any eligible candidate in the highest quality category regardless of the number of eligible candidates. But, if there is a combination of preference eligibles and non-preference eligibles in the highest quality category, the selecting official cannot select a non-preference eligible over a preference eligible without submitting a request to pass over the preference eligible and obtaining approval.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the record reflects that the agency used category rating procedures to fill the position at issue. Further, the record reflects that even if the agency had properly moved the appellant to the head of the well-qualified category in keeping with his five-point veterans' preference, it would not have made a difference because all the selectees came from the best-qualified category. Regarding the appellant's observation that two selectees had lower self-assessment scores than him, the record indicates that those selectees were entitled to CP or CPS status, respectively reflecting compensable service-connected disability ratings of either 10% to less than 30% (CP) or over 30% (CPS), entitling them to be listed in the highest quality category, as opposed to the appellant's five-point (TP) status, which would have only moved him to the top of the second, well-qualified, category and would not have resulted in his selection for the position at issue. <span class="Italic">Launer</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 7.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Category rating was described, along with a May 11, 2010, "Presidential Memorandum--Improving the Federal Recruitment and Hiring Process," in <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. DHS</span>, 528 Fed. Appx. 986, 990 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Mr. Donaldson asserts that an executive Memorandum issued on May 11, 2010, titled "Presidential Memorandum--Improving the Federal Recruitment and Hiring Process" (the "Memorandum") prohibits <span id="Page_669"></span>agencies from simultaneously using both the competitive evaluation process and the merit promotion process. Specifically, Mr. Donaldson relies on the statement in the Memorandum that "Agency heads shall...adopt hiring procedures that...provide for selection from among a larger number of qualified applicants by using the 'category rating' approach...rather than the 'rule of 3' approach, under which managers may only select from among the three highest scoring applicants." This statement, however, does not preclude the simultaneous use of both hiring processes. Instead, it provides authority for the heads of executive agencies to utilize the "category rating" approach, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319,[5] rather than being required to select from the top three candidates under the "rule of three" approach, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. 3318(a). The statement does not make the "category rating" approach mandatory, but rather merely requires agencies to adopt procedures that allow them to use that <span class="Italic">alternative</span> approach. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319 (titled "Alternative Ranking and Selection Procedures"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(a) (stating that agencies "may establish category rating systems"). The Memorandum does not, as argued by Mr. Donaldson, "remove discretion from federal agencies when filling vacancies when using dual advertisements" or "render[ ] moot" this court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Joseph</span> and <span class="Italic">Dean</span>. Because the Memorandum does not conflict with the propriety of an agency simultaneously using both hiring processes, we reject Mr. Donaldson's argument.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorized "alternative ranking and selection procedures," which have come to be known as "category rating." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319. For many years category rating was merely an optional tool that an agency could use when filling a vacancy, but by a directive of the President, effective November 1, 2010, it became the primary method by which all agencies fill competitive-service vacancies. <span class="Italic">See Dean v.

If the appellant had claimed on his application that he had a compensable service-connected disability of 10% or more and submitted the required documentation to establish his status, he would have been entitled to be placed in Category A ahead of all nonpreference eligibles; further, under those circumstances, the agency could not select a nonpreference eligible under Vacancy No. 043P without obtaining permission to pass over the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Launer</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 9 (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(b), (c)(2)).

The requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3308 through 3318 apply to excepted service examinations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3320; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(c)(1) (providing that "[a]n appointing official may select any applicant in the highest quality category or, if fewer than candidates have been assigned to the highest quality category, in a merged category consisting of the highest and the second highest quality categories"). To the extent that the agency was required to provide at least three names of qualified individuals to the selecting official for consideration for each vacancy when filling the excepted service position at issue using category rating, we find that the agency met this requirement. The record reflects that the agency considered seven candidates from the highest category to fill the two vacancies. We therefore modify the initial decision to find that the agency complied with the requirements of section 3317(a), and thus, the appellant did not prove that the agency violated his veterans' preference rights in this regard.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The category rating process described by &#x00A7; 3319 was determined to be valid under VEOA in <span class="Italic">Gingery v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 403 Fed. Appx. 498, 501-02 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), also determining to be valid an agency procedure that involved tentative ratings of applicants:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the merits of his appeal, Mr. Gingery does not contest the Board's conclusion that his VEOA claim concerning the 5T11 announcement was premature, nor does he dispute any of the factual findings underlying that decision. Rather, he challenges the agency's use of a "tentative" rating, arguing that the use of a tentative rating is impermissible under the statutes and regulations governing veterans' preference rights, and that even assuming the use of a tentative rating is permissible in some instances, the agency was nevertheless required by the applicable regulation to issue a final rating in his case. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(a), an agency may establish category rating systems, in lieu of numerical ratings, for evaluating applicants for positions in <span id="Page_670"></span>the competitive service. When an agency establishes a category rating system, "preference-eligibles shall be listed ahead of individuals who are not preference eligibles." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 3319(b). The statute further provides that for other than scientific and professional positions at or above the GS-9 level, "qualified preference-eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more shall be listed in the highest quality category." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The statute's implementing regulations provide general guidelines for an agency's use of a category rating system. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 337.303 to .304. However, neither the statute nor the regulations specify any particular method for rating applicants, leaving such details to the hiring agency's discretion. Thus, while an agency must "[p]lace applicants in categories based upon their job-related competencies or their knowledge, skills, and abilities," <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 337.303, nothing in the statute or regulations prescribes the particular categories or levels of competence that must be used, and nothing dictates how and whether tentative ratings may be used prior to the issuance of final ratings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, there is no legal support for Mr. Gingery's argument that the Treasury Department's use of tentative ratings was improper. Not only do the applicable rules permit the agency to apply tentative ratings in general, but the 5T11 announcement specifically stated that the agency would apply veterans' preferences in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(b) upon an applicant's successful completion of an interview. The 5T11 announcement also provided clear notice that, after completing the on-line assessment but before passing the interview, an applicant would be placed into a rating category that would be "tentative."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We likewise reject Mr. Gingery's assertion that the agency was required to assign him a final rating pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 332.402. That regulation provides that "OPM or a Delegated Examining Unit (DEU) will refer candidates for consideration by simultaneously listing a candidate on all certificates for which the candidate is interested, eligible, and within reach...." The regulation imposes no requirement to assign any category ratings, whether final or tentative. In addition, the regulation requires that an applicant be "eligible," not merely "tentatively eligible." While Mr. Gingery's application indicated that he was both "interested in" and "within reach of" positions in Detroit, Mount Clemens, and Pontiac, Michigan, it is clear that under the agency's procedures, Mr. Gingery would not be regarded as "eligible" for those positions until he successfully passed the required interview. Prior to verification of eligibility, the agency was not obligated to refer Mr. Gingery on a certificate of eligibles, nor was it obligated to assign him a final category rating. Accordingly, the agency did not act improperly by assigning Mr. Gingery a "Potential Rating" of Category B, without applying the veteran's preference, prior to his successful completion of an interview under the 5T11 announcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is there anything in the record to indicate that Mr. Gingery was prejudiced by the agency's use of a "potential" rating. In fact, the agency's unrebutted evidence establishes that Mr. Gingery will be moved to the top of Category A (the highest category) for grades 5 and 7 if he passes the interview. Because Mr. Gingery's appeal regarding the 5T11 announcement is premature in the absence of a final rating, we affirm the Board's denial of relief under the VEOA.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Donahue v. Dept. of Labor</span>, PH-3330-17-0031-I-1 (NP 7/19/2022), analyzes a right to compete VEOA claim when the appellant was not selected under a category ranking process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The following facts, as further detailed in the initial decision, are not in dispute. The appellant applied for a GS-11 Workforce Program Specialist vacancy in the agency's Employment and Training Administration. Among other things, his application recognized the appellant's entitlement to a 5-point veterans' preference.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency used the category rating method during its selection process. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319. Under that method, applicants completed a competency based questionnaire (CBQ), which computer software scored. Based on those scores, applicants were divided into three qualification categories, A, B, and C. Applicants with a 10-point veterans' preference were automatically placed atop category A, regardless of their CBQ score. Applicants with a 5-point veterans' preference remained in the category assigned by virtue of their CBQ score, but were placed atop of that category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of the 156 applicants for the Workforce Program Specialist vacancy, 2 were entitled to a 10-point veterans' preference and were, therefore, placed atop category A. The appellant's CBQ score resulted in his placement within category C, and his 5-point veterans' preference resulted in his placement atop of that category. The agency ultimately selected one of the candidates with the 10-point veterans' preference to fill its vacancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we have considered the appellant's arguments, we find them unavailing. While the appellant has expressed disagreement with the agency's use of the CBQ and category ranking, based on concerns about its adequacy and effectiveness, that disagreement does not establish a violation of his veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">See Launer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6; 7 (2013) (explaining the category rating system of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319 and recognizing that it is now the primary method by which all agencies fill competitive-service vacancies).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant's suggestion that category ranking is only appropriate for scientific positions is incorrect. <span class="Italic">See Jones v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 355, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 12-16 (2013) (discussing an agency's use of category ranking to fill a Public Health Advisor position), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 544 F. App'x 976 (Fed. Cir. 2013); <span class="Italic">Launer</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 252, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 7-10 (discussing an agency's use of category ranking to fill an Engineering Equipment Operator position). The language of the statute reflects otherwise. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3319(b) (requiring that "[f]or other than scientific and professional positions at GS-9 of the General Schedule (equivalent or higher), qualified preference-eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more shall be listed in the highest quality category").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lastly, while the appellant is frustrated by his failure to secure the employment he seeks, the Board's role under VEOA is not to determine whether a preference eligible is qualified for a particular position or whether he should have been selected for the position in question. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 88, &#x00B6; 11 (2014), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 818 F.3d 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Board instead focuses on the narrower question of whether the agency violated the individual's veterans' preference rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this case, the appellant has failed to identify evidence of any such violation.</p>
