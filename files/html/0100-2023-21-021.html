<p class="Body-Text">The principal statutory requirements for CSRS disability retirement are established by 5 USC 8337:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment described in that sentence if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee. A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces who completes 5 years of civilian service and who is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a judge of such court or who is removed for mental or physical disability under section 942(c) of title 10 shall be retired on the judge's own application or upon such removal. A Member who completes 5 years of Member service and is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a Member because of disease or injury shall be retired on the Member's own application. An annuity authorized by this section is computed under section 8339(g) of this title, unless the employee or Member is eligible for a higher annuity computed under section 8339(a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), or (s).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of the Office--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(1)&#x2003;at the end of 1 year from the date of the disability retirement; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;annually thereafter until he becomes 60 years of age;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">unless his disability is permanent in character. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required by this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, recovers from his disability, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">CSRS is implemented by the OPM regulation, 5 CFR 831.1203 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Basic requirements for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the following conditions must be met for an individual to be eligible for disability retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The individual must have completed at least 5 years of civilian service that is creditable under the Civil Service Retirement System.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The individual must, while employed in a position subject to the Civil Service Retirement System, have become disabled because of a medical condition, resulting in a service deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or if there is no actual service deficiency, the disabling medical condition must be incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in the position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;The disabling medical condition must be expected to continue for at least 1 year from the date the application for disability retirement is filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;The employing agency must be unable to accommodate the disabling medical condition in the position held or in an existing vacant position.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"), a federal employee is eligible for a disability retirement annuity when, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> she becomes disabled because of a qualifying medical condition while employed in a position subject to the Federal Employment Retirement System ("FERS"). If entitlement is proven, a disability annuity "commences on the day after the employee separates or the day after pay ceases and the employee meets the requirements for title to an annuity." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.301. If the recipient is younger than 62 years old, the rate of the annuity is computed according to rules established by OPM. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 844.302. Specifically, within the first year, the annuity "is [generally] equal to 60 percent of the annuitant's average pay." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 844.302(b)(1).

<p class="Block-Quote1">When the recipient turns 62 years old, however, the rate is recomputed according to the calculations set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415, with the assumption that the employee is given "credit for all periods before the annuitant's 62nd birthday during which he or she was entitled to an annuity under this part." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.305. Section 8415(a) defines the generally applicable calculation: "the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by such individual's total service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8415(a).</p>

OPM</span>, PH-844E-14-0864-I-2 (NP 8/22/2016) (issue of the timeliness of a disability retirement application: "the Board's review of an OPM decision is <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Licausi v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 350 F.3d 1359, 1363-65 (Fed. Cir. 2003)"). The nature of the Board's review authority in disability retirement appeals was touched on in <span class="Italic">Licausi v. OPM,</span> 350 F.3d 1359, 1363-65 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p> 
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Licausi's second argument is that the administrative judge improperly upheld OPM's decision on a different ground from the one on which OPM based its ruling. She contends that OPM's decision was based on its conclusion that she did not prove that she continued to suffer from the same medical condition that had led to her initial retirement, while the administrative judge's decision was based on her failure to establish that her condition prevented her from rendering useful and efficient service in her former position. By upholding OPM's decision on a different ground, Ms. Licausi argues, the Merit Systems Protection Board violated the principle set forth in the Supreme Court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 318 U.S. 80, 87-88 (1943), and <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.,</span> 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> cases stand for the proposition that "a reviewing court, in dealing with a determination or judgment which an administrative agency alone is authorized to make, must judge the propriety of such action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency." 332 U.S. at 196. That principle has long been applied to judicial review of agency action. <span class="Italic">See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &#x0026; Me. Corp.,</span> 503 U.S. 407, 420 (1992); <span class="Italic">Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

This court has declined to apply the rule of <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> to Merit Systems Protection Board review of a personnel action by another executive agency, however, noting that the argument that the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> rule applies generally to Board review of agency action "confuse[s] the assigned roles of the Board, itself part of the administrative agency structure, and the courts." <span class="Italic">Huber v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 793 F.2d 284, 287 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Yet even if the principles underlying <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> apply to Merit Systems Protection Board review of certain kinds of agency action, <span class="Italic">see Horne v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 684 F.2d 155, 157-58 (D.C. Cir. 1982), it is clear that those principles do not apply to Merit Systems Protection Board review of OPM disability retirement determinations.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The Board has referred indirectly to the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine in several cases involving Board review of agency disciplinary proceedings to support its holding that the Board may not uphold an agency disciplinary decision on the basis of misconduct different from the misconduct with which the employee was charged in the proceedings before the agency. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Dep't of Educ.,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 61, 71 (1989); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. Veterans Admin.,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 606, 609 (1989). Although that principle has frequently been recognized by this court and the Board, it is not so much an application of the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine as an application of the due process principle that a person must be given notice of the charge on which the action against him is based. <span class="Italic">See O'Keefe v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 318 F.3d 1310, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">Lachance v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 147 F.3d 1367, 1371-72 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <span class="Italic">Shaw v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Merit Systems Protection Board has statutory authority to review OPM decisions in CSRS disability cases under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d)(1), which provides (with an exception inapplicable here) that OPM disability decisions may be appealed to the Board "under procedures prescribed by the Board." As directed by statute, the Board has established procedures governing such appeals. In particular, the Board has promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(b)(2)(ii)], which provides as follows: "In appeals from reconsideration decisions of the Office of Personnel Management [(OPM)] involving retirement benefits, if the appellant has filed the application, the appellant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence [(as defined in &#x00A7; 1201.4(q))], entitlement to the benefits." That regulation makes clear that the appeal proceeding before the Board constitutes a de novo proceeding, quite different from the kind of limited review prescribed by section 10(e) of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706, for judicial review of administrative action. <span class="Italic">See Spradlin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 279, 283 (1999) ("appellants in disability retirement cases are...entitled to a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> hearing before the Board"); <span class="Italic">Chavez v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 413 (1981) (in a disability retirement appeal, the Board must "consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all the relevant evidence presented by both parties, whether offered at a hearing or transmitted as part of the administrative record").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board has explained, it is the "ultimate decision maker" in a disability retirement appeal. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 89 M.S.P.R. 1, 7 (2001). Thus, the question for the Board is not whether OPM's decision is supported by substantial evidence or otherwise should be upheld or <span id="Page_4121"></span>rejected based on the record made before OPM. Instead, the parties are free to introduce new evidence, including live testimony, bearing on the question whether the retiree is entitled to benefits, and the Board is required to decide the case on the basis of all the evidence before it. <span class="Italic">Morgan v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 607, 610-11 (1991) ("The Board has rejected the notion that its scope of review is limited to consideration of the administrative record established before the agency."); <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 289, 294 (1981) ("[T]he Board is both authorized and mandated...to consider <span class="Italic">de novo</span> all available evidence."). If the Board is persuaded that the employee has met his or her burden of showing entitlement to benefits, the Board will direct that benefits be awarded; otherwise, it will sustain the denial of benefits.[2] Because the Board engages in <span class="Italic">de novo</span> consideration of the eligibility issue, it is not confined to either upholding OPM's decision on the ground invoked by OPM or remanding to OPM for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Grumman Data Sys. Corp. v. Widnall,</span> 15 F.3d 1044, 1047 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The principles that apply to the Board's disability determinations parallel those applicable to Board review of adverse agency actions covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. On an appeal from such an adverse agency action, the Board reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span> whether the agency's decision was justified. <span class="Italic">See Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 528 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("The MSPB reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the merits of an agency's decision to take adverse action against an employee."); <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the Board's obligation to make an independent determination as to eligibility, its decisions in retirement disability cases fall outside the reach of the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine for reasons given in <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> itself, as the Board's decisions do not involve review of "a determination or a judgment that an administrative agency [OPM in this case] alone is authorized to make." <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, 332 U.S. at 196; <span class="Italic">see Fomby-Denson v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 247 F.3d 1366, 1373 (Fed.

United States,</span> 95 F.3d 1094, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The appropriate Supreme Court analogy is therefore not <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, but <span class="Italic">Helvering v. Gowran,</span> 302 U.S. 238, 245 (1937). In that case, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed a tax deficiency against the taxpayer, who sought a redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals. The Board of Tax Appeals upheld the Commissioner's assessment, but on a legal theory different from the Commissioner's. The court of appeals concluded that the Board of Tax Appeals was free to sustain the assessment on a different legal theory, because the taxpayer's burden in the Board of Tax Appeals was to show that the assessment was erroneous on any proper theory. The Supreme Court agreed. It explained that "if the Commissioner was right in his determination, the Board properly affirmed it, even if the reasons which he had assigned were wrong." 302 U.S. at 246.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, by analogy, the Merit Systems Protection Board was free to sustain OPM's decision on a different ground because Ms. Licausi was required to show, in <span class="Italic">de novo</span> proceedings before the Board, that she was eligible for disability retirement benefits. We therefore reject her argument that the Board's decision must be reversed because its conclusion that she had failed to prove that she was unable to render useful and efficient service in her position was based on a different rationale from the one that OPM invoked in denying her request for reinstatement.</p>

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 19 (2000) (finding that an appellant did not show entitlement to a disability annuity where there was no evidence that his disability caused the alleged misconduct); <span class="Italic">Peterson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 211, &#x00B6; 5 (1999) (the appellant established that he was entitled to disability retirement where the evidence showed that his severe mental condition included delusions that caused him to be a danger to himself or others). Removal for misconduct does not preclude an individual's receipt of disability retirement benefits if he can show that he was disabled prior to the effective date of his removal. <span class="Italic">Henderson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 9 (2008). However, an appellant's application for disability retirement in the face of an impending removal for misconduct may cast doubt upon the veracity of his application. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A determination regarding entitlement to disability retirement benefits must consider objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on his ability to perform in the grade or class of position last occupied, and evidence that the applicant was not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade or level as the position he last occupied. <span class="Italic">Nash v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 7 (2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant can show that his medical condition is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the position by showing that it is inconsistent with working in general, working in a particular line of work, or working in a particular type of setting. <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 16. In determining whether this burden is met, the Board looks at objective clinical findings, diagnoses and medical opinions, subjective evidence of pain and disability, and evidence relating to the effect of the applicant's condition on his ability to perform. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The ultimate question, based on all relevant evidence, is: Do the employee's medical impairments preclude him from rendering useful and efficient service in his position? <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof is on the appellant to establish the disability necessary to support an annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Alston v. OPM</span>, 527 Fed. Appx. 872, 874 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP) ("Mr. Alston, not the Board or OPM, bore the burden to contact his doctor and gather evidence to prove his eligibility for disability retirement.") That burden is aided by presumptions when the appellant is removed for medical or physical inability to perform the job. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-21-068.html#sec14-68">Removal for Physical Inability to Perform; <span class="Italic">Bruner</span>; Settlement</a>."] As to multiple disability <span id="Page_4122"></span>applications, "we are aware of no law, rule, or regulation that permits or forbids the filing of multiple disability retirement applications, or that sets forth any standards or procedures for dealing with multiple applications when they occur." <span class="Italic">Alletto v.
