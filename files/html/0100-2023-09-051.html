<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-50"><span class="space">a.</span> Mental or Physical Illness; <span class="Italic"><span class="Bold">Lacy</span></span> Notice</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lacy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/LACY_GREGORY_M_SF_0752_97_0367_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_199726.pdf">78 MSPR 434</a>, 437-38 (1998), remanded an appeal for further development by an AJ who failed to give to a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant with an apparent mental impairment precise information on how to demonstrate that his appellate deadline should be waived:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board will find good cause for waiver of its filing time limits where a party demonstrates that he suffered from an illness that affected his ability to file on time. <span class="Italic">See generally Hill v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 MSPR 254, 256 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 991 F.2d 808 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table). To establish that an untimely filing was the result of an illness, the party must: (1) Identify the time period during which he suffered from the illness; (2) submit medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period; and (3) explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time. <span class="Italic">See generally Andrews v. Department of the Army</span>, 76 MSPR 147, 151 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant, who was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, alleged in his petition for appeal that it was untimely due to depression. Nevertheless, the administrative judge's acknowledgment order did not set forth the specific showing that an appellant must make if he alleges that an untimely filing is due to illness. The agency's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed also discussed the Board's case law relating to timeliness only in general terms. Similarly, the initial decision failed to state the legal standard for waiver of an untimely filing when the alleged cause for the delay was illness. Thus, the appellant was never, at any stage of the Board's proceedings below, informed of the specific criteria he was required to meet to make a showing of good cause under such circumstances, even though he placed the administrative judge on notice that he was claiming depression as the cause of the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an appellant states that the reason for a filing delay is physical or mental illness, he must receive explicit information regarding the legal standard for establishing good cause on that basis, and he must be afforded a fair opportunity to submit evidence and argument to show that he met that standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 75 F.3d 639 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit construed an acknowledgment order identical to the one at issue here, finding that "[a]n appellant cannot be expected to fight a fog of generality," but must be given a "full and fair opportunity to litigate the [timeliness] issue." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The specific timeliness questions here and in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> are different. Here, the administrative judge's acknowledgment order failed to inform the appellant of what he was required to show to establish good cause for an untimely filing on the basis of his alleged mental illness. In <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, the acknowledgment order failed to advise the appellant of what she needed to submit to establish the date on which she received the agency's final decision on her formal complaint of discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton</span>, 75 F.3d at 641, 646. The same principle that guided the court in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, however, applies with equal force in this case: an appellant should be told what the timeliness issue is, and what he must show to establish either that his appeal is timely, or that there is good cause for waiving the time limit. <span class="Italic">See also Pierce v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 26, 30 (1993). Therefore, we find that the administrative judge should have advised the appellant of what he needed to submit to prove that a mental condition prevented him from timely filing his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 75 MSPR 144 (1997), the Board applied <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, finding that the appellant should have received specific notice regarding the date on which the Board will presume receipt of a document that triggers the running of the filing period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 148. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Persons v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 75 MSPR 428, 432 (1997) (where the appellant filed an untimely appeal alleging involuntary retirement, the Board found that the appellant's burden of proof was adequately explained to him when the agency's motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed specifically stated that he had to show that "he put the agency on notice that he considered his retirement to be involuntary or that he otherwise lacked the capacity to make a voluntary decision and a timely filing"); <span class="Italic">Dotson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, it is well-settled that, for jurisdictional purposes, an order must provide the appellant with "explicit information" as to what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue. <span class="Italic">See Burgess</span> <span class="Italic">v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that, because the appellant was never specifically informed of the three criteria he was required to meet to establish good cause for waiver of the Board's time limit on the basis of physical or mental illness, he was, in the words of the Federal Circuit, fighting a "fog of generality," and he was, therefore, denied a fair opportunity to address the timeliness issue. Accordingly, we find that the appeal must be remanded to provide the appellant with proper notice and a meaningful opportunity to file evidence and argument on the timeliness issue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lacy</span> involved a mental condition that may have affected timeliness of the appeal.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted below that he was "disabled" and undergoing "medical procedures." In addition, the agency removed the appellant for medical inability to perform the duties of his position, and there is some evidence in the record that the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant suffers from chronic pain and cognitive impairment. Under these circumstances, the appellant should have been provided with detailed and specific instructions concerning how to demonstrate that his medical condition constituted good cause for his apparent untimely filed appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437-38 (1998).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's show cause order, however, did not meet the requirements of <span class="Italic">Lacy</span>.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the AJ apprised the appellant of the general requirements to prove that he timely filed his appeal, he failed to provide the appellant with <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice after the appellant alleged that the filing deadline should be waived due to mental incapacity.

<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ fails to provide a <span class="Italic">Lacy-</span>style notice to an appellant, the Board may decide to forego a remand to develop medical evidence and issue the notice to the appellant at the PFR stage.

Typically, <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> is applied when the appellant fails to respond, or responds inadequately, to a general show-cause order issued following what appears to be an untimely appeal. The Board may remand the case for issuance of a more specific show-cause order when the AJ has before her a response to the appeal from the agency suggesting a mental or physical condition that may have interfered with the appellant's timely filing. The AJ is responsible for reviewing the information in the agency response to ascertain whether a <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> notice is warranted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moore v. OPM</span>, 87 MSPR 104, 106 &#x00B6; 6 (2000). The Board may remand when, with her PFR, the appellant first supplies information demonstrating that her condition may have hindered a timely appeal.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pro se</span> status is significant when the Board assesses mental incapacity relative to a filing delay, but <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status alone is not determinative. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v.

<p class="Body-Text">In 2004 the Federal Circuit attempted to broaden or redefine <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> to merge the analysis of the appellant's ability to file a timely appeal with the appellant's ability to file a request for an extension of time to file an appeal, <span class="Italic">Stout v. MSPB</span>, 389 F.3d 1233, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, given the facts of record here, we hold Stout's capacity to file an application for an enlargement of time to file his appeal stands or falls together with his capacity to file the appeal itself. At least on this record, any incapacity to do one establishes incapacity to do the other. If Stout's mental illness and physical condition rendered him unable to appreciate the process and deadline for appealing his removal, it rendered him equally unable to ask for an extension of that process and deadline; an applicant must comprehend a deadline in order to ask that it be extended or to request assistance in doing so. Thus, we reject the alternative reasoning of the Board that Stout failed to show he was unable to request an extension of time to file his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standard cited by the AJ for showing good cause as a result of an illness was that set forth in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998), which requires, among other things, that a party "explain how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal <span class="Italic">or a request for an extension of time</span>." (Emphasis added). An appellant's ability to request an extension of time to file his appeal, similar to his capacity to request assistance as discussed above, presumes cognizance of the filing deadline and method, and the mental wherewithal to file for an extension or to seek assistance in so doing. In addition, an appellant must understand that an extension may be available upon timely request. In cases alleging good cause due to mental incapacity, the ability to timely file an appeal and to file a request for an extension will often be coextensive; both presuppose cognition of one's state of affairs, potentially impaired by serious mental illness. The ability to perform these two actions--filing the appeal or requesting an extension to file by the thirty-day deadline--may prove more distinct in cases involving a physical, rather than mental, illness. For instance, an appellant recovering from a major surgery during the thirty-day appeal period, may have the physical capacity to draft a short request for an extension of time or ask another to do so yet, at the same time, lack the capacity to complete the more elaborate appeal form, or to request assistance in doing so, detailing specific grounds for challenging an agency's action. But in cases of mental illness, it is also possible that an appellant may have the capacity to file, or request assistance in filing, an extension request while lacking the capacity to file, or cooperate effectively with another in filing, the appeal itself. In either case, however, the requirement set forth in <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> that an appellant explain how an illness prevented him from requesting an extension of time must necessarily turn on whether appellant knew of the filing deadline, knew that he could request an extension, and had the mental or physical capacity to do so. Absent such a three-part finding, an appellant should not be faulted for not seeking an extension to file his appeal. To the extent <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> can be read to suggest otherwise, it is disapproved.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The problem with the <span class="Italic">Stout</span> analysis is that the Board does not have a regulation providing for an extension of time for filing an appeal, with the possible exception of appeals that can be filed later than the normal time limit because the cases are the subject of mediation after the decision is issued and prior to the normal time for filing an appeal. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-015.html#sec2-16">Request for Extension of Time to Appeal</a>."]</p>
