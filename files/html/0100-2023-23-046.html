<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-47"><span class="space">h.</span> Coercion by Counsel or Union Representative; Lack of Signature by Counsel</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">We turn to counsel's encouragement of a settlement. Ordinarily, counsel is assumed to be of some benefit in the settlement process. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mosier v. USPS</span>, 64 Fed. Appx. 206, 209 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP) ("Mr. Mosier had the benefit of professional guidance from his own experienced counsel during the settlement process."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-17-0611-I-1 (NP 1/23/2023) ("Here, the appellant was represented by a union representative during settlement negotiations, and both the appellant and his representative signed the settlement agreement. Such representation is significant in determining the validity of an appeal-rights waiver. <span class="Italic">Clede v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 72 M.S.P.R. 279, 285 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F.3d 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table)."). Generally, the appellant is bound by the actions, including settlement, of his designated representative. <span class="Italic">Dorsey v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 305, 305 n.2 (1987). <span class="Italic">Biberstine v. DODDS</span>, 37 MSPR 248, 257 (1988), stated as to coercion of counsel and financial problems involving a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also summarily alleges that his representative "worked on" him to settle the case without a hearing. The appellant has not identified the specific actions of his representative that were coercive. Nor does the record reflect that there were any such actions. Moreover, coercion by one's own representative may not permit a settlement, which is not unfair, to be overturned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. United States Postal Service,</span> 479 F.2d 1267, 1268 (2nd Cir. 1973).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Piazza v. Dept. of Air Force,</span> DA-0752-10-0759-I-1 (NP 5/13/2011), declined to upset a settlement based on allegations of counsel's negligence or coercion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, among other things, that her attorney provided ineffective counsel and/or coerced her to execute the settlement agreement, she did not understand the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement, and she tried to stop the settlement after she had an opportunity to review a copy of the agreement at her hotel, but neither her attorney nor the agency representative responded to her e-mails and telephonic text messages. However, a claim of inadequate representation is not grounds for Board review. <span class="Italic">Wadley v. Department of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 5 (2001). Further, the Board has held that coercive acts by a party's own representative are not a basis for overturning an otherwise lawful settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Cook v. Government Printing Office</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 8, 11, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 132 F.3d 51 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). Based on the agreement's language and the appellant's and her representative's signature, the administrative judge properly found that the appellant freely and voluntarily entered into a lawful settlement agreement with an understanding of the terms. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Social Security Administration</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 167, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5 (2006). Her challenges to the settlement agreement merely reflect post-settlement remorse and change of heart, which cannot serve as a basis for setting aside a valid settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Potter</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 374, &#x00B6; 6. Based on the foregoing, the appellant has failed to meet her heavy burden of alleging facts that, if proven, would compel the Board to set aside the settlement agreement. Accordingly we discern no basis to set aside the settlement agreement or to disturb the initial decision dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Adkins v. USPS</span>, 86 MSPR 671, 675 &#x00B6; 7 (2000), rejected a claim that appellant's diminished capacity and coercion of his counsel voided a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the appellant alleges coercion by his representative. In support, the appellant states that he was not present during the settlement conference; that he did not personally stipulate to the voluntariness of the settlement agreement; that the agreement was presented to him as a <span class="Italic">fait accompli;</span> that both representatives told him he had no choice other than to resign; and that he was drunk the whole time. Even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that these facts establish coercion by the appellant's representative, coercive acts by a party's own representative do not provide a basis for setting aside an otherwise proper settlement agreement.* <span class="Italic">Bynum</span>, 77 MSPR at 665.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Similarly, to the extent that this recitation of facts implicitly raises an allegation of lack of authority to settle the case on the part of the appellant's representative, the appellant does not meet the heavy burden required to establish such lack of authority. <span class="Italic">See Wildowsky v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 72 MSPR 298, 301-02 (1996) (duly-authorized representative presumed to have settlement authority, and appellant who asserts that representative lacked such authority carries heavy burden that cannot be met by conclusory statements).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Smith v.

In <span class="Italic">Smith</span>, the appellant asserted that his representative coerced a settlement by telling the appellant that to win, he had to take a deposition that was too costly for appellant, and that the representative could not attend the scheduled hearing, meaning that the appellant would have to go it alone and would lose. <span class="Italic">Smith</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Jackson v.

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant unsuccessfully claimed a settlement agreement was invalid because she agreed to it following contacts with the agency representative that should have been directed through appellant's counsel, but the record reflected that the appellant was not represented by designated counsel and that the appellant did not request that the agency representative include appellant's counsel in settlement discussions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Altman v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cook v. GPO</span>, 75 MSPR 8, 10-11 (1997), summarized the law concerning allegations that counsel coerced a settlement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant's appeal from her removal was pending with the Board's Washington Regional Office, the parties entered into a settlement agreement. The administrative judge found that the parties had reached a settlement agreement, understood its terms, and agreed that it would be enforceable by the Board. She also found that the agreement was lawful on its face and freely entered into, and that the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. The administrative judge therefore dismissed the appeal <span id="Page_4813"></span>as settled and entered the agreement into the record for enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her timely-filed petition for review, the appellant asserts that her former representative negotiated the settlement agreement on her behalf, told her that she (the former representative) would have to remove herself as the appellant's attorney if the appellant did not sign the agreement, and told the appellant that if the appellant did not sign the agreement and return it to the agency by a certain date, the agency would change its mind regarding settlement. The appellant claims that she reluctantly signed the settlement agreement, even though it did not include back pay, because she "felt [she] had no other options." The appellant asserts that her former representative's actions were "forceful tactics," and did not represent her interests. The appellant therefore claims that, in an indirect way, her former representative coerced her into signing the agreement because the representative knew that she was not in favor of the terms of the agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that her former representative's actions were inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Koury v. Small Business Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 176 (the appellant did not establish grounds for invalidating a settlement agreement where her counsel repeatedly advised her to settle and told her she could be left with nothing if she did not accept the settlement offer, even though she expressed great concern over, among other things, approximately $50,000 in back wages to which she felt she was entitled), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 891 F.2d 298 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Table). If the appellant disagreed with the judgment or tactics of her representative, she could have dismissed her and requested a continuance. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Instead, the appellant continued to retain her representative for 17 days after the initial decision was issued. The appellant is responsible for the actions of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 176-77; <span class="Italic">Smith v. Veterans Administration</span>, 43 MSPR 91, 95 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, coercive acts by a party's own representative are not a basis for overturning a settlement that is otherwise fair. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Ealy v. Department of Justice</span>, 72 MSPR 564, 565 (1996). Although the appellant wishes that the settlement agreement had included back pay, she does not assert that it is otherwise unfair. In return for withdrawing her appeal, the appellant received consideration that included retroactive reinstatement, attorney fees, and a self-imposed limitation by the agency as to the grounds for any future proposed adverse action. Viewing the agreement as a whole, we find that it is otherwise fair. Thus, the appellant has not established a proper basis on which to grant her petition for review. <span class="Italic">See Keith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 MSPR 668, 670 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to appellants' attempts to counter the authority of their lawyers to settle, <span class="Italic">Crayton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 62 MSPR 497, 500 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While a party's designated representative may not settle his client's appeal without express authority to do so, the representative of record is presumed to have such authority absent evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Moore v. US Postal Service</span>, 52 MSPR 160, 162-63 (1991); <span class="Italic">Kowalczyk v. Department of the Army</span>, 44 MSPR 616, 621 (1990); <span class="Italic">Laranang</span>, 40 MSPR at 235. The appellant designated her former representative in her petition for appeal and there is no indication in the record that the representative's authority was limited in any way. Furthermore, the administrative judge specifically asked the appellant's former representative during the telephonic settlement conference if he had the authority to enter into the settlement agreement on the appellant's behalf and he stated that he did. The appellant has provided no evidence suggesting that her former representative lacked such authority. Thus, the appellant is bound by the actions of her designated representative in settling the appeal on her behalf. <span class="Italic">See Kowalczyk</span>, 44 MSPR at 621-22; <span class="Italic">Montoya v. US Postal Service</span>, 40 MSPR 314, 317-18 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the appellant's allegation that her former representative did not inform her of the terms of the settlement agreement prior to entering into it, the record shows that during the telephonic settlement conference the administrative judge asked the appellant's representative if he had explained the terms of the settlement agreement to the appellant and the representative responded that he had. In any event, an allegation of an inadequate exchange of information between an appellant and her representative is not a basis to set aside a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Thompson</span>, 52 MSPR at 236; <span class="Italic">Montoya</span>, 40 MSPR at 318.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Would an attorney's conflict of interest--the alleged representation of both a member of management and the appellant involved in an adverse action--invalidate a settlement? We are left to ponder the possibility in <span class="Italic">Shults v. USPS</span>, 40 MSPR 673, 674 (1989): the Board did not reach the issue when the appellant allegedly did not demonstrate due diligence in bringing the conflict (alleged simultaneous representation of the appellant and the deciding official) to the Board's attention after the decision accepting his settlement became final.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit declined an argument that the financial arrangements between client and counsel were coercive, <span class="Italic">Hunter v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 211 Fed. Appx. 962, 963-64 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, even if Mr. Hunter's claims had been properly raised below, his allegations, assuming he could prove them, would be insufficient to support a claim for involuntariness. Mr. Hunter claims that two days before he signed the settlement agreement, Mr. Gould informed him that he could not continue to represent him on appeal unless Mr. Hunter paid $4,000 to $5,000 in legal fees. On May 18, 2006, Mr. Gould sent Mr. Hunter a copy of the settlement agreement. Mr. Gould allegedly stated by telephone that "if [Mr. Hunter] didn't [sign the agreement] the agency would rescind it and...[he would] still lose [the] appeal because [Mr. Gould] wouldn't be representing [him]." Mr. Hunter signed the settlement agreement that same day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner bears a "heavy burden" in proving that a settlement agreement should be invalidated. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982). To "set aside a settlement agreement, an appellant must show that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake." <span class="Italic">Sargent</span>, 229 F.3d at 1091. Mr. Hunter has not met this burden. The potential withdrawal of Mr. Gould as Mr. Hunter's attorney did not render the settlement agreement involuntary. If Mr. Hunter wished to continue his appeal, he could have done so <span class="Italic">pro se</span>. Moreover, to the extent that Mr. Hunter is arguing that he signed the agreement under economic duress, we have consistently held that financial hardship is an insufficient reason to set aside a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Asberry</span>, 692 F.2d at 1381. As this court stated in <span class="Italic">Asberry</span>, "Every loss of employment entails financial hardship. If that alone were sufficient to establish economic duress, no settlement involving it would ever be free from attack." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Koury v. SBA</span>, 40 MSPR 172, 176-77 (1989), the appellant alleged that her former counsel unreasonably her to settle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[H]e repeatedly advised her to settle even though "[s]he expressed great concern over the amount of accrued attorney's fees, the loss of retirement benefits, a positive employment recommendation, approximately $50,000 in back wages."... She also alleges that she informed her counsel that she wanted a "mistrial" but that he advised her that, if she did not accept the settlement offer, she could be left with nothing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that her counsel's actions were inappropriate. If the appellant disagreed with the judgment or tactics of her counsel, she could have dismissed him and requested a continuance. Instead, the appellant chose to retain him until after the initial decision was issued. The appellant is responsible for the actions of her chosen representative. <span class="Italic">See Andrez v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 145, 148 (1985), <span class="Italic">affd</span>, 785 F.2d 326 (Fed.

United States Postal Service</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (Fed. Cir. 1982).

<p class="Body-Text">Assertions of coercion by a union representative in the settlement process fare no better than allegations of coercion by an appellant's counsel. As to a last chance agreement, <span class="Italic">McQueen v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-11-0262-I-1 (NP 12/16/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that he signed the LCA because the local union vice president, serving as his designated representative, "insisted" that the appellant sign the agreement, and because he was "desperate" because he had been out of work for 6 months at that time. However, an appellant is responsible for the actions of his representative, including decisions to enter into a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Tates v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 678, &#x00B6; 10 (2006); <span class="Italic">see Rodriguez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 42, 45 (1998); <span class="Italic">Montoya v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 314, 317-18 (1989). Additionally, being faced with an unpleasant alternative to signing an agreement does not render the decision to sign an agreement involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 344, 346 (1991); <span class="Italic">Nies v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 510, 512 (1987). Therefore, neither alleged pressure from his designated representative, nor his lack of employment at the time that he entered into the agreement, alters the voluntary nature of the appellant's consent to form the agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to advice from a union representative, <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS,</span> DE-0752-09-0346-I-2 (NP 11/12/2010) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 431 Fed. Appx. 918 (Fed. Cir. 2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 2, 2009, the appellant, a preference-eligible custodial laborer, was removed from the Postal Service. The appellant filed an initial appeal with the Merit Systems Protection Board, but, at the appellant's request, the administrative judge dismissed his appeal without prejudice subject to the resolution of pending criminal charges. The appellant later entered into a "pre-arbitration" settlement agreement with the agency in which he agreed to resign. The parties agreed that the settlement constituted the "full and final settlement of all issues" related to the appellant's grievance. On March 19, 2010, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding, among other things, that "the parties want[ed] the agreement entered into the record so that the Board will retain jurisdiction to enforce its terms."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4814"></span>The appellant filed a timely petition for review, in which he stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The settlement I made was so I would not have my retirement taken away by the Post Office. The union came to me and said I had to go to a hearing that I would more than likey [sic] lose. I was not given any time to call or talk to anyone.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appears to assert in his petition for review that the settlement agreement should be set aside based on coercion from his union representative. However, the Board has long held that "contentions of coercion by a party's own representative do not provide a basis for setting aside a settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Wadley v. Department of Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 5 (2001); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also Ealy v.

Veterans Administration,</span> 43 M.S.P.R. 91, 95 (1990). Furthermore, being advised of a potentially negative outcome does not automatically make a decision involuntary. The fact that the appellant was faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice was limited to two unattractive options does not make his decision to enter into the settlement agreement any less voluntary. <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 325, &#x00B6; 10 (2009), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 361 F. App'x 134 (Fed. Cir. 2010). Thus, the appellant's assertions do not form a foundation to set aside the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed, <span class="Italic">Price v. USPS</span>, 431 Fed. Appx. 918, 919-20 (Fed. Cir. 2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Price's settlement agreement stated that "[t]his agreement constitutes full and final settlement of all issues relating to the above captioned grievance." Despite this voluntary waiver of appeal rights, Mr. Price filed a petition for review with the MSPB. The MSPB concluded that it did not possess jurisdiction to review the merits of the removal because Mr. Price had waived his appeal rights as part of the settlement agreement. The MSPB further found that any alleged "coercion" by the union representative was not sufficient to serve as a basis to set aside the settlement agreement. In denying Mr. Price's petition, the MSPB noted, "[t]he fact that the appellant was faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice was limited to two unattractive options does not make his decision to enter into the settlement agreement any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Price v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, No. DE0752090346-I-2, slip op. at 3 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 12, 2010) (citing <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Price timely appealed to this court. The scope of our review of MSPB fact finding is narrow, and Mr. Price bears the burden to demonstrate that the MSPB's determination is not supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Belanger v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 1 F.3d 1223, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 1993). A settlement agreement is presumed to be valid and voluntary, and an employee challenging the validity of such an agreement bears a heavy burden. <span class="Italic">Asberry v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 692 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1982) ("Those who employ the judicial appellate process to attack a settlement through which controversy has been sent to rest bear a properly heavy burden."); <span class="Italic">see also Mays v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 995 F.2d 1056, 1058-59 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (an employee's settlement of a grievance is normally considered a voluntary action). Bare allegations of coercion are not sufficient to set aside settlement agreements. <span class="Italic">See Tiburzi v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (finding that unsubstantiated allegations that petitioner's counsel and the administrative judge coerced petitioner into a settlement agreement are insufficient to invalidate the agreement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to this court, Mr. Price again alleges that his settlement agreement should be set aside because it was not voluntary. In explaining whether the MSPB incorrectly decided or failed to take into account any facts, Mr. Price simply states, "I had nothing to do with the union." He does not explain why the fact that he was not a union member renders his settlement agreement involuntary and requires reversal of the decision below. Here, the administrative judge found that Mr. Price had voluntarily signed the agreement. In addition, Mr. Price has not alleged facts sufficient to establish wrongful conduct by the agency or mutual mistake of fact or any other basis to set aside the settlement agreement. In light of these circumstances, the MSPB's dismissal is supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>
