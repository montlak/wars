<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-126"><span class="space">4.</span> Tucker Act</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Tucker Act, 28 USC 1491, creates a cause of action in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims against the United States for monetary claims based on the Constitution, any act of Congress, any regulation of an executive department, or any implied or express contract with the United States. Tort claims are specifically excluded from the jurisdiction of the Tucker Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Camastro v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-5172) (as to claims arising out of a discharge from federal employment: "While we agree with petitioner that he does not use words such as 'tort,' 'negligence,' or 'duty of care,' his claims are either overtly tort claims (e.g., pain and suffering) or they sound in tort"). <span class="Italic">Nelson v. United States</span> (Fed. Cir. 2020 NP <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200603151">No. 2020-1179</a>), explains:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1), grants the Claims Court jurisdiction "[t]o render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States." But as the Supreme Court explained, "[n]ot every claim invoking the Constitution, a federal statute, or a regulation is cognizable under the Tucker Act." <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 216 (1983). "[A] court must inquire whether the source of substantive law can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damages sustained." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 218.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Claims Court jurisdiction extends only to monetary claims, <span class="Italic">Dreiling v. United States</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP) (complaint seeking a federal agency to disclose information):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held the Court of Federal Claims' jurisdiction is limited to monetary claims against the government. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jones</span>, 131 U.S. at 19; <span class="Italic">King</span>, 395 U.S. at 2-3; <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 400-02 (1976); <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 216-17 (1983). SSG Dreiling argues that <span class="Italic">Jones</span> does not hold that the court lacks jurisdiction over equitable claims but only that it lacks jurisdiction to enforce the relief of equitable claims. This argument is unavailing. <span class="Italic">Jones</span> expressly addressed whether the jurisdictional statute "authorize[d] suits of the kind like the present, which are brought, not for the recovery of money, but for equitable relief." <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 131 U.S. at 14. It answered that question in the negative. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 18-20. Lest there was any doubt, the Supreme Court's subsequent case law has made clear that the Court of Federal Claims' jurisdiction has always "been limited to money claims against the United States Government" and does not include claims for equitable relief. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 395 U.S. at 2-3.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In more detail, considering claims under contracts, <span class="Italic">Starrett v. United States</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP):</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Tucker Act is a waiver of the United States' sovereign immunity, <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983), and confers jurisdiction to the Claims Court over, among other things, "any claim against the United States founded either upon...any Act of Congress...or upon any express or implied contract with the United States," 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1). "The Tucker Act itself does not create a substantive cause of action; in order to come within the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate source of substantive law that creates the right to money damages." <span class="Italic">Fisher v.

At the pleading stage, a source is money-mandating if the plaintiff makes "a non-frivolous allegation," <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, 402 F.3d at 1172, that the substantive law "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the [government]," <span class="Italic">United States v.

<p class="Body-Text">As with the Mandamus Act, the Tucker Act contains no substantive rights. A plaintiff must base his claim to damages on a specific remedial provision in the Constitution, a federal statute or regulation, or a contract with the United States. For an accounting of the relation between the Tucker Act and its use to recover money judgments in federal personnel actions subject to that statute, refer to <span class="Italic">Simon v. United States</span>, 113 Ct. Cl. 182 (1949). An agency personnel system, establishing pay rates pursuant to statutory authorization, qualifies as a regulation enforceable in the Court of Federal Claims under 28 USC 1491. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brodowy v. United States,</span> 482 F.3d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A court with Tucker Act jurisdiction, e.g., the Court of Federal Claims, may determine if a collective bargaining agreement improperly erodes an entitlement to reimbursement of expenses under a money-mandating statute, e.g., the Travel Expense Act, although the Tucker Act does not confer jurisdiction to resolve issues of negotiability of contract articles--the province of the Federal Labor Relations Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Filipczyk v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Martin v. United States</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2023 NP), catalogued what the Claims Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Court of Federal Claims is a court of limited jurisdiction, meaning it can only hear certain types of legal claims. Specifically, the Court of Federal Claims is primarily authorized to hear money claims founded upon the Constitution, federal statutes, executive regulations, or contracts with the United States. For example, the court has jurisdiction over claims for just compensation for the taking of private property under the Fifth Amendment, requests for the refund of federal taxes, claims regarding military and civilian pay, and claims for damages for the government's breaches of contract. The court also has jurisdiction over bid protests involving government contracts, vaccine compensation, claims of patent and copyright infringement against the United States, and certain suits brought by Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To show jurisdiction, plaintiffs at the Court of Federal Claims must identify a contract or a source of substantive law (such as a constitutional provision, federal statute, or agency regulation) that provides a right to money damages. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see Todd v. United States</span>, 386 F.3d 1091, 1093-94 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The source of law must be "money-mandating," i.e., it must mandate compensation by the government. <span class="Italic">Smith v. United States</span>, 709 F.3d 1114, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 2013). A plaintiff cannot establish jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims through only vague, conclusory, or unsupported assertions. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. Chiron Corp</span>., 136 F.3d 1317, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("Conclusory allegations of law and unwarranted inferences of fact do not suffice to support a claim.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court's limited jurisdiction means that it cannot hear many types of claims. For example, the court can only hear claims against the government; thus, it cannot hear claims brought against individuals, even individuals alleged to be federal officials. <span class="Italic">Brown v. United States</span>, 105 F.3d 621, 624 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("The Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits against the United States, not against individual federal officials."). The Court of Federal Claims also cannot review the decisions of other federal courts, including federal district courts. <span class="Italic">Joshua v. United States</span>, 17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed. Cir. 1994). And unlike district courts, the Court of Federal Claims can neither hear claims involving allegedly criminal or tortious actions, &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1), nor claims arising under the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988(a) (stating that jurisdiction over civil rights claims is "conferred on the district courts"). Similarly, claims challenging certain agency decisions, including decisions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), may not be brought before the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2342 (explaining that challenges to FCC decisions can only be brought in certain courts).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Court of Federal Claims can review certain contractual claims, <span class="Italic">see</span> &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1), jurisdiction requires a non-frivolous allegation that an express or implied-in-fact contract exists. <span class="Italic">Trauma Serv. Grp. v. United States</span>, 104 F.3d 1321, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("To show jurisdiction in the <span id="Page_5347"></span>Court of Federal Claims, [a plaintiff] must show that either an express or implied-in-fact contract underlies its claim."). Simply citing to various Constitutional Amendments or Articles, without more, is insufficient for a plaintiff to establish the existence of a contract for jurisdictional purposes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Taylor v. United States</span>, 113 Fed. Cl. 171, 173 (2013) (rejecting the argument that the Constitution was a contract with plaintiff). Further, the Constitution is not itself a money-mandating source of law that would grant jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States v. Connolly</span>, 716 F.2d 882, 887 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (explaining that the First Amendment is not money-mandating).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 28 USC 1346(a)(2), Tucker Act jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims is concurrent with that of the federal district courts in cases for claims less than $10,000 ("Little Tucker Act" suits).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The APA provides for judicial review of certain agency actions in the federal district courts. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701-706.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he government urges that, even though the ground for the Court of Federal Claims' decision was incorrect, the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction because the statute and regulations are not money-mandating. Rather, the government argues, the regulations "merely reflect [the Office of Personnel Management's] delegation of authority to the agencies." We disagree. The Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491 (2000), constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity with regard to claims over which the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">United States v. Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. 206, 212, 103 S. Ct. 2961, 77 L. Ed. 2d 580 (1983).

Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 398, 96 S. Ct. 948, 47 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1976). Instead, in a context such as this, another statute or regulation must be money-mandating to create such a substantive right against the government. <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, 463 U.S. at 218, 103 S. Ct. 2961; <span class="Italic">Martinez v. United States</span>, 333 F.3d 1295, 1302-03 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that a statute is money-mandating "if, but only if, it can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained." <span class="Italic">United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe</span>, 537 U.S. 465, 472, 123 S. Ct. 1126, 155 L. Ed. 2d 40 (2003) (internal citations omitted).

While the premise to a Tucker Act claim will not be lightly inferred, a fair inference will do." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal citation omitted). Furthermore, a statute can be money-mandating even if the government enjoys some discretion under it. <span class="Italic">Bradley v. United States</span>, 870 F.2d 1578, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("There are limits, of course, to the discretion inherent in [the prevailing pay rate statutes] ....

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5348"></span>The relevant statute in this case provides that an employee at a remote duty site "is entitled" to the remote duty allowance. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5942(a). The statute further provides that "[t]he allowance <span class="Italic">shall be paid</span> under regulations prescribed by the President." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). We have repeatedly recognized that the use of the word "shall" generally makes a statute money-mandating. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McBryde v. United States</span>, 299 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed.

Indeed, we have held that 37 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204 is money-mandating, and it contains substantively identical language to the statute at issue here: "The following persons <span class="Italic">are entitled</span> to the basic pay of the pay grade to which assigned or distributed," 37 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204(a) (2000) (emphasis added). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Martinez</span>, 333 F.3d at 1303 (acknowledging that 37 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 204 is money-mandating); <span class="Italic">Holley v.

We therefore hold that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5942(a) and its implementing regulations are money-mandating.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Khan v. United States</span>, 201 F.3d 1375, 1377-78 (Fed.

There was no "money-mandating" statute to support the claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his first prayer for relief, Dr. Khan seeks "all pay and allowances which he would have received had he continued in full time employment in his prior position from the date of retirement to the present, minus such retirement pay as he has presently received." The Court of Federal Claims held that it lacked jurisdiction to hear this claim under the Tucker Act. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Federal Claims derives its jurisdiction from the Tucker Act, which gives the court "jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort." 28 USC &#x00A7; 1491(a)(1) (1994). The Tucker Act does not, by itself, create any causes of action against the United States for money damages. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 398 (1976). Instead, to invoke jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a contractual relationship, constitutional provision, statute, or regulation that provides a substantive right to money damages. <span class="Italic">See Hamlet v. United States</span>, 63 F.3d 1097, 1101 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In other words, the plaintiff "must assert a claim under a separate money-mandating constitutional provision, statute, or regulation, the violation of which supports a claim for damages against the United States." <span class="Italic">James v. Caldera</span>, 159 F.3d 573, 580 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his brief, Dr. Khan claims entitlement to monetary relief under 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7401, 7431-33 (1994). We conclude that none of these provisions can be interpreted as mandating the compensation that Dr. Khan requests in his first claim, namely the difference between his current retirement benefits and what he would have received had he not retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7401 of title 38 authorizes the Secretary to appoint medical personnel as necessary to provide medical care to veterans. It does not mention pay, nor does it create a cause of action for monetary damages. Thus, it cannot be construed as a money-mandating statute. <span class="Italic">See Testan</span>, 424 U.S. at 400 (defining a money-mandating statute as one that "can fairly be interpreted as mandating compensation by the Federal Government for the damage sustained").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 7431-33 govern the payment of "special pay" to qualified physicians and dentists in the VHA. Although these provisions mandate the payment of money to qualified employees, such payments are limited to currently employed physicians and dentists. For instance, section 7431(f) states that "[s]pecial pay may not be paid...to a physician or dentist who (1) is employed on less than a quarter-time basis." Likewise, section 7433 specifically applies to "eligible physicians employed on a full-time basis." These sections preclude payment of special pay to a retiree. Similarly, section 7431(b) states that "[s]pecial pay may be paid to a physician or dentist...only upon the execution of, and for the duration of, a written agreement...in accordance with section 7432 of this title." Section 7432 requires that such agreements cover at least one year of service in the VHA. Again, this would preclude payment of special pay to retirees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his first claim, Dr. Khan does not assert that he is a current employee of the VHA, nor does he claim back pay for a prior period of employment. Instead, he claims an entitlement to special pay under 38 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7431-33 as a retiree, because of alleged misrepresentations made to him by his employer regarding his retirement benefits. As discussed above, the statutory provisions cited by Dr. Khan do not apply to retirees. We conclude, therefore, that Dr. Khan's first claim is not based on a money-mandating statute and that the Court of Federal Claims did not err in holding that it lacked jurisdiction over this claim.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Tucker Act remedial authority and jurisdiction may be precluded by the preemptive effective of the remedial structure of the Reform Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LeBlanc v.

United States</span>, 204 Fed. Appx. 877, 878 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP). The Federal Circuit determined that a Tucker Act lawsuit in the Court of Federal Claims stemming from the appellant's termination from a position in the judicial branch, in violation of a "for cause" provision of a statute, 18 USC 3602(a), was precluded by the preemptive scope of the CSRA, <span class="Italic">Semper v. United States</span>, 694 F.3d 90, 91-96 (Fed. Cir. 2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Alfredo Semper worked as a probation officer for the District Court of the Virgin Islands until he was removed from his position on August 6, 2010. The reason given for his termination was that he was negligent in the supervision of a convicted defendant who was killed while on release pending sentencing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Semper filed a complaint in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims seeking <span id="Page_5349"></span>review of his termination. As defendants, he named the United States as well as the Chief Judge of the District Court of the Virgin Islands and the court's Chief U.S. Probation Officer. In his complaint, Mr. Semper asserted that he was "denied Due Process under the U.S. Constitution" and that the defendants violated 18 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3602(a), which states that a court may remove a compensated probation officer "for cause." Mr. Semper argued that his termination was unjustified and that he was entitled to reinstatement and back pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argued that the Court of Federal Claims lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Semper's claim. The government noted that, under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), Mr. Semper was classified as a member of the "excepted service," not the "competitive service," and was not among those excepted service employees whom the statute makes eligible for judicial or administrative review of adverse agency action. Because the CSRA governs the procedural rights of members of both the competitive service and the excepted service, the government argued that Congress's decision to deny any right to administrative or judicial review to persons such as Mr. Semper for actions such as termination foreclosed him from obtaining review of his termination in other forums, such as the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court of Federal Claims dismissed Mr. Semper's complaint for lack of jurisdiction, but not on that ground. The court found that because Mr. Semper was employed in the Judicial Branch, the CSRA did not apply to him and therefore did not have the effect of foreclosing his access to judicial or administrative remedies. However, the court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over his claim because he failed to point to any money-mandating statute or regulation that would give him a right to contest his termination before that court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the judgment of the Court of Federal Claims but affirm on the reasoning originally advanced by the government below: that because Mr. Semper is a member of the excepted service, the CSRA forecloses his right to seek review of his termination in the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The portion of the CSRA that is codified in Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the United States Code details the procedural protections afforded to government employees who are subjected to certain adverse personnel actions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7501-7543. The statute provides those procedural protections for only certain adverse actions, including removal, suspension for more than 14 days, and reduction in pay or grade. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7512. In disputes involving those actions, the CSRA provides for administrative review by the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB"), followed by review by this court.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute provides that those procedures are available only to "employees," a term that excludes members of the excepted service who do not satisfy particular eligibility or tenure requirements, and it further excludes certain categories of "employees" from entitlement to the review procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) (limiting the definition of "employee" to certain personnel); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(b) (excluding certain "employees" from the provided procedures).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Semper was in the excepted service, not the competitive service. Therefore, he does not fall within section 7511(a)(1)(A). Mr. Semper was not preference eligible. Therefore, he does not fall within section 7511(a)(1)(B). Mr. Semper was not serving a probationary or trial period pending conversion to the competitive service. Therefore, he does not fall within section 7511(a)(1)(C)(i). Finally, although Mr. Semper had completed two years of current continuous service at the time of his termination, his service was in the Judicial Branch and not in a position in an Executive Branch agency. Therefore, he does not fall within section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). For those reasons, Mr. Semper does not fall within the statutory definition of an "employee" and therefore is not entitled to the administrative and judicial review procedures prescribed by the CSRA. That raises the question whether Congress's decision not to afford persons in Mr. Semper's position any right of administrative or judicial review under the CSRA forecloses him from obtaining judicial review of his termination by an alternative mechanism, i.e., through an action in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1491.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The answer to that question begins with the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 108 S. Ct. 668, 98 L. Ed. 2d 830 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, an excepted service employee with the federal government challenged his suspension, arguing that it was unwarranted and that he was entitled to pay for the period of his suspension. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 442. He filed a complaint in the Claims Court because the CSRA at that time did not allow excepted service personnel who were not "preference eligible" to challenge adverse personnel actions in the MSPB. The Court found that in enacting the CSRA Congress created an elaborate new framework, which replaced the preexisting "patchwork system" with "an integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 445. The new statute, the Court explained, "prescribes in great detail the protections and remedies applicable to such [adverse agency] action, including the availability of administrative and judicial review." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 443. The Court noted that no provision of the CSRA gives non-preference-eligible members of the excepted service the right to administrative or judicial review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The question before the Court in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, as in this case, was "whether that withholding of remedy was meant to preclude judicial review for those employees, or rather merely to leave them free to pursue the remedies that had been available before enactment of the CSRA." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 443-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After analyzing the statutory scheme in some detail, including the exclusion of certain employees from the review procedures, the Court in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> concluded that the CSRA "displays a clear congressional intent to deny the excluded employees the protections of Chapter 75--including judicial review--for personnel action covered by that chapter." 484 U.S. at 447. In light of the "comprehensive nature of the CSRA, the attention that it gives throughout to the rights of nonpreference excepted service employees, and the fact that it does not include them in provisions for administrative and judicial review contained in Chapter 75," the Court regarded the statute as reflecting "a congressional judgment that those employees should not be able to demand judicial review for the type of personnel action covered by that chapter." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 448. The absence of any provision for those employees to obtain judicial review, the Court concluded, "is not an uninformative consequence of the limited scope of the statute, but rather manifestation of a considered congressional judgment that they should not have statutory entitlement to review for adverse action of the type governed by Chapter 75." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 448-49. Accordingly, the Court held that where the CSRA covered a specific adverse action, the Claims Court was deprived of jurisdiction to review those actions in cases brought by non-preference-eligible excepted service personnel. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 455.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Semper argues that the reach of the CSRA, and therefore the holding of <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, is limited to employees of the Executive Branch. Under that view, because he was a Judicial Branch employee, his claim is not subject to the inference that Congress intended to bar persons in his position from recourse to remedies outside the CSRA, and he is therefore free to seek and obtain review from the Court of Federal Claims if he can satisfy that court's standard jurisdictional inquiry. That argument is unpersuasive for several reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, in considering the effect of the CSRA on the previous "patchwork system," the Court in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> did not limit its inquiry to employees of the Executive Branch, but instead repeatedly referred simply to "federal employees." 484 U.S. at 443 (noting that the CSRA created "an elaborate 'new framework for evaluating adverse personnel actions against [federal employees] ,'" <span class="Italic">quoting Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 470 U.S. 768, 774, 105 S. Ct. 1620, 84 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1985)); <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 445 (The CSRA was "designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration."); <span class="Italic">see also Dotson v. Griesa</span>, 398 F.3d 156, 170 (2d Cir. 2005) (<span class="Italic">Fausto</span> construed the CSRA's "exclusion of excepted service employees (including judicial branch employees)").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the definitional provisions of Title 5 make clear that the terms "civil service," "competitive service," and "excepted service" are not limited to employees of the Executive Branch. The term "civil service" is expressly defined, for purposes of all of Title 5, to include positions in "the executive, judicial, and legislative branches" of the federal government. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2101. Similarly, sections 2102 and 2103 of Title 5 define "competitive service" as including "civil service positions not in the executive branch which are specifically included in the competitive service by statute," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2102, and "excepted service" as consisting of "those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service," <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 2103. The explicit reference to non-Executive-Branch positions in section 2102 makes clear that the references to the competitive service and the executive service in the CSRA are not limited to Executive Branch personnel. Therefore, Mr. Semper falls within section 2103's definition of an excepted service employee, and the Supreme Court's analysis in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> applies directly to him without regard to the branch of government in which he served.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Mr. Semper points out that sections 2101 through 2103 of Title 5 were not enacted as part of the CSRA, but were part of Title 5 before the enactment of the CSRA. While that is true, it does not advance his argument that the CSRA has no application to employees outside of the Executive Branch. By using terms in the CSRA that were previously defined in Title 5, Congress adopted those definitions as if they had been included for the first time in the CSRA. Indeed, if definitional sections 2101 through 2103 had not been in Title 5 before the enactment of the CSRA, Congress would have had to include them to provide definitions for the terms "civil service," "competitive service," and "excepted service."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Mr.&#x2003;Semper also argues that the government's contention that the CSRA forecloses actions by Judicial Branch employees in the <span id="Page_5350"></span>Court of Federal Claims challenging adverse agency actions of the type covered by the CSRA would invalidate internal administrative remedies devised by Judicial Branch agencies to deal with their employees' employment-related complaints. But Congress's decision to foreclose civil service employees in the excepted service from challenging adverse employment actions in the Court of Federal Claims does not in any way suggest that Congress sought to bar the judiciary from devising administrative remedies for employees within the Judicial Branch, any more than the CSRA would bar an Executive Branch agency from implementing additional procedural protections for its employees within the agency beyond the procedural protections and review provisions created by the CSRA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, amendments that Congress made to the CSRA following the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> decision add further support to the inference that Congress did not intend to limit the preclusive effect of the CSRA to only Executive Branch employees. In response to <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, Congress enacted the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990). That statute extended MSPB review rights to non-preference-eligible employees in the excepted service, but only within strict limits. Those employees given a right of review included "an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)...who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). Having carefully limited the new right of review to certain excepted service employees in the Executive Branch, it seems unlikely that Congress envisioned that excepted service employees who did not qualify under the extended coverage would be entitled to litigate their employment-related claims before the Court of Federal Claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Later the same year, Congress enacted the Administrative Office of the United States Courts Personnel Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-474, 104 Stat. 1097. In that Act, Congress closed a loophole in the statutory scheme that had granted CSRA review rights to certain employees of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 101-770(I) (1990), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1709, 1710. The statute authorized the Administrative Office to create a personnel system that is "free from executive branch controls and more similar to that of the rest of the judicial branch" on the ground that keeping that office subject to Executive Branch oversight of its personnel activities was deemed "contrary to the doctrine of separation of powers." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Again, it is reasonable to infer from Congress's decision to withdraw CSRA review rights from Judicial Branch employees in the Administrative Office that Congress was acting in accordance with its general purpose not to grant statutory review rights to excepted service employees of the Judicial Branch. There is certainly no indication that upon withdrawing CSRA review rights from those Administrative Office employees, Congress contemplated that they would suddenly gain access to the Court of Federal Claims as a forum in which to adjudicate their personnel claims. <span class="Italic">See Dotson</span>, 398 F.3d 170-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several other circuits have reached the same conclusion that we reach here: that Congress's withholding of CSRA review rights was not inadvertent, and that Congress did not intend for Judicial Branch employees who were not entitled to review under the CSRA to have alternative routes to judicial review for adverse agency actions such as termination. <span class="Italic">See Dotson</span>, 398 F.3d at 169-71; <span class="Italic">Blankenship v. McDonald</span>, 176 F.3d 1192, 1195 (9th Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Lee v. Hughes</span>, 145 F.3d 1272, 1274-75 (11th Cir. 1998). Although those cases did not involve efforts to obtain judicial review from the Court of Federal Claims, the courts in each of those cases interpreted the CSRA, as construed in <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, as reflecting a congressional intention to deny judicial review of adverse agency actions for Judicial Branch employees in the excepted service and are not eligible for review under the provisions of the CSRA; the courts' analysis in those cases is therefore consistent with the result we reach in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At oral argument, the question was raised whether Mr. Semper could litigate his due process claim in a district court action, either in an action for damages under the <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> doctrine (<span class="Italic">see Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics</span>, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S. Ct. 1999, 29 L. Ed. 2d 619 (1971)), or by seeking reinstatement, or both. We do not address that issue other than to note that it has been presented to a number of circuits, which have expressed varying views on the issue. <span class="Italic">See Dotson v. Griesa</span>, 398 F.3d 156, 180 (2d Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Mitchum v. Hurt</span>, 73 F.3d 30, 36 (3d Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Saul v.

Mr. Semper has informed us that if he is not successful in obtaining review of his dismissal by the Court of Federal Claims, he will pursue his due process claim in a district court action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we conclude that the CSRA "was meant to preclude judicial review" of adverse agency actions by employees in Mr. Semper's position, rather than "merely to leave them free to pursue the remedies that had been available before enactment of the CSRA," <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 443-44, we affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Semper's complaint. We do not address the question whether the dispute would otherwise be within the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, an issue on which that court ruled against Mr. Semper.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Sixth Circuit determined that the Reform Act precluded a Tucker Act and APA suit by an administrative law judge who received minor discipline and other unfavorable treatment, <span class="Italic">Krafsur v. Davenport</span>, 736 F.3d 1032, 1036-41 (6th Cir. 2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Tucker Act and Administrative Procedure Act lawsuits raise a more complex question of statutory interpretation. The Tucker Act waives sovereign immunity in lawsuits seeking damages from the United States for various legal wrongs, including constitutional violations. 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1346(a)(2). And the Administrative Procedure Act waives sovereign immunity in lawsuits seeking non-monetary remedies from the United States for various legal wrongs, again including constitutional violations. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 702, 706(2)(B). Unlike Krafsur's <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim, these lawsuits target the Social Security Administration, not Davenport.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question here is a similar one: Does the Civil Service Reform Act displace Krafsur's remedies under the Tucker and Administrative Procedure Acts? As a general rule, the enactment of a new set of remedies does not by itself take away preexisting statutory remedies for the same wrong. But a federal statute precludes resort to alternative remedies if this result is "fairly discernible in the statutory scheme." <span class="Italic">Elgin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this standard, <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span> concluded that the Civil Service Reform Act establishes the sole track for challenging personnel decisions on statutory grounds. 484 U.S. 439, 455 (1988). The Act, to be sure, does not say in so many words that it precludes employees from invoking alternative remedies. But the Act establishes a comprehensive, reticulated and precise system of review that accounts for the rank of the employee and the severity of the personnel action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 448-52. The Act's history shows that the Act was designed to replace haphazard arrangements for review of personnel decisions with a unified framework. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 444-45. These considerations gave the Court "ample" grounds for discerning exclusivity in the statutory scheme. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 452.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the same standard, <span class="Italic">Elgin v. Department of Treasury</span> extended <span class="Italic">Fausto's</span> holding to constitutional claims. 132 S.

As a result, it held, the arguments supporting the Act's exclusivity for statutory challenges work just as well for constitutional challenges. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2134-35.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Fausto</span> and <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> control today's case. The Civil Service Reform Act spells out in painstaking detail the path an employee must follow if he wants to challenge a prohibited personnel practice. And Krafsur concedes that a lawsuit in district court strays from this path. Because exclusivity is fairly discernible in the Act's scheme, whether with respect to constitutional or other statutory challenges to personnel decisions, Krafsur's lawsuit may not proceed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Ryon v. O'Neill</span>, 894 F.2d 199, 204 (6th Cir. 1990) (reaching a parallel conclusion with respect to a statutory challenge to a prohibited personnel practice). Our earlier analysis of the <span class="Italic">Bivens</span> claim reinforces this conclusion. It would be strange if the Act sent a strong enough message of exclusivity to displace a constitutionally rooted remedy but not to displace remedies created by Congress. In both contexts, "what you get under the [Civil Service Reform Act] is what you get." <span class="Italic">Fornaro v. James</span>, 416 F.3d 63, 67 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (Roberts, J.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Krafsur responds that we have gauged the Civil Service Reform Act's exclusivity under the wrong standard. He points to a line of cases, most prominently <span class="Italic">Webster v. Doe</span>, holding that a court should not interpret a statute to "deny any judicial forum for a colorable constitutional claim" unless Congress's "intent to do so [is] clear." 486 U.S. 592, 603 (1988); <span class="Italic">see also Demore v. Kim</span>, 538 U.S. 510, 517 (2003); <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians</span>, 476 U.S. 667, 681 n.12 (1986); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Robison</span>, 415 U.S. 361, 373-74 (1974). The "heightened standard" established by these decisions requires more clarity than the fair-discernability test we have just applied. <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2132.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> did not apply a heightened standard of clarity, why should we? Krafsur offers an answer. <span class="Italic">Elgin</span> involved the most severe type of personnel decision, an adverse action. The Act thus granted the employee review before the Merit Systems Protection Board and the Federal Circuit. This guarantee of eventual judicial review made <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s special rule inapplicable. <span class="Italic">See Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2132. This case by contrast involves a less serious type of personnel decision, a prohibited personnel practice, and the Act does not give Krafsur a guaranteed path to court. The Special Counsel might stop him before he gets to the Board; and if he does not get to the Board, he cannot get to the Federal Circuit. Krafsur argues that <span id="Page_5351"></span>this roadblock to judicial review, absent in <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, activates <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s special standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Krafsur's effort "to carve out an exception" to the Act's "exclusivity" for constitutional challenges to prohibited personnel practices, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 2134, fails for two reasons. The impediments to judicial review here are too slight to bring <span class="Italic">Doe</span> into play. And even if we could bring <span class="Italic">Doe</span> into play, it would not alter the outcome in the case at hand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s heightened standard does not govern today's case. Each precedent in the <span class="Italic">Doe</span> series involved a <span class="Italic">total</span> denial of judicial review for constitutional claims. This case involves only a narrow limit upon judicial review. Krafsur may still take his case to the Federal Circuit, so long as he gets clearance from the Office of Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the most part, the claims the Special Counsel keeps out do not belong in court anyway. The Special Counsel weeds out frivolous complaints, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(B), and frivolous arguments, even frivolous <span class="Italic">constitutional</span> arguments, have no special entitlement to reach a federal judge. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 486 U.S. at 603 (requiring a "heightened showing" only when a statute denies a judicial forum "for a <span class="Italic">colorable</span> constitutional claim" (emphasis added)). The Special Counsel also weeds out grievances that agencies stand ready to redress without litigation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(b)(2)(C), but here too the employee kept out of court can hardly complain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond that, various safeguards attending the Special Counsel procedure diminish the risk of blocking meritorious constitutional challenges. The Special Counsel has every incentive to help wronged employees. The Act makes it his <span class="Italic">job</span> to expose agency misbehavior and to "protect employees...from prohibited personnel practices." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1212(a). And the Act protects his independence in performing this task. The Special Counsel receives his appointment from the President, may be removed only for cause, chooses his staff without interference from other executive agencies, and has independent authority to launch investigations, to participate in Board proceedings and to file friend-of-the-court briefs. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1211(b), 1212(b)-(d), (h).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further still, the requirement that an employee receive the Special Counsel's go ahead before heading to court covers only relatively minor matters. Recall that employees complaining about severe personnel decisions, like removal or demotion, may march straight to the Board and the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7521, 7703. Recall also that employees complaining about less severe personnel decisions may head straight to court if the complained-of decision involves particularly heinous types of wrongdoing like race discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(d). Recall too that employees alleging retaliation for whistleblowing or "for refusing to obey an order that would require [him] to violate a law," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(D), may go straight to the Board and then to the Federal Circuit. This last option indeed covers many of Krafsur's claims.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We doubt whether such a modest clearance requirement, accompanied by such rigorous safeguards and applicable only to relatively minor decisions, would trigger <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s special rule in <span class="Italic">any</span> context. We are confident that it does not trigger the rule in the context of government employment. The government has "greater leeway in its dealings with citizen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large." <span class="Italic">Engquist v. Or. Dep't of Agriculture</span>, 553 U.S. 591, 599 (2008). And in general "a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 600. These principles do not mean that the government workplace is a Constitution-free zone. But they do mean that many constitutional imperatives apply with less force when the government acts as employer. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NASA v. Nelson</span>, 131 S. Ct. 746 (2011) (substantive due process); <span class="Italic">Borough of Duryea v. Guarnieri</span>, 131 S. Ct. 2488 (2011) (right to petition); <span class="Italic">Engquist</span>, 553 U.S. 591 (equal protection); <span class="Italic">Garcetti v. Ceballos</span>, 547 U.S. 410 (2006) (freedom of speech); <span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Ortega</span>, 480 U.S. 709 (1987) (freedom from unreasonable searches). In the same way, the government's needs as employer do not suspend the requirement that Congress speak clearly before foreclosing all judicial review of constitutional challenges. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 486 U.S. at 603. But they argue against giving this requirement a broad sweep. <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s heightened standard of clarity in the last analysis does not govern this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even under <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s heightened standard of clarity, Krafsur's efforts to sidestep the Act's remedial regime would still fall short. The Act leaves no doubt that an employee who believes that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred must take his complaint to the Special Counsel, not a district court, even if he contends that the practice violates the Constitution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of &#x00A7; 2302 (which deals with prohibited personnel practices) signals that the Act's exclusivity extends to constitutional challenges. Covered prohibited practices include many actions that would offend the Constitution. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(A) (discriminating on account of race, color, religion, sex or national origin); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1)(E) (discriminating on account of political affiliation); <span class="Italic">id</span>. 2302(b)(3) (coercing an employee's political activity). The section also prohibits violating "any law, rule, or regulation implementing, or directly concerning,...merit system principles," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(12), and these principles in turn entitle employees to "proper regard for their...constitutional rights," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2301(b)(2). These provisions show that Congress anticipated that the Office of Special Counsel and the Board would handle constitutional as well as statutory issues. <span class="Italic">See Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2134 ("[The Board] routinely adjudicates some constitutional claims," especially "claims that an agency [violated] an employee's First or Fourth Amendment rights."); <span class="Italic">Bush</span>, 462 U.S. at 386 ("Constitutional challenges to agency action...are fully cognizable within [the Act's] system."). An employee may not evade this result by artful pleading--by taking a core prohibited personnel practice covered by &#x00A7; 2302 and dressing it up as a constitutional claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The text of &#x00A7; 2302 provides a further reason to doubt Krafsur's theory. If an employee alleges discrimination on account of forbidden grounds like race or sex, &#x00A7; 2302(d) permits him to sue in district court under the civil rights laws. The Act's special treatment of discrimination claims "demonstrates that Congress knew how to provide alternative forums for judicial review based on the nature of an employee's claim." <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2134. Congress's failure to include a similar exception for challenges like Krafsur's "indicates that Congress intended no such exception." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 2135.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Allowing employees like Krafsur to jump straight to district court also would overturn a central element of the Act's architecture: the harsher the action, the greater the employee's entitlement to review. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> at 3-4; <span class="Italic">see also Kloeckner v. Solis</span>, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/11-184_5ifl.pdf">133 S. Ct. 596</a>, 600 (2012) ("The Civil Service Reform Act...provides graduated procedural protections depending on an action's severity."). Under <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, employees facing more severe decisions (adverse actions) must go through the Board before bringing their constitutional challenge in court. Under Krafsur's theory, however, employees facing less severe decisions (prohibited practices) would enjoy "the luxury of immediate judicial review, without any resort to the administrative process," <span class="Italic">Carducci</span>, 714 F.2d at 174-75. Put concretely, an administrative law judge would have more extensive remedies for a reprimand than for a dismissal, more for a temporary reassignment than for a permanent demotion, more for a denial of leave than for a suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Treating the Act's remedial scheme as non-exclusive also would subvert the Act's objectives. One aim of the Act is to prevent "parallel litigation." <span class="Italic">Elgin</span>, 132 S. Ct. at 2135. Krafsur's theory, however, would yield parallel litigation whenever a minor personnel decision escalates into a major one--whenever, say, a supervisor follows up a reprimand with a suspension. The employee would have to challenge the suspension (an adverse action) before the Board but could challenge the reprimand (at most a prohibited personnel practice) in district court--meaning that two different tribunals would simultaneously hear about related personnel decisions resulting from the same employee conduct and involving the same constitutional issues. More, Krafsur's theory would yield bifurcated litigation even when no such escalation occurs. A prohibited personnel practice might violate both a statute and the Constitution. Krafsur's theory would require routing the statutory part of the case through the Special Counsel, the Board and the Federal Circuit, and the constitutional part through the district courts and the regional courts of appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act serves another purpose: ensuring that federal workplaces across the country follow a uniform body of law developed by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. at 449. Under Krafsur's approach, however, an employee could challenge a prohibited personnel practice in the regional circuits, each of which might have its own take on the Constitution. Worse, Krafsur's approach encourages forum shopping. Does the law in the Federal Circuit favor the employee's constitutional argument? Then he can follow the Special Counsel route. Would the employee fare better in one of the regional circuits? Then he can sue in district court. The employee, indeed, would not even have to choose between these two options. He could complain to the Special Counsel <span class="Italic">and</span> sue in federal district court, hoping that one way or another he will win.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Far from coming up on rare occasions, these problems likely would arise frequently. Constitutional claims, especially equal protection and due process challenges, "are part of the ordinary fodder of review" in federal employment disputes. <span class="Italic">See Elgin v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 641 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 2011) (Boudin, J.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Krafsur's interpretation of the Act would in short make a muddle of its text, a shambles of its structure and a lost cause of its purpose. That is a clear enough indication of statutory meaning to overcome any barrier set up by <span class="Italic">Doe</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Krafsur persists that <span class="Italic">Doe</span> requires more clarity still. But unlike say <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Ashcroft</span>, 501 U.S. 452 (1991) (involving restriction of a State's core sovereign powers), or <span class="Italic">Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon</span>, 473 U.S. 234 (1985) (involving elimination of a State's immunity from suit), <span class="Italic">Doe</span> does not establish an express-statement requirement. An early decision in the <span class="Italic">Doe</span> sequence, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Robison</span>, proves the point. The Court observed that "no explicit provision [in the relevant statute] bars judicial <span id="Page_5352"></span>consideration of [Robison's] constitutional claims." 415 U.S. at 367. If <span class="Italic">Doe</span>'s heightened standard were an express-statement rule, the Court would have stopped there. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dellmuth v. Muth</span>, 491 U.S. 223, 230 (1989) ("[Under <span class="Italic">Atascadero</span>], evidence of congressional intent must be both unequivocal and textual....Legislative history generally will be irrelevant to a judicial inquiry into whether Congress intended to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment."). But it did not. The Court went on to consult statutory purpose, legislative history and administrative practice before pronouncing the law insufficiently clear to prohibit constitutional review. <span class="Italic">Robison</span>, 415 U.S. at 367-74.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Demore v. Kim</span> does not undercut this conclusion. Kim, an alien detained pending his removal from the country, wanted to use the writ of habeas corpus to raise a constitutional challenge to his confinement. The Court held that he could do so, because the governing statute "contain[ed] no explicit provision barring [his lawsuit]." 538 U.S. at 517. The Court explained, however, that it had insisted upon a "particularly clear statement" because of the special presumption in favor of habeas review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This case does not involve the Great Writ and thus presents no occasion for ratcheting up the <span class="Italic">Doe</span> standard.</p>
