<p class="Body-Text">Many reasons are offered for setting aside a settlement: coercion, lack of authority to enter the agreement (by a purported representative who is alleged to have lacked that authority), mutual mistake, fraud, mental incapacity to enter the agreement. Few are set aside. "An appellant challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidation." <span class="Italic">McGowan v. DHUD,</span> PH-0752-10-0572-I-1 (NP 4/1/2011) (citing<span class="Italic"> Schwartz v.

NASA,</span> DC-0432-11-0033-I-1 (NP 8/19/2011) ("The appellant's unsupported assertion of coercion does not provide a basis for voiding the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Bowie v.

<p class="Body-Text">A summary analysis of several reasons advanced to set aside as coerced a settlement agreement reached during a Board appeal was provided by <span class="Italic">Kent v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 524 Fed. Appx. 614, 615-18 (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kent attended a hearing before an MSPB administrative judge on January 10, 2012, where the administrative judge encouraged him to engage in settlement discussions with the Air Force. Kent and the Air Force engaged in settlement negotiations and ultimately entered into a settlement agreement ("the Settlement Agreement" or "Agreement") on the day of the hearing. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Kent agreed to "withdraw and never reinstitute" his appeal and to "withdraw any and all other claims against the Department of the Air Force...arising from his civil employment at Dobbins Air Reserve Base." In return, the Air Force agreed to rescind Kent's removal, allow Kent to resign with a clear record, pay Kent $25,000.00, and provide a neutral reference. The Settlement Agreement also stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This Agreement was freely and voluntarily entered into without threats, coercion or duress and the parties fully understand and accept the terms of this Agreement. All parties have been afforded the opportunity to carefully review this Agreement, read and raise questions about its meaning, and consult with counsel or other representative prior to signing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Agreement further provided: "PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, UNDERSTAND IT, AND ARE VOLUNTARILY ENTERING INTO IT. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY, IT CONTAINS A RELEASE OF KNOWN AND UNKNOWN CLAIMS." On January 11, 2012, an MSPB administrative judge issued an initial decision <span id="Page_4799"></span>dismissing Kent's appeal based on the settlement between Kent and the Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kent subsequently appealed the January 11, 2012 initial decision, contending, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that he was coerced into signing the Settlement Agreement and that the Air Force procured his acceptance of the Agreement by fraud. On September 27, 2012, the MSPB issued a final order denying Kent's petition for review and affirming the January 11, 2012 initial decision. Kent now appeals the final order of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Kent contends that he was coerced into signing the Settlement Agreement. Kent asserts that he attended a hearing before an MSPB administrative judge on January 10, 2012, where the administrative judge encouraged him to engage in settlement discussions with the Air Force. Kent was not represented by counsel at the hearing or during the settlement discussions that took place that day. According to Kent, the Air Force, through the administrative judge, indicated that it would withdraw its offer to settle if Kent did not accept it on January 10, 2012. Kent alleges that, because of the deadline imposed upon him, he was denied the opportunity to consult with an attorney prior to accepting the Settlement Agreement. Consequently, Kent asserts that, particularly in light of the financial difficulty he had experienced following his removal from employment, he had no choice but to sign the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">None of Kent's allegations indicates that Kent's decision to settle with the Air Force was involuntary, that the administrative judge coerced Kent into accepting the Settlement Agreement, or that he was left with no other alternative. The fact that Kent was not provided with an attorney or afforded additional time to obtain counsel does not indicate that Kent involuntarily settled his dispute with the Air Force. Kent has not presented any evidence that he was prevented from bringing counsel to the hearing on January 10, 2012, or that, in the absence of counsel, he was unable to understand the settlement terms offered by the Air Force. Indeed, as noted, the Agreement itself recites Kent's full understanding of it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While Kent asserts that his financial distress prompted him to accept the Settlement Agreement, that fact does not establish that his acceptance of the Settlement Agreement's terms was involuntary. As this court has observed, "[e]very loss of employment entails financial hardship. If that alone were sufficient to establish economic duress, no settlement involving it would ever be free from attack....[E]ven threatened financial disaster is not sufficient." <span class="Italic">Asberry</span>, 692 F.2d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kent's coercion argument fares no better. There is nothing improper about an administrative judge conveying the terms of a settlement offer to a party--including the fact that the offer may be a short-lived one. And, there is nothing improper about the Air Force's decision to place a deadline on their offer. <span class="Italic">See Parrott v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 519 F.3d 1328, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2008) ("[t]he fact that [the petitioner] had a relatively short period of time to decide whether to sign the settlement agreement and resign...did not render his resignation involuntary."). Other than the Air Force's demand for a quick response from him, Kent has not pointed to any other facts that would support his claim of coercion. Kent's "bare allegation of coercion is not sufficient to set aside the parties' settlement agreement." <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Kent has failed to establish that the circumstances were such that he was left with no alternative but to agree to the Settlement Agreement. As the MSPB correctly observed, Kent "remained free to refuse to sign the [S]ettlement [a]greement and insist on a ruling by the administrative judge." Thus, because Kent has not satisfied any of the criteria for establishing the invalidity of the Settlement Agreement, we affirm the MSPB's decision refusing to set it aside.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to challenging the validity of the Settlement Agreement, Kent asserts that his removal from employment was improper in light of evidence that he presented to the MSPB prior to the remand order of September 19, 2011. Because we agree with the MSPB's determination that the Settlement Agreement resolves the employment dispute between Kent and the Air Force, however, we lack jurisdiction to address Kent's challenge related to the propriety of his dismissal. <span class="Italic">See Asberry</span>, 692 F.2d at 1380.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another summary of factors considered as to the scope and validity of a settlement is taken from <span class="Italic">Capil v. DOD</span>, SF-0752-10-0744-B-1 (NP 4/16/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal of an alleged reduction in grade is before the Board after remand to the regional office. <span class="Italic">See Capil v. Department of Defense</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-0752-10-0744-I-1, Remand Order (Feb. 7, 2012). On remand, the agency submitted an agreement settling another of the appellant's Board appeals. The settlement agreement included a general release covering "all other pending, existing, potential or putative causes of action" that the appellant had brought against the agency before it went into effect. The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction as moot. The appellant filed a timely petition for review. The agency did not respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reiterates his allegations from below that the settlement agreement did not bind the agency and that the agency failed to comply with its terms. He states that he is "appealing [his] case for noncompliance of the agency." Although the administrative judge dismissed this appeal as moot, it is more appropriately dismissed as settled under the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Swidecki v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110 (2006).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, the agency submitted a settlement agreement that the parties reached during grievance proceedings. The agency argued that the agreement settled two Board appeals, including the one on review. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 6. The Board set forth the factors to be considered and documented before an appeal could be dismissed as settled under a settlement agreement reached in another proceeding: the parties 1) reached a settlement agreement in which the appellant voluntarily waived his Board appeal rights, 2) understood the terms of the agreement, and 3) agreed whether or not it was to be enforceable by the Board. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (citing <span class="Italic">Mahoney v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 146, 149 (1988)); <span class="Italic">see also Cason v. Department of the Army</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 7 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as in <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, the appellant did not dispute that the parties reached a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 8. When the administrative judge in <span class="Italic">Capil II</span> entered the agreement into the record for enforcement, he found that the parties understood and freely accepted the terms of the agreement. The administrative judge here likewise affirmed that the appellant understood and accepted the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In evaluating these factors, the Board considered whether the appellant had adequately waived his Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-15. An appellant's waiver of Board appeal rights in a settlement agreement is enforceable "if the terms of the waiver are comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and the execution of the waiver was not a result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 17 (quoting <span class="Italic">Clede v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 279, 282-83 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F.3d 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agreement states that the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[u]nconditionally releases the Agency and its present and former employees, officers, agents, representatives, and all persons acting by, through, or in concert with any of those individuals, either in their official or individual capacities, for any and all liability which has arisen from the occurrences which are the subject matter of Appellant's appeal, as set forth in Paragraph 2(a), AND <span class="Italic">all other pending, existing, potential or putative causes of action, including any and all appeals of previous decisions and orders which Appellant has brought against the Agency of any sort whatsoever arising before the date this Agreement becomes effective</span>[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this release is somewhat less expansive than the one in <span class="Italic">Swidecki, compare id., with Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, it is sufficiently comprehensive. The italicized clause above clearly references any claims and appeals that the appellant had asserted before the effective date of the agreement. As the instant appeal pre-dates the <span class="Italic">Capil II</span> settlement, which went into effect on July 19, 2011, the release covers it. The term "any and all" used in a waiver statement includes all matters "not expressly preserve[d]" in a settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (quoting <span class="Italic">Laity v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 256, 261 (1994)). The settlement agreement preserves only the appellant's pending claims with the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for whether the waiver is fair, the appellant's release of his existing claims was supported by sufficient consideration. <span class="Italic">See Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R.110, &#x00B6; 23. Consideration included rescinding the agency's removal action, providing a neutral reference, promoting the appellant retroactively with 3 years' back pay, converting designated sick leave to administrative leave (effectively increasing the amount of time the appellant had in service), and paying him a lump sum of $75,000.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for whether the waiver was freely made and its execution was not the result of duress or bad faith, the appellant has not alleged otherwise. Additionally, he had the benefit of legal representation when he signed the settlement agreement. Such representation is "quite significant" in determining the validity of an appeal-rights waiver. <span class="Italic">Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 18 (citing <span class="Italic">Clede</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. at 285). Accordingly, we find the release in the <span class="Italic">Capil II</span> Settlement Agreement to be an enforceable waiver of the appellant's Board appeal rights and, further, that the appellant understood the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having examined all the relevant factors, <span class="Italic">see Swidecki</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 110, &#x00B6; 7, we DISMISS this appeal as settled under the <span class="Italic">Capil II</span> Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 683 Fed. Appx. 940, 941 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP) ("To set aside a settlement agreement Ms. McDell must establish that the agreement 'is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake.' <span class="Italic">Sargent v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 229 F.3d 1088, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2000). <span id="Page_4800"></span>However '[a] bare allegation of coercion is not sufficient to set aside the parties' settlement agreement.' <span class="Italic">Tiburzi v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 269 F.3d 1346, 1355 (Fed. Cir. 2001).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">One factor, and not a controlling factor, suggesting lack of voluntariness of a settlement is the attempt by the appellant to withdraw from or rescind the agreement quickly after it was entered. <span class="Italic">McLane v. Dept. of Interior,</span> DC-0752-11-0723-I-1 (NP 4/25/2012), declined to set aside an oral settlement based on the expectation of the appellant that there would be a subsequent written agreement. The appellant's attempts to challenge the agreement were too ambiguous to suggest that she communicated her intent to withdraw from the agreement, but the timing of the challenge was significant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Immediate action challenging a settlement can provide evidence that the settlement was invalid. <span class="Italic">See generally Futrell-Rawls v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 322, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). However, <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls</span> involved provisions that were added to the subsequent written iteration of the oral settlement agreement that the parties in that case purportedly agreed to at their close of record conference. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As such, it is distinguishable from the instant matter in which the appellant argues the opposite, i.e., that negotiated items were missing from the parties' agreement. The appellant's action was also more equivocal than that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Futrell-Rawls. Id.,</span> &#x00B6; 10 n.3. Notably, the appellant here concedes that the administrative judge's staff told her that she needed to call with agency counsel (in order to avoid <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> issues), and agency counsel has represented that she was available for such a conference call, but the appellant never followed up. The appellant also failed to immediately file any motions or other statements challenging the settlement. Moreover, there was no obvious basis for the administrative judge to doubt that a valid settlement had been made. <span class="Italic">Compare Futrell-Rawls,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 322, and <span class="Italic">McCarter,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 599, with <span class="Italic">Parks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 113 M.S.P.R. 60 (2010). The appellant's later calls came after the initial decision issued, but, at that point, her recourse was to the Board. Thus, we find that the appellant fails to establish a basis for invalidating the parties' settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">See Ziegler v. Dept. of Interior, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("Ziegler lastly appears to assert that he executed the Settlement Agreement under duress, was not permitted to participate in the drafting of the Settlement Agreement, and did not fully understand what he was signing. However, as previously discussed, Ziegler acknowledged that he was provided with time to review and consider the agreement and time to consult with counsel prior to signing. Furthermore, Ziegler acknowledged that he voluntarily, and without coercion or duress, agreed to the terms. Thus, we find the Settlement Agreement valid and enforceable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Represented status is another, not controlling, factor concerning the voluntariness of settlements, <span class="italic">Brown v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-17-0611-I-1 (NP 1/23/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was represented by a union representative during settlement negotiations, and both the appellant and his representative signed the settlement agreement. Such representation is significant in determining the validity of an appeal-rights waiver. <span class="Italic">Clede v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 279, 285 (1996), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 113 F.3d 1257 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table). The agreement specifically provided that the appellant and the agency entered into it voluntarily, without coercion or duress. The appellant has provided no arguments that he was mentally impaired when the agreement was reached, or that he entered into the agreement under duress or coercion.</p>
