<p class="noindent">Although negotiation regarding hours of work may be impermissible, negotiations are allowed for impact bargaining. Most proposals concerning shifts involve adjustment of hours of work. Nothing precluded, as an exercise in impact bargaining, a proposal for a trial period for a new shift to allow employees to assess the impact of the change on their commuting time. The trial period was to be followed by a period of return to the old shift pattern until the parties completed their negotiations concerning the impact of the new shift. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv.</span>, 37 FLRA 392, 400-02 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">A nonnegotiable proposal locked in established schedules for tours of duty and precluded the agency from changing tours of duty for any reason. It was contrary to government-wide regulations at 5 CFR 610.121 (2022). <span class="Italic">AFGE Meat Grading Council of Locals and USDA, Meat Grading and Certification Branch</span>, 22 FLRA 496, 497 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Hawaii FEMTC and DOD, Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard</span>, 57 FLRA 450, 452 (2001) (proposal restricting agency authority to change work schedules is nonnegotiable if it does not contain exceptions for situations determined by agency, pursuant to 5 CFR 610.121(a), that would seriously handicap agency in carrying out its functions or that would substantially increase its costs); <span class="Italic">FOP Lodge 1F and VAMC Providence, R.I.</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 384-85 (2001) (Proposal 10(b) (proposal was not appropriate arrangement that precluded agency from changing employees' shifts to provide training to them); <span class="Italic">FOP Lodge 1F and VAMC Providence, R.I.</span>, 57 FLRA 373, 378 (2001) (Proposal 3) (proposal was nonnegotiable that precluded agency from changing shifts without notice to union and negotiation; &#x00A7; 610.121(a) permits agency to change work schedules without limitation if agency head determines the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out functions or costs would be substantially increased).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 33 FLRA 532, 542-43 (1988), the Battery Shop case, revised preexisting law:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_616"></span>This case presents an opportunity to clarify the bargaining obligations with respect to changes in employees' hours of work. On our review of this area, we find that the distinctions previously used are not supported by the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, an employee's daily tour of duty consists of the hours that the employee works; that is, from the time when the employee starts work until he or she ends work. A decision as to what will constitute an employee's tour of duty is a decision by management as to when and where an employee's services can best be used. When an agency changes an employee's hours, that change, under applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, results in a new tour of duty for the employee. The degree of the change--whether it is a 1-hour change or an 8-hour change--does not alter the fact that the change results in a new tour of duty for the employee. A change in employees' starting and quitting times is a change in their tours of duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Changes in employees' tours of duty affect the "numbers, types, and grades of employees...assigned to...[a] tour of duty" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. For example, when an agency changes 10 employees' tours of duty by moving the employees from a day shift to a night shift, that change affects the numbers of employees assigned to both tours of duty--it decreases by 10 the number of employees assigned to the day tour of duty and increases by 10 the number of employees assigned to the night tour of duty. Therefore, an agency's decision to make these types of changes is negotiable only at its election under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. To the extent that previous decisions of the Authority are to the contrary, they will no longer be followed.[*]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] In some instances, bargaining over flexible work schedules has been specifically authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">See, for example, American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1934 and Department of the Air Force, 3415 ABG, Lowry AFB, Colorado</span>, 23 FLRA 872 (1986). Those instances are not affected by our decision in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed above, agencies must generally give appropriate notice to employees of changes in their tours of duty. Further, the fact that an agency's decision to change employees' tours of duty is negotiable only at the agency's election should not be viewed as encouraging agencies not to bargain over these changes. Moreover, even where an agency exercises its right under section 7106(b)(1) not to bargain over the change itself, an agency has an obligation to bargain over the matters set forth in section 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute: procedures to be observed by management in exercising its authority and appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Scott AFB,</span> resolving that an agency's decision to change employees' tours of duty is negotiable only at the agency's election, the decision of an agency to change the starting and quitting times of previously established shifts was subject to the duty to bargain, unless it could be shown that the change was determinative of the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and PASS</span>, 19 FLRA 732, 735-36 (1985). Without a showing that the starting and quitting times of a shift or tour of duty were integrally related to staffing, proposals were negotiable. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region VIII and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 606, 615-16 (1982) (ALJ Decision). There were some other limitations on the negotiability of proposals concerning the timing of existing shifts. There was no obligation to bargain over the hours that a commissary store would be open for customers, even though there were some changes in employees' hours. Management has the right to determine the hours in a day when its work will be performed. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Lowry AFB and AFGE Local 1974</span>, 16 FLRA 1104, 1105-06 (1984). A change in starting and quitting times, necessitated by a change in the employer's desired practice regarding lunch hours, was negotiable. The change did not establish an added shift or tour, but only changed the existing tour. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. Region IX, Chicago and NTEU</span>, 17 FLRA 221, 223 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA summarized the law as it stood before <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 32 FLRA 277, 279 (1988):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We will find a decision to change the starting and quitting times of bargaining unit employees to be negotiable unless the Agency demonstrates that the change is an exercise of management's right to determine (1) the numbers, types or grades of employees or positions assigned to a work project or tour of duty under section 7106(b)(1); or (2) the agency's mission under section 7106(a)(1). In deciding whether a particular change in starting and quitting times involves the exercise of management rights, we carefully consider and balance the facts and circumstances set forth in the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration West Los Angeles Medical Center, Los Angeles, California</span>, 23 FLRA 278, 281, 299 (1986) (agency obligated to bargain concerning decision to change by 1 hour the starting and quitting times for housekeepers' existing duty hours and ordering a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy), and <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Washington, D.C. and Veterans Administration Medical Center and Regional Office, Sioux Falls, South Dakota</span>, 23 FLRA 122, 125, 132-33 (1986) (agency had duty to bargain when changing starting and quitting times of laundry employee's existing tour of duty as such a change did not establish a new shift since employee's job duties did not change and he continued working with same employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These cases are distinguished from those in which starting and ending times are shown to interfere with the agency's right to determine its mission of, for example, providing services to the public, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3231 and Social Security Administration</span>, 22 FLRA 868, 869-70 (1986) (Proposal 1), or providing instructional services to students, <span class="Italic">Fort Bragg Association of Educators and Department of the Army, Fort Bragg Schools</span>, 30 FLRA 508, 516-17 (1987) (Proposal 8).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal concerning a minor adjustment in the starting and quitting times of employees was within the area of mandatory negotiation. FLRA rejected management's defense that the proposal was only permissively negotiable because it related to the assignment of employees to "tours of duty" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). That phrase had a broader meaning that encompassed a proposal affecting "by its direct or integral relationship...the numbers, types, or grades of employees or positions assigned to a tour of duty...determinative of such numbers, types, or grades." Because it was not demonstrated that the proposal, if implemented, affected positions or personnel so as to determine the numbers, types, or grades of employees or positions assigned to a tour of duty, the proposal concerned a negotiable "modicum of flexibility" within the range of starting and quitting times for the existing tour of duty. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 66 and IRS, Kansas City Serv. Ctr.</span>, 1 FLRA 927, 928-30 (1979). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VA Connecticut Healthcare Sys.</span>, 56 FLRA 1043, 1045 (2001) (Proposal 1, requiring maintenance of original schedule, representing 30 minute change from tour of duty established by agency, was negotiable at election of the agency).</p>
<p class="noindent">A change in the starting and quitting time of an individual employee was bargainable as long as a new shift was not established. <span class="Italic">VA and AFGE Local 1509</span>, 23 FLRA 122, 132-33 (1986) (ALJ Decision). But a proposal that permitted specific employees to have starting times significantly later than other employees was nonnegotiable. It essentially required a separate tour of duty rather than an adjustment of starting times for employees within a single tour of duty. The proposal violated the right of management to assign employees to a tour of duty. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1461 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Observatory</span>, 16 FLRA 995, 996-97 (1984). It was nonnegotiable to propose that an alternative work schedule be established for an individual employee to enable that individual to pursue some outside activity. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement, for it abrogated management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-109 and VAMC, Newington</span>, 26 FLRA 532, 534-35 (1987). Following the same reasoning, a proposal was nonnegotiable that required management to continue the schedules of employees who were reassigned; the proposal had the effect of blocking the agency from determining when the employees' work would be performed. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 85 and VAMC, Leavenworth</span>, 32 FLRA 210, 215-16 (1988). [This is not to be confused with flextime proposals, discussed in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-14-029.html#sec6-30">Alternative Work Schedules: Flextime and Compressed Work Schedules</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiable was a proposal that the principal day-shift hours be from 7:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 4:00 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> with a half-hour uninterrupted lunch period. There was no showing that the provision established a new shift or changed the hours of an existing shift. The proposal only described the hours of the existing principal shift and did not prevent management from changing those hours consistent with the rights of the union. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Prisons Locals, Local 171 and DOJ, Fed. Prison Sys., FCI El Reno</span>, 23 FLRA 224, 227 (1986). The decision to change the starting and quitting times of the previously existing first shift was a subject of bargaining. It concerned conditions of employment and evidence did not show that the change was determinative of the numbers, types, or grades of employees or positions assigned to a work project or tour of duty. FLRA directed that the agency restore the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> as to the times of the preexisting shift, pending bargaining over the decision to change that shift. However, FLRA decided that it would be inappropriate to require a remedy as to the creation of the new shift, noting that management was within its rights to do so without bargaining as to the decision. <span class="Italic">Customs Serv., Region V, New Orleans and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 116, 118 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>an exception to the general negotiability of shift changes involved management's right to determine internal security. A proposal to maintain, rather than change, shift rotation policies for cook foremen at correctional institutions was nonnegotiable, because their work entailed responsibilities for supervision and control of inmates and involved internal security, making the proposal nonnegotiable as a procedure and, due to the special security concerns of a penitentiary, nonnegotiable as an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 683 and DOJ, FCI Sandstone</span>, 30 FLRA 497, 499-501 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">Creation or abolition of shifts was nonnegotiable. An example of a proposal affecting the numbers of employees assigned to a shift was a proposal regarding a change in the timing of shifts. The proposal required a certain number of employees at work when the agency determined that no employees or fewer employees were needed. The proposal was nonnegotiable: it determined <span id="page_617"></span>number, types, and grades of employees assigned to a tour of duty, a matter negotiable at management's election under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1). <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 21 FLRA 667, 669 (1986). The decision to establish (as opposed to change) a second shift or tour of duty involved the "numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to any organizational subdivision, work project, or tour of duty" and was negotiable only at the election of the agency. Only impact bargaining was required for the decision to begin a second shift. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1461 and Dept. of Navy, Naval Observatory</span>, 16 FLRA 995, 996-97 (1984). The <span class="Italic">Naval Observatory</span> analysis was restated with greater clarity in <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1945 and Dept. of Interior, BLM</span>, 25 FLRA 675, 677-78 (1987), involving a proposal to retain a second shift rather than merge two shifts into one:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]his proposal involves the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to a tour of duty within the meaning of section 7106(b)(1). Specifically, this proposal is to the same effect as the proposal found nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees Local 1461 and Department of the Navy, U.S. Naval Observatory</span>, 16 FLRA 995 (1984). The agency in that case also sought to replace a two shift operation with one shift while the union proposed retaining the two shift schedule. The Authority determined that the union's proposal directly related to the numbers, types, and grades assigned to a tour of duty...because the proposal specifically identified the number of employees who would remain on the second shift. Further, the Authority distinguished this determination from its holding in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 66 and Internal Revenue Service, Kansas City Service Center</span>, 1 FLRA 927, 928-9 (1978), where a proposal requiring management to maintain existing starting times of shifts was found to be negotiable. The Authority stated that the proposal in <span class="Italic">Kansas City Service Center</span> contemplated only "a relatively minor adjustment" (30 minutes) to the starting times of employees already assigned to an existing tour of duty and did not explicitly relate to the matters enumerated in section 7106(b)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, FLRA examined the effect of proposals regarding shifts. If changes, in effect, constituted abolition of a prior tour of duty and establishment of a new tour of duty more closely aligned with the tour of duty worked by other employees, the decision was not negotiable, except at the election of the agency. It was directly related to the numbers, types, and grades of employees assigned to a tour of duty. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 20 FLRA 857, 858-59 (1985). The difference between a change of a shift and creation of new shift could be discerned if there was a major revision of the tours of duty so that it could not be said when one tour only had an adjustment of hours; for example, if eight shifts were substituted for an earlier practice of four shifts. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council, Local 2455</span>, 23 FLRA 90, 93-94 (1986). But under some circumstances even the establishment of a new tour of duty was negotiable. The agency's establishment of additional tours of duty was negotiable if the number of employees assigned to the tour of duty, their types and grades, and the number of positions remained the same before and after the new tours were established. The changes made by the agency were to be negotiated with the union at the union's request and not at the election of the agency. <span class="Italic">AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 5 FLRA 542, 546 (1981) (on exceptions to arbitration award).</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal permitted swing shift employees to use an hour of annual leave or work an added hour at the time of conversion to daylight savings time, so as to maintain their regular eight-hour shift. The proposal did not interfere with the right to assign work; the work had already been assigned. The proposal did not interfere with the right of the agency to grant annual leave when mission needs dictated otherwise. The proposal, although it might require five added employees on a shift once a year, did not interfere with the right of the agency to determine the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions. The proposal did not explicitly relate to those matters. FLRA determined that the record did not indicate that the yearly adjustment would establish a new shift or tour of duty or effect changes in the numbers, types, and grades of employees or positions assigned to shifts. Instead, minor changes in starting and quitting times of previously established shifts were a matter subject to the duty to bargain. <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Navy Pub. Works Ctr.</span>, 21 FLRA 497, 499 (1986). But the decision was reversed by the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy v. FLRA</span>, 814 F.2d 982, 984-85 (4th Cir. 1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union proposal in this case attempts to provide an alternative to the current practice of requiring employees to use annual leave time to make up the hour of pay lost during the daylight savings time conversion.&#x2003;While some proposals addressing this problem might be negotiable, the form of this particular proposal--affording employees the option of working an extra hour--contravenes management's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The optional eighth hour proposed by the union is actually the first hour of the next shift, and the agency assigned the work to be performed during that hour to the employees on that shift. The union proposal allowing the five employees the option of working an eighth hour would thus force the agency to alter its work assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority and the union contend that there is often enough work during the hour of overlap for both shifts to perform.&#x2003;They argue that the agency failed to show a lack of work for the five employees during the optional hour. Such a showing, however, is not necessary under the statute. The proposal would require the agency to provide an additional hour's worth of work every year. The agency might be required to create make-work and assign it to the five employees during the extra hour. It might be forced to reassign some of the next shift's work to employees of the previous shift. In any case, the proposal interferes with the agency's right under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) to assign work as it sees fit. Contrary to the Authority's holding, the proposal is non-negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal does not explicitly mention the numbers, types, or grades of employees, but it requires two shifts to overlap for one hour. The agency has determined that only five employees are needed to perform the work to be done during that hour. Because the union's proposal requires ten employees to be present when only five are deemed necessary, it substantially interferes with the agency's right under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(1) to determine the number of persons assigned to do the work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The court may ask only whether [the Authority's] decision is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We may not, however, blind ourselves to administrative decisions that frustrate congressional intent. <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89 (1983).... Here, the proposal which the Authority found negotiable may require agencies to assign work already performed, to devise make-work, or to assign no work at all. While petitioner attacks that proposal as legalizing, for the first time, "featherbedding in the federal service," such an accusation is beside the point. Suffice it to say that the proposal has everything to do with the assignment of work, and that is something which Congress left to management.</p>
<p class="noindent">Although a proposal was not negotiable that effectively sought to nullify (through negotiation) a management decision to establish a new tour of duty, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 153 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 21 FLRA 1116, 1118 (1986), a proposal was negotiable that once an employee was assigned to a shift, that shift assignment would not be changed as long as the composition and responsibilities of their shift remained unchanged. The proposal only addressed the location and times that employees would perform the previously assigned duties of their positions. <span class="Italic">Laborers' Int'l Union Local 1267 and DLA, Defense Depot Tracy</span>, 14 FLRA 686, 695 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal called on the agency to agree that employees would not have more than two different tours of duty within a period of seven consecutive days beginning with Sunday, with exceptions to accommodate patient needs. By protecting the right to assign work, the proposal did not directly interfere with management rights. <span class="Italic">Colorado Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, Ft. Lyons, Colo.,</span> 25 FLRA 803, 818 (1987) (Proposal 3); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE, Council of VA Locals and VA</span>, 31 FLRA 360, 370-437 (1988) (series of proposals concerning shift changes and leave arrangements for VA medical staff); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Union of Hosp. and Health Care Employees, Dist. 1199 and VAMC, Dayton</span>, 28 FLRA 435, 465 (1987); <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N.
