<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-208"><span class="space">a.</span> Classification</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Aside from actions resulting through reduction in force, discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>, classification appeals, i.e., appeals involving the appropriate pay or grade and civil service classification for a position, are resolved by employing agencies through their own regulations and by OPM through its regulations at 5 CFR Part 511. <span class="Italic">See Caporale v. NASA</span>, 4 MSPR 161, 162 (1980). The OPM classification appeal process, as it was applied to its predecessor, the Civil Service Commission, was briefly described in <span class="Italic">Kavazanjian v. INS</span>, 399 F. Supp. 339, 342, 346-47 (S.D.N.Y. 1975):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSC has the responsibility to oversee the classification of all government employees subject to such classification. It is given authority to ascertain the facts concerning government positions, to decide whether they are in their appropriate grade and class, and to change a position from one grade or class to another when the facts warrant. 5 USC 5112(a) (1, 3 &#x0026; 4). Upon request of an affected employee, the CSC must exercise its authority. 5 USC 5112(b). The process by which an employee requests the CSC to consider the propriety of his position's grade has been referred to by the parties as a classification appeal. This "appeal" is not, however, an appeal from any specific decision of the agency not to reclassify a job, and an employee need not petition his or her own agency for reclassification before invoking CSC review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute, 5 USC 6112, requires that the CSC ascertain currently the facts, decide whether the position in question is in its appropriate class and grade, and change the class or grade when the facts warrant. There is no requirement that an adversary hearing be held; nor is there a requirement that any particular type of audit take place or that appellants be interviewed for a given length of time. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> 5 CFR 511.607. The CSC has latitude as to the manner in which it will perform its statutory function....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory remedy for employees who believe that they are doing<span id="Page_330"></span> work that entitles them to reclassification of their positions is the process--appeals to the CSC pursuant to 5 USC 5112--described above. The CSC may reclassify a position, but there is no provision for retroactive reclassification and award of back pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has no authority to entertain a classification appeal. <span class="Italic">McGuire v. VA</span>, 76 MSPR 259, 261 (1997) (rule applied to an application for a law enforcement retirement credit); <span class="Italic">Gust v. OPM</span>, 43 MSPR 31, 33 (1989) (appellant disputed the proper grade level of his job: "the Board lacks jurisdiction over classification matters"); <span class="Italic">Carty v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 31 MSPR 24, 25 n.* (1986) (""The Board does not have appellate jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position, either by statute or regulation."); <span class="Italic">Alford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 31 MSPR 20, 21 n.* (1986) (same holding as <span class="Italic">Carty</span>); <span class="Italic">Lund v. Dept. of State</span>, 1 MSPR 484, 485, 1 MSPB 468 (1980) ("the Board has no authority to entertain a classification appeal"); <span class="Italic">cf. Peele v. DHHS</span>, 6 MSPR 296, 299, 6 MSPB 253 (1981) (no appeal from pay or grade reduction followed a reassignment from a classified GS-17 position to an unclassified position). <span class="Italic">But see Crum v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 75, 83 (1997) ("It thus appears from the record that the appellants' demotions resulting from the reclassifications may be appealable, either (1) because the reclassifications were due to erosion of duties, they were effected after the agency formally announced a RIF in the appellants' competitive area, and the RIF took effect within 180 days, or (2) because the reclassifications were not due to erosion of duties but, instead, due to one or more reorganization(s). Because the present record is inadequate to resolve these jurisdictional issues, and because the appellants have not been afforded a specific opportunity below to address them, the case must be remanded for further development of the record."). If there is a possibility that the agency downgraded the appellant and did not simply correct a classification error, the Board grants the employee a jurisdictional hearing, assuming the Board has personal jurisdiction over the employee. <span class="Italic">See Trotter v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Guertin v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20211209110">___Fed. Appx.___</a> (Fed. Cir. 2021 NP), noted the lack of Board jurisdiction over a disputed classification:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the decision of the Board explained, the Classification Act of 1949 provides that civilian job positions would be "grouped and identified by classes and grades" based on duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101(2). Under the Classification Act, OPM is charged with preparing and maintaining "standards for placing positions in their proper classes and grades." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5105(a)-(b), 5106(a)-(b). Executive agencies implement the standards, placing positions in the appropriate class and grade. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5107. Appeals to classification decisions must be made to OPM, and "[a]n appellate decision made by [OPM] is final unless reconsidered by [OPM]." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.612; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 511.603 (providing the circumstances in which an employee has a right to appeal and to whom). Given the relevant statutes, regulations, and the holding in <span class="Italic">Saunders</span>, the Board held that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Guertin's appeal because it turned on his view that the 2011 Classification Decision by OPM was unlawful.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if a classification matter is not within the province of OPM, because of a statutory exclusion of employees from Title 5 procedures, the Board does not secure jurisdiction over the reclassification, <span class="Italic">Quinlan v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 362, 367-68 &#x00B6; 9, 2012 MSPB 91 (2012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crux of the appellants' arguments on review is that the Board has the jurisdiction to review the merits of the classification decision and that the administrative judge erred in only determining whether the agency's actions were in accordance with law. The appellants argue that, because they are not covered by title 5 and are precluded from appealing the classification decision to the Office of Personnel Management, the Board must adjudicate the merits of the classification decision. It is well established, however, that the Board does not have jurisdiction over the merits of a classification decision. <span class="Italic">See Pierce v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 242 F.3d 1373, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2001); <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Gibson,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. at 277. That the appellants do not have a method for appealing the reclassification of their positions does not grant the Board jurisdiction over the merits of the classification decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Broderick v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 254, 260-61 (1992) (rejecting the appellant's jurisdictional argument that she would have no recourse if she is denied review by the Board because the Board "may not assert jurisdiction that it does not have"); <span class="Italic">Lomartere v. Department of Defense,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 30, 32-33 (1980) (finding proper the presiding officials' limited review of whether the agency showed that its actions were in accordance with its statutory authority); <span class="Italic">see also Wilson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 807 F.2d 1577, 1581-83 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (declining to apply the classification principles in chapter 51 to a Postal Service employee). The Board has held that, in cases in which an employee suffered a reduction in grade due to a downward reclassification decision, the Board's review of the agency's action is limited to whether the agency's action in effecting the reduction in grade was in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Bobie,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10; <span class="Italic">Gibson,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. at 277. Thus, we find that the administrative judge correctly examined the agency's adherence to its internal management directives to determine that the agency's actions were in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n); <span class="Italic">Winlock,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 521, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What amounts to a classification dispute does not fall within the Board's jurisdiction based on allegations that favorable resolution of the dispute would favorably impact an employee's retirement earnings or workers compensation benefits, <span class="Italic">Kershner v. Dept. of Interior,</span> PH-3443-12-0326-I-1 (NP 3/29/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's argument that the agency should have hired her at the GS-05 grade level based on her job duties, education, and experience can also be characterized as an argument that the agency misclassified her GS-04 Social Services Aid position. Classification appeals involve the appropriate pay or grade and civil service classification for a position. <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). These types of claims are resolved by employing agencies through their own regulations and by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) through its regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has no jurisdiction to review directly the classification of a position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also Santos v. Department of Transportation</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 579, 580-81 (1991) (the Board does not have jurisdiction over a claim that an appellant was denied the opportunity to receive pay commensurate with the difficulty of his work). To the extent that the appellant contends that her position was misclassified, her argument presents no reason to disturb the initial decision dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also has no jurisdiction to review the appellant's claim that the agency's decision to hire her at the GS-04 grade level potentially affects her retirement. The Board has jurisdiction to adjudicate an individual's rights and interests under the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) or Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) only after OPM has rendered a final or reconsideration decision on the issue in question. <span class="Italic">Tatum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6; 7 (1999) (CSRS); <span class="Italic">see Fletcher v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 632, &#x00B6; 7 (2012) (the Board's statutory authority extends only to OPM actions or orders that adversely affect an individual's rights or interests under FERS). The appellant alleged that she was appealing actions taken by her agency, not OPM; and she stated that she did not receive a final or reconsideration decision from OPM. Because the appellant did not allege that OPM took an action or made a decision that adversely affected her rights or interests under FERS or CSRS, the Board lacks jurisdiction to review her potential retirement claim. Nonetheless, the appellant can file a new appeal with the Board after OPM issues a final decision or reconsideration decision affecting her retirement, if appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant also reasserts her argument that the agency's classification error affected the amount of Workers' Compensation she receives. The Board does not have jurisdiction over this claim because determinations regarding the entitlement to Workers' Compensation benefits lie within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP). <span class="Italic">See Miller v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 210, 213 (1985) (while the issue of an appellant's entitlement to benefits under the Federal Employee Compensation Act is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OWCP, the issue of the appellant's fraudulent conduct in those proceedings is not). Accordingly, we find no reason to disturb the initial decision dismissing this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Waters v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3291), found unavailing appellant's <span id="Page_331"></span>contention that an equal pay claim, deemed to involve a classification issue, could be entertained by the Board because the wage disparity violated a merit system principle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his appeal, Mr. Waters sues for back pay, alleging that a female employee in his agency was paid at a higher rate of pay than he received, although he was performing substantially similar work under similar working conditions, which required equal skill, effort, and responsibility. He based his right to recover on 5 USC 2301(b)(2) and (3). Mr. Waters asserts that he was harmed because he had sustained a loss by not being permitted to apply for higher level positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board treated Mr. Waters' appeal as a classification dispute, and pursuant to the well established rule that the MSPB has no jurisdiction over cases concerning the proper classification of a position, the Board dismissed his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Saunders v. MSPB</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Because it had determined that Mr. Waters did not have an otherwise appealable matter, the Board held that it did not have jurisdiction to review his discrimination claim. <span class="Italic">Wren v. MSPB</span>, 681 F.2d 867 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his brief to the court, Mr. Waters asserts that in his appeal to the Board he did not allege that his position was improperly classified nor did he allege discrimination on the basis of sex under the 5 USC 2301. Having made these disclaimers, Mr. Waters bases his right to recover entirely on 5 USC 2301, and particularly on subsection b(2), which provides that all employees and applicants for employment shall receive fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel matters, and subsection b(3), which states that equal pay shall be provided for work of equal value.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its reply, the government quotes statements made by Mr. Waters in his appeal to the Board and argues that he has erroneously attempted to characterize the issue in this case as one of equal pay rather than classification. We need not resolve this dispute; we agree with the government's alternative argument that alleged violations of the merit systems principles set forth in 5 USC 2301 cannot create an individual cause of action or an independent basis for the jurisdiction of the Board. This court so held in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. GSA</span>, 917 F.2d 1297, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, we cited <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury v. FLRA</span>, 837 F.2d 1163, 1167 (D.C. Cir. 1988). In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury</span>, the D.C. Circuit noted that section 2301(b) states that "federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with the system principles" set forth in the statute. The D.C. Circuit also observed that section 2301(c) provides that the President shall take any action, "including the issuance of rules, regulations, or directives that he deems necessary to insure that personnel management is based on and embodies the merit systems principle." The court then concluded that the statute seems to contemplate that regulations issued pursuant to section 2301, "rather than the vague principles it contains, would form the operative basis for claims arising under that section."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellate jurisdiction of the Board is limited to the matters specifically conferred on it by statute or regulation. 5 USC 7701(a) (1982). The Board's appellate jurisdiction is set forth in 5 CFR 1201.3 (1996). There is nothing in that regulation which gives the Board jurisdiction over claims based on alleged violations of 5 USC 2301. Mr. Waters has not cited any other regulation nor have we found one which supports his position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board lacks jurisdiction over a claim that an employee is owed back pay involving classification of his position. <span class="Italic">Bradford v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 598, 600, 3 MSPB 115 (1980). However, when downgradings are appealable and involve classification problems, the Board will examine the action to ensure that the classification actions comply with statutory requirements. <span class="Italic">Pierce v. DOD</span>, 4 MSPR 257, 258, 4 MSPB 331 (1980) (Secretary of Defense acting under 20 USC 901(a) and 902(a) to reclassify teaching positions in Dependents Schools). If an individual who is reclassified for personal cause does not receive grade and pay retention rights, he has an adverse action appeal to MSPB from a grade reduction and a classification appeal to OPM. <span class="Italic">See Lane v. USDA</span>, 4 MSPR 379, 382 (1980). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-265.html#sec1-260">Grade and Pay Retention</a>," and refer to Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-130.html#sec16-128">Enforcement of MSPB Decision</a>," for compliance issues arising from disputes over pay and job assignments following cancelation of an unwarranted personnel action.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Crum v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 75 MSPR 75, 82 (1997), described jurisdictional limitations of Board authority over classification issues:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board may have jurisdiction over the demotions resulting from the reclassifications, as discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A demotion resulting from a reclassification, which entitles an employee to limited retained grade and pay under 5 USC ch. 53, is not appealable as an adverse action under 5 USC ch. 75. <span class="Italic">See Broderick v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 254, 258 (1992); 5 CFR 752.401(b)(8). Moreover, in general, a demotion resulting from a reclassification due to erosion of duties is not covered by the RIF regulations and is thus not appealable to the Board as a RIF action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2), 351.202(c)(3), 351.901. There is an exception to this general rule. The RIF regulations are applicable to a demotion resulting from a reclassification due to erosion of duties when the reclassification "will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days." 5 CFR 351.201(a)(2), 351.202(c)(3). Such a demotion is covered by the RIF regulations and is thus appealable as a RIF demotion. 5 CFR 351.901.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, if a reclassification was not due to an erosion of duties, as asserted by the agency here, but rather due to a reorganization, it would also be appealable as a RIF demotion. <span class="Italic">See Hardy v. Department of the Army</span>, 67 MSPR 292, 294 (1995). In <span class="Italic">Hardy</span>, the Board explained the difference between an erosion of duties and a reorganization, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Reclassification due to erosion [of duties] ...describes a situation where the grade of a position must be reduced because duties have gradually drifted away through an extended erosion process. In job erosion cases, an evaluation of the position shows no proximate cause or determinable time for the change in duties. This contrasts with a reclassification due to reorganization, where a <span class="Italic">planned</span> change in duties has occurred in which the cause of reclassification and time frame are clear, as for example, when, at an identifiable time, a statute or agency procedure changed or expired.</p>
