<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-293"><span class="space">g.</span> Reassignment; Shift Change; Assignment to New Supervisor</h5>
<p class="noindent">As a result of revision in its analysis of awards involving reassignments, FLRA enforces negotiated arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., New York and NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA 278, 283-84 (1991):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>), we reexamined our approach to cases in which an agency contends that an arbitrator's award, enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, is contrary to management's rights under section 7106(a). We held that when an agency makes such a contention we will examine, as appropriate, the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine: (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights; and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right. We explained that if it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute. Accordingly, we held that we will not find that such an award is contrary to law and we will deny the exception. We also held that if the arbitrator's interpretation does result in an abrogation of management's rights under section 7106(a), the award will be found deficient as contrary to law, but the contractual provision, susceptible to a different and sustainable interpretation by a different arbitrator, will not be affected. Finally, we noted that the arbitrator's interpretation must draw its essence from the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying that approach in this case, we conclude that the Agency fails to establish that the award is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. It is evident that Article 20 constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate management's right to assign its employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 20 provides that when reassignments are made for disciplinary reasons, the procedures in Article 28, Employee Conduct and Discipline, must be followed. It is clear that Article 20 constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its right to discipline employees. The Arbitrator found that this provision provided protection for employees who are reassigned for disciplinary reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, Article 20 does not abrogate management's rights. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Service</span>, we held that an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right....&#8197;Article 20, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, clearly does not abrogate the exercise of management's right to discipline employees. Management's right to reassign employees for disciplinary reasons where the required protection has been provided the employee remains unaffected. Moreover, management retains the right to assign and discipline employees consistent with the limitations of the contractual provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The abrogation standard (changed back to the excessive interference standard in 2018 (<a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018))), involving an award directing that a reassignment of a VA physician be canceled as a violation of provisions of a negotiated agreement, was applied in <span class="Italic">VAMC Kansas City and AFGE Local 910</span>, 65 FLRA 809, 813-14 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Agency's contention that the award violates its right to assign work, we note that the Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management-rights exceptions to arbitration awards. <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA</span>, 65 FLRA 113, 115 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">EPA</span>); <span class="Italic">FDIC, Div. of Supervision &#x0026; Consumer Prot., S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA 102, 106-07 (2010) (Chairman Pope concurring) (<span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>). Under the revised analysis, the Authority will first assess whether the award affects the exercise of the asserted management right. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 115. If so, then the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Also under the revised analysis, in determining whether the award enforces a contract provision negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses: (1) whether the contract provision constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right, and (2), if so, whether the arbitrator's enforcement of the arrangement abrogates the exercise of the management right. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 116-18. In concluding that it would apply an abrogation standard, the Authority rejected continued application of an excessive-interference standard. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 118. Furthermore, in setting forth its revised analysis, the Authority specifically rejected the continued application of the "reconstruction" requirement set forth in prior case law. <span class="Italic">FDIC, SF Region, </span>65 FLRA at 106-07.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, PTO</span>, 65 FLRA 13, 15 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting on other grounds). As the award requires the Agency to assign the duties of the head of the Nephrology Section to the grievant, we find that the award affects management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Detroit, Mich., </span>61 FLRA 371, 373 (2005) (<span class="Italic">VA Med. Ctr.</span>) (award returning grievant to previous position requires agency to assign certain duties to grievant and thus, affects management's right to assign work). We must therefore determine whether the Arbitrator enforced a contract provision negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that several provisions in the CBA are intended to limit the Agency's rights to assign and reassign work, and its right to discipline employees. The Arbitrator applied these provisions in finding that the Agency violated the CBA when it reassigned the grievant from <span id="page_2264"></span>his position as head of Nephrology to that of a staff Nephrologist. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated provisions of the CBA prohibiting reassignments from being used as punishment, harassment, or reprisal; provisions prohibiting reassignments from being used as discipline against employees without use of appropriate procedures; and provisions providing that discipline be applied "fairly and equitably" to employees. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 12-15 (citing CBA Articles 12, 13 and 16).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that contractual provisions limiting the use of employee reassignments for disciplinary purposes are enforceable &#x00A7; 7106(b) provisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., VA Med. Ctr.</span>, 61 FLRA at 372-74 (finding that contract provisions limiting the use of reassignments for disciplinary purposes were negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)). In this connection, the Authority has held that such contract provisions constitute arrangements within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., N.Y., N.Y.</span>, 39 FLRA 278, 283 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Treasury</span>) (contract provision setting forth limitations on reassignments found to be an arrangement); <span class="Italic">IRS, Austin Dist.</span>, 9 FLRA 672, 674 (1982) (contract provision providing that reassignments would not be used in lieu of discipline constituted arrangement). Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator's direction to the Agency to reinstate the grievant to the position from which he was improperly reassigned enforces an arrangement negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See EPA, </span>65 FLRA at 115.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we must determine whether the Arbitrator's award reinstating the grievant abrogates the Agency's right to assign work to employees. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 65 FLRA at 116-18. The Authority has previously described an award that abrogates the exercise of a management right as an award that "precludes an agency from exercising" that right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, N.C., </span>55 FLRA 163, 167 (1999) (quoting <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., </span>37 FLRA 309, 314 (1990)). The CBA provisions, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, do not prevent the Agency from assigning work to the grievant. By reinstating the grievant, the Arbitrator merely enforced the Agency's negotiated limitations on reassignments and discipline in the CBA as set forth above. Management still retains the right to assign work to employees within the limitations of the contractual provisions that it negotiated with the Union. Given these findings and that the Authority has concluded that similar CBA provisions constitute arrangements, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Treasury, </span>39 FLRA at 283-84, we find that the provisions are enforceable under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute and that Agency has not demonstrated that the award impermissibly affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). We therefore, deny the exception.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Given this determination, we need not address the Agency's claim that the Arbitrator failed to establish that the reassignment of the grievant violated any applicable law. Further, we find it unnecessary to address the Agency's argument that the award is deficient under <span class="Italic">BEP </span>because the Arbitrator failed to reconstruct what management would have done had it complied with the parties' agreement since the Authority no longer requires that an arbitrator's remedy reconstruct what management would have done had it not violated the contract provision. <span class="Italic">FDIC</span>, 65 FLRA 179, 181 (2010). In addition, for the reasons set forth in her concurring opinion in <span class="Italic">FDIC, S.F. Region</span>, 65 FLRA at 112, Chairman Pope agrees that the Agency provides no basis for finding the Arbitrator's remedy deficient because the remedy is reasonably related to the contract provisions at issue and the harm being remedied.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an award enforces a contract provision to mandate a reassignment on the basis of seniority, but the provision is not considered either a negotiable procedure or arrangement, the award may conflict with the right of the agency to make selections from any appropriate source. An award was set aside for that reason, <span class="Italic">NLRB and NLRB Union</span>, 54 FLRA 56, 62-64 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award conflicts with its right under section 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii) to make selections from any appropriate source. The Union maintains that the provision is enforceable, because Article 33, Section 7 of the parties' agreement results from the Agency's election to bargain under section 7106(b)(1) about the "method and means of assisting Agency employees in seeking broader opportunities in other Regional and/or Headquarters offices[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with Authority precedent, the Arbitrator's award directing the Agency to offer the grievant the "next available Agency vacancy for which he is qualified in the Washington area" affects the right of the Agency to select from any appropriate source. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pennsylvania National Guard and Association of Civilian Technicians and Pennsylvania National Guard and Association of Civilian Technicians, Pennsylvania State Council</span>, 35 FLRA 478, 486 (1990) (arbitrator's award requiring agency to select one of four original applicants for a job conflicted with section 7106(a)(2)(C)(ii)). In cases where an award affects management's rights under section 7106(a)(2), the Authority examines whether the award remedies a violation of "either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2), or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to the exceptions to section 7106(a) that are set forth in section 7106(b)." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 153 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no contention that the award remedies a violation of applicable law.&#x2003;Instead, it is clear that the award remedies the Agency's violation of Article 33, Section 7. As for whether Article 33, Section 7 was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b), the Union does not dispute the Agency's assertion that Article 33, Section 7 does not constitute either a procedure under section 7106(b)(2) or an appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3). In particular, the Union does not respond in any way to the Agency's contention that the provision does not constitute a procedure, and the Union expressly asserts that the <span class="Italic">Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>) analysis of the applicability of section 7106(b)(3) is not relevant to this case. As a result, the only issue remaining is whether, as the Union contends, Article 33, Section 7 results from the Agency's election to bargain over the methods and means of performing work under section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There are two prongs to the Authority's current test for determining whether a provision concerns the methods and means of performing work. First, the provision must concern a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. In this regard, the Authority construes "method" to refer to "the way in which an agency <span class="Italic">performs its work." International</span> <span class="Italic">Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 49</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Army, Army Corps of Engineers South Pacific Division, San Francisco, California</span>, 52 FLRA 813, 818 (1996) (emphasis added). The term "means" refers to "any instrumentality, including an agent, tool, device, measure, plan, or policy used by an agency for the accomplishment or furtherance of the performance of its work<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. Second, it must be shown that (1) there is a direct and integral relationship between the particular methods or means the agency has chosen and the accomplishment of the agency's mission; and (2) the provision would directly interfere with the mission-related purpose for which the method or means was adopted. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g., Association of Civilian Technicians</span>, <span class="Italic">Arizona Army Chapter 61 and U.S. Department of Defense</span>, <span class="Italic">National Guard Bureau, Arizona National Guard</span>, 48 FLRA 412, 420 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying Prong I, no basis is apparent for concluding that Article 33, Section 7, relates in any way to a "method" or "means" as defined by the Authority. That is, there is no basis for finding that Article 33, Section 7 relates to a method or means of <span class="Italic">performing work</span>. In this regard, the Union asserts only that the provision assists Agency employees "in seeking broader opportunities." Moreover, as plainly worded, Article 33, Section 7, provides only that Agency decisions to select employees from transfer registers shall not be based on arbitrary or unreasonable considerations. No connection has been established or is apparent between the provision, encompassing requirements governing decisions on transfer, and the way the Agency performs its work. Accordingly, the Union's assertion that the provision was negotiated under section 7106(b)(1) is not supported.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 53 FLRA 1344, 1347-50 (1998), declined to disturb an award that management was required by a contract provision to negotiate the impact of a reassignment with the union before moving the employee to another shop:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions to arbitration awards alleging that the award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C. and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201</span>, 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Under prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute.[4] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;An agency's authority to exercise the rights enumerated in section 7106(a) of the Statute is expressly made "subject to" section 7106(b) of the Statute, which states that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating" over matters set forth in section 7106(b). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152. To determine whether an award enforces a provision of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b)(3), the Authority applies the framework explained in <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury</span> <span class="Italic">Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs <span id="page_2265"></span>Service</span>). Under that framework, the Authority determines whether the collective bargaining provision enforced by the arbitrator: (1) constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, and (2) does not abrogate the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153 n.8; <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Medical Center, Birmingham, Alabama and</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2207</span>, 51 FLRA 270, 273-74 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency challenges the Arbitrator's remedy as contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. The Arbitrator directed the Agency to return the grievant to her original position to remedy the Agency's violation of Article 3, Section 3.03 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. That provision, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, requires negotiations over procedures and appropriate arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no contention that Article 3, Section 3.03 is unenforceable. Moreover, on its face, the provision appears to incorporate bargaining requirements set forth in section 7106(b)(2) and (3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the plain wording of Article 3, Section 3.03 indicates that it was intended to mitigate the adverse effects of an exercise of management's rights under the collective bargaining agreement, which parallels the Statute. As applied in this case, the Arbitrator specifically found that "the move of the grievant clearly had <span class="Italic">adverse</span> <span class="Italic">consequences for her."</span> Therefore, with regard to the first part of the <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span> test, Article 3, Section 3.03 constitutes an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. With respect to the second part of the <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> test, an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy, Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Philadelphia Metal</span> <span class="Italic">Trades Council</span>, 39 FLRA 590, 600 (1991) (citing <span class="Italic">Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314). In this case, the Arbitrator's award does not prevent the Agency from moving the grievant; the Arbitrator specifically held that the Agency "had the right...to move the grievant...[b]ut...[was] also obliged to conform" to Article 3, Section 3.03 of the parties' agreement "by fulfilling its obligation to the Union to negotiate" on procedures and appropriate arrangements. Therefore, Article 3, Section 3.03, as enforced by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate management's right to assign work under section 7106(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See Customs</span> <span class="Italic">Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, we conclude, based on both the plain wording of the provision and through application of <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, that Article 3, Section 3.03 was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. Accordingly, the award satisfies prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As for Prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, if the Agency had complied with Article 3, Section 3.03 of the collective bargaining agreement, the Agency would have negotiated over any procedures or appropriate arrangements before it moved the grievant. Because the Arbitrator's award merely returns the grievant to her original position and requires the Agency to comply with Article 3, Section 3.03 before moving her, the award is a reconstruction of what management would have done had it not violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. As such, the award satisfies prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award directing reassignment of a grievant was set aside because the remedy did not flow from a contract provision that clearly led to that result. FLRA, not embracing other awards speaking of the freedom of arbitrators to fashion remedies, determined in <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston Region and AFGE Local 1164</span>, 57 FLRA 264, 268-70 (2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's exception that the Award is contrary to management's right to assign employees challenges the award's consistency with law. Therefore, the Authority reviews the question of law raised by the exception and the Arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo. See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA, </span>43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437, </span>53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency asserts that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See SBA, </span>55 FLRA at 184. If it does, then the Authority applies the two-prong test set forth in <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 151-54. If the award does not affect management's rights, then the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis is not required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously found arbitral efforts to order reassignment to be contrary to an agency's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 12, </span>34 FLRA 877 (1990) (award requiring reassignment of employees deficient because violated provision of agreement did not address or require reassignment of employees); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., </span>55 FLRA 480, 481 (1999) (where an arbitrator's award does not require the agency to assign the grievant to a new supervisor, the agency's right to assign employees under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A) is not affected). <span class="Italic">Cf. United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv.,</span> <span class="Italic">New York, NY, </span>39 FLRA 278 (1991) (award ordering the reassignment of an employee back to his original position after the agency had not followed proper contractual procedures in reassigning him was not contrary to law as the agency retained the right to reassign employees subject to the contractual procedures). We conclude, therefore, that the award affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Upon satisfying the threshold requirement, the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, then the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See United</span> <span class="Italic">States Dep't of Defense, Defense Logistics Agency,</span> <span class="Italic">Defense Distribution Depot, Norfolk, Va., </span>54 FLRA 180, 185 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to apply the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>test, it is first necessary to identify the contract provision that the Arbitrator determined was violated. Here, the Arbitrator identified more than one provision of the parties' agreement relevant to the case. First, the Arbitrator determined that the grievant's supervisor violated the spirit and the letter of Article 21 of the Agreement through supervisory techniques that amounted to a less than honest interaction between himself and the grievant. The Arbitrator also determined that the supervisor violated Article 2, &#x00A7; 2A, second paragraph, of the Agreement when the supervisor failed to treat the grievant with courtesy, dignity and respect.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We assume without deciding that the award complies with prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test. Under prong II, we examine whether the award reflect(s) a reconstruction of what management would have done had it complied with the contract provision. <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 154. We conclude that under any of the provisions the Arbitrator found the Agency to have violated, transferring the grievant to another supervisor is not a proper reconstruction of what management would have done had it complied with the contract provision. First, had the Agency complied with Article 21, the supervisor would have engaged the grievant in honest feedback and open two-way communications, pursuant to the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 21, &#x00A7; 1. Upon identifying shortcomings with her work, the supervisor would have applied the remedial provisions of Article 21, &#x00A7; 6 of the parties' agreement, including the collection and analysis of data which focuses on the process and not on the individual employee. Nothing in Article 23 addresses, directly or indirectly, reassignment of Agency supervisors. As a result, reconstruction of what the Agency would have done had it complied with Article 21 cannot possibly entail such reassignment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, had the Agency complied with Article 3, &#x00A7; 2A, second paragraph, the grievant's supervisor would have deal[t] with [the employee] in a professional manner and with courtesy, dignity and respect. As is the case with Article 21, Article 3 does not involve, directly or indirectly, reassignment of the grievant to a different supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, as the portion of the Award directing the reassignment of the grievant to a different supervisor fails to meet prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>the Award is deficient. Accordingly, we set aside that portion of the Award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the dissent, we appreciate that the nature of contract provisions such as those involved in this case make it difficult to construct meaningful remedies. Nevertheless, for the reasons that follow, we disagree that this fact renders the reconstruction prong of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> inapplicable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">BEP</span> requirements are rooted squarely in the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA, </span>494 U.S. 922 (1990) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>). In that decision, the Court held that the only limitations on management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) of the Statute are those contained within &#x00A7; 7106 itself. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 928. There are two such limitations. First, management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) are limited by applicable laws. Second, all management rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a) are subject to subsection (b). While <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>itself involved review of an Authority decision in a negotiability proceeding, the Court's decision was based on an interpretation of &#x00A7; 7106, which obviously applies in other proceedings as well.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>it is clear that provisions negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) are enforceable <span class="Italic">vis a vis </span>management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106(a). However, determining that provision was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b) cannot end the inquiry. If it did, then constraints on management rights that were never agreed to under &#x00A7; 7106(b) could be imposed. This would be contrary to <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>which counsels that only constraints arising under &#x00A7; 7106 itself (through applicable laws or subsection (b)) are permissible. Consequently, an award must reconstruct what an agency <span id="page_2266"></span>would have done if it had complied with the disputed contract provision. Put simply, requiring reconstruction is necessary to ensure that an agency's section 7106(a) rights are limited only to the extent the parties bargained for. Regardless of whether allowing arbitrators to impose additional, different limitations on management's rights would be good policy, under <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>it is not good law.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA Long Beach Health Care Sys. and AFGE Local 1203</span>, 63 FLRA 332, 335 (2009), set aside a portion of an award, directing that the grievant be assigned to a new supervisor, as unsupported by the contract and an improper reconstruction (under law then requiring reconstruction) of what would have occurred without a contract violation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's management's rights exception challenges the award's consistency with law. The Authority reviews the question of law raised by the exception and the Arbitrator's award <span class="Italic">de novo.</span> <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (<span class="Italic">citing United States Customs Serv. v.

In applying a <span class="Italic">de novo </span>standard of review, the Authority assesses whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437,</span> 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">To resolve an assertion that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.,</span> 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999). The Authority has held that precluding a supervisor from performing certain duties affects management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529,</span> 56 FLRA 1049, 1051 (2001). The Arbitrator's award precludes certain management officials from supervising the grievant. Therefore, we find that the award affects management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an award affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106, the Authority assesses the legality of the award under a two-prong test. <span class="Italic">BEP,</span> 53 FLRA at 153-54. The <span class="Italic">BEP</span> test provides as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong I of the framework and will then address prong II. Under prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, then the Authority will find that the award satisfies prong II. An award that fails to satisfy either prong I or prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">SSA, Boston,</span> 57 FLRA at 268-69 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the Arbitrator's award satisfies prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span> Under prong II, the Agency states that, in accordance with the Arbitrator's findings, if it had complied with Article 22 of the parties' agreement, then it would have selected the grievant for one of the vacant positions that were the subject of the grievance. The Agency argues, however, that it would not have changed the grievant's supervision, which was the same for both the position he had and the ones for which he applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is similar to <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston,</span> in which the arbitrator found that the agency failed to treat the grievant with dignity, courtesy, and respect, as required by the parties' agreement, and ordered the agency to reassign the grievant to a different supervisor. <span class="Italic">SSA, Boston,</span> 57 FLRA at 269. The Authority found that this remedy failed to satisfy prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> because none of the contractual provisions that the agency violated had any relation to supervisory assignment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Likewise, here, the contractual provisions violated by the Agency involve candidate selection guidelines, and not supervisory assignment. Additionally, there is no indication from the record or the Arbitrator's findings that the Agency would have placed the grievant under different supervision if he had been selected for a GS-11 MT position. Therefore, we find that the portion of the Arbitrator's award addressing the grievant's supervision fails to meet prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP.</span> As it is deficient, we set aside that portion of the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agric, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv., Grain Inspection, Packers &#x0026; Stockyards Admin.,</span> 58 FLRA 98, 100 (2002) (where Authority set aside portion of award, but left other remedies undisturbed, there was no need for remand).</p>
<p class="noindent">An award requiring cancelation of a reassignment was set aside and remanded for resubmission to the arbitrator because the arbitrator did not explain what provision of the contract was violated by the reassignment, <span class="Italic">VAMC Detroit and AFGE Local 933</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-067.html">60 FLRA 306</a>, 306, 309-10 (2004) (following remand, 61 FLRA 371 (2005)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the merits award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency improperly disciplined the grievant by extending her reassignment to a medical supply technician position, and he sustained the grievance. In the subsequent remedy award, the Arbitrator awarded backpay and attorney fees and directed the Agency to reassign the grievant to her operating room technician position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts the awards are contrary to law.&#x2003;The Authority reviews questions of law <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying a standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority determines whether the arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See NFFE, Local 1437</span>, 53 FLRA 1703, 1710 (1998). In making that determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;Section 7106 of the Statute</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where an agency asserts that an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority first determines whether the award affects management's rights. <span class="Italic">See United States Small Bus. Admin.</span>, 55 FLRA 179, 184 (1999) (<span class="Italic">SBA</span>). If the award affects management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106, then the Authority applies the two-prong test established in the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA 146. Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either an applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, 53 FLRA at 152-53. If it does, then under prong II of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 154.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">a.&#x2003;Effect on management rights</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that an arbitration award ordering the reassignment of an employee affects management's right to assign employees. <span class="Italic">See SSA, Boston Region (Region 1), Lowell Dist. Office, Lowell, Mass.</span>, 57 FLRA 264, 268 (2001) (citations omitted) (Member Wasserman dissenting in part on other grounds). The remedy award orders the reassignment of the grievant, supporting a conclusion that the awards affect management's right to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The decisions relied on by the Union do not support a contrary conclusion.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Buffalo VA</span>, 32 FLRA at 604-06, the Authority found that management's right to assign employees was affected. In <span class="Italic">Dep't of Treasury</span>, 39 FLRA at 283-84, the Authority found that the award was not contrary to the right to assign employees because the arbitrator enforced an appropriate arrangement--not because the award had no effect on management's rights. Finally, unlike <span class="Italic">DLA,</span> 56 FLRA at 692-94, the instant case does not involve a situation where management has determined the grievant to be equally qualified to others and the award is merely enforcing a provision determining how equally-qualified employees will receive assignments. Thus, these decisions do not support a conclusion that the awards do not affect the Agency's right to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude<span class="Italic"> </span>that the awards affect management's right to assign employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">BEP </span>analysis</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To apply the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis, it is essential to identify the law or contract provision that the arbitrator found violated. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Newport News, Va.</span>, 56 FLRA 339, 343 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Dep't of Navy</span>) (Chairman Wasserman dissenting), <span class="Italic">decision after remand</span>, 57 FLRA 36 (2001) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part); <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 184; <span class="Italic">United States DOD, Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Distrib. Depot, Norfolk, Va.</span>, 54 FLRA 180, 184 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DOD</span>) (Member Wasserman dissenting). If the Authority is unable to determine which contract provisions were found violated, then the Authority will remand the matter to the parties for resubmission to the arbitrator, absent settlement, for clarification. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of Navy</span>, 56 FLRA at 344; <span class="Italic">SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 185; <span class="Italic">DOD</span>, 54 FLRA at 184.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we are unable to determine the basis for the Arbitrator's awards. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated that the Agency "violated the Agreement" because the reassignment was not "proper." However, the Arbitrator did not state which provisions of the parties' agreement was violated. Moreover, while the Arbitrator set forth several contract provisions and declared those provisions to "have relevance," the Arbitrator did not further specify, and we are unable to determine from the record, which of those provisions the Arbitrator relied on in finding a violation and forming the remedy. Among other things, the Arbitrator cited Article 13, which sets forth procedures for taking disciplinary actions, but did not find a violation of that Article. The Arbitrator also did not indicate that he was finding a violation of the just cause provision. Moreover, the Arbitrator cited Article 26, concerning actions based on unacceptable performance, and stated that "none of the procedures therein were followed" here. However, given the Arbitrator's repeated findings that this case does not involve unacceptable performance, the Arbitrator's reason for finding that Article 26 was not followed is not clear.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we cannot determine what contract provision(s) the Arbitrator <span id="page_2267"></span>was enforcing, we are unable to apply the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., SBA</span>, 55 FLRA at 184-85. Accordingly, we remand the awards to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, for clarification. On remand, the Arbitrator must clarify what contract provisions were violated, and whether those provisions were negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. If the Arbitrator determines that such a provision were violated, then any remedy must reconstruct what management would have done if it had complied with that provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we remand the awards for clarification.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA set aside an award finding that management violated its contract when it temporarily reassigned the grievant, an inmate systems officer. The contract provision unduly interfered with the agency's right to implement internal security. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Oakdale and AFGE Local 3957</span>, 59 FLRA 277, 279 (2003). <span class="Italic">DOJ, FCI La Tuna and AFGE Local 83</span>, 59 FLRA 374, 376 (2003), overturned an award applying contract articles to require management to adhere to overtime apportionment obligations through assignment of employees to vacant posts. The resulting interference with the agency's ability to fill posts at the correctional facility substantially interfered with the agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Interpreting contract language similar if not the same as that in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 83</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, FLRA sustained exceptions to an award that required management to follow seniority in the assignment of employees to various departments of Inmate Systems Management without regard to the particular qualifications of the employees, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Fed. Detention Ctr. Houston and AFGE Local 1030</span>, 59 FLRA 744, 745-46 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In resolving whether an arbitrator's award violates management's rights under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, the Authority applies the framework established in <span class="Italic">BEP</span>. Upon finding that an award affects a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test to determine if the award is deficient. Under prong I, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. Under prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if it had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Lompoc, Cal.</span>, 58 FLRA 301, 303 (2003) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring, Member Pope dissenting) (<span class="Italic">BOP Lompoc</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001). The Authority has recently stated that a proposal requiring selection based on seniority can affect management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) in certain circumstances. <span class="Italic">See AFGE Local 3935</span>, 59 FLRA 481, 482 (2003). As the right to assign work includes the right to establish qualifications and skills needed for a particular position, a provision that requires assignment by seniority, where management does not retain the authority to determine that the employees are equally qualified for the work assignments, affects the right to assign work.<span class="Italic"> Id</span>. Here, the Arbitrator's award effectively requires the Agency to rotate the employees in various departments of Inmate Systems Management solely in order of seniority, and does not allow management to make the determination as to whether the employees are equally qualified for the work assignments. We also note that there was no finding by the Arbitrator, nor any argument from the Union, that the employees were equally qualified. Thus, the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 18 to invoke seniority-based roster committees affects management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Otisville, N.Y.,</span> 58 FLRA 307 (2003) (<span class="Italic">BOP Otisville</span>), the Authority found that an award involving the same contractual provisions as in this case (Article 18, Sections d. and f.) simply required bargaining and did not affect the exercise of management's rights. The Authority noted, however, that "if, as asserted by the Agency, the award had the effect of...preventing the Agency from assigning employees in a manner it judged necessary for its security, then it would affect management's rights to determine its internal security practices and assign work, and application of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> analysis would be necessary." <span class="Italic">BOP Otisville</span>, 58 FLRA at 309 n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP</span>, the Authority must first determine whether Article 18 was negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Def., Def. Logistics Agency, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana,</span> <span class="Italic">Tex.,</span> 55 FLRA 523, 526 (1999). In order to determine whether a provision, as interpreted and applied by the arbitrator, was negotiated under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), the Authority assesses, pursuant to the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span>, whether the collective bargaining provision: (1) constitutes an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3); and (2) excessively interferes with the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Complex, Coleman, Fla.</span>, 58 FLRA 291 (2003); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr.

<p class="noindent-1">A collective bargaining provision constitutes an arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) if it is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects flowing from the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Admin., Washington, D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 1233, 1236-37 (2000). The Authority has found in other cases that Article 18 constitutes an arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute because it is intended to allow employees to plan days off and shift preferences, providing employees relief from the Agency exercising its right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Fed. Satellite Low, La Tuna, Tex.</span>, 59 FLRA 374 (2003), <span class="Italic">BOP Sheridan</span>, 58 FLRA at 284.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A provision excessively interferes with a management right under the standard set forth in <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span> if the benefits afforded employees under the provision are outweighed by the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">BOP Oklahoma City</span>, 58 FLRA at 111. Here, Article 18 benefits employees by allowing employees to have advance notice of when they are expected to work. However, this benefit to employees is outweighed by the intrusion on the exercise of management's right to assign work. In this regard, the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 18, Section f requires that the Agency establish roster committees and comply with the requirements in Article 18, Section d unless waived by the parties. Further, the Arbitrator interpreted Article 18, Section d to "[provide] that the roster committee...consider preference requests in order of seniority." The Agency claims, and the Union does not controvert, that this interpretation has the effect of <span class="Italic">requiring</span> that preference requests be made and granted in order of seniority. Such an interpretation effectively precludes the Agency from rotating ISM employees throughout the department in accordance with Agency policy. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3935</span>, 59 FLRA at 483-84 (proposal requiring that only seniority be considered when assigning and reassigning employees excessively interferes with management's right to assign work).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By denying the Agency the ability to assign the employees as it deems necessary within ISM, the award prevents management from determining the "particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what position the duties will be assigned." <span class="Italic">See Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org.</span>, 37 FLRA 392, 399 (1990). (describing the right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B)). In addition, the Agency would be required to confine work assignments to senior employees who chose a specific rotation and preclude management from assigning work to other employees. This places a significant burden on the Agency. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 26</span>, 22 FLRA 314, 325 (1986) (proposals that could have the effect of completely abrogating the agency's right to assign a particular employee to perform a particular job excessively interfered with management's right to assign work). On balance, we find that the intrusion on the exercise of management's right to assign work outweighs any benefits to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the award excessively interferes with management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, and set aside the award.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could properly direct an agency to rescind a geographical reassignment, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Indianapolis and NTEU Chap. 49</span>, 49 FLRA 55, 57-58 (1994):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we reject the Agency's assertion that the award is contrary to management's rights to assign employees and work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B) of the Statute. Although the right to assign employees "means the right to decide the particular position to which an employee will be assigned[,]...[t]his right does not normally encompass the decision as to <span class="Italic">where</span> employees will perform duties previously assigned to their positions." <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Association and U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office</span>, 41 FLRA 795, 834 (1991) (emphasis in original). Similarly, as to management's right to assign work, "the location at which employees perform the normal duties of their jobs is negotiable unless a relationship exists between the job location and the job duties." <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3369 and Social Security Administration, Cypress Hills District Office</span>, 31 FLRA 1110, 1111-12 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency does not claim that the grievants were assigned to different positions or that there is any relationship between the job duties assigned to the grievants and any particular job location.&#x2003;In fact, the Arbitrator noted that the grievants' "work on ETEP inventory was to be transferred" with them to their new duty station. In addition, the Union asserts that the grievants' positions and work are "identical" at either duty station. In these circumstances, we find that the Agency has not established that the award is inconsistent with its rights to assign employees and work. In so holding, we find that the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 12 and United States Department of <span id="page_2268"></span>Labor</span>, 34 FLRA 877 (1990), <span class="Italic">Naval Air Rework Facility, Jacksonville</span>, <span class="Italic">Florida and National Association of Government Inspectors and</span> <span class="Italic">Quality Assurance</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel</span>, 27 FLRA 318 (1987) and <span class="Italic">Naval</span> <span class="Italic">Undersea Warfare Engineering Station, Keyport, Washington and</span> <span class="Italic">International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers</span>, <span class="Italic">Local</span> <span class="Italic">282</span>, 22 FLRA 957 (1986) is misplaced. Those cases involved management's right to assign employees to different positions and to determine specific work assignments rather than, as here, the determination as to where employees will perform the work assigned to their positions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">C&#x0026;BP, Laredo Section and AFGE Local 2455</span>, 70 FLRA 921, 921-22 (2018) (Member DuBester concurring) (failure of agency to provide geographical reassignment under its compassionate transfer policy constituted an arbitrable dispute over condition of employment).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 1990 and the <span class="Italic">Customs Serv. </span>decision (37 FLRA 309) establishing an "abrogation" standard [the abrogation standard was reinstituted in 2010 in <span class="Italic">EPA and AFGE Council 238</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v65/65-28.html">65 FLRA 113</a> (2010), and then the abrogation standard was abandoned in favor of the earlier application of the "excessive interference" standard for negotiability cases in <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 817,</span> <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v70/70-83.html">70 FLRA 398</a> (2018)], case law concerning awards directing reassignments followed the law established concerning negotiability of details and reassignments. Arbitrators often could not enforce agreements precluding management from reassigning employees. The agreements violated the right to assign employees to positions under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Air Force Logistics Command and AFGE Local 214</span>, 32 FLRA 261, 266-67 (1988). An award directing that a reassignment of an employee be rescinded and that the employee be placed back into his original position interfered with the right of management to assign work. <span class="Italic">Naval Undersea Warfare Eng'g Station and IAM Local 282</span>, 22 FLRA 957, 959 (1986); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 12 and Dept. of Labor</span>, 34 FLRA 877, 882 (1990) (remedy directing reassignment was not founded on specific negotiated arrangement or procedure). Even when a disciplinary reassignment was challenged as an improper procedure under a governing collective bargaining contract, FLRA vacated an award canceling the reassignment. The award violated management's right to assign work and employees, although FLRA's decision ignored the issue of the agency's disciplinary authority and instead focused on the agency's authority to determine qualifications of employees assigned to specific positions. <span class="Italic">Buffalo VAMC and New York State Nurses Ass'n</span>, 32 FLRA 601, 604 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">A limited exception existed to the general prohibition against awards that interfered with reassignments. An arbitrator could enforce a contract clause concerning who, among a group of qualified employees, will fill duties previously assigned to their positions. <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 29 FLRA 225, 227-28 (1987), involved an exchange of fully qualified employees between identical positions. As part of a remedy concerning a grievance against a reprimand, the arbitrator directed the agency to place the employee in another work module. FLRA sustained that result:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the portion of the Arbitrator's award dealing with the grievant's transfer is contrary to section 7106(b)(1) of the Statute. Specifically, the Agency asserts that by directing the grievant's transfer, the Arbitrator's award would require the Agency to adjust the number of employees assigned to two organization subdivisions: the grievant's current work location and the work location to which he would be transferred. The Agency maintains that the parties' collective bargaining agreement demonstrates that the Agency has elected not to bargain on the number of employees assigned to its organizational subdivisions. The Union disputes the Agency's contentions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the parties' collective bargaining agreement contains no applicable negotiated provision constituting the Agency's election under section 7106(b)(1) to negotiate, we conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the award concerns a matter which is negotiable only at the election of the Agency under section 7106(b)(1). The Agency has in no manner established that the award is directly or integrally related to the numbers of employees or positions assigned to an organizational subdivision so as to be determinative of such matters....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Agency has not established that the Arbitrator's award pertaining to the grievant's transfer to another module, and outside of Section 3 if possible, involves an assignment of employees to positions or an assignment of work under section 7106(a)(2)(A) and (B). The Authority has specifically held that proposals which relate to the transfer of an employee to other work areas is merely concerned with where employees will perform those duties which management has previously assigned to their positions and does not conflict with an agency's right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Internal Revenue Service</span>, 28 FLRA No. 11 (1987) (assign certain home office rather than field-located work to union officials); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees and Air Force Logistics Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</span>, 5 FLRA 83 (1981) (make temporary duty assignments to different geographical areas based on seniority).

<p class="noindent-1">...The Activity did not argue before the Arbitrator that the applicants were not equally qualified or that some were more qualified than others to fill the positions. Although the Activity claims in its exceptions that some of the applicants "may" be more qualified than others, it provides no support for this claim in the record. In the absence of such a showing, we find that the Arbitrator did not err in determining that the employees were equally qualified. Therefore, we conclude that the award does not interfere with management's right to determine the relative qualifications of employees selected for assignment....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[W]e find that the Arbitrator's remedy did not dictate the source from which the Activity would fill the vacant positions. The Activity chose the source for filling the vacant positions. The Activity chose to use reassignments as the method by which it would fill the vacancies. Once it made that decision, the Activity was required to follow negotiable procedures applicable to reassignments....&#8197;The Arbitrator merely enforced Article 20.</p>
