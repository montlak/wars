<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-225"><span class="space">2.</span> Assistance to Mentally Incompetent Appellant; <span class="Italic"><span class="Bold">French</span></span> Procedure</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">At the urging of the Federal Circuit, the Board showed initiative as to recruitment of counsel for an incompetent appellant in <span class="Italic">French v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/FRENCH_RALPH_T_SL831L8610005_OPINION_AND_ORDER_224784.pdf">37 MSPR 496</a>, 498-99 (1988), involving a disability retirement appeal characterized by the Federal Circuit as "an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent" and not represented by counsel or a conservator. <span class="Italic">French</span> is limited to annuity cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither the Board nor OPM has authority to appoint a paid conservator or counsel....&#8197;Congressional appropriations may be applied "only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise authorized by law." 31 USC 1301....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lack of authority to appoint a representative is not equivalent, however, to a lack of authority to request representation <span class="Italic">pro bono publico</span>. Government attorneys are specifically authorized by 18 USC &#x00A7; 205 to represent "any person who is the subject of...personnel administration proceedings," if it is not inconsistent with their duties. Private attorneys may also render <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> services in Board proceedings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the court's finding...our St. Louis Regional Office is directed to make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation by counsel for Mr. French.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;While the Regional Office should not, of course, direct appellant to a particular attorney, it may appropriately provide...a list of available attorneys. For this purpose, the Regional Director should request the names and addresses of attorneys who might represent...<span class="Italic">pro bono</span> from sources such as the local bar association, the local Federal Executive Board, and other local organizations which provide legal services to the indigent.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">French v. OPM</span>, 810 F.2d 1118 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (reh. den., 823 F.2d 489 (Fed. Cir. 1987)), originated with an appeal from an OPM determination rejecting as untimely a disability annuity claim. The court was concerned that the Board and OPM did not do more to protect the interests of an appellant who seemed clearly incompetent to prosecute his claim. The remedy was to require the Board to make best efforts to locate counsel for the appellant or to conduct a nonadversarial adjudication in an annuity determination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">French is, now at least, a mental incompetent who is paranoid and at times schizophrenic. He was removed from his position with the Social Security Administration on January 5, 1968, after approximately 10 years of service. His mode of living for years has been that of one of the mentally disabled homeless who have, alas, become so familiar a sight in our cities. On April 2, 1984, French applied for disability retirement benefits with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)....&#8197;French had no conservator or like fiduciary acting on his behalf, nor was he represented by counsel. In subsequent proceedings, likewise, he has acted entirely <span class="Italic">pro se</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The issue in this case, as we view it, is whether a mental incompetent, without assistance of counsel or conservator, is to be required to establish or allowed to attempt to show his own incompetency for many years in the past. We hold that it is patently unreasonable and fundamentally unfair to require or allow an incompetent to act as advocate in such a setting where even a sane attorney would be confronted with a difficult task. Exercise of the statutory discretion in such a manner is an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marcee v. United States</span>, 455 F.2d 525, 527, 197 Ct. Cl. 363 (1972), one of our predecessor courts attempted to prescribe some kind of fair treatment in a 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b) disability claim so that the present incompetent will not lose out be cause he failed, without assistance of counsel, to prove his own past incompetence. There was a history of belated filings rejected by the former Civil Service Commission because it ignored the mental condition of the claimant which it knew. Finally a conservator petitioned. In <span class="Italic">Marcee</span>, the court considered the type of role the government should take in such a disability claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It might be supposed that the Congress expected the CSC [Civil Service Commission] not to sit passively back and leave the incompetent former employee to prove her incompetence. It could have taken the initiative in looking into the matter so that the obvious desire of Congress should be respected, that former employees disabled in the course of honorable service should not be reduced to penury.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...We reaffirm the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Marcee</span> and add that it is also unfair that the full board's decision regarding French's disability was based on the incompetent's testimony at the hearing, with its admissions, rather than on medical evidence regarding his sickness and its duration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is unlike <span class="Italic">Marcee</span> in that there is still no conservator and thus no one competent to pursue justice under the adversary system. A candid assessment of the position of an incompetent in our society is that he is disadvantaged, and lacks the ordinary powers of the citizen. The statute reflects a concern of Congress that one disabled because of mental incompetence is not to lose the disability annuity because of failure to meet, in timely fashion, the preconditions as to procedure the sane and normal must satisfy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">French has had at least an inchoate claim to an annuity; the OPM must, therefore, take an active role in the determination of an incompetent's claim to waiver of the 1-year limitation under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8337(b), which requires a high degree of care in dealing with the claims of the incompetent. We note OPM apparently has material on French the presiding official refused to consider because it was not timely submitted. Accordingly, we remand to the MSPB with instruction to formulate procedures to ensure the presence of a competent conservator or attorney if possible in a case such as this of an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent; the consideration of appropriate medical testimony; and the statement of standards for adjudicating such disability retirement claims where the 1-year statute has run. We agree that French failed to establish his incompetence from 1968 to the present. However, we disagree that he alone should be charged with the task of establishing his case. If he fails to cooperate in allowing himself to be represented by a competent person, his case may be suspended, but rulings that will be <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> may not be made against him<span class="Italic">. Marcee</span>, in <span class="Italic">dictum</span>, suggests the possibility of a nonadversary determination following an active investigation by the agency, rather than awaiting what the applicant submits.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, OPM should apply the procedures set forth in <span class="Italic">French v. <span id="Page_1210"></span>Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 MSPR 496 (1988).

As directed by the court, if there is "an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent," the Board and OPM must take an "active role" in ensuring that the apparently incompetent appellant not "be charged with the task of establishing his case [alone]." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">French,</span> 810 F.2d at 1120. The Board has held that the <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures should be invoked when: (1) there is a showing that the appellant is mentally incompetent, and (2) he is proceeding "entirely <span class="Italic">pro se</span>." <span class="Italic">Larry v. Department of Justice,</span> 76 MSPR 348 (1997).

The court in <span class="Italic">French</span> stated that an appellant need not be a "raving lunatic" to be considered incompetent for purposes of adequate representation; incompetency may be shown "by one having some minimal capacity to manage his own affairs." 810 F.2d at 1120.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the doctor's report supports a finding that the appellant was incompetent for the period covered by the medical records because it indicates that he was unable to handle his affairs (i.e., timely filing his disability retirement application) due to his mental conditions of depression and schizoaffective disorder. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Engler v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 81 MSPR 582 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) (finding that the appellant was incompetent, for purposes of <span class="Italic">French,</span> based on doctors' reports describing him as paranoid schizophrenic and delusional). Absent any evidence showing a change in circumstances regarding the appellant's mental competence, OPM should make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate representation for him. <span class="Italic">See French,</span> 810 F.2d at 1120. <span class="Italic">See also Eddy,</span> 38 MSPR at 445; <span class="Italic">French</span> at 37 MSPR at 499.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Eddy v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 442, 444-45 (1988), added as to development of medical evidence in the appeal of an individual who is presently incompetent in a retirement appeal (involving, in <span class="Italic">Eddy,</span> an overpayment claim):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant is represented by his wife, although there is no designation of representative form as required under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.31 or evidence that his wife is his guardian or conservator. In the petition for appeal, Mrs. Eddy claimed that the appellant is mentally disabled, a claim supported by medical documents in the record and not disputed or addressed by OPM. We find that the fundamental unfairness found by the court in <span class="Italic">French</span> may exist here, where an appellant who may be mentally disabled and is without legal counsel is required to show financial hardship. In this regard, we find that even if the appellant chose his wife as his representative, his mental incapacity casts doubt on whether he should be held responsible for his choice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, as in <span class="Italic">French,</span> we direct the regional office to do the following: (1) Make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation by counsel for the appellant and (2) if appropriate, direct the representatives of the parties to obtain medical evidence from mutually agreeable private nonprofit or governmental sources. In addition, we direct OPM to cooperate fully in a nonadversary determination of the appellant's competence during the period in issue.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Chapter 2 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span> provides the Board's views on the nature of the assistance that should be provided in a retirement appeal to an appellant who is incompetent to pursue his own appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">8.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">INCOMPETENCE</span>. In a retirement case in which the appellant bears the burden of proving entitlement to annuity benefits, if the appellant is, or appears to be, incompetent, the AJ must follow the requirements set out in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 496 (1988). In essence, <span class="Italic">French,</span> a disability retirement appeal, requires an AJ to make diligent efforts to assist such an appellant in obtaining representation. The Board has extended the <span class="Italic">French</span> process to other types of retirement appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Brown v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 10 (2003). It has not, however, extended the <span class="Italic">French</span> requirements to questions of the appellant's competence in adverse action appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 72 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, in cases such as J<span class="Italic">ones v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 269 (2000), the Board has noted an agency's obligation to file a disability retirement application on behalf of an employee it has removed, under the similar circumstances set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 844.302 and 831.1205. If the agency has such an obligation, procedures such as those required by <span class="Italic">French</span> are to be employed. The AJ's responsibility and authority in that situation were detailed in <span class="Italic">Dixon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 148, 151 &#x00B6; 5 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the AJ should monitor the progress of the application, including setting reasonable time limits where appropriate, to ensure that the agency complies with its duty to prosecute the application in good faith and to ensure that OPM complies with its duty to process the application expediently and in good faith. The AJ may join OPM as a party to the appeal, or initiate procedures to request <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for the appellant, if he determines that such steps are appropriate or necessary. Additionally, the AJ has the authority to vacate the ID to the extent necessary to facilitate any settlement agreement that the parties and OPM may reach. When OPM issues a decision, the AJ is to ensure that the appellant and any representative understand the options, including requesting reconsideration and appealing to the Board.</p>

Therefore, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mr. Wade's ability to participate in other litigation fatally undermines his claim that his alleged incompetence prevented him from filing his appeal or a request for an extension.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">French</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Woods v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 1, 2 (1993), remanding a case for further regional consideration after an appellant who proceeded <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before the AJ obtained counsel to prosecute a PFR. The Board remanded based on counsel's representations of the appellant as</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"a very sick man whose thought processes are in disarray...and have <span id="Page_1211"></span>been for some considerable time in the past"; that he was unable to present a cogent argument for himself at the hearing the judge held on his appeal; that he needed an attorney to present his case; and that, now that he has one, he should be given another opportunity to gather and present evidence in support of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Meanwhile, because the appellant dismissed his counsel, the Board directed the AJ to "make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation for the appellant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 3.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dennison v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 358, 361 (1989), commented on the desirability of having an attorney represent an incompetent appellant during an annuity proceeding, as opposed to representation through a family member:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Preference should be given to the appointment of a lawyer to represent the appellant on remand because a lawyer is more likely than a lay person to have the substantive and procedural knowledge and skill necessary to develop evidence of the appellant's incompetence during the relevant period. Equally important, lawyers are obliged to serve the best interests of the their clients and are subject to professional discipline if they betray their client's trust; lay persons are not. This safeguard is especially desirable when dealing with one who is unable to grasp what is going on around him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Engler v. OPM</span>, 81 MSPR 582, 589-91 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-26 (1999), determined that the AJ must make the effort to secure counsel even if the appellant has a nonlawyer representative when the AJ forms the opinion that the representative cannot or does not provide effective assistance to the appellant. <span class="Italic">Engler</span> arose from an appellant's attempt to rescind his withdrawal of a retirement appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">French</span> allows for representation by a person other than an attorney or guardian. <span class="Italic">See</span> 810 F.2d at 1120. Second, in <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the court, in discussing <span class="Italic">French</span>, considered regulations which contemplate that an "immediate family member" is expected in some cases to file a retirement application on behalf of an incompetent employee. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1469. When discussing Mr. Harris's mental capacity for "making a decision to file <span class="Italic">and pursue</span> a disability retirement application," the court noted the absence of any record evidence showing that he had "either a personal representative or guardian, or an immediate family member, who could stand in his stead." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1471 (emphasis added). The court therefore appeared to acknowledge that a family member, that is, a nonlawyer, may pursue a retirement application on behalf of an incompetent individual. Hence, we find that <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures are not invoked simply because an incompetent appellant is represented by an individual who is not a lawyer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the court in <span class="Italic">French</span> noted the responsibility of OPM and the Board to take an "active role" in ensuring that an incompetent person's rights in a retirement case are protected, 810 F.2d at 1120, and the court in <span class="Italic">Harris</span> stressed the need for the Board "to assure that persons of likely mental incapacity will not suffer an impairment of their rights on account of their incapacity," 142 F.3d at 1471-72. Accordingly, we find that our inquiry under <span class="Italic">French</span> does not end simply because the appellant has a lay representative. Rather, we must examine whether the appellant's chosen representative is capable of adequately representing him before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, although the Board in <span class="Italic">Moses</span> found that the appellant was not "entirely <span class="Italic">pro se</span>" because she had designated two nonlawyers to represent her, it nonetheless noted that one of her representatives (Ms. Boggs) "took an active role in eliciting testimony and setting forth argument." The Board therefore found that the appellant was not "entirely <span class="Italic">pro se</span>" only after considering the fact that Ms. Boggs had provided active and capable representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a December 9, 1997 letter to OPM, Mr. Engler stated that he and his wife are both over eighty years of age and in "frail health." After mentioning his age and health, Mr. Engler made a "personal plea" to OPM for assistance, stating that "parental help in [the appellant's] cause has a limited horizon." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on Mr. Engler's undisputed statement that he is elderly and in poor health and his suggestion that he can be of only limited help to the appellant, we find that, absent changed circumstances, Mr. Engler is not able to provide the level of representation contemplated by the court in <span class="Italic">French</span>. Given the court's direction to the Board to take an active role in ensuring that an appellant's mental incapacity will not impair his right to present his retirement case, we find that Mr. Engler's age and health limit his capacity to assist the appellant to such an extent that the appellant is effectively proceeding "entirely <span class="Italic">pro se</span>" even though he designated Mr. Engler as his representative. [This finding does not suggest that Mr. Engler is incompetent, but rather that he is unable to actively and effectively prosecute this appeal due to his age and health.] We therefore find that the second prong of the standard for invoking <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures is satisfied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that both parts of the test for invoking <span class="Italic">French</span> have been met, we find unusual circumstances that warrant not giving effect to the August 26, 1998 letter withdrawing the appeal and requesting that it be dismissed. We therefore give no effect to the letter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we vacate the initial decision, reinstate the appeal, and remand this case to the New York Field Office. Absent any evidence submitted by the parties showing a change in circumstances regarding either the appellant's mental competence or Mr. Engler's ability to provide capable representation, the administrative judge shall on remand make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate representation for the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Eddy</span>, 38 MSPR at 445; <span class="Italic">French</span>, 37 MSPR at 499. If the administrative judge obtains capable representation for the appellant, she should adjudicate the appeal on the merits, including a hearing if the appellant requests one. If capable representation cannot be obtained despite the administrative judge's diligent efforts or if the appellant refuses to allow himself to be represented by a capable representative, the administrative judge shall not enter an adverse order against him; rather, if necessary, she should dismiss the case without prejudice to reinstatement of the action under circumstances conducive to fair adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, 142 F.3d at 1471.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A year before <span class="Italic">Engler,</span> <span class="Italic">Moses v. OPM</span>, 80 MSPR 535, 538-39 (1998), determined that <span class="Italic">French</span> does not apply when the appellant is represented by nonlawyer representatives, one of whom "took an active role in eliciting testimony and setting forth argument"; neither the appellant nor her representative claimed that the appellant was incompetent in the past or during the Board proceedings; it was insufficient to provide an unelaborated and unsupported general statement that the appellant was "incapable of comprehending this process." <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Barnett v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 95, 99-100 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15 (2001) (<span class="Italic">French</span> procedures were not defeated for a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who received some assistance from a congressional office); <span class="Italic">Visconti v. EPA</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 21 (1998) (implying that the AJ should not have approved or allowed participation by an undesignated representative because of the AJ's concerns about the appellant's competency to represent himself in an adverse action appeal not involving a potential right to an annuity).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">French</span>, the AJ may reasonably dismiss an appeal without prejudice until the appellant either becomes competent or agrees to representation. If the incompetent appellant secures, then dismisses, a representative without being adjudicated as competent, the AJ should again dismiss the appeal without prejudice. In these cases the AJ need not establish a date certain for refiling or a reporting schedule. <span class="Italic">Brown v. OPM</span>, 94 MSPR 331, 336-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-13 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">French</span> may be applicable in survivor annuity appeals prosecuted by apparently mentally incompetent <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frank v. OPM</span>, 111 MSPR 206, 210 &#x00B6; 11, 2009 MSPB 72 (2009) (remanding to AJ to determine whether the <span class="Italic">French</span> process should be applied).<span class="Italic"> Jones v. DHUD</span>, 87 MSPR 269, 274-75 &#x00B6; 13 (2000), suggested, without definitively ruling, that <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures may be appropriate when an adverse action appeal is tied to a directive that an agency initiate a retirement application on behalf of an employee believed to be mentally impaired:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because of this holding and the court's ruling in <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> 142 F.3d at 1471, if the agency does not, on its own accord, file an application for the appellant, then the use of <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures would be appropriate. We do not thereby decide whether <span class="Italic">Marbrey</span> [<span class="Italic">post</span>] and its progeny should be overruled or whether the appointment of counsel should generally be required in adverse action appeals, since the ensuing procedure, although having its genesis in an adverse action appeal, will be under the retirement law and regulations. Unlike adverse action appeals, the nature of the proceeding directed here and in <span class="Italic">Harris,</span> and as discussed in <span class="Italic">French,</span> is nonadversarial, one in which all of the parties act in the appellant's best interest.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">French</span> and its progeny involved unrepresented and incompetent appellants in certain types of annuity cases. In that group of appeals, the Board is supposed to help the appellant secure counsel or take other measures to protect the appellant to avoid what amounts to a default in presenting the appealed claim. <span class="Italic">Burge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 75, 92 &#x00B6; 32 (1999), an adverse action case based on AWOL and principally defended on entitlement to FMLA leave, noted that <span class="Italic">French</span> is limited to annuity cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's contention that he was denied proper legal representation below because of his physical and mental conditions, the Board has held that its obligation to ascertain an appellant's competency under <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, <span class="Italic">recons. denied</span>, 823 F.2d 489 (Fed. Cir. 1987), exists only in cases involving a potential right to an annuity. <span class="Italic">Visconti v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 21 (1998) (citing <span class="Italic">Gulbenkian v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 237 241 n.7 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 318 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table)); <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. Department of Justice</span>, 45 MSPR 72, 75 (1990). Moreover, a review of the appellant's coherent arguments and submissions indicates that he was mentally and physically competent to represent himself.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The need to secure counsel to assist mentally incompetent appellants is clear. Counsel undertaking such assistance will be responsible for zealously representing their clients as well as determining how their clients are to <span id="Page_1212"></span>effectively make decisions concerning the course of their appeals, including settlements. A court-appointed guardian or conservator may be required to confirm decisions affecting the client. Counsel would do well to contact his or her state disciplinary board to ascertain the most effective means to ethically represent the mentally disabled client. A decision involving a counsel fee petition, <span class="Italic">Swentek v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 605, 616 (1997), remarked:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorneys, however, may be reluctant to accept such cases without the possibility of receiving any fees under statutory fee-shifting provisions. In addition to not being reimbursed for their work on the cases, they incur other, less obvious expenses. These include losing money they could be making from paying clients while working for the <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> clients, not being reimbursed for "out of pocket" expenses, and not being compensated for overhead expenses such as rent and malpractice insurance. Moreover, attorneys accepting <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> cases involving mentally incompetent clients may confront additional obstacles. These include the greater possibility that the clients not only will be unable to assist the attorneys in presenting their cases, but may actively hamper their attorneys' efforts by being uncooperative and suspicious. Thus, the additional risk borne by counsel agreeing to represent mentally incompetent former employees in these cases is a factor we find worthy of consideration in establishing this new extension of the clearly without merit category.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hall v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 01-3037), considered a challenge to a settlement of a disability retirement case secured by an appellant represented by <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hall had been an employee of the United States Postal Service until she was terminated on July 19, 1991. In May 1993, Ms. Hall applied for disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331, 8337 (1994). After the Agency denied Ms. Hall's application, she appealed to the Board. After protracted litigation, the Board assisted Ms. Hall in retaining an attorney to represent her in this matter on a <span class="Italic">pro bono publico</span> basis. Ultimately, in April 2000, Ms. Hall's attorney, on behalf of Ms. Hall, entered into a settlement agreement with the Agency. Under the terms of the agreement, Ms. Hall's attorney obtained for Ms. Hall all of the relief that was available under the law. Specifically, OPM agreed to grant Ms. Hall's application for disability retirement retroactive to her last day in a pay status as an employee of the Postal Service. By its plain terms, the settlement agreement stated that the parties acknowledged that they understood the terms of the agreement, and that the parties entered into the agreement voluntarily after good faith negotiations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision dated April 28, 2000, the Board accepted the terms of the settlement agreement, finding that it was lawful, voluntarily entered into, and based upon the understanding of the parties. Ms. Hall's appeal was consequently dismissed, as the appeal was settled before the Board had reached a decision on the matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Ms. Hall contends that the settlement agreement is invalid because she did not enter into it voluntarily. We have carefully reviewed the record in this case, and we can find no basis for disturbing the Board's final decision. Substantial evidence in the record supports the Board's factual determination that Ms. Hall, through her duly-appointed attorney, voluntarily entered into the settlement agreement with the Agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there can be no dispute that the terms of the settlement agreement are fair, because Ms. Hall, through her counsel, obtained all of the relief that was available under the law. Also, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that Ms. Hall's attorney lacked the authority to enter into the settlement agreement. Finally, we discern no evidence in the record that the Board's decision to sustain the Agency's decision departed from important procedural rights, was based on a misconstruction of the governing statutes, or was erroneous in any other respect. We therefore affirm the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The assistance that the Board is supposed to supply in <span class="Italic">French</span> may be coupled with the requirements expressed in <span class="Italic">Lacy v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 434 (1998), carefully outlining what the AJ is supposed to advise an appellant whose appeal appears to be untimely because of illness or mental incapacity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Kelley v. OPM</span>, 198 Fed. Appx. 940 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP). [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-09-049.html#sec2-48">Timeliness of Appeals</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-09-051.html#sec2-50">Mental or Physical Illness; <span class="Italic">Lacy</span> Notice</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Marbrey v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 72, 74-75 (1990), a removal appeal, the Board was faced with the problem of an appellant who could not, in the AJ's opinion, make any effective contribution to his own case and who was without representation. The AJ dismissed the case without prejudice to the appellant to refile when the appellant obtained representation. The Board determined that the AJ erred, distinguishing <span class="Italic">French</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">French</span>, a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant had raised the issue of his mental incapacity in connection with his application for disability retirement. The...Federal Circuit vacated the Board's first decision on the appellant's appeal, remanded the case to the Board, and directed the Board to formulate procedures for the processing of a case of an apparently nonfrivolous claim of past incompetence by one presently incompetent and not represented by counsel or a conservator. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">French v. OPM</span>, 810 F.2d 1118, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In establishing these procedures, the Board noted that they were to be used in disability retirement cases of the kind present in <span class="Italic">French</span>. It directed the Regional Office to make diligent efforts to obtain appropriate representation for the appellant. The Board further stated that if counsel could not be obtained, the Regional Office should not enter an adverse order against the appellant, but if necessary, should dismiss the case without prejudice to reinstitution under circumstances conducive to fair adjudication. <span class="Italic">French v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 496, 498-99. The Board has subsequently applied the <span class="Italic">French</span> procedures to cases involving appellants who claimed mental disability and applied for waivers of repayment after they had received annuity overpayments....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast, this case does not involve an appellant who bears the burden of proving his entitlement to annuity benefits. Rather, here the agency must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant committed the misconduct alleged, and that his removal is reasonable and promotes the efficiency of the service....&#8197;Moreover, the appellant did not claim that he suffers from a mental disability, and the record does not contain any medical evidence to support such a finding. Finally, the record does not show that the appellant asked the Board for assistance in obtaining a representative after the administrative judge properly informed him of the possibility of obtaining <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> representation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">French</span>, 810 F.2d at 1119-20, the court did not indicate that the procedures it directed the Board to formulate should be extended beyond retirement appeals in which appellants claim that they are mentally incompetent and present medical evidence to support such claims. Because these factors are absent here, we find no reason to apply the <span class="Italic">French</span> standards to the present case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In a later appeal, the Board again was not inclined to expand the scope of <span class="Italic">French</span> to adverse action appeals, <span class="Italic">Larry v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 348, 353 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant was represented by an attorney below: although the attorney did not accompany him to the hearing, the attorney did not withdraw his representation. Neither the appellant nor his attorney below alleged that the appellant was mentally incompetent. <span class="Italic">See Marbrey v. Department of Justice,</span> 45 MSPR 72, 75 (1990). The fact that he received some EAP counseling is insufficient, without more, to show that he was mentally incompetent, and there was no medical evidence of record addressing his mental competency<span class="Italic">. See generally Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 372-73 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table); <span class="Italic">Brown v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to Wilder's request for counsel, Wilder cites the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 37 M.S.P.R. 496 (1988). In <span class="Italic">French</span>, based on this court's decision in <span class="Italic">French v. Office of Pers.

The Board further noted, however, that it lacked authority to appoint counsel. <span class="Italic">See French,</span> <span id="Page_1213"></span>37 M.S.P.R. at 498 ("Neither the Board nor OPM has authority to appoint a paid conservator or counsel for Mr. French").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the Board decision at issue in this petition, the administrative judge (AJ) cited <span class="Italic">French</span> and provided Wilder with a list of attorneys and organizations to consult concerning the possibility of obtaining legal assistance. The AJ further dismissed Wilder's appeal without prejudice until such time as Wilder becomes competent or obtains representation. Wilder has not shown that either this court's decision or the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">French</span> requires more than this. Thus, Wilder has not shown that the AJ clearly and indisputably erred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In any type of case--retirement or otherwise--if, with or without counsel, the appellant is not presently competent, the AJ is to issue no adverse order against the appellant, but should, if necessary, dismiss the case without prejudice to its reinstatement under circumstances conducive to fair adjudication. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frank v.
