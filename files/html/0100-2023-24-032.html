<p class="Body-Text">As to legal conclusions, normally the court will review agency action based on the reasoning advanced by the agency. The result reached by the agency cannot be sustained on <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizations supplied during judicial review. <span class="Italic">Timken Co. v. United States</span>, 894 F.2d 385, 388 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (citing <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943)). But the Federal Circuit may affirm an MSPB decision on grounds other than those relied upon by the MSPB when sustaining the decision does not require the court to make factual determinations not previously made by the MSPB. <span class="Italic">Cain v. OPM</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3272) (relying on <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">VanHorn v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP) ("We may affirm an agency's decision on 'grounds other than those relied upon in rendering [the agency's] decision, when upholding the agency's decision does not depend on making a determination of fact not previously made by the agency,' including in situations where the Board lacks jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">McCarthy v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 809 F3d 1365, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting <span class="Italic">In re Comiskey</span>, 554 F.3d 967, 974 (Fed. Cir. 2009)); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Sec. &#x0026; Exch. Comm'n v. Chenery Corp</span>., 318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943) ('It would be wasteful to send a case back to a lower court to reinstate a decision which it has already made but which the appellate court concluded should properly be based on another ground within the power of the appellate court to formulate.')."); <span class="Italic">Sumner v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3053) ("[W]e may affirm the dismissal of an action on a jurisdictional ground, even if that ground is different from the ground invoked by the Board, as long as our action does not require us to make a determination of fact not previously made by the Board."); <span class="Italic">Whittington v. MSPB</span>, 80 F.3d 471, 474 (Fed.

(quoting <span class="Italic">Killip v. OPM</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1993))).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Killip v. OPM</span>, 991 F.2d 1564, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the court noted its ability to affirm the Board's decision for reasons other than those stated in its decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">... Generally, a reviewing court may judge the propriety of an agency's decision only on the grounds "upon which the record discloses that its action was based." <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Comm'n. v.

United States</span>, 916 F.2d 689, 700 (Fed. Cir. 1990). We may, however, where appropriate, affirm the Board on grounds other than those relied upon in rendering its decision, when upholding the Board's decision does not depend upon making a determination of fact not previously made by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chenery I</span>, 318 U.S. at 88, 63 S.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grabis v. OPM</span>, 424 F.3d 1265, 1270 (Fed. Cir. 2005), affirmed the court's authority to affirm the Board for a reason not stated by the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question therefore arises whether our affirmance of the Board is consistent with the principle announced in <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 95 (1943), that "an administrative order cannot be upheld unless the grounds upon which the agency acted in exercising its powers were those upon which its action can be sustained." The <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> principle was designed to prevent reviewing courts from "improperly invad[ing] the administrative province" by deciding issues not addressed by the administrative tribunal. <span class="Italic">Ward v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 528 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Salt River Project Agric. Improvement &#x0026; Power Dist. v. United States</span>, 762 F.2d 1053, 1061 n.8 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). Although the Board is a quasi-judicial tribunal whose primary role is adjudicating government employment disputes, it is an administrative agency for <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> purposes. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Howatt v. United States</span>, 657 F.2d 1204, 1208 (Ct.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, however, does not always bar a reviewing court from affirming an agency on a ground different from that on which the agency based its decision. Such affirmance is permissible if "it is clear that... the agency would have reached the same ultimate result" under the court's legal theory. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">cf. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Boston &#x0026; Me.

In other words, <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> does not apply if there is no room for the agency to exercise discretion in deciding the legal issue under review. <span class="Italic">See Koyo Seiko Co. v. United States</span>, 95 F.3d 1094, 1100-01 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is no valid basis on which the Board could have reversed OPM's reconsideration decision and allowed Grabis to keep the windfall he received. <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> does not preclude our affirmance of the Board's decision on the basis we have given.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Oracle America, Inc. v. United States,</span> <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20200902117">975 F.3d 1279</a>, 1290-91 (Fed. Cir. 2020), considering a government contracting dispute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has referred to the <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine as embodying a "'foundational principle of administrative law' that judicial review of agency action is limited to 'the grounds that the agency invoked when it took the action.'" <span class="Italic">Dep't of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal</span>., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1907 (2020) (quoting <span class="Italic">Michigan v. EPA</span>, 576 U.S. 743, 758 (2015)). In <span class="Italic">Chenery</span>, the Supreme Court explained the rationale for that rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an order is valid only as a determination of policy or judgment which the agency alone is authorized to make and which it has not made, a judicial judgment cannot be made to do service for an administrative judgment. For purposes of affirming no less than reversing its orders, an appellate court cannot intrude upon the domain which Congress has exclusively entrusted to an administrative agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">318 U.S. at 88.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">Chenery</span> doctrine, however, does not invariably require a remand to the agency whenever a court holds that the agency's action was based on legally improper grounds. As the Supreme Court, this court, and other circuit courts have recognized, principles of harmless error apply to judicial review of agency action generally. A remand is unnecessary when the error in question "clearly had no bearing on the procedure used or the substance of decision reached," <span class="Italic">Mass. Trs. of E. Gas &#x0026; Fuel Assocs. v. United States</span>, 377 U.S. 235, 248 (1964); if there is no reason to believe that the decision would have been different, <span class="Italic">In re Watts</span>, 354 F.3d 1362, 1370 (Fed.

Gorsuch</span>, 742 F.2d 1028, 1036 (7th Cir. 1984); if the court is not "in substantial doubt whether the administrative agency would have made the same ultimate finding with the erroneous finding removed," <span class="Italic">Kurzon v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 539 F.2d 788, 796 (1st Cir. 1976); or where there is no "significant chance that but for the error, the agency might have reached a different result," <span class="Italic">NLRB v.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5193"></span>As this court has summed up the rule, a court may affirm the decision of an agency on a ground other than the ground given by the agency, so long as it is clear that the agency would have reached the same decision if it had been aware that the ground it invoked was legally unavailable, or if the decision does not depend on making a finding of fact not previously made by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Ford Motor Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is a general principle of administrative law that a court may not uphold an agency's decision on grounds different from those employed by the agency in the decision under review. <span class="Italic">See Sec. &#x0026; Exch. Comm'n v. Chenery Corp</span>., 318 U.S. 80, 87 (1943). Although recognizing that general principle, the government invokes an exception to that principle that applies when the reviewing court can uphold the agency's decision on a purely legal basis without making any factual determination not previously made by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Killip v.

<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Chennault v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 796 F.2d 465, 467, 469-71 (Fed. Cir. 1986), the appellant was fired for poor performance. The Navy performance regulation recited that it had been approved by OPM, but the Navy did not offer independent evidence of that approval. The AJ approved the action and the Board reversed, determining that the Navy's evidence was insufficient on the point of OPM approval. On remand, the AJ reversed the decision. There was no proof of OPM approval of the appraisal system. The Navy then appealed. Between the time of the Board's first decision and its second decision after appeal of the region's decision following remand from the Board in the first decision, the Board issued another decision with a similar issue and an opposite result. It made no mention of <span class="Italic">Chennault</span>, and implied that an agency regulation reciting OPM approval was sufficient. Then the Board decided <span class="Italic">Chennault II</span>, finding no additional proof that the Navy regulation was sufficient. The Board cited the decision that it had issued in the interim. Neither the interim decision nor <span class="Italic">Chennault II</span> made any suggestion of a reason for the abrupt about-face in position. The case went to court, where it was argued that the Board was bound by its first decision under law of the case doctrine; alternatively, it was barred from reversing legal direction by <span class="Italic">stare decisis</span>, the notion that the law, once formed, remains so formed until changed for good (and explicit) reasons. The arguments were to no avail, however, for the court sustained the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One of petitioner's contentions is that the first full Board decision, ruling the Navy regulation insufficient proof, is the law of the case which had to be followed by the full Board in the second decision (now on appeal to us). But, all else aside, the doctrine of law of the case includes as an exception the situation where "controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to such issues."... &#8197;Here, the full Board had decided [<span class="Italic">Campbell v. VA</span>, 25 MSPR 556 (1985)] diametrically contrary to the position stated in the first full Board order in this case, and <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> then became the controlling authority for the MSPB. It cannot be the rule that the Board could decide <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> as it did but later, in this current case, had to follow the first <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> order even though the Board had itself decided in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> that earlier position was wrong.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are next urged to set aside the Board's decision here because it departed from the former decision in the first <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> order without explanation or rationale. True, there is a general principle that administrative agencies should not depart from their prior precedents without some indication of the reason for the change... but the underlying ground of that principle is that the reviewing court should be able to understand the basis of the agency's action and so may judge the consistency of that action with the agency's general mandate....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, we have no difficulty whatever in assessing why the summary remarks made in the first <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> order were not followed when the Board had actually to <span class="Italic">decide</span> the precise issue in <span class="Italic">Campbell</span>. The Board obviously felt that the earlier observations were hasty and mistaken, and that there was no reason to reject, as proof, a formal agency regulation stating explicitly and officially that OPM had approved that agency's performance appraisal system. That would appear to be a top-level showing of OPM approval, fully probative and acceptable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a word, we think the full Board was quite mistaken, in its first <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> order, in suggesting that <span class="Italic">Griffin</span> precluded reliance on the Navy regulation. <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> corrected that error and the second <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> followed suit. The Board could well have been more meticulous in spelling out why it disavowed its earlier <span class="Italic">Chennault</span> observation, but that is not a valid reason for now overturning its current position....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Another commercial dispute, <span class="Italic">Ad Hoc Shrimp Trade Action Committee v. United States</span>, 596 F.3d 1365, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2010), found the court stating:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board recognized that the separation of Mr. Lentz's claim into multiple cases was confusing and unclear, but did not determine whether the separation resulted in harmful error. The Court has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Administrative Procedure Act, which governs the proceedings of administrative agencies and related judicial review, establishes a scheme of reasoned decisionmaking.
