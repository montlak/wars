<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-144"><span class="space">7.</span> Employees in Confidential, Policy-Making, Policy-Determining Positions; Presidential Appointee</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Among the categories of excluded employees lacking Board appeal rights are confidential or policy-making employees, or those appointed by the President. The statute establishes the exemption, 5 USC 7511(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This subchapter does not apply to an employee--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;whose appointment is made by and with the advice and consent of the Senate;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character by--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;the President for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;the Office of Personnel Management for a position that the Office has excepted from the competitive service; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(C)&#x2003;the President or the head of an agency for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;whose appointment is made by the President.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 213.3301 (2022) establishes the process followed by agencies to appoint positions that are "of a confidential or policy-determining nature" and within the excepted service. 5 CFR 752.401(d) (2022) excludes from adverse action coverage:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;An employee whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character by the President for a position that the President has excepted from the competitive service; the Office of Personnel Management for a position that the Office has excepted from the competitive service (Schedule C); or the President or the head of an agency for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(3)&#x2003;A Presidential appointee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 752.401(c)(7) (2022) provides adverse action protections for "An employee who was in the competitive service at the time his or her position was first listed under Schedule...C of the excepted service and who still occupies that position." Special rules apply to career SES appointees who receive presidential appointments while they occupy career SES positions. [Refer to this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-142.html#sec1-141">Senior Executive Service</a>"; and Chapter 6, "<a href="0100-2023-13-158.html#sec6-157">Senior Executive Service</a>"; and refer to Broida and Davis's <span class="Italic">Senior Executive Service Legal Guide</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/09SESG.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2009).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The policy considerations involving excluded employees were explained, <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Peace Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 225, 231-32 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These arguments focus on the term "policy-making"; they do not address the other exclusionary terms of "confidential" or "policy-advocating." In any event, an excessive preoccupation with the meaning of each term in isolation distorts the purpose of the exception found at 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(B)(i). These terms are, after all, only a shorthand way of describing positions to be filled by so-called "political appointees." As pointed out <span class="Italic">supra</span>, there are sound policy reasons for having positions excepted from the usual civil service protections, including Special Counsel jurisdiction. In executing administration goals, the President is entitled to certain noncareer policy aides who can be brought into the civil service and moved out without the usual procedural protections. These positions can be identified by their relationship to the President or the administration officials in furthering the goals of the President. That Congress saw fit to make Country Directors subject to appointment by the President is ample evidence of the confidential, policy-making, or policy-advocating nature of the positions. The actual duties of the position as delineated in the Country Director position description, and as described by Peace Corps staff, merely reinforce the conclusion that they are "non-covered" positions outside Special Counsel jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A presidential appointee, a U.S. Marshal, could not invoke Board appellate jurisdiction. An employee whose appointment is made with the advice and consent of the Senate is specifically excluded by 5 USC 7511(b)(1) from the category of employees covered by Board appellate procedures.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The 1990 Due Process Amendments...do not apply to an employee whose position has been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character by the President or the head of an agency for a position excepted from the competitive service by statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7511(b)(2)(C). The agency asserts that this provision excludes the Executive Director position from coverage under the Due Process Amendments because the appellant's appointment to the position of Executive Director was effected under 29 USC 783, which states, in relevant part, that the agency</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">may appoint, without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions of chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of such title relating to the classification and General Schedule pay rates, an Executive Director to assist the National Council to carry out its duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this appeal, the administrative judge relied on OPM's interpretation of the Due Process Amendments. In particular, the administrative judge found support for her decision in an OPM regulation, effective April 9, 1993, to be codified at 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12), stating that adverse action appeal rights were not afforded to</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an employee whose agency or position ha[d] been excluded from the appointing provisions of title 5, United States Code, by separate statutory authority in the absence of any provision to place the <span id="Page_225"></span>employee within the coverage of chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191 at 13,193 (Mar. 10, 1993). In comments on the new regulation that it published in the Federal Register, OPM stated that such employees were excluded from coverage "whether or not they [were] specifically listed as excluded in the [Due Process Amendments]." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13,191.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The OPM regulation applies, by its terms, to positions that have been excluded generally "from the appointing provisions of title 5." In its comment on the regulation, OPM stated that its new regulation was intended to clarify that "a legislative exclusion from the appointing requirements of title 5" was "<span class="Italic">required</span> for a statutory exclusion from chapter 75." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 13,192 (emphasis added). However, 29 USC 783 provides only that the National Council may appoint an Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in <span class="Italic">the competitive service</span>" (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 29 USC 783 allows the agency to appoint an Executive Director without regard to title 5 provisions governing appointments in the competitive service, it does not exclude the appointment of the Executive Director from the appointing requirements of title 5 in general. Excluding a position from appointing requirements applicable to the competitive service, as was done by 29 USC 783, means only that the position is in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 2103(a) ("the 'excepted service' consists of those civil service positions which are not in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service"). Indeed, many excepted service positions are covered by chapter 75 of title 5<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Pennington v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 57 MSPR 8, 9-10 (1993). Thus, the OPM regulation relied on by the administrative judge does not support a finding that the appellant's position is excluded from coverage under the Due Process Amendments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because Sandra Swift Parrino, who served as the agency's chairperson at the time the agency appointed the appellant to the Executive Director position, stated in an affidavit that she determined the position of Executive Director to be of a policy-determining, policymaking, and policy-advocating character. Although Ms. Parrino, as the agency head, was authorized to make such a determination under 5 USC 7511(b)(2)(C), she failed to state when she made this purported determination or in what form the alleged determination was made, e.g., in writing, orally, or neither in writing nor orally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Parrino declared in her affidavit that vacancy announcements and position descriptions for the Executive Director position, including the position description in effect when the agency appointed the appellant to that position, embodied her determination that the position was of a policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Although the record evidence includes position descriptions and vacancy announcements for the Executive Director position that refer to policy-related duties, these documents show, at most, that the agency could appropriately have determined that the position was policy-determining. The documents do not establish that such a determination was in fact made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Parrino further averred that she advised the appellant that, upon acceptance of the Executive Director position, the appellant "would be giving up her career status with the civil service and would thereafter serve at the pleasure of the National Council." A statement such as this might, under the proper circumstances, indicate that Parrino had determined that the Executive Director position was of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. However, in a declaration made under penalty of perjury, the appellant denied that Ms. Parrino or any other person ever made such a statement to her. Furthermore, even if Ms. Parrino made the statement described in her declaration, that statement would not appear to be sufficient to establish that the determination in question had been made. As we noted above, the appellant was not covered by 5 USC 7511(a) when she was first appointed to the Executive Director position, and she therefore could be said to have served initially at the pleasure of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A jurisdictional hearing is not warranted absent an allegation of facts that, if proven, would establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of an action that is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nortz v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 47 MSPR 526, 533 (1991). We find that, although 5 USC 7511(b)(2)(C) does not require that determinations described therein be made in any specific form, fairness and due process considerations require that any determination as to the character of the position at issue here have been made in such a manner as to put the appellant on notice of the nature of the position she was considering accepting. The appellant has raised nonfrivolous allegations that the agency head did not determine that the Executive Director position was of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character, or that, if such a determination was made, it was not conveyed to her in such a way as to place her on notice of the determination before she accepted the position. These allegations cannot be resolved on the basis of the documentary evidence. Thus, we conclude that the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">King v. Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384, 1388-89 (Fed. Cir. 1996), affirmed the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The OPM contends that the statute that creates the Executive Director's position, 29 USC 783(a)(1), has the effect of excluding Briggs from the expansive definition of "employee" found in section 7511(a) because it allows the Council to appoint the Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions...of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates." Briggs contends, in response, that the OPM has not succeeded in refuting the Board's basic conclusion that the two sections alleged to conflict, 783(a)(1) and 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), are easily reconciled and plainly confer Board jurisdiction over Briggs' appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recently had occasion to address a similar question regarding the effect of the Due Process Amendments on the Board's jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Todd v. MSPB</span>, 55 F.3d 1574 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The appellant in <span class="Italic">Todd</span>, like Briggs, fell within the definition of employee at section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1576 &#x0026; n.3. The statute under which Todd was hired, however, gave the agency the option to employ her "without regard to the Civil Service Act and rules and the following:...(4) sections...7511, 7512, and 7701 of Title 5."[4] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1577 (quoting 20 USC 241(a)). We affirmed the Board's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over Todd's appeal, reasoning that "there is no repugnancy between the general rule at section 7511(a)(1)(C) that excepted service employees with two years of continuous service have appeal rights and the specific exception to this rule at section 241(a) which permits an agency to deny the appeal rights to a narrow category of personnel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In sum, we concluded that, due to the enactment of the Due Process Amendments, "Todd would now qualify to appeal a section 7512 adverse action but for the limitation on her appeal rights found in section 241(a)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Briggs suggests, quite correctly, that we should apply the analytic framework of <span class="Italic">Todd</span> to determine her appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Section 7511 of title 5 defines the categories of federal employees that are eligible to appeal adverse actions to the Board; section 7512 defines appealable adverse actions; and section 7701 outlines the Board's appellate procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we noted above, section 783(a), the statute under which Briggs was hired, gives the Council the option to employ an Executive Director "without regard to the provisions of Title 5 governing appointments in the competitive service, or the provisions...of such title relating to classification and General Schedule pay rates." Notably absent from the enumerated parts of title 5 that the Council may disregard in employing the Executive Director are those dealing with appeal rights in chapters 75 and 77, the very parts of title 5 from which Briggs has, according to the OPM, purportedly been excluded. As the text of section 783(a) makes plain, Congress gave the Council the option of disregarding only certain parts of title 5. To interpret the section as giving the Council the option to disregard additional, unenumerated parts of title 5 would run afoul of the maxim "<span class="Italic">expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>," and in a domain where, as <span class="Italic">Todd</span> amply demonstrates, Congress knows how to exempt a civil service position from the protections found in chapters 75 and 77 of title 5 if it so desires. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence &#x0026; Coordination Unit</span>, 507 U.S. 163, 168, 113 S. Ct. 1160, 1163, 122 L. Ed.2d 517 (1993) ("Thus, the Federal Rules do address in Rule 9(b) the question of the need for greater particularity in pleading certain actions, but do not include among the enumerated actions any reference to complaints alleging municipal liability under &#x00A7; 1983. <span class="Italic">Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</span>."); <span class="Italic">Albright v. United States</span>, 10 F.3d 790, 793 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">United States v. Lopez</span>, 938 F.2d 1293, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 1991). We decline to construe the statute in this manner. Section 783(a) does not remove the Executive Director's position from the ambit of title 5's procedural protections for removal. The OPM's implementing regulation at 5 CFR 752.401(d)(12), to the extent that it calls for a result contrary to the plain meaning of section 783(a), has no force or effect in this case. <span class="Italic">See generally Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984) ("If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."). The Board thus has jurisdiction over Briggs' appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does not show, however, whether the appellant's position is excluded from coverage under the relevant part of chapter 75 by 5 USC 7511(b) or any other relevant authority. The only source of any such exclusion on which the agency appears to have relied is 5 USC 7511(b)(2), which excludes positions in the excepted service that have "been determined to be of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating character" by the appropriate official. If the position was excepted from the competitive service by the President, <span id="Page_226"></span>the determination described above must be made by the President; if it was excepted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the determination must be made by that agency; and, if it was excepted by statute, the determination must be made either by the President or by the head of the employing agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record in this appeal does not indicate whether the appellant's former position was excepted from the competitive service by the President, by OPM, or by statute. In fact, it does not even indicate specifically whether the position was excepted from the competitive service at all. Furthermore, even if the position was excepted, the record does not show that the appropriate official or agency made the determination described in 5 USC 7511(b)(2). Although the record includes a written declaration in which the agency head stated that the appellant "occupied a high level, confidential position with broad responsibilities for managing the Region and making and advocating policy with regard to bankruptcy issues," that declaration--even if otherwise sufficient under 5 USC 7511(b)(2)--was made too late to affect the appellant's rights under chapter 75. A determination under 5 USC 7511(b)(2) is not adequate unless it is made before the employee is appointed to the position. <span class="Italic">See Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331, 335 (1994). Not only was the declaration cited above not made until after the appellant's appointment, but it was not made until after the appellant had been removed, had sought corrective action from OSC, and had even filed this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Stanley v. DOJ</span>, 423 F.3d 1271 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Whistleblower Protection Act, discussed in <a href="0100-2023-20-001.html#sec13-1">Chapter 13</a>, also excludes individuals in policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions. <span class="Italic">O'Brien v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B), employees in "covered position[s]" are protected from reprisal for making protected disclosures by the WPA. A "covered position" is any position in the competitive service, a career Senior Executive Service position, or a position in the excepted service,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">but does not include any position which is, prior to the personnel action--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;excepted from the competitive service because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B). Because the appellant's position is in the excepted service, the question is whether it was placed there because of its "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below that the appellant's position was exempted from the coverage of the WPA because of the confidential nature of positions at the agency. The appellant's responsibilities as Document Manager required him to become familiar with agency documents, including grand jury materials, organize them, and index them. As the administrative judge noted, the appellant signed on November 17, 1991, a memorandum addressed to all agency support staff and entitled "Grand Jury Secrecy" which stated that persons with proper access to information concerning proceedings before the grand jury are individually responsible for maintaining the secrecy of such information. The memorandum further stated that the relevant provisions of Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure were attached and that the appellant should take all necessary steps to insure they were enforced. Also, the appellant signed on November 18, 1991, a non-disclosure agreement which stated that, by accepting employment, the appellant had a fiduciary relationship with the agency and the Special Division of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, that his position afforded him repeated and continuous access to confidential information, and that he agreed not to disclose information regarding, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, information relating to the operation of the agency, investigative material, and grand jury information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute authorizing the Independent Counsel to appoint additional personnel specifies that the appointments "are exempted from the competitive service," but does not state or even suggest the reason for the exemption. 28 USC 594(c). The legislation creating the agency, along with subsequent amendments, includes several provisions to protect the confidentiality of its proceedings while allowing for oversight of the agency. Nevertheless, nothing in the legislation or its legislative history implies that Congress placed the positions in the excepted service because of its specific concerns for the confidentiality and security of the information gathered by the agency and its proceedings or because of the confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character of the positions. Nor does the language and legislative history of 28 USC ch. 40 persuade us that the WPA should be applied to the agency in any way different from its application to other government entities dealing with sensitive matters. As detailed below, the WPA specifically excludes agencies because they deal with sensitive information, either through an express exclusion of such agencies from the law; or by expressly excluding disclosures from the law's definition of protected disclosures as it does in the case of the FBI, CIA, and a few others. The law does neither with regard to offices of an Independent Counsel, and, furthermore, does not with regard to a plethora of executive branch agencies and offices that handle civil and criminal investigations closely connected, as is the WPA, to the desire for government accountability and our constitutional system of checks and balances. Thus, there are no restrictions on the statutory Offices of Inspectors General found in every cabinet agency, which often investigate high ranking government executives, including cabinet officials, for example, in the Department of Defense or the Department of Justice, including its Office of Public Integrity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, we see no indication in the WPA itself or its legislative history that the appellant's position should be exempted from coverage....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA addresses the problem of agencies that deal with sensitive information in two ways: By excluding the agency itself from coverage of the WPA; and by excluding certain disclosures from the definition of "protected disclosure."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress also provided for the protection of confidentiality in 5 USC 2302(b)(8) by providing that a disclosure that is prohibited by law or Executive Order is not protected by the WPA unless it is made to the Special Counsel, the Inspector General of an agency, or another employee designated by the head of the agency to receive such a disclosure. 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(B). We note that 28 USC ch. 40 protects numerous kinds of documents from disclosure. 28 USC 592(e), 592(g)(4), 593(b)(4), 594(h), (k). The WPA's exclusion of certain disclosures from its protection indicates that Congress considered the harm resulting from revealing certain kinds of information and weighed that harm against the benefits of encouraging the behavior protected by the WPA. Thus, an additional exclusion based on the same considerations need not be read into other provisions of the WPA.... The exclusion for certain confidential information at 5 USC 2302(b)(8) adequately protects the sensitive documents in the hands of the Independent Counsel without affecting an employee's ability to cooperate in an investigation of waste, fraud, and abuse at the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously considered the meaning of the language of 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B)(i). In <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Peace Corps</span>, 31 MSPR 225 (1986), the Board considered whether a Country Director position in the Peace Corps was excluded from coverage under the WPA because of the position's confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. Just as in this appeal, there is nothing in the statutory language authorizing the appointment to the Country Director position describing the position in confidential or policy-making terms. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 230. The Board determined that the position was excluded from coverage under the WPA because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character as evidenced by the fact that Congress gave the authority to make Country Director appointments to the President. The Board stated that "[t]hese positions can be identified by their relationship to the President or the administration officials in furthering the goals of the President," and the fact that "Congress saw fit to make Country Directors subject to appointment by the President is ample evidence of the confidential, policy-making, or policy-advocating nature of the positions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 232. The Board further stated that "an excessive preoccupation with the meaning of each term in isolation distorts the purpose of the exception found at 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B)(i)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 231.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the Independent Counsel has appointment power for every position at the agency. 28 USC 594(c). While every position may be confidential in the sense of access to confidential information, we cannot believe that every position at the agency has a confidential relationship with the Independent Counsel or a "policy-making or policy-advocating" function. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the appellant's position in particular requires a confidential relationship with the Independent Counsel or is policy-making and policy-advocating.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also stated in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Peace Corps</span> that the terms "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy-advocating" are a shorthand way of describing positions to be filled by "political appointees." 31 MSPR at 231. The Country Director position in that case was subject to appointment by the President, who had delegated his authority to the Director of the Peace Corps. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 229 n.12. The Board found that this delegation was of no consequence and that the authority <span id="Page_227"></span>resting in the President was sufficient to show that the position was a "political appointment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 230-31. Here, the appellant's position was subject by statute to appointment by the Independent Counsel and there are no indications that the appointment was intended to be, or in fact was, made with any political considerations in mind. We agree with the appellant that his position, which he applied for in response to an employment advertisement in the Washington Post, is not comparable to a political appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Positions described as "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating" at 5 USC 7511(b)(2) are excluded from the coverage of 5 USC ch. 75, subch. II. The legislative history of the CSRA describes the exception at 5 USC 7511(b)(2) for positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character as an extension of the exception for Schedule C positions and Non-Career Executive Assignment positions confirmed by the Senate and states that "[t]he concept of tenure and protection against dismissal is contrary to the confidential relationship between incumbent and supervising official, and the commitment to Administration policy objectives, required by those filling such positions." S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 48 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2770. The record here is devoid of evidence that the appellant's position involves such a relationship. Rather, the evidence that the appellant's position is "confidential" consists of the "Grand Jury Secrecy" memorandum and the non-disclosure agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that a position may be designated excepted service for many reasons. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations regarding the excepted service that indicate some of them. Although the provisions of 5 CFR part 213, subpart C do not apply to the agency here because the positions were designated as excepted by 28 USC 594(c) and not by OPM, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bey-Ali v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 51 MSPR 207, 210 (1991), these regulations provide some guidance. 5 CFR part 213. Positions designated as excepted by OPM fall into one of three categories, Schedule A, Schedule B, and Schedule C. Schedule A includes positions not of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is impracticable to examine, a number of subcategories of positions within the entire Federal service, and positions in temporary organizations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.3101, 213.3199. Schedule B includes positions not of a confidential or policy-determining character for which it is not practicable to hold an examination and various student positions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 213.3201, 213.3202. Schedule C, the only category to include positions of a confidential or policy-determining character, authorizes appointments to positions "which are policy-determining or which involve a close and confidential working relationship with the head of the agency or other key appointed officials." 5 CFR 213.3301. This regulation, while using the same language as 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B), adopts a narrow definition of a position of "a confidential or policy-determining nature," i.e., involving "a close and confidential working relationship with the head of an agency or other key appointed officials." 5 CFR 213.3301(a). The word "confidential" in that regulation does not necessarily refer to matters that are to be kept secret but instead to the nature of the relationship between the employee and the head of the agency or other key appointed officials.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further support for the notion that the terms of the exception found at 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B)(i) are a shorthand way of describing "political appointee" positions can be found in the legislative history of the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments to the CSRA, which extended adverse action appeal rights to a broader class of excepted service employees than had previously been covered. 5 USC 7511. The Act retained the exclusions found at 5 USC 7511(b), however, and the legislative history describes excepted service employees as those in either Schedule A, Schedule B, or Schedule C and states that Schedule C positions of a confidential or policy-determining character are "political appointees who are specifically excluded from coverage under 5 USC 7511(b)." H.R. Rep. No. 328, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 4-5 (1989), reprinted in 1990 USCCAN 698-99. Although the Board in certain cases has considered the question of who is excluded under 5 USC 7511(b) as a "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making or policy-advocating" employee, it did not resolve those cases on that issue. <span class="Italic">See Thompson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 61 MSPR 364, 368 (1994); <span class="Italic">Briggs v. National Council on Disability</span>, 60 MSPR 331, 333-36 (1994). Both 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B)(i) and 5 USC 7511(b) use the phrase "confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating" to exclude certain positions. We know of no reason why Congress would intend that it be interpreted differently in each of the two parts of Title 5. In fact, 5 USC 7511(b) excludes agencies that are covered by the WPA, e.g., the Tennessee Valley Authority, evidencing an intention by Congress that the WPA be more inclusive than 5 USC 7511(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note here that Assistant United States Attorneys (AUSAs) may have access to similar sensitive information. Yet, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left open the question of whether they are afforded appeal rights under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C) while acknowledging that the Attorney General's authority to appoint and remove AUSAs under 28 USC 542 may conflict with 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(C). In dicta, the court stated that the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments afforded AUSAs a right to appeal personnel actions listed at 5 USC 7512. <span class="Italic">See Gosnell v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 69 F.3d 1138, 1139-40 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the legislative history of the 1994 amendments to the WPA indicates that Congress was dissatisfied with the Board's narrow interpretation of the statute which led to gaps in coverage. In its discussion of the expansion of the definition of "agency" in 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(C) to include a government corporation, the House Committee warned against technically rigid criteria and directed that "government corporation" should be broadly construed. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 23. The 1994 amendments added the requirement that the designation of a position as excepted because of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character must be made "prior to the personnel action" at issue. 5 USC 2302(a)(2)(B). This change strengthened the protection afforded to an employee who engages in protected activity and indicates a general legislative intent to prefer inclusion over exclusion and to support an interpretation to include employees in the coverage under the WPA rather than to exclude them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The exclusion from Board protections of confidential employees was emphasized in a whistleblower reprisal case, through a concurring opinion of Member Rose, <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Dept. of Interior</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CHAMBERS_TERESA_C_DC_1221_04_0616_M_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_566514.pdf">116 MSPR 17</a>, 63-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 2011 MSPB 7 (2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee whose position has been excepted from the competitive service because it is "of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character" is excluded from statutory tenure and appeal-rights coverage. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(2). The decision to except a position from the competitive service on one of these grounds may be made by the President, the Office of Personnel Management, or the head of an agency, <span class="Italic">id</span>., and once made is the kind of "discretionary judgment call" that is not reviewable by the Board, <span class="Italic">Stanley v. Department of Justice</span>, 423 F.3d 1271, 1273 (Fed. Cir. 2005). For the section 7511(b)(8) exclusion to be effective as to a particular individual, the appropriate official must designate the position in question as confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating before the individual is appointed. <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of Justice</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 364, 369 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">What makes the present case unique is that, despite the appellant's status as head of an agency, she was a tenured employee in the competitive service with the right to appeal her removal to the Board. The agency has never argued that the position of Park Police Chief was designated as confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating before the appellant was appointed to it, and the record indicates that in fact such a designation was never made. In other words, the appellant had the same rights <span class="Italic">vis-&#x00E0;-vis</span> her employment as Chief of the Park Police--including the right to appeal her removal and to claim protection from whistleblower retaliation, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7701(c)(2)(B)--that rank and file civil servants have with respect to their employment. The "discretionary judgment call" to give her these rights was made by others, not by the Board.</p>
