<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-39"><span class="space">a.</span> Revised Proposals; Conditional Approval by Agency</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although a union may submit a negotiability appeal, it may instead choose not to do so and submit altered proposals to the employer. If the employer refuses to consider those proposals and asserts that it is doing so because it believes the union has waived its bargaining rights, the refusal constitutes a failure to bargain in good faith. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 9 FLRA 178, 179 (1982). <span class="Italic">POPA and Dept. of Commerce, PTO</span>, 48 FLRA 546, 547-48 (1993), commented on revised proposals:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority will not consider a modification of a disputed proposal or provision where the modified proposal or provision has not been the subject of an agency allegation of nonnegotiability....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that nothing precludes a union, following an agency head's disapproval of collective bargaining agreement provisions, from filing a negotiability petition while continuing to pursue negotiations with the agency to reach agreement on revised agreement provisions. If the continuing negotiations are successful, the petition for review may be withdrawn. However, if the negotiations are not successful, the parties may still receive a decision as to the negotiability of the agreement provisions contained in the petition for review....</p>
<p class="noindent">The union may withdraw a negotiability appeal. It may file another appeal after it submits, and the agency rejects as nonnegotiable, a proposal that is substantively different from the proposal originally considered by the agency, <span class="Italic">ACT Heartland Chap. and DOD, Iowa NG</span>, 56 FLRA 236, 237 (2000):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where a union has withdrawn its appeal as to a disputed provision, substantively revised it and resubmitted it to the agency as a proposal, and timely appealed after an agency's refusal to provide, as requested, an allegation of nonnegotiability as to the revised proposal, the appeal as to the revised proposal is properly before the Authority....<span class="Italic">&#8197;</span><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Agricultural Employees and</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant</span> <span class="Italic">Health Inspection Service, Hyattsville, Maryland,</span> 48 FLRA 599, 602-03 (1993) (appeal timely, although agency only objected to sentence previously declared nonnegotiable, because modified proposal was substantively different from previous proposal); <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 15 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois,</span> 43 FLRA 1165, 1167-68 (1992)....</p>
<p class="noindent">The inability to resurrect a negotiability appeal earlier filed and withdrawn, with but minor changes to the earlier proposal, was illustrated in <span class="Italic">IBEW Local 1002 and Southwestern Power Admin</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-152.html">71 FLRA 779</a>, 779-80 (2020) (recon. den., 71 FLRA 930 (2020)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The petition indicates that the Union had previously filed a related petition concerning fifteen proposals, docketed as case number 0&#8209;NG&#8209;3388. In that case, the Union requested a written allegation of nonnegotiability in a letter dated May 11, 2017. The Agency provided a written allegation declaring the proposals nonnegotiable in a letter dated October 26, 2017. On November 22, 2017, the Union appealed the Agency's allegation by filing the petition in 0&#8209;NG&#8209;3388. The parties then engaged in mediation with the Authority's Collaboration and Alternative Dispute Resolution (CADR) program. Subsequently, the Union requested to withdraw its petition without reserving its right to refile that petition. The Authority granted the withdrawal request.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Later, the Union presented the Agency with the two proposals at issue and requested a written allegation of nonnegotiability. On March 5, 2019, the Agency provided a written allegation stating that it had previously declared the two proposals nonnegotiable in the October 26, 2017 letter. In response, the Union filed this petition on March 19, 2019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When a union has requested a written allegation from the agency concerning the duty to bargain, the time limit for filing a petition for review of negotiability issues is fifteen days after service of an agency's allegation of nonnegotiability on a union.[6] The time limit for filing a petition may not be extended or waived by the Authority.[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, where a petition for review concerns a dispute as to a proposal that is not substantively changed from one that had previously been alleged to be nonnegotiable by an agency, the effect of the petition is to seek review of the previous allegation.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of EEOC Locals No. 216</span>, 71 FLRA 300, 302 (2019) (<span class="Italic">AFGE EEOC</span>) (Member DuBester concurring, in part, and dissenting, in part); <span class="Italic">NFFE, Local 422</span>, 50 FLRA 541, 542 (1995) (<span class="Italic">NFFE</span>); <span class="Italic">NAGE, R1&#8209;100</span>, 41 FLRA 752, 752-54 (1991) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the order directed the Union to show that the proposals in the instant case were substantively changed from two proposals in 0-NG-3388. As the order explained, if the proposals were not substantively changed, then the Union was seeking review of the Agency's October 26, 2017 declaration of nonnegotiability. In this regard, the Authority has held that "amended proposals that involve the same matters and substance with only <span class="Italic">minor</span> modifications do not restart the timeline for filing a petition for review."[10] The Union's response to the order does not address the substance of the proposals, let alone explain or otherwise provide evidence to show that the proposals in the instant petition were substantively changed from those previously alleged to be nonnegotiable. Therefore, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the proposals contained in the instant petition are substantively changed from those in the 0&#8209;NG-3388 petition.[11]</p>

<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_431"></span>It follows that the Union's petition in this case essentially seeks review of the Agency's October 26, 2017 written allegation of nonnegotiability. The Union neither filed the instant petition within fifteen days of receiving this written allegation, nor retained the right to refile its earlier petition. Accordingly, the Union's right to file a petition for review concerning the proposals was extinguished on July 2, 2019, when its withdrawal request was granted by the Authority.[12]</p>

<p class="noindent">To determine when a new negotiability appeal must be filed for a successor proposal, there must be substantive revision.

<p class="noindent">An example of amended proposals that were but variants of the originals--in essence the same proposals addressing the same matters and substance--and that did not extend the time for filing a negotiability appeal, is <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of EEOC Locals and EEOC</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-49.html">71 FLRA 300</a>, 300-02 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring and dissenting in part):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties are negotiating the Agency's Table of Penalties (TOP) and, by August 2018, had agreed on all but three of the Union's proposals regarding the table.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On August 3, the Agency declared the three proposals "non-negotiable." On August 27, the Union "withdrew" the three original proposals and presented the Agency with three amended proposals, claiming that they were "new[&#8197;]." On September 5, the Agency responded that it had previously declared the proposals non-negotiable on August 3. The Union filed this petition on September 6, based on the proposals that it provided the Agency on August 27.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 3, the Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication issued an order directing the Union to show cause why its petition should not be dismissed as untimely. The Union filed a timely response to the Authority's order on October 17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The Union's petition is untimely.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (Statute) and the Authority's regulations require that a negotiability petition for review be filed no later than fifteen days after an agency declares proposals to be non-negotiable.[7] This time limit may not be extended or waived by the Authority.[8]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.21(a)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.23(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that the Agency declared the Union's original proposals to be non-negotiable on August 3. It also is not disputed that the Union did not file a petition for review concerning the Agency's August 3 declaration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that, if a party withdraws and amends proposals and the amended proposals <span class="Italic">substantively</span> change the original proposals,[10] then the agency must respond anew if the union requests a declaration of non-negotiability.[11] Further, that declaration triggers a new fifteen-day period in which the union may file a petition for review.[12] But, the Authority has held that amended proposals that involve the same matters and substance with only <span class="Italic">minor</span> modifications do not restart the timeline for filing a petition for review.[13] Here, the Union's August 27 proposals contain only <span class="Italic">minor</span> modifications that do not differ in any meaningful respect from the proposals that the Agency declared non-negotiable on August 3.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union's amended proposal #4/8 does not substantively change the original proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Original Proposal #4/8: The Table of Penalties shall not be applied to any discipline occurring before the training in paragraph 1 takes place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Amended Proposal #4/8: The Table of Penalties is not retroactive and shall not be applied to any discipline occurring before the training in paragraph 1 takes place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The language of the Union's amended proposal only adds that the TOP is "not retroactive," which is already implicit in the original proposal, and both proposals state that the table of penalties would not be applied to any discipline that occurred prior to training. As the amended proposal is only a minor modification to the original proposal, the amendment did not restart the timeline for filing a petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's amended proposal #7 does not substantively change original proposal #7.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Original Proposal #7: A subsequent penalty under TOP applies to disciplinary action currently appropriately placed as a matter of record in an employee's electronic official personnel folder (eOPF) and for which the employee was informed in writing and had an opportunity to dispute. A previous action will not be relied upon if it has been withdrawn, expired, not upheld by a higher-level agency official and/or third party or has a challenge pending. In assessing penalties, consideration will be given to the freshness of the time frame of previous offenses; past discipline occurred years, for example 3 years, before the current action and that involved unrelated offenses may be discounted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Amended Proposal #7: When discipline becomes necessary, the goal is to impose the minimum remedy that can reasonably be expected to correct and improve employee behavior. A previous penalty under TOP can be relied upon for penalty assessment for a subsequent offense where the employee was informed in writing, had an opportunity to dispute, and is a matter of record properly filed in an employee's eOPF. Consideration will be given to the freshness of the timeframe of previous offenses, for example, within three years of the current offense. Similarity to the prior misconduct can be considered in the penalty determination. A previous action will not be relied upon if it has been withdrawn, expired, not upheld by a higher-level agency official and/or third party or has a challenge pending.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While the amended proposal rearranges the ideas from the original proposal and adds one sentence, the amendments do not substantively modify or clarify any ambiguity in the original proposal, which limited the evidence upon which the Agency would be permitted to rely when determining the penalty.[20] Like in <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1786</span>, where the Authority held that the amended proposals were not substantial modifications because the proposals addressed the same matters and substance,[21] here, the amended proposal and the original proposal both address factors to consider in applying the TOP to subsequent disciplinary offenses. Therefore, the clock for filing a petition regarding proposal #7 did not restart.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[21]&#x2003;26 FLRA at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's amended proposal #9 does not substantively change the original #9.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Original Proposal #9: Disciplinary and adverse actions will be in accordance with CBA Article 37 and 38 of the CBA and applicable law, rules and regulations and will be based on just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Amended Proposal #9: The parties agree that discipline and adverse actions will be based on just cause and be consistently applied equitably and promote the efficiency of the Federal Service.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union removed "in accordance with CBA Article 37 and 38 of the CBA and applicable law, rules and regulations" and added that discipline "be consistently applied equitably and promote the efficiency of the federal service." But, both proposals address the same matters and substance--that disciplinary and adverse actions will be based on just cause. Moreover, the Authority has previously held that requirements that discipline be for the "efficiency of the service" and "just cause" are functional equivalents,[24] so the inclusion of the efficiency-of-the-service standard in the amended proposal is not a substantive change. Therefore, the amendments do not rise to level of a substantial modification, and the clock for filing a petition regarding proposal #9 did <span id="Page_432"></span>not restart.[25] The record shows that the Union's three proposals reflect only insubstantial modifications of the proposals alleged by the Agency on August 3 to be nonnegotiable.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[25]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Local 1786</span>, 26 FLRA at 186.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the argument made by the Union in its response to the Authority's order--that it withdrew its August 3 proposals and submitted new proposals on August 27 triggering a new requirement for a declaration of nonnegotiability--is without merit. Section 7117(c)(2) of the Statute requires a petition for review to be filed "on or before the 15th day after the date on which the agency <span class="Italic">first</span> makes the allegation" of nonnegotiability.[26]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[26]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(c)(2) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As we found recently in <span class="Italic">National Weather Service Employees Organization</span>, parties may not extend unilaterally timeframes to which they agreed in a negotiated agreement.[27] That proposition is even more relevant here where the Union attempts to circumnavigate the relatively short timeframes that are established by the Statute[28] and are intended to "expedite" negotiability disputes and achieve resolution "at the earliest practicable date."[29]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under the circumstances of this case, the Union had until August 18, 2018, to file its negotiability petition. It did not do so. Therefore, the petition that it filed on September 6, 2018 is untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">An agency head may review and conditionally approve a proposal based on a stated interpretation of the proposal. The union may then file a negotiability appeal based on its rejection of the interpretation as a condition to the proposal. <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Operations Locals and DHHS, SSA, Dist.
