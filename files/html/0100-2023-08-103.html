<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-102"><span class="space">c.</span> Harmful Error Analysis; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Stephen</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee is terminated as a probationer and without constitutional due process involving notice of the reasons for the termination with an opportunity to respond before a decision has been made, the agency's error in construing the employee as a probationer will result in reversal of the action as constitutionally defective. But, although the situation does not frequently arise, it is essentially immaterial if a tenured employee is terminated as a probationer, as long as the employee received constitutional due process, i.e., notice of the charges (and supporting evidence) against her and a right to reply. In <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672, 680-89 (1991), the agency miscalculated the length of the probationary period and fired the employee <span id="Page_147"></span>just after she completed probation. Revising earlier law, <span class="Italic">Stephen</span> stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency contends that reversal of its action is not warranted for not following those procedures in separating the appellant because the probationary termination procedures it afforded her comported with the "essential requirements of due process"--notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond--under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Educ. v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985). The agency asserts further that the administrative judge erred under <span class="Italic">Handy v. USPS</span>, 754 F.2d 335, 338 (Fed. Cir. 1985), by finding that the agency's procedural error was harmful without determining how the agency's error could likely have affected the outcome before the agency. We conclude, for the reasons below, that the agency's arguments are meritorious.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Supreme Court held in <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>...that the government's failure to provide a tenured public employee with an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an action that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to due process of law. The Court stated the minimum requirements as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essential requirements of due process...are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement.... The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>, an agency's failure to provide a nonprobationary Federal employee with prior notice and an opportunity to present a response, either in person or in writing, to an agency action appealable to the Board that deprives him of his property right in his employment constitutes an abridgement of his constitutional right to minimum due process of law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A competitive service employee who has completed his probationary period, like the appellant in the instant appeal, has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment.... When such an employee is being deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest, the right to minimum due process is "absolute" in the sense that it does not depend on the merits of his claim.... Thus, we conclude that an appealable agency action taken without affording an appellant prior notice of the charges, an explanation of the agency's evidence, and an opportunity to respond, must be reversed because such action violates his constitutional right to minimum due process....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board cannot sustain an agency's decision in any case if the employee "shows harmful error in the application of the agency's procedures in arriving at such decision." Reversal of an action for harmful error is warranted where the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency.... In order to show harmful error under the statute and the Board's regulations, an appellant must "prove that any procedural errors substantially prejudiced his rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision."... Harmful error cannot be presumed. As the...Federal Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Handy</span>, 754 F.2d at 338, a finding that the agency's denial of the employee's right to make an oral reply to a removal action was not harmful error, "[t]he harmful error provision is part of the law and, thus, negates a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule with respect to <span class="Italic">any</span> procedural error." (Emphasis supplied.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's treatment of the issue of harmful error in this appeal was consistent with a line of Board precedent in which the Board held that an agency's application of merely the procedural protections of 5 CFR Part 315, Subpart H, in separating an employee who has completed his probationary period, rather than the greater procedural protections guaranteed under 5 USC Chapters 43 and 75, constitutes harmful error.... This line of Board decisions is in accord with an even longer line of decisions in which the Board held that an agency's complete failure to provide any of the procedural protections guaranteed under 5 USC Chapters 43 and 75 in separating a nonprobationary employee constitutes harmful error....[11]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Of course, however, if a nonprobationary employee, who has a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment, has not received minimum due process, then <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>...applies to require reversal of the agency's action, as noted above. Thus, an agency action effected without affording an employee any of the procedures provided by statute or regulation does not constitute harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), but rather constitutes a violation of constitutional minimum due process under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">No doubt, in many cases where employees are given neither full Chapter 43 or 75 procedural rights, particularly the right to present both a written and an oral reply, there would be grounds for finding harmful error simply because many employees would have colorable defenses or claims. Many other employees would not have colorable defenses or claims, however.... The Board's approach, up to this time, to harmful error, which the administrative judge applied in issuing the initial decision, thus creates considerable risk of doing exactly what Congress sought to avoid in enacting the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978...i.e., reversing agency actions for procedural violations that did not cause harm to the employee. Moreover, the Board's previous approach, as discussed above, is inconsistent with the precedent of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that existed at the time that the initial decision in this appeal was issued. The courts require proof of actual harm resulting from any agency procedural error before an agency's action will be reversed....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), the Board cannot sustain an agency action if the appellant "shows that the decision was not in accordance with law" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). The legislative history of the Reform Act does not shed any light on the meaning of this provision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board first applied the "not in accordance with law" standard in <span class="Italic">Cuellar v. USPS</span>, 8 MSPB 282, 8 MSPR 624 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Cuellar</span>, the Board held that an Office of Personnel Management regulation, which permitted an agency to place an employee on "emergency suspension" without any procedural rights during the advance notice period of a removal action, was invalid and thus the "suspension" was "not in accordance with law" and must also be reversed for "harmful error."...Thereafter, in <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, 15 MSPR 112, the Board distinguished the concept of "harmful error" from "not in accordance with law." The Board stated that "harmful error" applies to "all procedural errors," whereas the "not in accordance with law" standard applies "to other unlawful actions."... The Federal Circuit subsequently provided additional guidance on the "not in accordance with law" standard in <span class="Italic">Handy</span>, 754 F.2d 335. The court stated that the "not in accordance with law" standard "is directed to the decision itself. Was the decision in its entirety in accordance with law?"...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Handy</span> and <span class="Italic">Baracco</span>, we find that an appealable action should also be reversed as "not in accordance with law," even if minimum constitutional due process consistent with <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> was afforded to an appellant and he has not shown harmful error under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), if the action is unlawful in its entirety, i.e., if there is no legal authority for the agency's action....[12] Thus, when an agency has no legal authority for taking an action, such as an "emergency suspension" effected during the advance notice period of a removal action, that action is "not in accordance with law" and must be reversed under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;We conclude that a violation of constitutional minimum due process under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> is not subject to a "not in accordance with law" analysis under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). The Board has previously recognized that, although it lacks the authority to determine the constitutionality of a statute, it has the authority to adjudicate a constitutional challenge to an agency's application of a statute.... Thus, the Board has adjudicated, as an independent affirmative defense, nonprobationary employees' constitutional challenges to appealable actions effected under statute or regulation.... Therefore, regardless of the statutory prohibition of 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C) against actions "not in accordance with law," the Board will not sustain an otherwise authorized action that is taken in violation of a nonprobationary employee's constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board holds that, when an appealable action against a nonprobationary Federal employee has not been effected in accordance with the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of the law under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span>...the action must be reversed because it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further hold that when an appealable action is unlawful in its entirety, i.e., there is no legal authority for the agency's action, the Board will reverse such an action as "not in accordance with law" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). The burden of showing that an action is not in accordance with law lies with the appellant. 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we hold that, when an appealable action against a nonprobationary Federal employee meets the minimum requirements of due process of law under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and the action is lawful in its entirety under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C), the Board will reverse the action for "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A) for failure to provide statutory or regulatory procedures, or alternative procedures provided under a collective bargaining agreement, only when the evidence and argument of record shows that the procedural error was "likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence or cure of the error." 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] . The burden of showing harmful error also lies with the appellant. 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A); 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.4(r)] . The Board's prior decisions reversing agency actions for "harmful error" based solely on an agency's failure to afford employees their statutory or regulatory procedural rights are modified consistent with these holdings.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_148"></span>In reviewing an appellant's allegations of agency procedural error, administrative judges shall determine whether the agency's action comported with the minimum procedures that satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of law under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> and whether the action is lawful in its entirety under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C). If the action does not meet these requirements, then it must be reversed. Administrative judges shall reverse an action for "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A) only when the appellant alleges that the agency committed procedural error, even though the procedures afforded by the agency satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process of law and the action is otherwise lawful in its entirety. Reversal of an action for "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A) is warranted only where the procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant received prior written notice of her proposed separation for alleged unacceptable performance on July 15, 1986, and that she was afforded an opportunity to reply in writing within 5 work days. A July 15, 1986 memorandum signed by the proposing official also states that he advised the appellant on that day that "she would be allowed ample time away from the work center to discuss her situation with appropriate advisors of her choosing." The record reflects that the appellant did not submit a reply, and she was separated on July 28, 1986, 13 days after the issuance of the proposal notice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency's procedures for effecting the appellant's separation for alleged unacceptable performance comported with her constitutional right to minimum due process of law under <span class="Italic">Loudermill</span> because she received notice of the action against her, an explanation of the reasons for the action, and an opportunity to present her response....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that the agency has the legal authority under 5 USC Chapters 43 and 75 to effect the appellant's separation for unacceptable performance. We conclude, therefore, that the agency's action cannot be reversed as "not in accordance with law" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(C).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reversal of the agency's action in this appeal is thus warranted for the agency's procedural error only if the appellant shows that the agency's error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency so as to constitute "harmful error" under 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A). The appellant's failure below to avail herself of the opportunity to submit a written response to the agency's action, and the lack of evidence in the record with regard to the effect of the agency's error upon the outcome of the case before the agency, necessitate a remand for the presentation of evidence and argument on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prove harmful error on remand, the appellant must show that she could not have submitted a written reply in the abbreviated period of time afforded by the agency and that the agency's error likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. Alternatively, she must show that the agency's failure to afford her an opportunity to submit an oral reply, or that any failure to obtain representation by an attorney or other representative in the abbreviated period of time afforded by the agency, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency. The agency, of course, must carry its burden of proof on the merits of its alleged performance-based action under 5 USC Chapters 43 or 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7701(c)(1)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the appellant requested a hearing in her petition for appeal. Because the appeal is within the Board's jurisdiction, she is entitled to her requested hearing on the merits of her appeal.... On remand, the administrative judge shall afford the appellant a hearing, if she so desires, and shall afford the parties the opportunity to submit additional relevant and material evidence and argument on the merits of the appeal, the appellant's affirmative defense of harmful error, and any other affirmative defenses that she may raise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the advance notice provisions of the Reform Act confer a right upon employees to pay for 30 days in all cases not subject to the crime exception of 5 USC 7513(b)(1) or to a valid regulatory exception. We also conclude that the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596(b), authorizes the Board to order an agency to compensate an employee for any loss of pay due to an unwarranted suspension during the advance notice period of an appealable action even when the Board sustains the action appealed. Administrative judges in all future cases in which an agency has not afforded an employee with 30 days' advance notice of an action under the applicable provisions of the Reform Act must direct the agency to amend its records so as to retroactively afford the employee 30 days of back pay regardless of whether the appealed action is sustained.... The Board's prior decisions that sustained an agency's action on the ground that the shortening of the 30 day notice period was not harmful error without ordering the agency to compensate the employee for the lost pay are overruled consistent with this holding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present appeal, the appellant was separated on July 28, 1986, 13 days after she received advance notice of her proposed separation for alleged unacceptable performance, although she was entitled to be retained in a pay status for 30 days regardless of whether the agency took the action under 5 USC Chapter 43 or 75. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 4303(b)(1)(A) and 7513(b)(1). In issuing a new initial decision on remand consistent with this Opinion and Order, the administrative judge shall order the agency to amend its records so as to afford the appellant an additional 17 days of back pay retroactively.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hawkins v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 52 MSPR 686, 691 (1992), summarized <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e note that an agency's failure to afford a nonprobationary Federal employee prior notice of and an opportunity to respond, either in person or in writing, to an appealable agency action constitutes an abridgement of the employee's minimum due process rights and requires reversal of the agency action. <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 680-81, 684. The Board further held in <span class="Italic">Stephen,</span> 47 MSPR at 681-85, that, even where minimal due process requirements are satisfied and the action is lawful in its entirety under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(C), it will reverse the action for harmful error under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(A) for failure to provide statutory or regulatory procedures only when the procedural error was "likely to have caused the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in the absence of the error or cure of the error."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant did not complete probation, there is no constitutional due process or harmful error analysis. OPM regulations, not the constitution, control as to the right to a hearing on marital status or partisan political discrimination or procedural violations involving terminations for preappointment conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Terry v. EEOC</span>, 111 MSPR 258, 261 n.2, 2009 MSPB 77 (2009) (claims of harmful error are not appealable to the Board absent an otherwise appealable action, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Moon v. Dept. of Army,</span> 63 MSPR 412, 420 (1994).); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Tucker v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-315H-11-0313-I-1 (NP (1/6/2012) ("Furthermore, the appellant's argument that the agency deliberately terminated her employment 2 weeks prior to the end of her probationary period, knowing that she lacked Board appeal rights, does not establish jurisdiction."); <span class="Italic">Youngs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 551, 560 (1997) (no automatic reversal for the removal of an employee who was improperly determined not to have completed a trial period under a term appointment; the appellant was provided 30 days advance written notice of the proposed separation and a right to reply, as well as a written notice of the agency's decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The conclusion reached in <span class="Italic">Stephen, permitting a harmful error approach when there is a reply process in the probationary termination,</span> is unfortunate, for most agency officials more readily terminate probationers, as opposed to tenured employees, for minor misconduct, personality issues, miscues, or marginal performance. The use of a harmful error approach throws onto the appellant the burden of proving that the outcome would differ if agency managers who instituted the case, the HR officials and lawyers who reviewed it, and the proposing and deciding officials considered the appellant a tenured employee. A probationer can be fired at will, but the process is such that the discharge is often for an issue that for a tenured employee would lead to lesser discipline, a warning, or imposition of a performance improvement period. The result is that some tenured employees will be dismissed with constitutional safeguards, but without the benefit of the normal hesitancy of an agency to dismiss a tenured employee without proper warnings, an opportunity to improve, or substantial consideration of mitigating factors. Since the Board generally defers to an agency's choice of penalties, an appellant has a difficult time obtaining Board mitigation of an action that might not have occurred had the agency earlier recognized his proper tenure. An appellant was unsuccessful in convincing the Federal Circuit that the agency's initial conclusion that she was a probationer denied her due process when the agency gave the employee an opportunity to respond to the removal proposal and the deciding official conducted a mitigation analysis. <span class="Italic">Aviles-Wynkoop v.
