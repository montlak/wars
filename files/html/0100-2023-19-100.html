<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-96"><span class="space">6.</span> Demotion; Promotion</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Demotion (as a result of a physical impairment) to a job that an employee can perform was a reasonable accommodation and a permissible alternative to removal in <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 10 MSPR 411, 413-14 (1982) ("[t]he presiding official erred in requiring the agency to prove by a preponderance of evidence that demotion to the Scheduling Clerk position was appropriate. The agency need only establish that the demotion was reasonable under the circumstances."). The Board endorsed change to a lower-graded position as a form of accommodation, <span class="Italic">Joe v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 408, 414-16 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the agency should have accommodated her by assigning her to a lower-graded position as required by the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the agency's regulations. We agree that an agency's duty under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to attempt to accommodate a handicapped employee may include searching for vacant positions at a lower grade. In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, EEOC No. 03840005, slip op. at 11 (Sept. 4, 1984), the EEOC stated that "[t]he touchstone for determining whether a particular personnel action or device is appropriate is determined by its reasonableness." Further, the EEOC found that "reasonable accommodation must be a logical adjustment made to a job and/or work environment that enables a qualified handicapped person to perform." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., slip op. at 12. Subsequent EEOC and Board decisions applying the rationale of <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> have not disapproved of an assignment to a lower-graded position as a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roberson v. Stone</span>, EEOC No. 03900079, slip op. at 7-9 (Oct. 30, 1990) (the EEOC found that the agency's attempts to accommodate the employee were sufficient when she refused to accept assignment to an available lower-graded position with retained pay as an accommodation); <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 64-68 (1990) (the agency was not required to assign the appellant from his WG-7 Motor Vehicle Operator position to a vacant WG-6 Motor Vehicle Operator (Dispatcher) position because the appellant did not show that he could perform the essential functions of the WG-6 position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's obligation to accommodate a handicap by assigning an employee to another position has been described as an obligation to <span id="Page_3515"></span>"reassign" the employee. <span class="Italic">See Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986) (an agency must consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee). The Office of Personnel Management's regulations define "reassignment" as "a change of an employee...from one position to another without promotion or demotion." 5 CFR 210.102(b)(12). The EEOC has indicated in its regulations governing Federal sector equal employment opportunity, however, that it does not so limit the meaning of "reassignment." The EEOC's regulations at 29 CFR 1614.203(g) require that an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]ffer to reassign the [handicapped employee] to a funded vacant position...at the same grade or level....&#8197;In the absence of a position at the same grade or level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level shall be required....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This regulation, effective October 1, 1992, is not directly applicable to this appeal....&#8197;However, the EEOC noted in <span class="Italic">McQueen</span>, EEOC No. 03930006, slip op. at 10 n.7, that "the parameters of reassignment set forth in this regulation embody the principles set forth in" its prior case law. Additionally, we recognize that, when an employee is faced with the possibility of removal because she cannot perform the essential functions of her position due to a handicapping condition, an offer of a lower-graded or lower-level position when there are no vacancies at an equivalent grade or level may be reasonable. For these reasons, we find that an agency is required to consider assigning a qualified handicapped employee to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to any responsibility under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to assign the appellant to another position, we find that the agency was obligated to consider assigning her under its own regulations. Under those regulations, the agency may separate an employee, like the appellant in this case, for disability only after efforts to reassign her at the same grade level are unsuccessful and she refuses to accept assignment to a lower grade level. The appellant contends that the agency's failure to offer her a position at a lower grade constituted harmful error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge found that the agency's failure to make a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> offer to assign the appellant to a lower-graded position did not indicate a failure to accommodate. The appellant's supervisor, Michelle Lakins, testified that she discussed with the appellant the possibility of restructuring her position to accommodate her handicap, but that such a restructuring would require assigning a lower grade to the position. She also stated that the appellant informed her that a position at a lower grade would be unacceptable. Based on that testimony, which the administrative judge found more credible than the appellant's testimony, the administrative judge found that the appellant told Lakins that she would not accept a position at a lower grade. Because of the appellant's statement, MEDDAC personnel did not investigate assignments at a lower grade. We note that the appellant also informed Lakins in a July 10, 1989 letter that she desired a "lateral" assignment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency was not required to consider ad infinitum assignments that it had reason to believe the appellant would reject. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 91, 96 (1988); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 35 MSPR 691, 693 n.3 (1988). In light of the appellant's stated refusal to the agency to accept a lower-graded position, we see no reason for the agency to search for one to offer to her. <span class="Italic">See Roberson</span>, EEOC No. 03900079, slip op. at 7-9. Thus, we find that the agency's actions regarding assignment of the appellant to a lower-graded position do not constitute a failure to accommodate her or harmful error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 90, 93 (1985) (agency should have demoted the appellant to the position she previously satisfactorily performed rather than remove her from a position that she was promoted to when the agency should have known that she could not perform the higher-level job); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 13 MSPR 642, 645-46 (1982) (agency reasonably accommodated the appellant by offering him a permanent reassignment to a GS-4 Supply Clerk position, a job that the appellant declined although it was within his medical restrictions, in place of his WG-6 Warehouseman position); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. USPS</span>, 9 MSPR 552, 553 (1982) (appellant was offered and declined reassignment to a lower-graded position to accommodate his disabling condition; the burden on the employee to identify other reasonable accommodation is "especially heavy where, as here, the agency has in good faith attempted some accommodation unsuccessfully and other possible accommodations are not readily apparent"). [Refer to discipline imposed concurrently with accommodation, later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-19-115.html#sec12-111">Alcoholism and Substance Abuse</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An earlier case, <span class="Italic">Edinboro v. DHHS</span>, 33 MSPR 91, 93 (1987), determined that involuntary demotion may not necessarily satisfy the agency's accommodative responsibility:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The general policy of the law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of handicap, and therefore the policy behind reasonable accommodation, is that the federal government will become a model employer of handicapped persons, giving full consideration to their hiring, placement, and advancement. [29 CFR 1614.101].An involuntary demotion does not promote this policy and cannot constitute reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Friel v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 216 (1985) (in an adverse action appeal, imposition of a disciplinary action, such as a demotion, does not constitute reasonable accommodation of a handicap); <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 156, 157-58 (1985) (rejecting agency's contention that handicapping conditions should not be considered in actions under 5 USC Chapter 43)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assignment to a higher-level job is not within the realm of reasonable accommodation. Considered from the perspective of the agency's duty to accommodate a disability through reassignment, <span class="Italic">Clopton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 378-79 (1988), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's duty to accommodate an employee's handicapping condition is not unlimited. <span class="Italic">Pletten v. Department of the</span> Army, 6 MSPB 626, 7 MSPR 13, 17 (1981). All that is required is a "reasonable" attempt by the agency to accommodate the condition. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704; <span class="Italic">Pletten</span>, 7 MSPR at 17. Once an employee establishes her status as a qualified handicapped employee, the employing agency is then required to provide reasonable accommodation unless the agency can show "undue hardship." <span class="Italic">Prewitt,</span> 662 F.2d at 310. <span class="Italic">See also Savage v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 36 MSPR 148 (1988). In this regard, an agency is not required to provide accommodation to a qualified handicapped employee if it can prove that to do so would create an undue administrative or financial burden, or would require substantial modification of job requirements. <span class="Italic">Mackay v. United States Postal Service,</span> 607 F. Supp. 271 (E.D. Pa. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an accommodation for her physical condition, the appellant in this case made a general request for reassignment to any of several higher-graded positions for which she claimed to be qualified. The Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) defines "reassignment" as the change of an employee from one position to another <span class="Italic">without promotion or demotion</span>. FPM Chapter 335, Subchapter 1, 1-2d. With that definition in mind, we find that the agency's obligation under <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>...to consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee does not extend to considering the employee's request to be placed in a higher-graded position, because to do so would give the employee rights superior to those of a non-handicapped individual.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clopton</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Army</span>, 46 MSPR 63, 69 (1990). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Okleson v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 415, 424 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) (agency was not required to offer a higher level position as an accommodation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Promotion potential, as opposed to actual promotion, does not take a position out of consideration for reassignment for a qualified disabled employee, <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 493-95 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, it is undisputed that the appellant suffers from a physical impairment which renders him unable to perform the duties of his former position, and that his removal was expressly based on this inability to perform. Moreover, by requesting to be reassigned to a number of specified positions, the appellant has articulated a method by which he believes the agency could reasonably accommodate his disability. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination. <span class="Italic">See Ignacio v. United States Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986) (reasonable accommodation may include reassignment to a vacant position in the agency).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once an appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the agency has the burden of showing that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 36 MSPR at 153. This burden can be met by, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a showing that the appellant is not a "qualified disabled person," i.e., "a disabled person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; 29 CFR 1613.702(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here asserts that the agency could have reasonably accommodated his disability by reassigning him to the following vacant positions: (1) Housing Management Assistant, GS-5; (2) Tool Room Mechanic, WG-9; and (3) one of a number of clerical positions, GS-4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge affirmed the agency's denial of the appellant's request for reassignment to this position on grounds that it would have afforded him a promotion. Although it is undisputed that the appellant was otherwise qualified for the Housing Management Assistant, GS-5, position, and that his former grade of WG-9 is equivalent in pay to a position at the GS-6 level, the agency argues that he was ineligible for the Housing Management Assistant position because it had promotion potential to GS-7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has indeed found that an agency's obligation to consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified disabled employee does not extend to considering the employee's request to be placed in a higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">See Clopton v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 36 MSPR 373, 379 (1988). Furthermore, regulations promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) define "reassignment" as "a change of an employee...from one position to another without <span id="Page_3516"></span>promotion or demotion." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 210.102(b)(12). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's regulations require that an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[O]ffer to reassign the [handicapped employee] to a funded vacant position...at the same grade or level....&#8197;In the absence of a position at the same grade or level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level shall be required....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR 1614.203(g).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There remains the question, however, of whether a position classified at or below an employee's current grade, may nonetheless be properly characterized as a "promotion" by virtue of its "promotion potential." As a general principle, a disabled employee is not entitled to accommodation which affords him rights superior to those he enjoyed prior to the onset of his condition, or to those of other nondisabled employees. <span class="Italic">See Clopton</span>, 36 MSPR at 378-79; <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 392, 396-97 (1988). However, although promotion potential may be a desirous feature of any given position, "no guarantee of upward mobility is made to the incumbent of such a position." <span class="Italic">Pearson v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 38 MSPR 255, 259 (1988). Indeed, the staffing announcement for the Housing Management Assistant Position expressly states that "[t]he selectee may be subsequently promoted without further competition; however, promotion is not guaranteed and no promise of promotion is implied." Moreover, the Board does not generally distinguish between positions of equal grade on the basis of promotion potential. For example, in <span class="Italic">Beard v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 57 MSPR 355, 356-59 (1993), the Board found that an agency which had agreed to give an employee priority consideration for any available WG-2 Laborer position or "equivalent," could not refuse to consider him for a trainee position on the grounds that it had promotion potential to WG-4 or WG-5. Again, in <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 21 MSPR 108, 111-12 (1984), the Board found no merit in the appellant's contention that the agency acted improperly in permitting her displacement by another employee as part of a reduction in force (RIF), on grounds that her position had greater promotion potential. The Board further noted that "neither pertinent regulations nor the applicable [Federal Personnel Manual] provisions distinguish positions with promotion potential from those without such potential...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 112. <span class="Italic">See also Lange v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 2 MSPB 110, 1 MSPR 700, 702-03 (1980) (reassignment from a position with known promotion potential to one without such expectancy does not constitute an appealable reduction in grade).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Significantly, while OPM regulations governing priority reemployment of employees separated by RIF state that such employees are entitled to consideration for available positions for which they are qualified and "that are at no higher grade (or equivalent) and have <span class="Italic">no greater promotion potential than the position from which the employee was or will be separated"</span> (5 CFR 330.206(a)(1) (emphasis added)), parallel provisions covering employees separated by compensable injury state only that such employees are entitled to priority consideration for "his or her own position or <span class="Italic">an equivalent one</span>," 5 CFR 330.206(b) (emphasis added). As the Board has previously noted, "an agency's obligation to accommodate its employee's handicap...could be regarded as somewhat similar in nature and purpose to an agency's obligation to restore its former employee after that employee has recovered from a compensable injury." <span class="Italic">Patrick</span>, 39 MSPR at 396. Furthermore, the Board has found the term "equivalent position," as used in OPM's restoration regulations, to mean "one of like seniority, status and pay." <span class="Italic">Beard</span>, 57 MSPR at 358.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing, we find that the vacant Housing Management Assistant, GS-5, position was not of higher grade than the appellant's former WG-9 position by virtue of its greater promotion potential, and that therefore the appellant was entitled to consideration for this position as a reasonable accommodation to his disability.</p>
