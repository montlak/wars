<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-115"><span class="space">a.</span> Guilty Plea</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">As to collateral estoppel by a guilty plea rather than by a conviction, <span class="Italic">Haring v. Prosise</span>, 462 U.S. 306 (1982), determined that although there may be issues not fully and fairly litigated when a guilty plea is entered, the specific question of a defendant's unlawful conduct is determined by the guilty plea. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Briggs v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-851) (AJ correctly ruled that the petitioner's plea and conviction estopped him from denying his unlawful conduct of falsifying documents to obtain government compensation). An appellate court explained in <span class="Italic">Sherman v. Alexander</span>, 684 F.2d 464, 468 (7th Cir. 1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner points out that in reaching its conclusion, the Board noted that he had presented no defense to the merits of the first charge. He contends that the Board thereby shifted the burden of proof on the question of whether the petitioner had in fact committed the complained of misconduct to the petitioner, and required him to prove, in effect, that he had not committed the misconduct. This is a nugatory contention where, as here, the petitioner's commission of the crime is a matter of public record, and has not been contested at any point in the proceedings. An agency is not required to conduct a new trial before a hearing examiner when the occurrence of the misconduct has already been admitted in a guilty plea and the public record of those proceedings is before the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Raymond v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 476, 480-82 (1987), concluded that a guilty plea leading to a conviction satisfies the "actual litigation" requirement of collateral estoppel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board may apply the doctrine of collateral estoppel to any issue previously adjudicated where three prerequisites exist: (1) the issue in the second action must be identical to that involved in the prior action; (2) the issue must have been actually litigated in the prior action; and (3) the determination of the issue in the prior action must have been necessary to the resulting judgment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant contends...that the issue of his actual guilt of conversion of agency property valued at less than $100.00, by falsification of his travel voucher, was not litigated in the prior criminal proceeding because he pled guilty to the charge, and that it would be unfair to find that his guilty plea estops him from contesting his guilt before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "actual litigation" prerequisite for the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel means that the issue must have been contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court.... The...Federal Circuit has determined that an employee's conviction based on a guilty plea constitutes a full and fair opportunity in the criminal proceeding to litigate the issue of his innocence, even if there had been great incentive to accept a plea bargaining agreement in order to avoid a possible conviction on more serious charges. <span class="Italic">Graybill</span>, 782 F.2d at 1573 &#x0026; n.1[5].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Graybill</span>,...the court stated that it treated the petitioner's plea as an "<span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea," even though the record was unclear as to whether Graybill actually entered his plea in accordance with <span class="Italic">North Carolina v. Alford</span>, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). By means of an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea, a defendant maintains his innocence of the charges against him but, in order to avoid the risk of being found guilty of the charges, decides to accept legal responsibility and sanction for a lesser offense. The Board addressed the collateral estoppel effect of an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea in <span class="Italic">Loveland v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 484 (1987). In the instant case, however, the appellant did not protest his innocence and in fact, as noted above, agreed at the criminal proceedings that the summary of facts that formed the basis for the charges, as read into the record by the Assistant U.S. Attorney, was accurate and true. His guilty plea, thus, was not an <span class="Italic">Alford</span> plea.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Otherson</span>, 711 F.2d at 276-77 (when preclusion is sought in the second suit by the former adversary in the first suit, the federal government, and the other requirements for preclusion are met, the courts should refuse to give the first judgment preclusive effect on the ground that the party lacked adequate incentive to litigate in the first suit only upon a compelling showing of unfairness). Therefore, the Board finds that the administrative judge properly determined that the "actual litigation" prerequisite for the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel was met by the appellant's guilty plea conviction in the prior criminal proceeding, and that it was not error to conclude that his guilty plea estopped him from contesting his falsification of the travel voucher as regards his conversion of agency property valued at less than $100.00....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to appellant's further assertion, the administrative judge did not err by relying on the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel under federal law rather than the state law of Kansas, where appellant's falsification occurred. While the court in <span class="Italic">Graybill</span> applied the Maryland law of collateral estoppel to determine if the employee's guilty plea satisfied the "actual litigation" prerequisite, the court did so because the employee had been convicted in a Maryland State court of violating state law.... Appellant was convicted in federal court of violating federal law. <span id="Page_1552"></span>Thus, the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel under federal law is controlling in this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's criminal conviction based on his guilty plea may be given collateral estoppel effect until revised or removed for <span class="Italic">de novo</span> consideration. <span class="Italic">Cataulin v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Senyszyn v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 465 Fed. Appx. 935, 939-41 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP), considered the application of collateral estoppel to satisfy the agency's burden of proving misconduct that forms the basis of a guilty plea:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn argues that the AJ acted as an advocate for the agency, and failed to afford him a full and fair hearing on the merits, when the AJ invoked collateral estoppel to find the charged misconduct proven. Mr. Senyszyn is correct that litigants are entitled to a full and fair hearing. The doctrine of collateral estoppel, however, does not abridge that right. The doctrine saves an adjudicating body from wasting resources on unnecessary litigation of an issue when that issue was decided in an earlier proceeding. <span class="Italic">Chisholm v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 656 F.2d 42, 46 (Fed. Cir. 1981). When he applied collateral estoppel, the AJ did not absolve the agency from proving the charged misconduct, as Mr. Senyszyn claims. The AJ found that the proof already existed because Mr. Senyszyn admitted, under oath, in his criminal action that he engaged in the charged misconduct. The AJ was not obligated to require the agency to prove something that Mr. Senyszyn conceded occurred. "The grant of a right to appeal does not in itself limit the decisionmaking mechanisms available to the appellate tribunal. This court...has approved use of collateral estoppel by the board." <span class="Italic">Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 238 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn alternatively argues that the AJ misapplied collateral estoppel to the facts of this case. This argument also fails.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To apply collateral estoppel, the AJ was required to find the following: (1) the issues previously adjudicated were identical with those now presented; (2) the issues were actually litigated in the prior proceeding; (3) the previous determination of those issues was necessary to the end decision then made; and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action. <span class="Italic">Kroeger,</span> 865 F.2d at 239 (citing <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Gen. Serv. Admin.,</span> 794 F.2d 661, 664 (Fed. Cir. 1986) and <span class="Italic">Mother's Rest., Inc. v. Mama's Pizza, Inc.,</span> 723 F.2d 1566, 1469 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). We address each requirement in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issues adjudicated in Mr. Senyszyn's criminal action are identical with those now presented. The notice of proposed removal identified each of the four counts to which Mr. Senyszyn pled guilty and cited them as the basis for his removal. Mr. Senyszyn argues that the issues are not identical because "[T]he [agency's] charged misconduct relates to tax evasion from embezzlement and the plea relates to intended tax loss from the sale of Schedule D transactions...." Mr. Senyszyn mischaracterizes the conduct identified in the notice of proposed removal, the charges specified in Mr. Senyszyn's plea agreement, and the conduct to which Mr. Senyszyn admitted during his plea hearing. The plea agreement specifies the four counts to which Mr. Senyszyn agreed to plead guilty. The transcript of Mr. Senyszyn's plea hearing reflects that Mr. Senyszyn pled guilty to each count and admitted the truth of numerous facts supporting each count. The district judge found that the facts Mr. Senyszyn conceded were both true and sufficient to support each of the charges to which Mr. Senyszyn pled guilty. The notice of proposed removal recites the exact same charges. Thus, the charged conduct in Mr. Senyszyn's removal action is identical to that to which Mr. Senyszyn pled guilty in his criminal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issues here were actually litigated in Mr. Senyszyn's criminal action. In his plea agreement and during his plea hearing, Mr. Senyszyn admitted the truth of the facts supporting the charged offenses. The district court entered judgment, which specified that "the court has adjudicated that the defendant is guilty of the [four charged] offenses." The government did not have to present its case to a jury to actually litigate it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn attempts to cast his guilty plea as a stipulation and argues that a stipulated fact has not been actually litigated for purposes of collateral estoppel unless the stipulation clearly manifests a party's intent to be bound in future actions. Mr. Senyszyn, however, could not have made his intent to be bound clearer. During the plea hearing, the district court advised Mr. Senyszyn that, as a consequence of the guilty plea, he would be "required to be discharged from employment with the IRS...under a federal law." When the court asked Mr. Senyszyn whether he understood that consequence, Mr. Senyszyn responded, "[y]es, your Honor." The AUSA then recited facts alleged in the superseding information. Mr. Senyszyn responded by admitting that each recited fact was true. At the end of this colloquy, the AUSA asked Mr. Senyzszyn, "[a]re you pleading guilty to the crimes in Counts 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Superseding Information because you, in fact, are guilty of those offenses?" "Yes, I am," Mr. Senyszyn responded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn clearly understood what he was admitting when he pled guilty and the consequences of doing so. He cannot argue that he did not intend to be bound by his plea.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The previous determination of the issues here was necessary to the end decision made in the criminal action. The district court had to accept Mr. Senyszyn's guilty plea and his proffered factual basis to enter judgment against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3). <span class="Italic">See also Boykin v. Alabama,</span> 395 U.S. 239, 242 (1969) ("A guilty plea is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but to give judgment and determine the punishment.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn argues that the final requirement for collateral estoppel is not satisfied because he was not fully represented throughout the entirety of his criminal proceedings, specifically at his sentencing hearing. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn was represented by counsel during the phase of his criminal action relevant to this case. After Mr. Senyszyn was indicted, the district court appointed an assistant federal public defender, K. Anthony Thomas, to represent him. The government presented the plea agreement to Mr. Thomas to review with Mr. Senyszyn. Mr. Thomas signed the plea agreement with Mr. Senyszyn. Mr. Thomas also appeared with Mr. Senyszyn at the plea hearing, when Mr. Senyszyn admitted to the factual basis supporting the charged offenses and pled guilty in open court. Although Mr. Senyszyn decided to proceed <span class="Italic">pro se</span> for his sentencing, the terms of his sentence had no bearing on the I.R.S.'s decision to remove him. It was his guilty plea and conviction that prompted the agency to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirement that an estopped party have been "fully represented" in a prior proceeding, moreover, does not mean that the party had to be represented by counsel. The relevant inquiry is whether the party had a "full and fair chance to litigate" the issue to be precluded. <span class="Italic">Blonder-Tongue Labs., Inc. v. Univ. of Ill. Found.,</span> 402 U.S. 313, 329 (1971). While we have considered whether an estopped party was represented in a prior proceeding as a factor in determining whether the party was "fully represented," <span class="Italic">see Thomas,</span> 794 F.2d at 665 n.3, we have not deemed the presence of counsel mandatory. Where, as here, Mr. Senyszyn himself asked that counsel be discharged and informed the court that he was prepared to represent himself at sentencing, we find that the absence of counsel had no impact on Mr. Senyszyn's ability to fully and fairly litigate all aspects of his criminal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn advances other arguments about collateral estoppel that are not well taken. He argues that the plea agreement has no collateral estoppel effect because it is limited to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey and "cannot bind other federal, state, or local authorities." The AJ, however, did not blindly accept the plea agreement as binding. He applied each of the collateral estoppel requirements and found that the facts to which Mr. Senyszyn admitted did not have to be relitigated here. The provision of the plea agreement on which Mr. Senyszyn relies does not bar the application of collateral estoppel; it merely preserves the right of other authorities to pursue action against Mr. Senyszyn. In fact, the next paragraph of the plea agreement provides that "[t]his agreement does not prohibit the United States, any agency thereof (including the Internal Revenue Service), or any third party from initiating or prosecuting any civil proceeding against [Mr. Senyszyn]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Senyszyn also argues that the AJ erred by applying the Federal Circuit's collateral estoppel precedent rather than that of the Third Circuit. He cites our holding, in <span class="Italic">Vardon Golf Co. v. Karsten Manufacturing Corp.,</span> that, "[B]ecause the application of collateral estoppel is not a matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of this court, this court applies the law of the circuit in which the district court sits." 294 F.3d 1330, 1333 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citation omitted). The rule that Mr. Senyszyn cites is applicable in cases in which a district court's jurisdiction was based on a patent infringement claim, not in employment cases appealed from the Board. We have long applied our own collateral estoppel precedent in Board appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Kroeger,</span> 865 F.2d at 239.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ, in sum, properly applied collateral estoppel.</p>

DHS</span>, SF-0752-16-0411-I-1 (NP 12/22/2016) ("The fact that the appellant's conviction of a lesser offense resulted from a plea deal has no bearing on the issues in this appeal. Furthermore, contrary to the appellant's contention, the administrative judge did not 'rule' that the appellant accepted a plea deal. Rather, in the background section of the initial decision, the administrative judge stated that, 'as part of a plea deal, the appellant was <span id="Page_1553"></span>convicted of the infraction of malicious disturbance of another person[.] ' The appellant does not challenge the factual accuracy of the statement.").</p>
