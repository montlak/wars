<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-115"><span class="space">8.</span> Drug Testing</h4>
<p class="noindent">At issue in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 46 FLRA 1475, 1482-89 (1993), a ULP case that considered the implications of the <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> decision of the Supreme Court (but a decision that was issued before the Supreme Court's name and address case, <span class="Italic">DOD v. FLRA</span>, 114 S. Ct. 1006 (1994)), was whether the agency improperly withheld from the union the names of employees selected for random drug tests. The union complained that the agency was required to release the information so that the union could determine whether a grievance would lie for unfair application of random drug testing procedures. The employer claimed that the information was neither necessary nor disclosable under the Privacy Act. FLRA favored the union's position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant cases, the Union requested the lists to "ensure that the [Respondent's] Departmental Drug Program is administered in a fair and equitable manner." As noted above, the parties' memorandum of understanding concerning drug testing requires the Respondent to ensure that random drug testing at the Respondent's facilities is "'implemented in a fair and equitable manner.'" The Union contends that the lists are "necessary to ensure that the names of all [nonbargaining] unit employees actually appear on the list, that no bargaining unit employee was tested in lieu of a [nonbargaining] unit employee, and that annotations contained on the drug list are accurate."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the unsanitized lists are necessary for the Union to determine whether bargaining unit employees were treated fairly and equitably when the Respondent conducted random drug testing on March 15 and April 19, 23, and 24, 1991, and to determine whether there is a basis for filing a grievance on behalf of bargaining unit employees who were tested on those dates. The lists reveal whether an employee was available for testing, whether an employee was tested, and if an employee was not tested, the reason that the employee was not tested. The General Counsel asserts that if the name associated with an entry on the list is deleted, the Union "would not be able to police the administration of the Respondent's drug testing process to ensure that unit employees are not disadvantaged by a Site Coordinator's error or deliberate manipulation."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...It also is reasonable to conclude that the Union would need to know the names of nonbargaining unit employees who were tested to determine whether a particular employee was or was not tested for discriminatory reasons. Consequently, we conclude that the record establishes that the lists are necessary for collective bargaining, within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">National Labor</span> <span class="Italic">Relations Board v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 523 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>), where the court concluded that an agency need not disclose certain requested information to a union unless the union has a "'particularized need' for such information." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 534. The court also held that the Statute requires the Authority to consider "countervailing interests" against disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 531. Subsequently, the court issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base v. FLRA</span>, 956 F.2d 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>), where, based on <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span>, the court determined that the Authority ordered disclosure of certain requested information "without adequately explaining the 'necessity' of the requested information" under section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>, 956 F.2d at 1224. The court held that the Authority had failed to consider the "countervailing interests against disclosure." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not decide whether <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> apply in the circumstances of this case. However, even if we were to apply <span class="Italic">NLRB v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> here, those decisions would not change our conclusion that the requested information is necessary within the meaning of section 7114(b)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted above, the Union needs the information to determine whether the Agency has complied with the parties' agreement concerning the operation of its drug testing program and to determine whether there is a basis to file a grievance alleging that bargaining unit employees were treated unfairly or inequitably during certain random drug testing sessions. Specifically, in the absence of the information covered by the Union's request, the Union would be unable to determine whether the Respondent is selectively enforcing the drug testing program or to determine whether grounds for a grievance exist under the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, the countervailing interest against disclosure asserted by the Respondent is speculative. In this connection, the Respondent argues that it should not be required to disclose information because "[t]he Union simply [is] on a fishing expedition." The Respondent asserts that "the [G]overnment cannot operate effectively if actions are taken based on underlying, baseless suspicions of wrongdoing by officials conducting the normal course of business." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. However, even assuming that the Respondent's asserted concerns would constitute countervailing interests weighing against disclosure, the Respondent offers no evidence which shows that disclosure of the requested data would negatively affect the efficient operation of the Government.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find, for the reasons stated below, that disclosure of the requested information is not barred by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With certain enumerated exceptions, the Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of any record concerning a Federal employee if the record is contained in a system of records and the individual to whom that record pertains has not consented to the disclosure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(b). Section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act provides that the prohibition against disclosure is not applicable if disclosure of the information would be required under the FOIA. Section (b)(3) of the Privacy Act permits disclosure "for a routine use," which is defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552a(a)(7) as "the use of such record for a purpose which is compatible with the purpose for which it was collected."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to determine whether disclosure of the requested information in this case is permitted by section (b)(2) of the Privacy Act, we must determine whether it is disclosable under Exemption (b)(6) of the FOIA. That section provides that information contained in personnel files, in addition to medical and other similar files, may be withheld if disclosure of the information would constitute a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[.]" 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 552(b)(6).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether disclosure of the requested information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, we must balance the employee's right to privacy against the public interest in disclosure. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, National Aviation Support Facility, Atlantic City Airport, New Jersey</span>, 43 FLRA 191, 199 (1991) (<span class="Italic">FAA, Atlantic City Airport</span>). In applying the balancing test, we look to the public interest embodied in the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally Portsmouth</span>, 37 FLRA at 525-35. We have stated that the "public interest" identified in the Statute may be summarized as "the facilitation of the collective bargaining process...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 531. We conclude here that there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of the requested information.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union sought the information to "ensure that the [Respondent's] Departmental Drug Program is administered in a fair and equitable manner."...&#8197;The Union stated that the drug test lists are "necessary to ensure that the names of all [nonbargaining] unit employees actually appear on the list, that no bargaining unit employee was tested in lieu of a [nonbargaining] unit employee, and that annotations contained on the drug list are accurate."...&#8197;We conclude, consistent with our precedent, that such representational responsibilities are in the public interest and also safeguard the public interest....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that unit and nonunit employees have definite privacy interests, but conclude that those interests are outweighed by the public interest embodied in the Statute. The Respondent argues that the nonconsensual release to the public or the Union of an unsanitized medical record "would clearly eliminate any remaining element of dignity or privacy to a process that has been otherwise described by both unions and employees...as the ultimate intrusion to their privacy." However, the information requested by the Union does not reveal the results of employees' drug tests. Rather, as noted above, the lists only reveal whether an employee was available for testing, whether an employee was tested, and if an employee was not tested, the reason that the employee was not tested. Inasmuch as all employees are subject to testing under the Respondent's random drug testing program without regard to cause or suspicion and "have an equal statistical chance of being selected for testing within a specified time frame," disclosure of a random drug test list would not disclose information that is stigmatizing....&#8197;Moreover, there is no indication in the Agency's drug testing policy that the documents requested by the Union in this case would be covered by a claim of confidentiality....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nor should the fact that an employee has been selected for random drug testing be considered a particularly private matter because the public is already well aware of the Government's practice to administer random drug tests to employees....&#8197;In addition, the Federal employee status of the individuals tested further diminishes the employees' privacy interests in the drug test lists because of the corresponding public interest in knowing how public employees are performing their jobs....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent's privacy interests argument is further undercut by the fact that the Respondent released the names of bargaining unit employees on the random drug testing lists. Whether an employee is a member of the bargaining unit is not relevant to considering whether an employee's privacy rights, protected by the Privacy Act, have been abridged. Therefore, inasmuch as the Respondent determined that the names of bargaining unit employees on the random drug testing lists could be disclosed under the Privacy Act, the names of nonbargaining unit employees may also be disclosed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_378"></span>On balance, we conclude that the public interest inherent in the Union's discharge of its obligations under the Statute to monitor and administer the collective bargaining agreement, including the parties' agreement concerning the implementation of the Respondent's drug testing program, outweighs the employees' personal privacy interest in preventing disclosure of information about their appearance for a drug test to the exclusive representative of the Respondent's employees....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, under the public interest test identified by the U.S. Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 772, we find that there is an overriding public interest in the disclosure of the information requested by the Union in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">FAA, Atlantic City Airport</span>, 43 FLRA at 202 (union sought transcript of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hearing to determine whether agency had violated parties' agreement by not following the procedures in their merit promotion plan; Authority concluded that disclosure would open to public scrutiny the manner in which the Agency administers its selection process and whether that process is administered in a fair and evenhanded manner and that, therefore, the public interest outweighed the limited privacy interest of a single employee). In particular, the requested information pertains to the decisions the Respondent makes and the actions the Respondent takes in testing employees for illegal drug use. Disclosure of the information would open to "public scrutiny" what the Respondent is "up to" in its drug testing program. <span class="Italic">See Reporters Committee</span>, 489 U.S. at 772-73.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Disclosure of the information will enable the public to assess, for example, whether the Respondent is implementing its drug testing program consistent with applicable law, regulation, and the collective bargaining agreement....&#8197;The information also will enable the Union to detect whether the Respondent's administration of its drug testing program is free of discriminatory practices. For example, if certain groups of bargaining unit employees were randomly selected more frequently than other employees, some further examination of the Respondent's random selection process may be in order. If further examination resulted in the discovery of irregularities in the random selection process, such results, achieved as a consequence of the Union's efforts, clearly inure to the public's benefit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the random drug test lists enable the Union to monitor certain aspects of the drug testing program which can only be monitored by direct employee contacts. Without the names of those employees, there would be no way to communicate directly with employees to verify that the basis upon which the drug test was ordered was truly random selection, and whether the Respondent followed its drug testing procedures as required. Thus, disclosure of the random drug test lists is in the public interest because it facilitates the overall monitoring of the Respondent's drug testing program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Balancing the employees' limited privacy interest in the lists against the strong public interest in the disclosure of the drug test lists, we find that disclosure of a copy of the lists to the Union would not constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Therefore, disclosure of a copy of the lists to the Union is not prohibited by the Privacy Act.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp. and NATCA Y90 Local</span>, 47 FLRA 110, 121-23 (1993), also determined that the employer committed a ULP when it refused to provide the union with an unsanitized copy of the list of names used by FAA for random drug testing of employees on a particular date and at a particular location. FLRA concluded that the union needed the information to determine whether the employer was selectively enforcing the drug program and to assess the need for a grievance. The only justification for withholding the information was the employer's concern about the confidentiality of the names. The request did not violate the Privacy Act. The union did not request test results. The information requested only disclosed if an employee was available for testing, whether the employee was tested, and, if not, why not. Because all employees were subject to testing, there was no stigma attached to placement on the list. The random selection for testing was considered by FLRA not to be a particularly private matter, given the public awareness of random drug testing for government employees. The employer released the names of unit employees on the list; the disclosure of those names undercut a claim of confidentiality of the names of nonunit employees on the list. Public interest in the conduct of the drug testing program suggested a FOIA basis for the disclosure under the <span class="Italic">Reporters Committee</span> case. FLRA declined to find that release of the information was authorized, alternatively, as a routine use under the "Employee Medical File System" of records. FLRA determined that the records notice did not include disclosure of the information to unions. It held that it would not second-guess the propriety of OPM's designation of routine uses of the information in that records system.
