<p class="Body-Text">The PIP is not the time to materially change performance standards, <span class="Italic">Betters v. FEMA</span>, 57 MSPR 405, 409-10 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n <span class="Italic">Boggess v. Department of Air Force</span>, 31 MSPR 461, 462-63 (1986), the Board held that by simultaneously presenting the appellant with revised performance standards that were substantially different from the prior standards and notifying him both that his performance was unacceptable and that he had thirty days to improve, the agency failed to fulfill the substantive requirement of 5 USC 4303 to provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve. The Board found further that the appellant was entitled to an appraisal period under the revised standards and to a reasonable opportunity to improve <span class="Italic">after</span> his performance was rated as deficient under those standards before the agency could properly initiate an action based on an unacceptable performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency's failure in this regard went further when the agency gave the appellant a new performance plan when he was placed on the PIP. This plan, too, differed significantly from that for the appellant's official position of record. Agencies may not use a PIP either to reduce or increase the standards of performance established at the beginning of the appraisal period. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brown v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR 635, 643 (1990). Accordingly, we find no error in the administrative judge's finding that the agency improperly used a PIP to change the appellant's performance standards.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clifford v. USDA</span>, 50 MSPR 232, 236 (1991), cautioned against making improper changes in standards during a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Brown v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 MSPR at 643, the Board held that an employee's performance pursuant to a PIP must always be reviewed in the context of the employee's performance plan, and that agencies may not use a PIP either to reduce or to increase the standards of performance established at the beginning of the appraisal period. In the present case, the initial decision's discussion...did not address the appellant's contention that his detail resulted in additional duties that prevented him from successfully completing his PIP. The initial decision should, therefore, discuss this matter on remand.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An arbitrator's award sustaining a performance action was reversed because the arbitrator did not recognize that the agency substantially increased the appellant's performance requirements during the PIP--essentially by requiring that appellant complete his pre-PIP assignments and more assignments during the PIP, <span class="italic">Rogers v. VA</span>, CB-7121-18-0006-V-1 (NP 1/30/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, pursuant to the PIP, the agency required the appellant to meet a far higher average rate of production. Specifically, to successfully complete the PIP, the appellant was required to meet the cumulative productivity requirement for her extended performance year. Essentially, the agency extended the performance year and defined a portion of the extended performance year as the PIP period. It stated that the appellant's 87-day long PIP would begin effective Monday, September 28, 2015, which is the first business day after the end of the fourth quarter, and end Monday, December 28, 2015. It further stated that the appellant must reach 192 credits by the end of the extended performance year, or by the end of the PIP period. Thus, during the 13-week PIP period, the appellant would have had to complete 36 credits plus the 31.5-credit-production shortfall during the 12 months of FY15, or an average of approximately 5 credits per week, a number far higher than the average rate of production required for a fully successful rating under the performance standards given to the appellant at the beginning of the appraisal year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional record evidence shows that the agency intended to increase the standards of performance established at the beginning of the appraisal period. Prior to the PIP period, the appellant asked her supervisor to forgive the 31.5-case-credit shortfall for FY15. In response, her supervisor stated that she had "no authority to simply 'forgive' or otherwise ignore any [f]air [s]hare credit deficiency that [kept the appellant] from reaching the Fully Successful level of her annual Productivity requirement." The supervisor stated that the appellant must meet 192 credits by December 28, 2015, the end of her PIP period. The supervisor emphasized that the appellant's success or failure in the PIP would ultimately depend on her ability to meet the overall goal through the end of the PIP period, or 192 credits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By setting a performance production standard of approximately 5 credits per week for the appellant to achieve during her PIP, the agency imposed revised performance standards for the production element that were substantially different from her prior production standard of three credits per week. The PIP thus increased the standards of performance established at the beginning of the appraisal period. The Board has held that a PIP that increases the standards of performance established at the beginning of the appraisal period does not provide a reasonable opportunity to improve. <span class="italic">See Betters v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 405, 410 (1993); <span class="italic">see also Boggess v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 461, 462-63 (1996) (finding that the agency failed to provide the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve when it simultaneously presented him with substantially different performance standards and notified him that his performance was unacceptable); <span class="italic">cf. Brown v. Veterans Administration</span>, 44 M.S.P.R. 635, 644-45 (1990) (finding that, although the employee must have notice of how his or her performance will be judged during the PIP, when the workload is fairly constant, an employee subject to an annual numerical standard should reasonably anticipate evaluation of his or her PIP performance under a <span class="italic">pro-rata</span> standard). Under the circumstances of this case, the arbitrator erred as a matter of law in finding that the agency provided the appellant with a reasonable opportunity to improve, and the arbitration decision must be reversed. <span class="italic">De Bow</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 5, &#x00B6; 5.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although agencies may not use a PIP to reduce or increase the standards of performance established in the annual performance plan, <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 44 MSPR 646, 661 n.16 (1990), the Board implies that in addition to communications from supervisors, the letter placing an employee on a performance improvement period may serve to augment a vague standard, <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 27 MSPR 293, 298 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e hold that an agency may satisfy the employee's rights under 5 USC 4302(b)(1), (2), and (6), by communicating to the employee the standards he must meet in order to be evaluated as demonstration performance at a level which is sufficient for retention. Those standards may be more or less objective depending upon the job measured, <span class="Italic">Shuman</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, but must be sufficiently specific to provide a firm benchmark toward which the employee must aim his performance, and not an elusive goal which the agency may find the employee met or failed to meet at its pleasure. Such communication may occur in the PIP, in counseling sessions, in written instructions, or in any manner calculated to apprise the employee of the requirements against which he is to be measured.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2900"></span>Yet the PIP may change expectations if standards and critical elements are not materially altered, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 89 MSPR 188, 194-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-19 (2001) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 84 Fed. Appx. 61 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we do not concur in the administrative judge's finding that the agency's establishment of numerical error limits at the beginning of the PIP had the effect of denying the appellant his right to a reasonable period to demonstrate acceptable performance. In connection with that finding, we note that the Board has addressed the issue of whether an employee may be subject during his PIP to performance standards different from those covering him prior to the PIP. In <span class="Italic">Boggess v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 461, 463 (1986), it held that, when the new standards differed substantially from the previous standards, the employee was entitled to an appraisal period under the new standards and--if his performance was rated unacceptable under those standards--to a subsequent PIP. It also found, in that case, that the action against the employee could not be sustained because the employee's standards were substantially changed at the beginning of his PIP. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 462-67.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note, however, that <span class="Italic">Boggess</span> differs materially from the present case. In <span class="Italic">Boggess,</span> the changes the agency made included the elimination of the performance standard the employee had allegedly failed to meet, the substantial alteration of most of the remaining standards, and the addition of a new critical element and three new noncritical elements. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464. In addition, the only critical element the employee failed to meet after the revised standards were imposed included a new performance standard that had no counterpart in the original performance plan. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 464-65. In the present case, the agency added no new elements or standards. Instead, it only clarified the standards that had been in effect for the preceding 7 months by explaining in some detail why the appellant's performance during that time was considered unacceptable, and by (as indicated above) providing specific information about the errors he was to avoid and the number of those errors that would result in an "unacceptable" rating on either of the two critical elements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held repeatedly that clarification such as that described above is permissible. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Romero</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 535; <span class="Italic">Jimenez-Howe v. Department of Labor,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 202, 207-08 (1987); <span class="Italic">Mouser v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 543, 547 (1987); <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 614, 617 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 782 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Moreover, the PIP notice clarifying the appellant's standards did not impose any burdens on the appellant that had not been in effect during the preceding 7 months. <span class="Italic">See Anthony v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 n. (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 795 F.2d 1011 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Table), (performance standard changes made at beginning of PIP "neither materially changed the performance expected nor posed any additional burdens on appellant," and appellant accordingly was afforded reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that an agency may cure otherwise fatal defects in the development and communication of performance standards by communicating sufficient information regarding performance requirements at the beginning of--and even during--the PIP<span class="Italic">. See Jimenez-Howe,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. at 205-06; <span class="Italic">Donaldson v. Department of Labor</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 293, 297-98 (1985). It also may modify, at the beginning of the employee's PIP, the quality and quantity of performance required, as long as it does so according to a reasonable standard and makes the appellant aware of the modifications. <span class="Italic">Mouser</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. at 548.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Evidence that the agency failed to make modifications in other employees' performance standards similar to those made in the appellant's standards...is immaterial, since it is only the appellant's performance, and not that of other employees, that is at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, it could be argued that the unmodified performance standards for the appellant's critical elements were invalid because they were "absolute," i.e., because a single error or instance of failure to meet the standards could be regarded as warranting a rating of "unacceptable."[3] <span class="Italic">See Callaway v. Department of the Army</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 592, 597 (1984) (absolute performance standards are invalid except in instances where death, injury or breach of security could result from a single failure to meet those standards). As indicated above, however, the agency advised the appellant prior to the beginning of the PIP that he could make up to three errors under each element during the 92 day PIP and still receive an "acceptable" rating. Moreover, there is no indication that this apparent modification of the appellant's performance standards posed any burdens on the appellant that had not previously been imposed; instead, it appears to have been communicated to the appellant in an effort to help him improve his performance to an acceptable level. <span class="Italic">See Anthony</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. at 273 &#x0026; n....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The "acceptable" level of performance for the "organizational support and communication" element is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Promotes and properly uses administrative channels. Follows the policies, regulations and procedures and is aware of the organization's goals and priorities to produce efficient performance of job operations. Communicates well and maintains good rapport with supervisor and co-workers. Keeps supervisor, co-workers and customers informed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The "acceptable" level of performance for the "execution of duties" element is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Readily accepts work assignments and follows instructions. Independently and efficiently uses technical knowledge and skills. Services provided and/or work produced is of good quality, timely and responsive to the supervisor, customer, and the organization priorities and requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As we indicated in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Interior,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 359, 365 (2000), standards that appear to require that work must always be timely and otherwise at an acceptable level are impermissibly absolute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson</span> was affirmed on judicial review, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 84 Fed. Appx. 61, 63-65 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Thompson next argues that the standards the Navy used to evaluate his performance were invalid because they were vague, subjective, and unreasonable. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4302(b)(1), a performance evaluation system must establish "performance standards which will, to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria." The performance standards should "inform the employee of what is necessary to achieve a satisfactory or acceptable rating." <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The performance standard used to evaluate Mr. Thompson's performance contained two critical elements: "Organizational Support and Communication" and "Execution of Duties." The requirements of the first critical element were set forth as follows: "Understands the organization's goals and priorities. Fully complies with the organization's policies, regulations, and procedures. Communicates orally and/or in writing to perform work." The standard for "acceptable" performance of that critical element was set forth as follows: "Promotes and properly uses administrative channels. Follows the policies, regulations and procedures and is aware of the organization's goals and priorities to produce efficient performance of job operations. Communicates well and maintains good rapport with supervisor and co-workers. Keeps supervisor, coworkers and customers informed."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The requirements of the second critical element were set forth as follows: "Performs assigned work by applying technical knowledge and skills. The services provided and/or work produced is of acceptable quality." The standard for "acceptable" performance of that critical element was set forth as follows: "Readily accepts work assignments and follows instructions. Independently and efficiently uses technical knowledge and skills. Services provided and/or work produced is of good quality, timely and responsive to the supervisor, customer, and the organization priorities and requirements."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the performance standards for Mr. Thompson's position were somewhat general in nature, we agree with the Board that they were sufficient to explain to an employee what constituted acceptable performance in the position and thus satisfied the statutory requirement. In fact, the standards applicable to Mr. Thompson were quite similar to the standards that this court upheld in the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> case, on which Mr. Thompson relies<span class="Italic">. See Wilson</span>, 770 F.2d at 1055. As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Wilson,</span> the performance requirements for a professional position cannot be expected to be set forth in a "purely mechanical way." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1052. Thus, "some tasks may be rated only with a certain modicum of subjective judgment," and in such cases specific numerical values are not suitable. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1055.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The standards adopted in this case are very different from those held invalid in <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439 (Fed. Cir. 1988), on which Mr. Thompson relies. In that case the court concluded that the performance standards at issue were vague, subjective, and (as the government conceded) could not be read literally. The court concluded that the standards did not describe what was necessary for acceptable performance, as the statute requires, but in fact were written "backwards" in describing what constituted marginal performance, i.e., the standards described "marginal performance" in terms of the failure to achieve particular objectives rather than as requiring the attainment of a particular level of achievement. In this case, the standards described what was necessary for acceptable performance and did so in a reasonably objective manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, as in <span class="Italic">Wilson,</span> the standards in this case were fleshed out and implemented in more detail in the letter given to Mr. Thompson at the outset of the PIP. Thus, he was advised that in the course of the PIP he would be expected to satisfy the following requirements under the first critical element and make no more than three errors in so doing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;To follow administrative channels, regulations, policies or procedures; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2901"></span>b.&#x2003;To comply with directives and instructions while demonstrating knowledge of the organization's goals and priorities; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;To communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, with your Section Leader, other staff members, and [supervisor] ; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;To properly coordinate work requirements; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">e.&#x2003;To keep your Section Leader, customers, and [supervisor] informed of work-related issues, their development and status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the second critical element, he was advised that he must "complete assigned actions so that there are no more than three valid findings where you fail to produce a product or provide a service because the quality, timeliness, or responsiveness is unacceptable, as determined by the supervisor."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in the <span class="Italic">Wilson</span> case, the governing standards were thus fleshed out and implemented in some detail at the outset of the PIP. The performance standards, particularly as supplemented prior to the PIP, adequately informed Mr. Thompson of "the specific areas in which he needed improvement and of the specific tasks by which he could satisfy [his agency's] concerns." <span class="Italic">Wilson,</span> 770 F.2d at 1056. The guidance that Mr. Thompson was given at the outset of the PIP constituted an effort to provide additional specificity with regard to the performance standards already applicable to his position; contrary to Mr. Thompson's contention, they did not constitute new performance standards. Moreover, although Mr. Thompson objects to the selection of three errors with respect to each of the critical elements as the standard applicable to his PIP, the Board held that the "three error" standard was reasonable in light of evidence that a typical employee working under the standards that applied to Mr. Thompson made "probably three to four errors in a given year." Accordingly, we reject Mr. Thompson's argument that the standards that were applied to him during his PIP were insufficiently detailed as to be arbitrary and capricious, or that they impermissibly departed from the standards applicable to his position generally.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that during the PIP Mr. Thompson made at least 10 major errors with respect to each of the critical elements. Those errors were not minor ones, such as the isolated spelling mistakes that Mr. Thompson focuses on, but constituted serious problems, such as repeatedly missing important deadlines, going outside the chain of command, and making rude and insubordinate remarks to his supervisor. Although Mr. Thompson asserts that his supervisor acted arbitrarily in identifying the errors Mr. Thompson committed during the PIP, the evidence does not support his contention that the errors on which his removal was based were minor or should not have been held against him. To the contrary, there is ample evidence to support the Board's conclusion that Mr. Thompson committed more than the permissible number of serious errors during the PIP and that the agency therefore acted lawfully in removing him because of the inadequacies in his performance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">According to <span class="Italic">Dancy v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 331, 334-35 (1992), the PIP may "flesh out" standards:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performance standards must, "to the maximum extent feasible, permit the accurate evaluation of job performance on the basis of objective criteria." 5 USC 4302(b)(1). Thus, a performance standard "should be sufficiently precise and specific as to invoke a general consensus as to its meaning and content." <span class="Italic">See Wilson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1052 (Fed. Cir. 1985). In this case, the critical element states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In performing the work of the unit, the employee accepts the work to be accomplished, properly follows instructions, uses the technical knowledge and applies the skill(s) needed to complete tasks assigned. The service of work product produced is of good quality, timely, and responsive to the supervisor and the organization's priorities and requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are five possible ratings for the element:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Unacceptable: Frequently hesitates in accepting the work assignments, often fails to follow instructions, and does not properly apply the technical knowledge/skills required to complete tasks. The service or product produced is frequently of poor quality and/or untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Fully successful: Willingly accepts work assignments, properly follows instruction[,] uses technical knowledge, and applies skills needed to produce a product or service of good quality in a timely, and responsive manner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Outstanding: Readily accepts and often anticipates work assignments, independently follows instructions and efficiently utilizes technical knowledge and skills in an outstanding manner, resulting in a product or service of excellent quality, frequently completed ahead (of) schedule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's performance management system provides that performance falling between "Unacceptable" and "Fully successful" is to be rated as "Minimally successful," and that performance better than "Fully successful" but not as good as "Outstanding" is to be rated as "Exceeds fully successful." The five rating levels are reflected on the appellant's appraisal document.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Frederick, the appellant's supervisor, testified that the technical knowledge and skills mentioned in the performance appraisal refer to those called for in the appellant's position description. While Mr. Frederick conceded that the performance standards at issue were subjective, he credibly explained that the appellant's work was not subject to quantitative measurement. The Board has recognized that certain positions are not susceptible to strictly objective, numerical ratings<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Stubblefield v. Department of Commerce</span>, 28 MSPR 572, 576 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Eibel v. Department of the Navy</span>, 857 F.2d 1439, 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit distinguished between those "backwards" performance standards that are beyond salvage because, though purporting to describe acceptable performance, they actually describe what is unacceptable, and those that, though somewhat vague on their face, can be "fleshed out" with more specific oral and written communications to the employee. We find that the performance standards at issue here are clearly not "backwards," but rather, fall within the latter category of those that can be "fleshed out."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, to the extent that terms such as "work assignments," "frequent," "poor quality," and "good quality" are not defined, and the manner of demonstrating one's degree of willingness to accept work assignments is not explained, those concepts are, if not self-evident, quite susceptible to further clarification by management in day-to-day communications with the employee. Therefore, we find that the appellant's performance standards were valid<span class="Italic">. See Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d at 1443.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, we find that the agency effectively "fleshed out" the performance standards at issue in the "Warning of Unacceptable Performance" that it gave to the appellant on June 1, 1989. This document explained in detail why the appellant's performance was deficient, and also gave the appellant detailed instructions on what he had to accomplish during the improvement period in order to keep his job. That is, in addition to certain regularly assigned duties, the appellant was given the task of rewriting the "Operating Procedures Manual for Manage Manpower/Front-End Feedback," and the agency explained precisely what that would entail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the performance standards at issue meet the requirements of the statute. 5 USC 4302(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Eibel</span>, 857 F.2d at 1443.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Jimenez-Howe v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 35 MSPR 202, 207-08 (1987), noted that the agency may essential reset standards through a PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant was made aware of the level of performance expected of her to retain her position as a result of the August 12, 1985 PIP. In <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>, 27 MSPR at 298, we found that agencies may satisfy the statutory requirements of 5 USC 4302(b)(1)(2) and (6) by "communicating to the employee the standards he must meet in order to be evaluated as demonstrating performance at a level which is sufficient for retention" and that "[s]uch communications may occur in the PIP." There, we further cited <span class="Italic">Baker v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 25 MSPR 614 (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 782 F.2d 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1986), for the proposition that agencies may give sufficient specificity to their performance standards by written and oral instructions to meet the statutory requirements<span class="Italic">. See also Wilson v. Department of Health and Human Resources</span>, 770 F.2d 1048, 1056 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Mouser</span>, 32 MSPR 547. It is clear from the facts of this case that the agency gave appellant's written performance standards the requisite specificity for them to meet the statutory requirements in a manner that we found to be permissible in <span class="Italic">Donaldson</span>. We do not find that the agency committed harmful error in doing so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Salmon v. SSA</span>, 663 F.3d 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-017.html#sec9-16">Objectivity</a>"); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 87 MSPR 359, 362 &#x00B6; 7 (2000) (agency may demonstrate the validity of standards through the standards themselves or by "giving content to standards by informing the employee of specific work requirements through other methods, including while placing the employee on a PIP"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Ortegel v. NASA</span>, DC-0432-15-0715-I-1 (NP 1/3/2017) ("We have reviewed the referenced meeting summaries and find, however, that his supervisor's comments constituted substantive feedback designed to help the appellant produce acceptable deliverables rather than changes in the requirements of the PIP.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Augmentation through a PIP of broadly-stated standards was permissible, <span class="Italic">Lane v. DHS</span>, CB-7121-14-0001-V-1 (NP 7/29/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find unavailing the appellant's argument on review that she was subjected to increased performance standards on the critical core competency of technical proficiency during her PIP. <span class="Italic">See also Boggess v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 461, 465 (1986) (finding that an appellant was subjected to new performance standards during a PIP which had no counterpart in the original performance plan). Under the critical core competency of technical proficiency, the appellant was required to, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, "[d]emonstrate[&#8197;] and appl[y] relevant knowledge and skills to perform work in accordance with applicable guidelines" and "[m]ake[&#8197;] <span id="Page_2902"></span>sound, well-informed, and timely decisions or recommendations." Building upon these standards, the agency specified that the appellant had to complete certain tasks with no more than a certain limited number of errors per week or month. We find that the specific standards imposed on the appellant during the PIP "neither materially changed the performance expected nor posed any additional burdens on the appellant," <span class="Italic">Anthony v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 271, 273 n.* (1985), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 795 F.2d 1011 (Fed. Cir. 1986), but rather fleshed out the appellant's overall performance objectives and therefore constituted valid clarifications which provided her a firm benchmark toward which to aim her performance, <span class="Italic">Towne v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 21 (2013).[3] We note, moreover, that the performance standards the appellant uses in making her comparison between the original and "heightened" performance standards are not those contained within the critical core competency of technical proficiency; rather, the appellant cites to several performance goals, which are different from her critical core competencies, in which her performance was rated as acceptable. We are unpersuaded by the appellant's argument that during her PIP the agency improperly imposed heightened standards on her performance in the critical core competency of technical proficiency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;It is for this reason that we find unpersuasive the appellant's argument that the agency erred when it imposed certain numerical benchmarks during her PIP. Without firm guidance informing an employee of the standards she is to work toward during a PIP, an agency would otherwise run the risk of failing to establish the propriety of its removal action under chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See Towne</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 239, &#x00B6; 8 (the employee's right to a reasonable opportunity to improve is a substantive right and a necessary prerequisite to all chapter 43 actions).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But Kolavo v. SSA</span>, CH-0432-10-0975-I-3 (NP 4/17/2014), reversed an agency performance action for failure to timely and properly define standards used during the PIP:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency is correct that the Board has held that an agency is not required to include in each performance standard specific indicators of quantity, quality, and timeliness that are used to evaluate work. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Department of the Army</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 305, 309 (1985). Further, the fact that the performance standard may call for a certain amount of subjective judgment on the part of the employee's supervisor does not automatically invalidate it. <span class="Italic">Melnick v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 93, 99 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 899 F.2d 1228 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute, however, that, in this case, the agency relied on numerical targets, national workload goals, and field office goals as specific indicators of timeliness. Where, as here, an agency relies on numerical targets and goals as specific indicators of satisfactory performance, the appellant is entitled to advance notice that it intends to do so, as well as notice of the method that the agency intends to use to make its determination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Clarke v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 37 M.S.P.R. 63, 66 n.4 (1988) (the agency was required to provide the appellant with sufficient advance notice of expectations when the method that it used to determine whether a standard was met involved comparison of the appellant's error rate with those of other employees during the appraisal period). We find no error in the administrative judge's determination that the agency failed to do so here. Thus, for example, the appellant's supervisor testified at the hearing that, although she determined that the appellant's backlog was excessive by considering the number of cases on the list, the time that they had been on the list, and "whether or not they met the goals," she never informed the appellant whether there was an acceptable backlog amount, and she did not know how the appellant could determine whether he was meeting the agency's other goals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may be able to show that similar performance standards, as supplemented by additional information such as performance expectations and numerical goals, are acceptable in another appeal. Such a showing, however, does not cure the agency's failure to communicate to the appellant the performance standards by which it would determine his level of performance in this case. We concur with the administrative judge's determination in this appeal that the standards for the critical elements were not communicated to the appellant at the beginning of the relevant appraisal period. Thus, we decline to consider the appellant's alleged performance deficiencies under those standards.</p>
