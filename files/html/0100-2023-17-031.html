<section>
<h3 class="h3" id="sec9-32"><span class="space">B.</span> ADVERSE ACTIONS; PERFORMANCE ACTIONS; 5 USC 7121(e)</h3>
<p class="noindent">We consider here the election that an individual who is subjected to an adverse action or performance action must make between statutory appellate procedures, e.g., MSPB, and a contract grievance. Later in this chapter, discussion will focus on the exclusive jurisdiction under 5 USC 7121(f) of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than FLRA, to review arbitration awards involving statutorily-defined adverse actions and performance-based actions that do not involve discrimination. An individual who obtains an arbitration award concerning an adverse action or performance action may have other review routes, including the MSPB and EEOC, or federal district court, when allegations of discrimination are involved, but the review course is then charted outside of and apart from FLRA. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-17-038.html#sec9-39">Awards Involving Adverse Actions and Performance Actions Unreviewable by FLRA: 5 USC 7122, 5 USC 7121(F)</a>" and refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-16-269.html#sec8-269">Election/Preclusion of Remedies; Statutory Appeals; 5 USC 7116, 7121</a>"; refer in this chapter to, "<a href="0100-2023-17-430.html#sec9-430">Section 7121(f) Award</a>," concerning enforcement of arbitration awards that 5 USC 7121(f) places beyond FLRA's direct exceptions review authority.]</p>
<p class="noindent">An employee who seeks to challenge an adverse action or unacceptable performance action must make a choice among remedies. Under 5 USC 7121, a provision that also establishes the standard of review to be used by arbitrators for adverse and unacceptable performance actions:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(e)(1) Matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which also fall within the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures of section 7701 of this title or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. Similar matters which arise under other personnel systems applicable to employees covered by this chapter may, in the discretion of the aggrieved employee, be raised either under the appellate procedures, if any, applicable to those matters, or under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not both. An employee shall be deemed to have exercised his option under this subsection to raise a matter either under the applicable appellate procedures or under the negotiated grievance procedure at such time as the employee timely files a notice of appeal under the applicable appellate procedures or timely files a grievance in writing in accordance with the provisions of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, whichever event occurs first.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;In matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, an arbitrator shall be governed by section 7701(c)(1) of this title, as applicable.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that the employee selects the grievance-arbitration route, the award in an adverse action or unacceptable performance action is then made unreviewable by FLRA through statute. The authority of FLRA to review an arbitration award is found at 5 USC 7122(a). Section 7122 specifically precludes jurisdiction over an award relating to a matter described in 5 USC 7121(f):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Exceptions to Arbitral Awards.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title). If upon review the Authority finds that the award is deficient--</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(1)&#x2003;because it is contrary to any law, rule, or regulation; or</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(2)&#x2003;on other grounds similar to those applied by Federal courts in private sector labor-management relations;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">the Authority may take such action and make such recommendations concerning the award as it considers necessary, consistent with applicable laws, rules, or regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent">Section 7121(f) allows arbitrators' awards of adverse actions under 5 USC 7512 and performance-based actions under 5 USC 4303 to be judicially reviewed as if they were decisions of the MSPB:</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n and Maritime Metal Trades Council</span>, 49 FLRA 1398, 1401-02 (1994), suggested that jurisdiction is measured by the similarity of an action to one that, if it could be appealed to the MSPB, would be reviewable in the <span id="page_1722"></span>Federal Circuit (whether the challenged action reviewed by the arbitrator is in fact reviewed by the circuit or any other court did not seem to be a material consideration):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The matters described in section 7121(f) include serious adverse actions covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, such as removals, as well as similar actions that arise under "other personnel systems." <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, Army and Air Force Exchange Service, Dan Daniels Distribution Center, Newport News, Virginia and National Association of Government Employees</span>, 42 FLRA 175 (1991).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Agency employees are not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, but, instead, are covered under another personnel system, within the meaning of section 7121(f) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission, Balboa, Republic of Panama</span>, 43 FLRA 1483, 1504 n.4 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 1075 (1992). Accordingly, the issue before us is whether the award concerns a matter which is similar to a matter covered under section 7512.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue in the grievance, as framed and addressed by the Arbitrator was whether the Agency misapplied "any provisions of the contract, or any policy or law when it terminated the [g]rievant[.]" In this regard, the Union alleged in its grievance and before the Arbitrator that the Agency terminated the grievant in violation of law and the parties' agreement. As such, if the grievant were an employee subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, the Union's claim could properly have been asserted as the basis for an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 and, following a Board decision, to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513 (providing that the Merit Systems Protection Board has jurisdiction to review, among other actions, contested removals); Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Supplement 296-33, S31-2.m (defining "adverse action" as "a personnel action considered unfavorable to an employee, including removal...taken by an agency against an employee.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the grievance in this case concerns a matter that, if a covered employee were involved, could have been referred to the MSPB and, on appeal, to the United Stated Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the grievance concerns a matter which is similar to a matter covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and, under section 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note, in this connection, that the Authority previously has reviewed awards where, despite a union claim to the contrary, the arbitrator concluded that the grievance involved a matter over which the MSPB lacks jurisdiction. For example, in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2798</span>, 24 FLRA 447 (1986) (<span class="Italic">VA</span>), the union claimed that an employee was terminated in violation of the parties' agreement as well as applicable law and regulation. As in this case, the claim could have been submitted to the MSPB. However, the arbitrator dismissed the grievance on the grounds that the termination was not improper but, instead, merely constituted the expiration of a time-limited appointment. Noting that expirations of such appointments do not constitute adverse actions, the Authority concluded that it had jurisdiction to review the award. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 447 n.1. Insofar as the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">VA</span>, or any other decision, stands for the proposition that the Authority will review an award that otherwise is appealable to the Federal Circuit when an arbitrator determines that the disputed action does not constitute an adverse action, it will no longer be followed. Put simply, we conclude that the existence of Authority jurisdiction to review an award does not properly rest on the outcome of an award but, rather, depends on whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA has no jurisdiction over either an arbitrability decision involving what could be processed as a statutory appeal or a decision on the merits of that grievance. If the arbitrator bifurcates his rulings, the rulings remain parts of one decision on the issue of the grievant's removal and both relate to that removal, a matter covered by 5 USC 7512 and described in &#x00A7; 7121(f), <span class="Italic">USDA, APHIS and Nat'l Ass'n of Agric. Employees</span>, 35 FLRA 998, 999-1003 (1990):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant was removed from her position of Plant Protection and Quarantine Officer, GS-9, for making an unauthorized inquiry into the U.S. Customs Service's Treasury Enforcement Communications System (TECS) computer and disclosing the results of the inquiry to a private individual. The grievant filed a grievance contesting her removal. The Agency contended that the grievance was not grievable or arbitrable under the parties' collective bargaining agreement. The grievance was submitted to arbitration. The parties agreed that the Arbitrator should first resolve the threshold issue of grievability and arbitrability under the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the grievance was grievable and arbitrable under Article 10, Section 1 of the agreement, which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">This article establishes the exclusive procedures available to bargaining unit employees, the Union or the Employer, whereby they may seek consideration of grievances arising out of any and all matters relating to, and within the authority and jurisdiction of the parties to this Agreement, except matters for which a statutory appeal procedure exists or are excluded by statute. Disputes as to whether or not a grievance is precluded by existing statutory appeal procedures and all other disputes of grievability shall be submitted in writing to an arbitrator as a threshold question prior to any hearing on the matter[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator issued an award in which he ruled that the grievant's removal was "grievable under either the procedures of the Merit Systems Protection Board or the grievance and arbitration procedures of the collective bargaining contract between the parties" and that the grievance was "entitled to be considered on the merits."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also ruled that he had jurisdiction to resolve the grievance on the merits.&#x2003;He noted that the Agency representative "had stated his view that if [the Arbitrator] ruled in favor of the Grievant the parties would then determine whether [the Arbitrator], or another [a]rbitrator, should hear the merits of this dispute. [The Agency representative] did not state or indicate in any manner that the Union had agreed with his view of the matter." The Arbitrator further noted that his appointment to the case by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service stated that he "was appointed to hear both the procedural and substantive matters involved in the [grievant's] discharge." The Arbitrator stated that the Union "assumed that if [the Arbitrator] resolved the threshold issue in its favor [the Arbitrator] would thereafter continue in authority to hear and determine the merits of the matter."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator held a hearing and issued an award on the merits of the grievance.&#x2003;He determined that although the grievant committed the act of unauthorized use of the TECS computer terminal and release of the information obtained to an unauthorized person, a penalty of removal was too harsh. He ruled that for a first offense for an employee with the grievant's otherwise good record, any penalty beyond a 3-day suspension would be "arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of discretion." The Arbitrator set aside the removal action and replaced it with a suspension of 3 calendar days. He ordered that the grievant be reinstated to her former position with all references to the removal deleted from her personnel record. He awarded backpay with interest for the period August 8, 1988, the date the grievant filed a formal answer to the Agency's charges, to the date of the grievant's reinstatement. The Arbitrator denied the Agency's request that the cost of the transcript be divided equally between the parties. The Arbitrator granted the grievant's request for attorney fees and retained jurisdiction to determine a reasonable amount of attorney fees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Positions of the Parties</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Agency's Exceptions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed exceptions to the Arbitrator's decision that the grievance was arbitrable and to the Arbitrator's award on the merits. The Agency contends that the parties requested the Arbitrator to resolve only the issue of grievability and arbitrability of the grievance and maintains that the grievability and arbitrability issue is separate from the merits issue which was not properly before the Arbitrator. The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's finding that the grievance is arbitrable is deficient because: (1) it is erroneous and fails to draw its essence from the agreement, which plainly excludes matters for which a statutory appeals procedure exists from the negotiated grievance procedure; (2) it is contrary to law; (3) it is based on a mistake of fact; and (4) the Arbitrator failed to recognize that the Union waived the right to grieve removals.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency maintains that the Arbitrator's erroneous interpretation of the agreement improperly changed the terms of the agreement from those intended by the parties. The Agency argues that if the question of grievability had been presented to an arbitrator for a decision on that issue alone with no decision on the merits, the Authority would consider exceptions under section 7122(a) of the Statute. The Agency states that the Office of Personnel Management advised the Agency that it will not seek judicial review of the award in the case and, consequently, the Agency has no appeal other than to the Authority before the Arbitrator's award becomes final and binding. The Agency asks that the Arbitrator's decision that the grievance was grievable and arbitrable be reversed and the award on the merits be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Union's Opposition</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Agency's exceptions to the Arbitrator's decision holding the grievance to be grievable and arbitrable under the parties' agreement are interlocutory. The Union maintains that the Arbitrator's decision on grievability and arbitrability was the threshold issue leading to the arbitration of the grievance on the merits. The Union also contends that the Authority is without jurisdiction to consider the Agency's exceptions under section 7122(a) of the Statute because the awards relate to a removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, which is a matter described in section 7121(f).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union maintains that, even if considered by the Authority, <span id="page_1723"></span>the Agency's exceptions fail to provide a basis for finding the awards deficient. The Union asserts that the Agency is merely disagreeing with the Arbitrator's interpretation of the agreement to find that the grievant's removal was grievable and arbitrable. The Union contends that the Agency has failed to show that the awards are contrary to any law or that the awards fail to draw their essence from the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also requests that the Authority grant the grievant reasonable attorney fees and costs for the time spent responding to the Agency's exceptions. The Union maintains that the granting of such a request is within the Authority's power under either the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, or under the broad powers granted the Authority under sections 7105 and 7118 of the Statute. In support of its request, the Union asserts that (1) the grievant has incurred attorney fees; (2) the grievant is the prevailing party; (3) the grievant is entitled to fees in the interest of justice; and (4) the grievant can show that the amount of fees requested is reasonable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority Jurisdiction</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that we are without jurisdiction under section 7122(a) of the Statute to review the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(a) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Either party to arbitration under this chapter may file with the Authority an exception to any arbitrator's award pursuant to the arbitration (other than an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The matters described in section 7121(f) include serious adverse actions covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512, such as removals. Review of arbitration awards relating to such matters, like review of decisions of the Merit Systems Protection Board, may be obtained by filing an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not agree with the Agency that the Arbitrator's decision on grievability and arbitrability should be treated separately from his award on the merits of the grievant's removal and is therefore subject to the filing of exceptions under section 7122(a) of the Statute. The threshold issue of grievability and arbitrability is directly connected to and an integral part of the grievance over the removal of the grievant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Baltimore, Maryland and National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council, American Federation of Government Employees</span>, 34 FLRA 79 (1989) (<span class="Italic">INS, Baltimore</span>) (supplemental award resolving request for attorney fees in award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f) is not separate and distinct from the award resolving the section 7121(f) matter); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Armament Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC), Dover, New Jersey and National Federation of Federal Employees (NFFE), Local 1437</span>, 24 FLRA 837 (1986) (award interpreting settlement agreement under which grievant's removal was changed to 6-month suspension related to matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute and was not separate and distinct from original issue of removal).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We do not view the Arbitrator's threshold decision on grievability and arbitrability and the decision on the merits as two separate and distinct awards. Rather, we view the two awards, as did the Arbitrator, as parts of one decision on the issue of the grievant's removal. Because the Arbitrator's two awards relate to the grievant's removal, which is a matter covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and described in section 7121(f), exceptions to the awards may not be filed with the Authority under section 7122(a) of the Statute. Consequently, we are without jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions and we will dismiss them. <span class="Italic">See, for example, American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3627 and Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Region IV</span>, 31 FLRA 1178 (1988); <span class="Italic">International Organization of Masters, Mates, and Pilots, ILA, AFL-CIO, Panama Canal Branch and Panama Canal Commission</span>, 30 FLRA 646 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">APHIS</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, did not mention a result that could be considered to take a different path concerning FLRA review of an arbitrability decision involving an adverse action otherwise appealable to MSPB, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1546 and Sharpe Army Depot</span>, 22 FLRA 60, 60-62 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A grievance over the removal of the grievant was submitted to arbitration at which a preliminary issue as presented of whether the grievance initiated by the Union directly with Commander of the Activity complied with the requirements of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. The Arbitrator determined that the grievance in this case was not the type of grievance properly filed directly with the Commander and that consequently the Union had failed to comply with the requirements of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure in filing the grievance. Accordingly, the Arbitrator ruled that the grievance was not arbitrable and that the merits of the grievance would not be considered.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">EXCEPTION</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the award is deficient because it is incomplete, ambiguous, and contradictory so as to make implementation impossible.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Union's contention, the Authority has advised that to find an award deficient on this basis, there must be a showing that the award is ambiguous or contradictory, or that implementation is impossible, because of the award being unclear in its meaning and effect or because of the award being too uncertain in its effect to be sustained. <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Hospital, Newington, Connecticut and National Association of Government Employees,Local R1-109</span>, 5 FLRA 64 (1981). In this case the Union fails to establish that the Arbitrator's finding the grievance nonarbitrable and refusing to consider the merits is in any manner unclear in its meaning and effect or too uncertain in its effect to be sustained. Instead, this exception constitutes nothing more than disagreement with the Arbitrator's determination that there had not been compliance with the procedural requirements of the negotiated grievance procedure of the parties' collective bargaining agreement. In this respect, the Authority has consistently and repeatedly held that such questions are for resolution by the arbitrator and are not subject to review or challenge before the Authority. <span class="Italic">Headquarters, Fort Sam Houston, Department of the Army and Local 2154, American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO</span>, 15 FLRA 974 (1984). Consequently, the Union's exception provides no basis for finding the award deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*]&#x2003;Although the issue has not been raised by the parties, the Authority confirms its jurisdiction to resolve the Union's exception. Because the Arbitrator's award pertained solely to the question of whether the grievance in this case was filed in accordance with the terms of the parties' agreement, it is not apparent that the award relates to a removal action within the meaning of section 7121(f) and section 7122(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville, Kentucky and Lodge No. 830, International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,</span> 11 FLRA 19, 20 n.3 (1983).</p>
<p class="noindent">Cited in the footnote in <span class="Italic">Sharpe Army Depot was Naval Ordnance Station, Louisville and IAM Lodge 830</span>, 11 FLRA 19, 19-20 (1983):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties submitted to arbitration their dispute of whether a grievance pertaining to the grievant's removal[1] was grievable and arbitrable under the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, which agreement was negotiated under provisions of Executive Order No. 11491.[2] The Arbitrator noted that matters for which a statutory appeals procedure existed were excluded from coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure. Because the Arbitrator determined the grievant's removal was clearly a matter for which a statutory appeals procedure existed within the meaning of the parties' agreement, he ruled that the grievance was not arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;It is not disputed that the grievant's removal is an action covered under 5 U.S.C. 7512.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Although the parties' collective bargaining agreement expired in 1977, provisions of the negotiated grievance procedure were required to be maintained to the extent not modified, terminated, or superseded in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Naval Station, Mayport, Florida and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 2010, AFL-CIO</span>, 6 FLRA No. 26 (1981), at 4; <span class="Italic">Interpretation and Guidance</span>, 2 FLRA 273, 277-78 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its exception the Union contends that the award is contrary to the Statute.&#x2003;Essentially, the Union argues that provisions of the Statute required the Arbitrator to find that after the enactment of the Statute grievances pertaining to removals were within the coverage of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's exception however provides no basis for finding the award deficient. Contrary to the assertion of the Union, it is clear that the enactment of the Statute did not operate to broaden the scope of the parties' negotiated grievance procedure so as to make the otherwise nonarbitrable matter involved in this case arbitrable. <span class="Italic">International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 8 FLRA No. 54 (1982). Accordingly, the Union's exception is denied.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Although the issue has not been raised by the parties, the Authority confirms its jurisdiction to resolve the Union's exception. Because the submitted issue and the Arbitrator's award pertained solely to the question of whether the grievance in this case was grievable and arbitrable under the terms of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, it is not apparent that the award relates to a matter described in section 7121(f) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and American Federation of Government Employees, National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council</span>, 6 FLRA No. 12 (1981), at 2.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 933 and VA Dingell VAMC</span>, 71 FLRA 521, 521 (2020), reiterated that if the matter in arbitration is an adverse action, an arbitrator's ruling on a procedural matter is bound up with the nature of the adverse action grieved, making that ruling unreviewable on exceptions to FLRA:</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1724"></span>The Authority has repeatedly held that an arbitrator's interpretation of procedural issues under the parties' agreement is inextricably intertwined with the original removal action.[9] Here, because the exceptions concern a procedural arbitrability issue under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, the Arbitrator's determination of the procedural issue is dispositive of the removal claim and is, therefore, inextricably intertwined with that claim.[10] Upon full consideration of the circumstances of this case, including the case's similarity to other fully detailed decisions involving the same or similar issues,[11] we conclude that the Union's exceptions are not within the Authority's jurisdiction and we dismiss the Union's exceptions on that ground.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review exceptions to an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in [&#x00A7;] 7121(f)" of the Statute. The matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, which are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4303 or 7512.[4] Arbitration awards resolving these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit), rather than the Authority.[5]</p>

DHS</span>, 793 F.3d 1291, 1294-95 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (<span class="Italic">Appleberry</span>) (noting that the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction to review an arbitral determination of procedural arbitrability in a removal claim). Member Abbott observes that the Agency argues it has no recourse for reviewing the Arbitrator's determination of the procedural issues. However, as noted in <span class="Italic">Appleberry</span>, 793 F.3d at 1294-95, and &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute, the Federal Circuit reviews procedural as well as substantive aspects of the grievance and arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the Authority issued a show&#8209;cause order (SCO) directing the Agency to show cause why its exceptions should not be dismissed because the Authority is without jurisdiction to review exceptions relating to an award pertaining to the removal of the grievant from the Agency. In its timely response to the SCO, the Agency argued that the Authority has jurisdiction over the exceptions because the Arbitrator's award solely concerns a timeliness issue under the parties' agreement that is wholly separate from the removal claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has repeatedly held that an arbitrator's interpretation of procedural issues under the parties' agreement is inextricably intertwined with the original removal action.[9] Here, because the exceptions concern a procedural arbitrability issue under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, the Arbitrator's determination of the procedural issue is dispositive of the removal claim and is, therefore, inextricably intertwined with that claim.[10] Upon full consideration of the circumstances of this case, including the case's similarity to other fully detailed decisions involving the same or similar issues,[11] we conclude that the Agency's exceptions are not within the Authority's jurisdiction and we dismiss the Agency's exceptions on that ground.</p>

<p class="noindent">Varying conclusions may be drawn from the FLRA decisions concerning the reviewability by FLRA of jurisdictional dismissals by arbitrators of grievances involving adverse actions. One problem is defining what constitutes jurisdiction. The Federal Circuit reviews awards dismissing grievances for timeliness issues, without comment on any role by FLRA. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Gunn v. VAMC</span>, 892 F.2d 1036, 1039-40 (Fed. Cir. 1990); (delay in processing grievance); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Muller v. GPO</span>, 809 F.3d 1375, 1381-82 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (contract provision calling for award to be issued within four months from date of request for arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent">Although an arbitrator may issue some type of interim remedy, e.g., a remand of a grievance to the grievance procedure, FLRA will not review an exception to the interim award if the subject matter of the grievance is excluded from FLRA review under &#x00A7; 7122(a). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Army Training Ctr. Eng'rs and NAGE Local R14-32</span>, 6 FLRA 7, 7 (1981). An award that resolves more than one dispute may leave an issue within and an issue outside the review jurisdiction of FLRA. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Phoenix Dist. and NTEU, Chap. 33</span>, 43 FLRA 686, 690-91 (1991) (reviewing award concerning information request and declining to review award of witness fees incurred in course of arbitration over demotion). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2206 and SSA, Southeast Program Service Center</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-181.html">71 FLRA 938</a> (2020) (declining to separate out an information request denial associated with a removal case heard in arbitration).</p>
<p class="noindent">If under &#x00A7; 7122 FLRA lacks jurisdiction of an award relating to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f), the scope of the remedy directed by the arbitrator does not vest jurisdiction in FLRA to review the award, even though the award may not be otherwise reviewable at the instance of the agency, e.g., a removal case, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, BIA and Indian Educators Fed. Local 4526</span>, 65 FLRA 5, 6-7 (2010) (over the dissent of Member Beck):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with, a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013</span>, 60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one reviewable by the MSPB, and, on appeal, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See id.; Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 49 FLRA 1398, 1402 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this precedent, we conclude that the award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. The sole claim advanced in arbitration was that the grievant was improperly removed from his position as an Irrigation System Operator. The Arbitrator's determination that the grievant was improperly removed resolved that claim. In these circumstances, we find that the award relates to the grievant's removal for purposes of &#x00A7; 7121(f). <span class="Italic">See U.S. EPA, Narragansett, R.I.,</span> 59 FLRA 591, 592 (2004). Accordingly, we conclude that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent's position that we should exercise jurisdiction in this case is inconsistent with the plain language of the Statute. Section 7122(a) of the Statute specifically provides that the Authority lacks jurisdiction over "an award relating to a matter described in section 7121(f)[.]" It is clear, and undisputed by the dissent, that the award in this case relates to the grievant's removal, a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f). Indeed, as the dissent acknowledges, "[t]he issue to be addressed, as expressly framed by the Arbitrator, relates only to the grievant's removal[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent's concerns with the breadth of the Arbitrator's remedy and the absence of a forum in which the Agency can challenge the award do not provide a legal foundation for Authority jurisdiction. In the dissent's view, the Arbitrator's determinations went beyond what was necessary to resolve the propriety of the grievant's removal. In addition, the dissent <span id="page_1725"></span>is concerned that unless the Authority exercises jurisdiction, the Agency may not have a forum in which to challenge the award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the breadth of the remedy, Authority precedent explicitly directs that "the existence of Authority jurisdiction to review an award does not properly rest on the outcome of an award but, rather, depends on whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit." <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n,</span> 49 FLRA at 1402; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">PTO, </span>61 FLRA at 478-79 (noting, among other things, the Statute's legislative history "confirm[ing] that the statutory scheme of which &#x00A7; 7122(a) is a part was specifically designed to promote consistency and uniformity of process and to discourage forum shopping."). As discussed above, the claim advanced in arbitration went to the propriety of the grievant's removal. We therefore reject the dissent's reliance on the award's outcome as a basis for asserting jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the dissent's reluctance to risk leaving the Agency without a forum to challenge the award's outcome does not provide a foundation for overcoming the jurisdictional restrictions of &#x00A7; 7122(a). As the Authority has stated: "We recognize that our refusal to assert jurisdiction may leave the Agency without a forum to challenge the Arbitrator's award....Nevertheless, we conclude that the advancement of the Congressional policies of uniformity, discouragement of forum shopping, and avoidance of multiple litigation, as well as the need for clarity and predictability on questions concerning jurisdiction, clearly override any potential for unreviewable awards." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn.,</span> 53 FLRA 440, 443 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also PTO,</span> 61 FLRA at 478 (noting that "[a]s a general matter,...under the statutory scheme enacted by Congress, there may be some awards that are not reviewable at all." (citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent">The analysis under &#x00A7; 7122(a) and &#x00A7; 7121(f) can become esoteric. Even if the grievance is initiated by the union, rather than the aggrieved employee, the statutory election (or review preclusion) applies. It matters not that the case could go but did not get to the MSPB. Nor does it matter that the issue presented in the grievance, e.g., a dispute over the interpretation of a contract article, would be outside the ordinary appellate jurisdiction of the MSPB as long as the MSPB could consider that issue as to a disputed personnel action with the Board's jurisdiction. The analytical elements were considered in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 58 FLRA 476, 477-78 (2003). The agency determined decided that the grievant was unfit for duty because he was intoxicated and he was sent home with leave to return to work only when he completed rehabilitation. A grievance was filed disputing the agency's determination to preclude the employee from returning to work. Subsequently, the grievant was indefinitely suspended. The grievance concerning the bar to the employee's return to work was submitted to an arbitrator, who sustained the grievance and directed that the grievant be returned with backpay. The agency filed exceptions, and FLRA declined to consider those exceptions based on the statutory election scheme:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review an arbitration award "relating to a matter described in section 7121(f)" of the Statute. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include serious adverse actions, such as suspensions for more than 14 days, which are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512<span class="Italic">. See United States DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed.</span> <span class="Italic">Det. Ctr., Miami, Fla., </span>57 FLRA 677, 678 (2002) <span class="Italic">(Bureau of Prisons). </span>Arbitration awards resolving these matters are reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than the Authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f) and &#x00A7; 7703. The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with, a &#x00A7; 4303 or &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Transp., FAA, </span>57 FLRA 580,581 (2001). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is reviewable by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, </span>57 FLRA at 678; <span class="Italic">United States</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Agric., Forest Serv., N. Region, Idaho Panhandle Nat'l Forests, </span>49 FLRA 1582, 1587-88 (1994); <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Comm'n, </span>49 FLRA 1398, 1402 (1994).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this precedent, we conclude that the award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. In so doing, we reject the Agency's argument that the Authority "should look at the issue being grieved" to determine its jurisdiction. It is well established that the Authority looks at the claim advanced in arbitration, not the grievance, when determining its jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Bureau of</span> <span class="Italic">Prisons, </span>57 FLRA at 678; <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dep't of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army, Fort Polk, La., </span>44 FLRA 1548, 1552 (1992) (looking at claim advanced in arbitration, rather than grievance form, in determining whether award concerned the classification of a position). Consequently, we also reject the Agency's arguments that we have jurisdiction because the indefinite suspension occurred after the initial grievance was filed and because the Union filed the initial grievance in its own behalf. These facts are not relevant to determining whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one that would be reviewed by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' stipulation of the issue to be resolved in arbitration demonstrates that the claim advanced there was whether management violated applicable procedures in concluding that the grievant was permanently unfit for duty. The MSPB routinely reviews fitness for duty determinations when resolving disputes concerning enforced leave periods of more than 14 days, based on an employee's fitness for duty status.[4] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gribcheck v. United States Postal Service, </span>87 M.S.P.R. 473, 481 (2001). In fact, the MSPB reviewed the grievant's fitness for duty determination in reviewing his indefinite suspension. Thus, the arbitration award resolves a matter that would be, and indeed was, reviewed by the MSPB.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The MSPB also routinely resolves disputes over indefinite suspensions before a notice of indefinite suspension is issued<span class="Italic">. See, eg, Higgins v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 447, 451 para. 7 (2000) (employee's involuntary absence from work for more than 14 days held a constructive suspension appealable to the MSPB). As such, it is irrelevant that the Agency's notice of the indefinite suspension in this case was issued to the grievant after the grievance was filed. Put simply, the grievant could have filed an appeal with the MSPB any time after he had been barred from work for 14 days and that he did so only after receiving the Agency's notice does not change the facts that: (1) the Agency's refusal to permit the grievant to return to work is part and parcel of the subsequent notice of indefinite suspension; and (2) the grievance was filed before the MSPB appeal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In reaching this conclusion, we reject the Agency's argument that the claim before the Arbitrator concerned only "an alleged contract violation [which] can easily be separated from the indefinite suspension." The parties' stipulated issue expressly ties the alleged contract violation to the grievant's fitness for duty status. Moreover, it is undisputed that the grievant's fitness for duty status was the sole basis for his indefinite suspension. Therefore, the propriety of the fitness for duty determination is essential to whether the grievant's indefinite suspension was proper, and the issues are not separate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency's assertions that it will be left with conflicting decisions and that the Union will have "two bites at the apple" do not vest the Authority with jurisdiction. While the Agency is correct that, under &#x00A7; 7121(e) of the Statute, actions like the one here may be reviewed by either an arbitrator or the MSPB, but not both, the fact remains that after review in either forum, the Federal Circuit--not the Authority--has exclusive jurisdiction to review the resulting decision.[5] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f) and &#x00A7; 7703(d). Consequently, the Authority is without power to consider the merits of the Agency's claim concerning the grievant's representation to the MSPB.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Authority lacks jurisdiction to review the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;Section 7121(d), which provides that prohibited personnel practices under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1) may be reviewed by either an arbitrator or in a statutory appeal, but not both, has no similar bar to Authority jurisdiction. Thus, the fact that the Authority reviews awards involving &#x00A7; 7121(d) matters is irrelevant in this case. Put simply, pursuant to &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7121(f) and 7122(a), the Authority <span class="Italic">never</span> has jurisdiction over &#x00A7; 7121(e) matters; the Authority <span class="Italic">always </span>has jurisdiction over &#x00A7; 7121(d) matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;This is distinct from the Authority's approach to resolving questions of procedural arbitrability, where the Authority has jurisdiction to review, but nevertheless <span class="Italic">denies on the merits, </span>exceptions to awards. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., AFGE, Local 2921,</span> 50 FLRA 184, 185-86 (1995). Under &#x00A7; 7121(f), the Authority has no jurisdiction <span class="Italic">without regard to the merits </span>of a claim.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award involving a challenge to enforced leave exceeding 14 days was beyond FLRA's jurisdiction because it involved a matter within the adverse action jurisdiction of the MSPB. <span class="Italic">NARA and AFGE Local 2578</span>, 70 FLRA 277, 278 (2017) ("Further, when such periods of enforced leave are greater than fourteen days, they are suspensions under &#x00A7; 7512 and are reviewable by the MSPB and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. Moreover, to determine whether an agency 'enforced' leave--that is, placed an employee on leave 'against [the employee's] will'--the MSPB has held that the employee's ability to perform essential duties 'is <span class="Italic">immaterial</span>. Rather, the only question is whether the employee's placement in a leave status was voluntary or involuntary.'"). <span class="Italic">But see Bureau of Prisons FCC Petersburg and AFGE Local 2052</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v72/72-92.html">72 FLRA 477</a> (2021) (Chairman DuBester and Member Abbott concurring) (reviewing an award involving an employee placed on LWOP during evaluation of medical fitness and accommodation request; the decision did not state how long the period of LWOP was, but the facts would suggest that period exceeded 14 days).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA concluded that events that are separately grievable, but that were a prelude to a removal that could be appealed to the MSPB, were not precluded from being arbitrated when the arbitrator stated that the removal was not before him and that the merits of the removal were not addressed in the award. <span class="Italic">See DHHS, Gallup Indian Med. Ctr. and LIUNA Local 1376</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-045.html">60 FLRA 202</a>, 204 (2004). In a decision that was better explained, <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 65 FLRA 615, 616-17 (2011), the union president's termination <span id="page_1726"></span>was appealed to the MSPB, but the discontinuation of the union president's access to the agency's computer system was grieved to arbitration. The award concerning system access was properly within FLRA's review authority, for the system access was a matter that was not bound up with the termination of employment:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute, the Authority lacks jurisdiction to resolve exceptions to awards "relating to" a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) of the Statute. Matters described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) include adverse actions, such as removals, that are covered under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 and are appealable to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and reviewable by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va.,</span> 61 FLRA 476, 477 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority directed the Agency to show cause why its exceptions should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to &#x00A7; 7122(a) of the Statute because the award "concerns a matter that could be considered 'inextricably intertwined' with a removal[.]" In its response, the Agency asserts that "the loss of computer access is not an 'adverse action' appealable to the MSPB[,]" and that the Union "brought a separate grievance related to the [President's] proposed removal...." Further, the Agency maintains that "the MSPB reviewed [the President's] termination, issued a decision, and did not address [the President's] computer access." Finally, the Agency contends that the present matter of "whether the Agency may remove a [U]nion member's or officer's computer access...is not inextricably intertwined with [the President's] termination."<span class="Italic"> </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will determine that an award relates to a matter described in &#x00A7; 7121(f) "when it resolves, or is inextricably intertwined with," a &#x00A7; 7512 matter. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1013</span>, 60 FLRA 712, 713 (2005). In making that determination, the Authority looks not to the outcome of the award, but to whether the claim advanced in arbitration is one reviewable by the MSPB, and, on appeal, by the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The Authority has found that an award was inextricably intertwined with a removal where, for example, "the MSPB or an arbitrator w[ould] examine the propriety of an [absence without leave (AWOL)] charge in determining whether an employee was lawfully removed based on such a charge." <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Med. Ctr., Newington, Conn., </span>53 FLRA 440, 443 (1997) (<span class="Italic">Newington</span>). The Authority has also found that a supplemental award that specifically granted remedies for an unlawful removal was inextricably intertwined with the removal. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin.</span>, 57 FLRA 580, 581 (2001) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). The fact that a grievant has separately challenged his or her removal before the MSPB is not dispositive of whether the award is inextricably intertwined with the removal. <span class="Italic">See Newington</span>, 53 FLRA at 441.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the stipulated issue before the Arbitrator was whether "the Agency violate[d] the contract when it removed [the grievant's] computer access[?]" The Arbitrator expressly noted that "[a]t the time of the hearing in the instant matter, [the grievant's] discharge was [before the MSPB] and [as of] yet unresolved[,]" and his award did not address whether the President's removal was proper. As such, we find that the award does not resolve a &#x00A7; 7512 matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to whether the grievance is inextricably intertwined with the grievant's removal, in contrast to <span class="Italic">Newington</span>, the action at issue here--termination of system access--is not a basis for the removal. In fact, there is no dispute that the termination of system access occurred <span class="Italic">after </span>the grievant's removal. Moreover, the award specifically provides a remedy for the President's loss of system access--not for her removal. <span class="Italic">See FAA</span>, 57 FLRA at 581. As such, we find that the award is not inextricably intertwined with the President's removal and, therefore, the Authority has jurisdiction over the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator could find nonarbitrable a grievance over an AWOL charge that was reviewed by MSPB as part of a removal action against an employee. The charge could not be extricated from the removal action and relitigated without regard to the removal action that was beyond his jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 169 and Tinker AFB, Air Logistics Ctr., Oklahoma City</span>, 7 FLRA 27, 29 (1981).</p>
<p class="noindent">When a ULP charge is filed concerning a proposed action that, if imposed through an agency decision that would be within the jurisdiction of the MSPB, matters become complex as to FLRA's jurisdiction over the ULP.
