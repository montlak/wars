<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-152"><span class="space">11.</span> Failure to Provide Medical Information; Position Requirement</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Archerda v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 314, 322-29 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-35, 2014 MSPB 49 (2014), an employee is properly the subject of adverse action whose position has medical standards and who fails to comply with legitimate requests from the agency for medical information pertaining to his ability to meet those standards. If the agency's request for information is appropriate, the adverse action does not constitute disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's finding in the initial decision, the agency's instructions in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information were proper. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]n agency may require an individual who has applied for or occupies a position which has medical standards or physical requirements or which is part of an established medical evaluation program, to report for a medical examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;[o]n a regularly recurring, periodic basis after appointment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that, as a Firefighter, the appellant occupied a position which had medical standards and physical requirements. [<span class="Italic">Classification &#x0026; Qualifications, General Schedule Qualification Standards, Fire Protection and Prevention Series</span>, 0081, OPM.GOV, <a href="http://www.opm.gov/policy-dataoversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/fire-protection-and-prevention-series-0081/">http://www.opm.gov/policy-dataoversight/classification-qualifications/general-schedule-qualification-standards/0000/fire-protection-and-prevention-series-0081/</a> (last visited May 13, 2014).] Accordingly, the agency had authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(2) to require the appellant to report to a periodic medical examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's position as a Firefighter required him to function without supervision while under extreme stress in emergency lifesaving situations <span id="Page_2624"></span>and as the sole medical authority available. As part of his duties, he was responsible for assessing any particular emergency situation to establish medical priorities without advice or direction and for directing any personnel present and the movement of equipment to effect life-saving operations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency physician and the agency physician assistant who conducted the appellant's periodic medical examination on September 21, 2010, testified that they needed medical documentation from the VA relating to the appellant's military disability retirement in order to complete the medical examination and to find that the appellant had the continuing capacity to meet the physical and medical requirements of his position. In particular, the agency physician and agency physician assistant testified that they had significant concerns about the appellant's PTSD and the reasons for his retirement from the U.S. Air Force as a Reservist Firefighter. The agency physician testified that a 50 percent VA disability rating based on PTSD, as reported by the appellant during a September 2, 2010 examination, represented a significant social and/or cognizant impairment for a chronic relapsing disorder. The physician explained that the appellant had changed medications by his September 2010 examination and was taking a number of significant psychotropic drugs that could cause fatigue and affect coordination and cognitive memories. He explained that, because PTSD symptoms ebb and flow, the ongoing use of these medications indicated significant, and possibly worsening, symptoms. He further testified that, although he had reviewed a February 9, 2010 letter from the appellant's physician, it lacked the details necessary for the agency clinic to evaluate the appellant objectively for safety-sensitive duties in light of the diagnosed PTSD. The physician also explained that a diagnosis and PTSD rating alone were insufficient to determine whether the appellant was impaired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the appellant failed to comply with the clinic's request that he provide information relating to his military disability retirement, the agency issued the appellant a March 8, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information, followed by a June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information, seeking this information. Specifically, the agency stated in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information that an agency physician assistant and an agency physician needed further information regarding the reason for the appellant's disability retirement from the U.S. Air Force Reserve and the supporting documentation to ensure the appellant met the standards of his position as a Firefighter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency was entitled to request medical documentation related to the appellant's military disability retirement as part of the periodic medical examination, and he was obligated to provide the documentation as part of his duty to cooperate with the examination. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.102(c) (an employee may face an adverse action if he refuses "to be examined in accordance with a proper agency order"). Moreover, the agency's request for the disability retirement documentation from the appellant in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information was job-related and consistent with business necessity and was narrowly tailored to its specific concerns regarding the appellant's ability to meet the requirements of his Firefighter position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.103 (actions under 5 C.F.R. Part 339 must be consistent with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations, citing to the predecessor to the current ADA regulations); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c) (generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination must be "job-related and consistent with business necessity," and an employer "may make inquiries into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions"). Because the agency's request for additional medical documentation was job-related and necessary to make an informed management decision, the agency was authorized to require the appellant to produce medical information relating to a psychiatric condition, and to discipline the appellant for refusal to do so. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scott v. Napolitano</span>, 717 F. Supp.2d 1071, 1083-85 (S.D. Cal. 2010) (recognizing that an employer does not violate the ADA by conducting a narrowly tailored mental examination where there is a reasonable concern about an employee's mental health, but finding the particular questions posed to be broader and more intrusive than necessary). Accordingly, under the circumstances in this case, we find that the agency's request for the appellant's medical documentation in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information was proper.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In the initial decision, the administrative judge cited to <span class="Italic">Doe v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579 (2012), in finding that the agency's instructions in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information were not proper. However, <span class="Italic">Doe</span> is inapposite to this case because the appellant in <span class="Italic">Doe</span> was not subject to medical standards or physical requirements. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6; 28. Unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Doe</span>, the appellant in the instant case was subject to periodic medical examinations under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 339.301(b)(2). <span class="Italic">See Doe</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 579, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 27-28 (distinguishing situations involving medical standards or physical requirements)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prove a charge of failure to follow instructions, the agency must also establish that the employee failed to follow the instructions at issue. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. at 556. Here, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant failed to follow the instructions in the June 20, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information. In the June 20, 2011 instructions, the agency asked that the appellant submit the following information from his physician: (1) a history of the appellant's medical condition; (2) a diagnosis and prognosis, including an estimated date of full or partial recovery, if any; (3) identification of specific restrictions, which related to the attached position description; and (4) a determination of whether the appellant was able to perform in a light duty capacity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant argues both below and on review that he submitted a February 9, 2010 letter from his physician, the administrative judge properly found that this letter did not provide the medical information requested by the agency. Although the letter explained the medications the appellant was taking to manage his PTSD, it did not provide a history of his medical condition and a diagnosis and prognosis, or set forth any restrictions associated with the attached position description.[4] Because the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to follow the instructions as set forth in the specification listed by the agency in support of its charge. <span class="Italic">See Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987); <span class="Italic">see also Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 106 (1997). Based on the foregoing, we sustain the agency's charge of failure to follow instructions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The February 9, 2010 letter indicated that the appellant's condition did not interfere with use of certain equipment or with driving. However, it neither affirmatively stated that the PTSD caused no other restrictions related to his position nor represented that he had no such additional restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency established nexus and that the penalty of removal was reasonable.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has met its burden to establish nexus here because the charge of failure to follow instructions relates directly to the efficiency of the appellant's service. <span class="Italic">See Howarth v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 1, 7 (1997) (finding that there was nexus between the appellant's refusal to comply with the agency's legitimate instruction to submit for alcohol testing and the efficiency of the service because failure to follow instructions inherently affects the agency's ability to carry out its mission). Furthermore, as discussed below, we find that the agency-imposed penalty of removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where, as here, all of the agency's charges have been sustained, the Board will review an agency-imposed penalty only to determine if the agency considered all of the relevant factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Woebcke v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 7 (2010); <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 306 (1981). In determining whether the selected penalty is reasonable, the Board gives due deference to the agency's discretion in exercising its managerial function of maintaining employee discipline and efficiency. <span class="Italic">Woebcke</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6; 7. The Board recognizes that its function is not to displace management's responsibility or to decide what penalty it would impose but to assure that management judgment has been properly exercised and that the penalty selected by the agency does not exceed the maximum limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board will modify a penalty only when it finds that the agency failed to weigh the relevant factors or that the penalty the agency imposed clearly exceeded the bounds of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing the record in this case, we find that the deciding official properly considered the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in making his penalty determination, including the nature and seriousness of the offense, the appellant's position as a Firefighter, the appellant's past disciplinary record, the clarity of being on notice, and the potential for rehabilitation. Regarding the nature and seriousness of the offense, the deciding official stated that the agency needed the medical documentation requested in the June 21, 2011 Request for Additional Medical Information to make an informed decision regarding whether the appellant could be returned to full duty. The deciding official also considered that the appellant had recently been suspended for 14 days for failure to follow instructions regarding his medical clearance. The deciding official also considered mitigating factors, including the appellant's length of service and performance on the job. In this regard, the deciding official noted that the appellant had an excellent work record with a long history of "fully successful performance." The deciding official, however, found that these mitigating factors did not outweigh the seriousness of the appellant's misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the deciding official considered <span id="Page_2625"></span>the relevant <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors and that the agency properly exercised management discretion in imposing the penalty. Thus, under the circumstances in this case, we find that the penalty of removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (1999) (finding that the administrative judge erred in mitigating a penalty of removal for failure to follow instructions and fiscal irregularities based solely on the employee's years of service and his satisfactory performance); <span class="Italic">Thompson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 41, 46 (1991) (finding removal to be a reasonable penalty where the appellant failed to follow his supervisor's instructions), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 965 F.2d 1065 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The appellant failed to establish his claim of disability discrimination.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his cross petition for review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge erred in denying his affirmative defense of disability discrimination. In finding that the appellant failed to establish his affirmative defense of disability discrimination, the administrative judge applied a disparate treatment analysis. However, to the extent that the appellant is asserting that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of his disability by requiring him to submit medical documentation regarding his PTSD, the administrative judge should have applied a different standard to the appellant's claim. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01992682, 2001 WL 1526433, at *3-*4 (E.E.O.C. Nov. 20, 2001) (finding that the administrative judge erred in applying a disparate treatment analysis to an employee's claim that the agency discriminated against him by requiring him to undergo a fitness-for-duty examination); <span class="Italic">see also Southerland v. Department of Defense</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 20 (2013) (the Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law). Specifically, as discussed below, the administrative judge should have determined whether the agency's medical inquiry was "job-related and consistent with business necessity." <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 2001 WL 1526433, at *4. For the following reasons, we find the appellant has not prevailed on his disability discrimination claim under this standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"The ADA imposes significant restrictions on an employer's freedom to make medical inquiries of employees." <span class="Italic">Watkins v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01981800, 2001 WL 1097442, at *2 (E.E.O.C. Aug. 29, 2001). Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d)(4)(A), an employer "shall not require a medical examination and shall not make inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity." The EEOC has promulgated regulations implementing this statutory provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a disability-related inquiry or medical examination may be "job-related and consistent with business necessity" if an employer "has a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that: (1) an employee's ability to perform essential job functions will be impaired by a medical condition; or (2) an employee will pose a direct threat due to a medical condition." <span class="Italic">Watkins</span>, 2001 WL 1097442, at *2. "Direct threat means a significant risk of substantial harm to the health or safety of the individual or others that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(r).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is the employer's burden to show that its disability-related inquiries and requests for examination are job-related and consistent with business necessity. <span class="Italic">Watkins</span>, 2001 WL 1097442, at *2. The appellant alleges that the agency regarded him as disabled, and therefore he is an individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA. However, the ADA's restrictions on disability-related inquiries and medical examinations apply to individuals both with and without disabilities. <span class="Italic">Watkins</span>, 2001 WL 1097442, at *2. Therefore, the appellant is protected by these restrictions regardless of whether he qualifies as disabled within the meaning of the ADA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review of the record, we find that the agency has met its burden of showing that its June 20, 2011 instructions to the appellant were job-related and consistent with business necessity. The agency has not presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the second prong, that it had a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the appellant posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. There is no evidence that the appellant was violent or posed a significant risk of substantial harm. <span class="Italic">See Clark</span>, 2001 WL 1526433, at *4 (finding that the agency failed to show that the complainant posed a direct threat due to a medical condition where there was no evidence that the complainant was physically violent or would do any harm). However, as discussed below, the agency has shown that it had a reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the appellant was unable to perform the essential job functions of his Firefighter position due to his PTSD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Record and testimonial evidence indicates that the appellant suffered from, and was being treated for, PTSD since at least 2009. As previously noted, the agency issued its June 20, 2011 instructions requesting information relating to the appellant's PTSD. An agency physician and physician assistant testified that they needed additional information to medically clear the appellant based on their significant concerns regarding his PTSD and the reasons for his retirement from the U.S. Air Force as a Reservist Firefighter. The agency physician further testified that, although he had reviewed a February 9, 2010 letter from the appellant's physician, the letter lacked the details necessary for the agency clinic to objectively evaluate the appellant for safety-sensitive duties in light of the diagnosed PTSD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has shown that it had a reasonable belief that the appellant was unable to perform the essential job functions of his Firefighter position due to his PTSD. In particular, the documentation provided by the appellant did not provide sufficient information regarding his PTSD and whether he was impaired. <span class="Italic">See Calicott v. Potter</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A01169, 2003 WL 21634364, at *2 (E.E.O.C. Jul. 2, 2003) (finding that the agency had a sufficient basis for ordering a fitness-for-duty examination where the medical documentation provided by the employee lacked relevant facts and information regarding his current medical status). The agency had a sufficient basis for seeking clarification about the appellant's PTSD based on the agency physician's and the physician assistant's significant concerns regarding the appellant's psychiatric condition. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency's June 20, 2011 instructions to the appellant were job-related and consistent with business necessity, the agency did not violate 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(d) and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1630.13(b), 1630.14(c), when it ordered the appellant to submit medical documentation relating to his PTSD.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Thus, the appellant's refusal to meet with her supervisor was not an isolated incident, as the appellant suggests. Instead, it was part of a pattern of inappropriate behavior that the appellant had been exhibiting for months. Given these circumstances, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that the agency did not violate the ADAAA by ordering the FFD examinations. Therefore, we find that the appellant failed to prove her disability discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency's request for medical information is overbroad and an action based on the failure to provide information is later reversed, the agency may find that it has committed a violation of the Rehabilitation Act, <span class="Italic">Litton v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency contends that it proved that its disability-related inquiries were job-related and consistent with business necessity, we disagree.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency's inquiries were not due to any reasonable belief, based on objective evidence, that the appellant's ability to perform his essential job functions was impaired by a medical condition or that he posed a direct threat due to a medical condition. Rather, the inquiries were part of a general policy applying to all similarly situated employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Conroy v. New York State Department of Correctional Services</span>, 333 F.3d 88, 97-98, 100-01 (2d Cir. 2003) (distinguishing between disability-related inquiries to all employees arising from generally applicable policies and inquiries directed at an individual employee based on particular facts relating to that employee). The EEOC's Enforcement Guidance appears to permit such generally applicable policies and inquiries under certain circumstances. For example, an employer generally may not ask all employees what prescription medications they are taking. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Enforcement Guidance: Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Examinations of Employees under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Notice 915.002, Question 8, 2000 WL 33407181, at *9 (July 27, 2000) (Enforcement Guidance). Nevertheless, relevant provisions of the Enforcement Guidance provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Asking all employees about their use of prescription medications is not job-related and consistent with business necessity. In limited circumstances, however, certain employers may be able to demonstrate that it is job-related and consistent with business necessity to require employees in positions affecting public safety to report when they are taking medication that may affect their ability to perform essential functions. <span class="Italic">Under these limited circumstances, an employer must be able to demonstrate that an employee's inability or impaired ability to perform essential functions will result in a direct threat</span>. For example, a police department could require armed officers to report when they are taking medications that may affect their ability to use a firearm or to perform other essential functions of their job. Similarly, an airline could require its pilots to report when they are taking any medications that may impair their ability to fly. A fire department, however, could not require fire department employees who perform only administrative duties to report their use of medications because it is unlikely that it could show that these employees would pose a direct threat as a result of their inability or impaired ability to perform their essential job functions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (italics and bold in original). Similarly, the Enforcement Guidance provides that employers may require periodic medical examinations of employees in positions affecting public safety, such as police officers and firefighters, in "limited circumstances" if they are "narrowly tailored to address specific job-related concerns." Enforcement Guidance, Question 18, 2000 WL 33407181, at *14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant questions on the SF-93 asked the appellant to describe his "Present Health" and list his "Current Medication[s]," as well as to disclose whether he had consulted with or been treated by clinics, physicians, healers, or other practitioners within the past 5 years for other than minor illnesses. Asking an employee whether he is taking prescription drugs or medication or questions seeking information about illnesses, mental conditions, or other impairments an employee has or had in the past triggered the ADA's, and hence the Rehabilitation Act's, protections. <span class="Italic">Lee v. City of Columbus</span>, 636 F.3d 245, 254 (6th Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">see Miller v. Whirlpool Corp</span>., 807 F. Supp.2d 684, 685-87 (N.D. Ohio 2011). The administrative judge found that the agency put forward no evidence or argument showing how these inquiries were job-related and consistent with business necessity. The agency asserts on review that the duties of Special Agents include providing updates on medical health and medications, the SF-93 is a Government-wide form used as part of a fitness-for-duty examination, and it had a "business necessity in obtaining on a regular basis medical information about its Special Agents." Nevertheless, the agency has not explained the business necessity in asking an employee like the appellant for a list of all current medications taken and all treatment that did not involve minor illnesses. The agency has not shown that these inquiries were narrowly tailored to address specific job-related concerns, such as asking whether Special Agents were taking medications that may affect their ability to perform the essential functions of their positions. Under these circumstances, the agency has not shown that the broad inquiries at issue in this case were job-related and consistent with business necessity, and thus, has not shown error by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Roe v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching our determination, we do not hold that a law enforcement agency cannot make inquiries regarding an employee's health.
