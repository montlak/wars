<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-40"><span class="space">3.</span> Overtime Distribution</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal requiring strict adherence to an overtime roster, particularly where the employees on the roster did not perform the same duties, violated management's reserved right to assign work. <span class="Italic">IAM and Dept. of Treasury, Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing</span>, 33 FLRA 711, 728-29 (1988) (Proposal 8). A proposal requiring assignment of overtime work fairly and equally among employees on the basis of their standing on overtime rosters was nonnegotiable when not all unit employees performed the same duties and the effect of the proposal was to require management to assign employees to overtime work if the work to be performed was different from that normally assigned to the employees. The proposal interfered with the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Int'l Council of Marshals Serv. Locals and DOJ, Marshals Serv.</span>, 11 FLRA 672, 675-76 (1983). Management was not required to bargain over a proposal that on-call status be equally rotated among all employees in a department. The proposal did not permit management to select employees for duty status based on their specific specialized skills and knowledges of procedures and techniques within the nursing profession. <span class="Italic">VA Staff Nurses Council, Local 5032 and VAMC, Wood</span>, 29 FLRA 849, 863 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not negotiable that allowed exceptions to an overtime rotational system only when the union agreed that specific projects required special employees with special expertise. That proposal deprived management of the right to determine the qualifications needed to perform work. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 and Dept. of Army, Army Publications Distrib. Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 32 FLRA 1006, 1009-10 (1988). A uniform standard establishing the qualifications that employees must meet for assignment to overtime work interfered with management's right to assign work and failed an arrangements test because the proposal allowed no exceptions. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 900 and Dept. of Army, Army Reserve Personnel Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 46 FLRA 1494, 1504-05 (1993) (Provision 2: "qualified" to mean employees who, for the preceding 60 days, performed satisfactorily within performance standards). An unusual proposal, requiring overtime assignments for those employees performing at the fully successful level, was declared nonnegotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 and Dept. of Army, Army Publications Distrib. Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 32 FLRA 1006, 1008 (1988). The proposal <span id="page_645"></span>conflicted with management's right to determine the particular qualifications needed for assignment of work, violating 5 USC 7106(a)(2)(B).</p>
<p class="noindent">Outside the duty to bargain was a proposal that the agency equitably distribute involuntary overtime and attempt to make allowances for the demonstrated hardship of individual employees whenever possible. The "attempt to make allowances" provision imposed a substantive condition on the right of management to assign work. Management was required to show that it assessed whether assignments would cause hardships for particular employees and that allowances were attempted. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 226-29 (1987) (Proposal 5). A proposal was nonnegotiable that management train employees as necessary for overtime assignments so as to ensure uniform distribution of overtime. The training requirement violated management's right to assign work. The proposal was not evaluated as an arrangement. <span class="Italic">NTEU and PTO</span>, 53 FLRA 539 (1997).</p>
<p class="noindent">Deemed nonnegotiable as a means to reduce involuntary overtime was a proposal, considered by FLRA to excessively interfere with the right to perform work, that required a certain level of supervisory coverage that would otherwise be filled through overtime assignments of unit employees, <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 66 FLRA 658, 658, 661-62 (2012) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Coverage for operations supervisors/front[-]line managers who are on regular days off (RDOs), leave of any kind, official travel, and official details will not be provided by A11 [unit employees] in order to reduce the adverse impact of working forced overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because Proposal 1 is not outside the duty to bargain on the basis that it affects supervisors' conditions of employment, we must consider the Agency's argument that Proposal 1 is nonnegotiable because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work. The right to assign work encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA 1049, 1050 (2001) (<span class="Italic">Local 3529</span>). Here, the Union concedes that Proposal 1 affects the Agency's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See</span> Response at 2 ("[t]he Union acknowledges that its proposal[ ] interfere[s] with management's right to assign work"). Therefore, we must consider whether Proposal 1 is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The framework for determining whether a proposal is within the duty to bargain under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) is set out in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-87,</span> 21 FLRA 24 (1986). Under that framework, the Authority initially determines whether a proposal is intended to be an "arrangement" for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 31. If a proposal is an arrangement, the Authority then determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. At 31-33. The Authority makes this determination by weighing "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to ascertain whether the benefit to employees flowing from the proposal outweighs the proposal's burden on the exercise of the management right or rights involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At 31-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming that Proposal 1 constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, we agree with the Agency that it does not constitute an appropriate arrangement because it excessively interferes with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA at 1051.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 benefits unit employees because it mitigates the adverse effects, such as "employee burn out," resulting from unit employees working forced overtime to cover for absent supervisors. However, this benefit is limited because the Agency has procedures in place by which unit employees may be relieved of working forced overtime, such as an overtime roster allowing unit employees to volunteer for overtime opportunities and the ability for unit employees to find a replacement for any overtime shifts they are assigned. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3937</span>, 66 FLRA 393, 397 (2011) (finding that the benefit to employees was limited where the agency had taken steps to mitigate the adverse effects). The Union also argues that Proposal 1 benefits employees because it alleviates the adverse effects on unit employees of reduced training opportunities, reduced breaks, and reduced ability to take leave. However, consistent with the meaning of the proposal set forth above, the Agency still may assign supervisory duties to CICs during their regular tours of duty. Therefore, the proposal provides at most a limited benefit because unit employees still will have to "control more airspace with less assistance," while the CIC is acting as a supervisor.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While Proposal 1 provides a limited benefit to unit employees, it also significantly burdens the Agency because it completely prohibits the Agency from requiring unit employees to work overtime to cover for absent supervisors. The Authority has held that a proposal prohibiting compulsory overtime excessively interfered with management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1658</span>, 44 FLRA 1375, 1384-86 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Local 1658</span>) (finding that a proposal prohibiting compulsory overtime for the purpose of performing duties below their grade level except where it was "necessary to accomplish essential mission and function" excessively interfered with management's rights). Proposal 1 is even more restrictive than the proposal in <span class="Italic">Local 1658 </span>because it does not provide any exceptions to the prohibition of requiring unit employees to work overtime to cover for absent supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 1 burdens the Agency because, by preventing the Agency from requiring unit employees to work forced overtime when supervisors are on any kind of leave, the Agency is limited to assigning CICs for absent supervisors during the unit employees' regular workweek. Therefore, there are fewer occasions during which the Agency can assign work.[3] <span class="Italic">See Local 3529</span>, 56 FLRA at 1052 (finding that a proposal that would preclude the agency from assigning certain unit employees to supervisors, regardless of supervisors' workload needs was not an appropriate arrangement). Proposal 1 also burdens the Agency because, by requiring it to assign CICs only during their normal tours of duty, the Agency must either redistribute the duties the CICs otherwise would perform or allow those duties to remain unperformed; by contrast, a CIC working overtime solely to cover a supervisory shift would not have any regular duties that the Agency must redistribute.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;The dissent contends that "the need for compulsory overtime to cover for an absent supervisor appears minimal" and, therefore, that the Agency fails to provide a persuasive description of its burden. However, even assuming the dissent is correct on this point and there is only a minimal need for forced overtime, the dissent fails to show how that fact would affect <span class="Italic">the balance of</span> the benefit to the unit employees to the burden on the Agency. That is, even if compulsory overtime by CICs to perform supervisory duties is not needed frequently, the complete prohibition on the Agency's ability to assign it outweighs the benefit to employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Because Proposal 1 would require the Agency to assign supervisory duties only to the CICs who are on duty, the dissent's suggestion that the burden on the Agency would be limited if there are more available CICs is unpersuasive. The total number of qualified CICs is irrelevant because there are only a finite number of those employees on duty at any given time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although Proposal 1 does not prohibit unit employees from working as CICs in all situations, such as "as part of their regular tour of duty in the supervisor's absence," it does not follow, as the Union suggests, that the effect on the Agency is minimal. There are currently only four supervisory employees working for the Agency, and those four supervisors are required to provide "watch supervision" coverage fifteen hours a day, seven days a week, and also are required to perform other non-watch supervision duties. The Agency currently utilizes CICs to provide coverage when supervisors are absent, handling other tasks, or when no supervisors are on duty. Thus, according to the Agency, by limiting the circumstances in which the Agency may utilize CICs, Proposal 1 would require it to either hire additional supervisors or force supervisors to work overtime to maintain full shift coverage. Therefore, by prohibiting the Agency from assigning unit employees to work forced overtime, Proposal 1 severely burdens the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, on balance, the benefit to the unit employees of working less forced overtime is outweighed by the significant burden on the Agency's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1409</span>, 28 FLRA 109, 113 (1987) (finding a proposal that prohibited supervisors from assigning duties to unit employees that would conflict with any medical restrictions to excessively interfere with the agency's right to assign work). We find that Proposal 1 is not an appropriate arrangement and is, therefore, outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that the proposals are nonnegotiable because they are "covered by" the parties' agreement and excessively interfere with management's right to determine a budget and its right to determine personnel. Further, the Agency contends that Proposal 2 is contrary to law. However, in light of our conclusion that the proposals are nonnegotiable for the reasons stated above, it is unnecessary to address the Agency's remaining arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent">Deemed negotiable was a proposal that an employee or employees regularly assigned to a position requiring overtime work be selected to perform that overtime work when management required overtime. The employer had already determined qualifications and work assignments, and the proposal concerned only when employees would perform the previously assigned duties of the job. The proposal did not set the administrative workweek of the employer. <span class="Italic">AFGE Meat Grading Council of Locals and USDA, Meat Grading and Certification Branch</span>, 22 FLRA 496, 498 (1986). Another proposal was subject to bargaining that solicited a fair and equitable system of assigning overtime duties for employees in units utilizing overtime in emergencies. The proposal went on to require that the "supervisor will compute averages of overtime duty for each employee and make assignments in a fair and equitable manner." Management maintained the ability to consider the duties of the positions <span id="page_646"></span>already assigned to employees. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1798 and VAMC, Martinsburg, W.Va.</span>, 27 FLRA 239, 262-63 (1987). Overtime equalization among employees normally assigned to the work was also approved in <span class="Italic">NFFE and Dept. of Interior, BLM</span>, 29 FLRA 1491, 1507-08 (1987) (Provision 10).</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that overtime be offered equitably to employees that the agency determined to be qualified within a particular trade or occupation in an organizational element. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1770 and Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg Dependent Sch.</span>, 28 FLRA 493, 503-04 (1987). It was negotiable to call for supervisors to seek to rotate overtime assignments equitably among qualified employees under their supervision. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1853 and U.S. Attorney's Office, E. Dist. Of New York</span>, 29 FLRA 94, 99-101 (1987) (Provision 3). The union could bargain for a provision that employees not be brought into a shop to work overtime when qualified employees in that shop desired overtime and had not been assigned overtime. <span class="Italic">IAM, Local 726 and Naval Air Rework Facility, North Island</span>, 31 FLRA 158, 167-68 (1988) (Provision 5). Another negotiable proposal required management to make a reasonable effort to have overtime work performed by qualified volunteers. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1853 and U.S. Attorney's Office, E. Dist. Of New York</span>, 29 FLRA 94, 99-101 (1987) (Provision 3). Negotiable was a provision that management permit qualified employees to exchange overtime assignments. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 753-54 (1992) (Provision 28). Unions may negotiate for agreements for overtime assignment based on seniority among qualified employees. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-52 and Dept. of Army, Red River Army Depot</span>, 44 FLRA 738, 741-42 (1992) (Provision 1).
