<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-140"><span class="space">a.</span> Evidence of Reasonableness; Fee Agreement; Result Achieved</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The law now is that the fee agreement (retainer agreement) is presumed to represent the prevailing community rate and that the agreement is presumed to set the maximum reasonable rate that counsel may receive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cabe v. OPM</span>, 34 MSPR 60, 65 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 455 (1980); <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 63 (1984)). Subsequent decisions show, however, that evidence must still be supplied to demonstrate the reasonableness of the retainer rate, a demonstration usually provided through citation to past fee awards or to comparable awards in the community to attorneys of comparable backgrounds. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lizut v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 42 MSPR 3, 7 (1989) ("[t]he rate provided in the fee agreement is presumed to be the maximum reasonable rate that counsel may receive."). The fee agreement can be oral, with an agreement that, if successful, counsel will apply for an award of fees without a stated rate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. DOJ</span>, 123 MSPR 502, 509-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 13, 2016 MSPB 28 (2016) (a contingency arrangement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The presumptions established by a retainer agreement gave way to a more complex counsel fee determination, <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. DHHS</span>, 19 MSPR 206, 208-10 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Kling v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 MSPB 620 (1980), the Board adopted the method set forth in <span class="Italic">Lindy Bros. Builders, Inc. v. American Radiator and Standard Sanitary Corp</span>., 487 F.2d 161 (3d Cir. 1973), for computing attorney fees authorized by 5 USC Section 7701(g)(1). Under this approach, the computation of the appropriate award begins with an analysis of two objective variables: the lawyer's customary billing rate and the number of hours reasonably devoted to the case. The "lodestar" amount which results from the product of those variables may then be adjusted for other factors, such as the quality of counsel's service and the risk of nonpayment involved in handling the case (if these factors are not reflected in the hourly rate). The Board noted that the twelve factors affecting the value of an attorney's services set forth in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express Inc</span>., 488 F.2d 714 (5th Cir. 1974), may provide useful guidance in implementing the <span class="Italic">Lindy</span> approach....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Northcross v. Board of Education</span>, 611 F.2d 624 (6th Cir. 1979), one of the cases cited in <span class="Italic">Kling</span> for its elucidation of the <span class="Italic">Lindy</span> approach, analyzed the attorney's customary billing rate as representing the fair market value of his services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In most communities, the marketplace has set a value for the services of attorneys, and the hourly rate charged by an attorney for his or her services will normally reflect the training, background, experience and skill of the individual attorney.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The attorney's billing rate is thus strong evidence of "the hourly rate to which attorneys of like skill in the area would typically be entitled," <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc</span>., <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 488 F.2d at 718, or of the rate "prevailing in the community for similar work," <span class="Italic">Copeland v. Marshall</span>, 641 F.2d 880, 892 (D.C. Cir. 1980), as other courts have phrased the standard for the reasonable hourly rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4674"></span>The prevailing community rate is the more general characterization of the standard because it can be applied to determine the value of services by attorneys for public interest law firms who do not ordinarily bill clients. In addition, when we noted in <span class="Italic">Kling</span> that the hourly billing rate must be scrutinized, we implicitly recognized that the actual rate is not necessarily the appropriate rate. Rather, we agree with the court's statement in <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Concerned Veterans v. Secretary of Defense</span>, 675 F.2d 1319, 1326 (D.C. Cir. 1982), that the rate the attorney can command in the market is "important substantiating evidence of the prevailing community rate."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court went on to stress the resulting need for accurate documentation of counsel's billing practice:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A fee applicant should be required to state the rate at which he actually billed his time in other cases during the period he was performing the services for which he seeks compensation from defendant. This rate is not what he would have liked to receive, or what the client paid in a single fortunate case, but what on average counsel has in fact received.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the fee application must provide specific evidence of the prevailing rate for similar work, the attorney who varies his rates according to the kind of case should state the average rate he charges in cases similar to the one for which he seeks the award. For example, if he charges higher rates to wealthy corporate clients or others with greater ability to pay than the appellant he represented in the Board proceeding, it is the rate which he charges in comparably billed cases which is relevant. The application should also provide information from which the Board can conclude that the attorney has billed sufficient work to establish that his rate reflects a market value for his services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Attorneys who do not bill clients or who have not billed sufficient work may introduce other evidence of the prevailing community rate, as the court noted in <span class="Italic">NACV</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. Affidavits which state the rates charged fee-paying clients in similar cases by lawyers with comparable qualifications can provide such evidence. Fees awarded or paid in settlements in other cases, which were in compensation for similar work by the applicant or by attorneys of comparable reputation and experience in the community, are also relevant proof of the appropriate rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A statement of the terms of the fee agreement, without more, is insufficient to establish the reasonableness of the hourly rate. <span class="Italic">Francis v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 23 MSPR 443, 446 (1984). The <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> calculus must be followed. For many lawyers, <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> required the production of evidence of prevailing market or community rates instead of evidence of billing rates. Because bar associations no longer fix fees, establishing a community rate can be a tall order, particularly for lawyers who do not practice in communities large enough to support several attorneys engaged in representation of federal employees (not many communities qualify for that distinction). The Board went on to determine that the attorney's billing rate is good (although not conclusive) evidence of a fair hourly rate for services. As to attorneys who bill different clients at differing hourly rates, it is appropriate to state the average rate for similar cases and provide information permitting the Board to conclude that the attorney has billed sufficient work to establish that his rate reflects a market value. This task requires the attorney to provide specific evidence of the average rate that she has billed clients (not what counsel could have billed) for work similar to that of the petitioner during the same period of time. If that cannot be done--that is, if there are insufficient billings to fairly show a rate reflecting "market value"--the prevailing rate may be demonstrated through affidavits relating to fees charged by other lawyers or evidence of fee payments in other cases (with appropriate adjustments for varying skill of the attorneys who receive the fee awards).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Willis v. USPS</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1340-41 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Willis v. USPS</span>, 89 MSPR 85 (2001)), involving a dispute over a rate for nonlocal counsel (a situation that no longer arises under more recent Board regulations setting the attorney's community rate as the controlling rate, rather than the rate applicable at the hearing site), emphasized as proof of a reasonable hourly rate, the retainer agreement rate and, particularly for counsel having a national Board practice, the rate approved by the Board in other appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not cited by either party, and not mentioned in the Board's opinion, the Supreme Court has stated that a motion for attorney fees under a different but comparable fee recovery statute must be supported by "satisfactory evidence--in addition to the attorney's own affidavits." <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n.11, 104 S. Ct. at 1541, 1547 n.11, 79 L. Ed.2d 891 (1984). In that case, the attorneys who had represented the fee applicant, Stenson, were employed by The Legal Aid Society, and had provided representation at no charge, <span class="Italic">pro bono</span> <span class="Italic">publico</span>. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 890, 104 S. Ct. at 1544. Thus, Stenson had not entered into a representation contract specifying an hourly rate. Stenson's only evidence that the rates sought in her motion for fees were consistent with market rates consisted of affidavits from her attorneys so attesting.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Willis' submission of the representation contract specifying the requested rates is a critical distinction between this appeal and Blum. A representation contract specifying hourly rates is evidence that the contract rates are consistent with local market rates, because the client freely agreed to pay the rates by entering into the contract. Further, the three Board decisions in unrelated appeals--although providing no direct evidence of market rates in Charleston, but only of rates in those three other localities--should nevertheless have confirmed to the administrative judge that, as asserted, Gamlin and the DiFalco firm have a broad national practice before the Board, are aware of market rates in various localities, and that their customary rates--which they charged Willis--have been found reasonable for several other localities. This evidence lends credence to the assertions in their affidavits that their rates were indeed "average," and thus reasonable, in Charleston. Therefore, assuming that <span class="Italic">Blum</span> is not distinguishable and that the Court's statement quoted above is applicable, we hold that Willis met its requirement by submitting satisfactory evidence "in addition to" her attorneys' affidavits--namely, the representation contract and the prior Board decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court, also in the context of a different but comparable fee recovery statute, has recently stated that "the trial court should demand adequate proof from individuals familiar with the market of the community billing rate charged by attorneys of equivalent skill and experience performing services of similar complexity" <span class="Italic">Raney v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons,</span> 222 F.3d 927, 938 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). <span class="Italic">Raney</span> was not cited by either party, nor was it before the Board because it issued after the full Board declined review of the administrative judge's initial decision. In <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, as in <span class="Italic">Blum</span> the fee applicant had not entered into a representation contract specifying an hourly rate, and his only evidence that the rates sought in his motion for fees were consistent with market rates consisted of affidavits from his attorney<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In contrast, Willis submitted evidence indicating that Lopez and Gamlin were "familiar with the market" rates in Charleston--namely, their affidavits so stating, her representation contract, and the prior Board decisions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, assuming that <span class="Italic">Raney</span> is not distinguishable and that this court's statement quoted above is applicable, we hold that Willis satisfied its requirement by submitting "adequate proof from individuals familiar with the market." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given their national practice, the Board decisions awarding their customary rates in diverse localities, and the lack of rebuttal evidence, we see no reasonable basis upon which the Board could properly disbelieve the affidavits of Lopez and Gamlin. It appears that the Board failed to consider the representation contract and the prior Board decisions submitted by Willis. One indication of this is that they are not mentioned in the administrative judge's opinion. To the contrary, his opinion states, surprisingly, that "appellant adduced no relevant evidence to support her attorneys' requested hourly rates." <span class="Italic">Willis,</span> slip op. at 7 (emphasis added). This oversight was reversible error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Board's refusal to find Willis' evidence sufficient, in addition to being incorrect, is difficult to understand. Perhaps the Board considered the Lopez and Gamlin affidavits inadequate because they do not specify the underlying factual bases for their assertions that the contract rates were "average" for Charleston. The issue, then, is whether they must do so in order to constitute the "specific" evidence required by the Board under <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span>, even assuming that this decision is correct and applicable, or to satisfy the prescriptions of our court in <span class="Italic">Raney</span>, and the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Blum</span>. We hold that they need not do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We discern no requirement either for corroborating affidavits from local attorneys or others, or that the attorneys' affidavits must set forth the underlying factual bases or sources for their assertions equating the contract and community rates. Such an attorney-affiant should be presumed to be knowledgeable and truthful unless and until he is shown to be otherwise. After all, Lopez and Gamlin are members of the bar and officers of the "court"--the Board in this case. As such, they are subject to disbarment before the Board and/or referral to the conduct committee of their state bar if it appears that they knowingly filed a false affidavit. One purpose of placing officers of the court under the threat of disbarment, suspension or censure is to assure the reliability of their assertions, even in pleadings and briefs, and all the more so in sworn affidavits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, Willis submitted evidence that her attorneys, and the DiFalco firm which sets their rates, have a national practice before the Board, and are experienced at charging clients their customary rates--the exact rates at which Willis contracted and at which she seeks recovery. We therefore deem it unnecessary, at least on the record in this case, for the Lopez and Gamlin affidavits to include factual bases in support of their assertions, even though they are non-local attorneys.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if the agency does not challenge the rate, the appellant must demonstrate that it is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Hockman v. American Battle Monuments Comm'n</span>, 22 MSPR 570, 573 (1984). If affidavits from appellant's counsel are uncontested, the rate claimed by the attorney will not be lightly disturbed by the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 151-52 (1987). If an attorney offers no more than generalized affidavits stating that the firm's rates were reasonable, rather than specific evidence of rates, the AJ may rely on his own expertise in assessing the rates. <span class="Italic">Downes v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 88-3912). An affidavit <span id="Page_4675"></span>from local counsel with similar skills and similar work is of value. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 475, 481 (1990). Affidavits supplied by the appellant or by the agency from counsel will be of little value if they do not compare the experience of the affiants to appellant's counsel, if they do not speak of rates contemporaneously charged to clients in similar cases, or if the billing rates are from separate localities. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 685, 692 (1992) (agency submitted statements from other counsel but did not show comparable experience, billing rates for the same community as the appellant's counsel, or the unreasonableness of the rate of the appellant's counsel). If counsel labors in an area populated by legal specialists, the evidence presented should relate to prevailing community rates for federal personnel work in that area--at least if counsel cannot establish a market rate based on his own billing practices. <span class="Italic">SSA v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Beeler-Smith v. OPM,</span> DC-844E-09-0520-A-1 (NP 8/20/2010), commented on the significance of a fee agreement signed after the decision was issued that led to the fee petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board assesses the reasonableness of such requests based on two objective variables: the customary billing rate and the number of hours reasonably devoted to the case. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. Department of the Army</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 16 (2006); <span class="Italic">Casali v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9 (1999).

To establish the appropriate hourly rate, the attorney fees petition must be accompanied by a copy of the fee agreement, if any, and evidence of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, including a showing that the rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar work. <span class="Italic">Stewart,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6; 17; <span class="Italic">Casali</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(2)-(3). The relevant community is the one in which the attorney ordinarily practices. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a)(3). An appellant need not submit affidavits from other local attorneys if he has satisfied his burden of proof regarding the prevailing community rate through a retainer agreement and an affidavit from his own attorney. <span class="Italic">Willis v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 245 F.3d 1333, 1339-41 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the appellant asserts that she "provided all that was required regarding the substantiation of the fees and costs," including affidavits from her representative and a local attorney to verify the hourly rate of $250. However, the fee agreement between the appellant and her attorney was signed after the Board's decision was issued and, apparently, in anticipation of this fee petition. As such, the administrative judge did not commit legal error in concluding that this agreement did not establish a presumption that the agreed-upon rate was based on marketplace considerations and that the claimed $250 per hour reflects the prevailing community rate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the contemporaneous billing records, showing the dates and hours of work done on the appellant's case, reflect that the appellant was billed $250 per hour. However, the administrative judge correctly found that appellant's counsel did not provide a sworn affidavit stating that his customary billing rate was $250 per hour and, therefore, did not err in according his unsworn statement to that effect diminished weight. The administrative judge likewise did not err in discounting the unsworn statement from a patent and copyright attorney in Williamsburg. That attorney did not have similar experience as that of appellant's counsel nor did he state what he charges clients for similar work. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Casali,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 347, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Montreuil v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 55 M.S.P.R. 685, 690-91 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As such, the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge erred in concluding that the appellant's counsel failed to establish that $250 was the prevailing community rate. Further, the administrative judge acted appropriately in finding that $200 per hour "would be more in line with counsel's practice outside a major urban area." The Board has held that an administrative judge may set the hourly billing rate based on his own experience where the appellant's attorney fails to show his billing rate was the prevailing rate in the community for similar attorneys and cases. <span class="Italic">See Blumenson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 644, 650-51 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If affiants attest to the reasonableness of a particular hourly rate, the agency's evidence must address the rate claimed. It may not be sufficient for the agency to obtain the statement of another attorney who will do the work for a lower hourly rate, <span class="Italic">Heath v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 66 MSPR 101, 108 (1995):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides submitting a copy of the actual retainer agreement showing the agreed-upon rate of $175 per hour, Ms. Davis stated in an affidavit that this rate represents her customary billing rate in her Marietta, Georgia, practice. She also submitted an affidavit from an attorney (Mr. Conti) who stated that his Atlanta hourly billing rate is $175 per hour and that he has charged this rate in matters before the Board as well as in other Federal employment law matters; he further affirmed that he is familiar with the hourly rates charged by other attorneys in the Atlanta area in such cases and that the $175 per hour rate charged by Ms. Davis falls within the range of existing rates. Mr. Conti and Ms. Davis appear to have generally similar backgrounds in employment law litigation. The agency submitted an affidavit from an attorney (Mr. McIntosh-Hopewell) who stated that his Atlanta hourly rate for representing two appellants before the Board was $135 per hour. He also asserted that he would currently charge $145 per hour in such a case and that this rate fell within the range of prevailing rates for attorneys of his experience in such cases; he did not address whether a $175 per hour rate fell within the range to which he referred. Ms. Davis thus has presented specific evidence of prevailing community rates in support of her claim that the charged $175 per hour rate was reasonable, and the agency's submission does not specifically rebut that showing. We therefore find that she has established that the charged rate was reasonable<span class="Italic">. See White v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 45 MSPR 475, 481-82 (1990); <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Department of the Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 430, 434 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> required attorneys with a billing practice to state in their fee applications the average rate they billed clients for similar work during the relevant time period because that evidence has an important bearing on the prevailing market rate. The fee agreement or a statement of its terms was to be submitted with a fee motion, a requirement that would ensure that the evidence would be addressed by the AJ if the asserted prevailing market rate exceeded the agreed rate. <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. FTC</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 65 (1984). For a time the Board held that it was not essential to submit the fee agreement itself, although that was the preferred practice; the appellant's counsel needed only to submit a statement of the terms of the fee agreement with his motion for fees. <span class="Italic">Key v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 142, 152 (1987). <span class="Italic">Hunter v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 369, 372-73 (1984), <span class="Italic">post</span>, observed as to <span class="Italic">Gerlach</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">in all future requests for fees, the Board will require submission of the fee agreement or a statement of its terms. The Board so held because the fee arrangement, absent evidence to the contrary, is so important as an indication of the attorney's assessment of the market value of his services that it is presumed to be the prevailing market rate in the community for similar work by attorneys of like standing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.203(a)(2) (2022) (formerly 5 CFR 1201.37(a)(3)(ii)) now provides that "[a] copy of the terms of the fee agreement (if any)" is to be submitted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Parham v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 22 MSPR 146, 148 (1984), explained <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> for the benefit of the befuddled masses of attorneys yearning to be free of a byzantine rate structure established in the name of administrative economy and the interest of justice: a fee application must provide specific evidence of the prevailing community rate for similar work. If an attorney varies his rate according to the kind of case, he should state the average rate charged in cases similar to the Board appeal. Counsel should also provide information allowing the Board to determine if the attorney has billed sufficient work to establish that his rate reflects a market value. Attorneys who do not bill clients or who have not billed sufficient work may introduce other evidence of the prevailing community rate through affidavits stating the rates charged paying clients in similar cases by lawyers of similar qualifications. The requirements were reiterated in <span class="Italic">Hunter v. DOJ</span>, 22 MSPR 369, 372 n.5 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also stated in <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> that attorneys who do not bill clients or who have not billed sufficient work may introduce other evidence of the prevailing community rate through affidavits stating the rates charged fee-paying clients in similar cases by lawyers with comparable qualifications. Fees awarded or paid in settlements in other cases, which were in compensation for similar work by the applicant or by attorneys of comparable reputation and experience in the community are also relevant proof of the appropriate rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With all the talk about rates for comparable cases, the rate set by the retainer agreement will be the most significant factor in the fee equation. It is difficult to obtain a higher rate, although the Board may impose a lower rate if there is no evidence demonstrating the reasonableness of the retainer rate. The presumed reasonableness of the retainer agreement rate may yield to a rate higher than that established by the retainer agreement, as in <span class="Italic">Flood v. FERC</span>, 30 MSPR 546, 547 n.2 (1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant demonstrated that the normal presumption that the retainer agreement represented the maximum reasonable attorney fee was not a bar to a higher award by presenting evidence of a provision in the retainer agreement indicating that his attorney had agreed to a lower than market rate and that the attorney had been awarded higher attorney fees in the past when representing other appellants before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blum v. Stenson</span>, 465 U.S. 886 (1984); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 19 MSPR 206 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The presumption of the reasonableness of a set fee also yielded to the realities of law practice in <span class="Italic">Spezzaferro v. FAA</span>, 32 MSPR 643, 651 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Board finds that counsel has rebutted the presumption that the fee provided in his fee agreements with the appellants is the maximum reasonable fee that may be awarded by showing that he reasonably spent on the compliance proceedings more than the time he envisioned when he entered into his fee agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gerlach v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 20 MSPR 60, 63-64 (1984). When counsel agreed to represent the appellants for $250.00 each, for a total of $9,000.00 (36 multiplied by $250.00), he did not foresee that the compliance action would be as complex and lengthy as it proved to be.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_4676"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 455 n.11, 2 MSPB 604 (1980) (the agreed ("reduced") upon fee is presumed to be the maximum reasonable fee: that presumption is relevant to the "normal commercial billing practice for legal practitioners with clients such as labor unions which are commonly expected, if not explicitly understood, to produce a high volume of legal business").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">However claimed, the retainer rate must be supported. In <span class="Italic">Hanson v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 28 MSPR 176, 180 (1985), hapless counsel for the successful appellant was a state government employee. The fee agreement called for $95 per hour, determined by the Board to be the maximum fee permitted. But the fee was cut to $50 an hour because the attorney did not have an established rate from a regular private practice; affidavits that were submitted from other lawyers stating that the claimed rate was reasonable were disregarded by the Board as conclusory. The Board said that such affidavits "should be specific, rather than generalized and conclusory, and should state the factual bases for the affiant's conclusions." The Board did not state what other factual information it desired (the attorney did receive, even under the Board's limitations, a fee of slightly more than $21,000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agreement sets an hourly rate that depends on the occurrence of a contingency, and the contingency does not come to pass, the hourly rate mentioned by the agreement will not control the reasonableness of the rate claimed by counsel. <span class="Italic">Jones v. DOD</span>, 42 MSPR 35, 44-45 (1989). Contingency agreements, to be discussed subsequently, may recite hourly rates that are hypothetical. The Board tends to ignore the stated hourly rate and determine counsel's regular billing rate. <span class="Italic">Helt v. VA</span>, 34 MSPR 165, 169 (1987), said of a fee request at $150 per hour:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding on the reasonableness of an hourly rate, the Board requires specific evidence of the prevailing rate for similar work to establish that the attorney's rate reflects a market value for his services....&#8197;In support of his request for an award of attorney fees at an hourly billing rate of $150.00, appellant's counsel submitted a sworn affidavit in which he states that this amount is an accurate reflection of his rate in cases he accepts on a contingency fee basis....&#8197;He also submits a copy of a contingency fee retainer agreement with appellant which reflects an hourly adjustable rate of $150.00 per hour. Additionally, he submits copies of other documents reflecting that in 1985-86, he was paid from $100 to $120 per hour for his representation of clients in other matters. However, he provides no specific evidence of contingency fee cases handled in which he was actually paid at the rate of $150.00 per hour during the time he represented appellant or that this is the prevailing hourly rate in the community in which he practices. Thus, we find that the maximum reasonable hourly market rate is $120.00 per hour for his representation of appellant in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Helt</span> does not reflect much familiarity with contingency agreements: by their nature, clients who are on full contingency do not pay an hourly rate. Perhaps the Board was suggesting that contingency cases can only be paid at a prevailing rate, or perhaps at a rate petitioner's counsel has received in some other type of work. It would have been clearer had the Board stated it will ignore hourly rates in contingency cases, if that was the intent of the decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant's counsel fails to provide evidence of the reasonableness of the rate claimed, the AJ may set a rate that seems reasonable based on the AJ's assessment of the appellant's counsel as measured against other attorneys who have appeared before the AJ. <span class="Italic">Blumenson v. DHHS</span>, 30 MSPR 644, 649-50 (1986). If the appellant's counsel is operating under a contingency agreement, counsel may suggest an appropriate hourly rate, and the Board may adopt the rate if it appears reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 73 MSPR 590, 608 (1997) (agency did not object to a rate of $150 per hour).

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 525, 529-30 (1987), remanded with a critique of the deficiencies of counsel's original submission:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the affidavits submitted in this case deficient in several respects. None of the affidavits inform us of how experienced a practitioner appellant's counsel is. It stands to reason, then, that we cannot glean from this record evidence of what comparably qualified attorneys in his locale charge for similar work. Counsel's affidavit states that he has handled other Board cases, but he has not submitted his billings for those cases or any other evidence of the rates he charged for that work. <span class="Italic">See Mitchell,</span> 19 MSPR at 211-212. We are not informed of the rate appellant would have been charged if fees were not awarded. Finally, the affidavits submitted by the two other attorneys are not sufficient to enable us to determine the market value of counsel's services because they do not "specifically address the market rate for attorneys with similar qualifications," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 213, but merely assert a range of fees purportedly charged by attorneys in the area.</p>

Similarly, the MSPB applied the Maryland rate for the first set of fees awarded and the retainer agreement rate for awarding supplemental attorney fees with no reason for using two different fee calculations, <span class="Italic">see Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.</span>, 463 U.S. 29, 48 (1983) (explaining that "an agency must cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given manner"); Oral Arg. at 20:02-10, (Q: "And did the judge discuss that [the Maryland rate local rules are guidance] in any fashion?" A: "No, your honor."). Despite the MSPB's reliance on Maryland rates, TELG is located in Washington, DC and represents clients, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, in Washington, DC. The MSPB's failure to adequately explain its selection of the Maryland rate constitutes an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Motor Vehicle Mfrs.</span>, 463 U.S. at 48 (explaining that an agency must explain its reasoning "for exercis[ing] its discretion in a given manner" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 237 (1946) (codified in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.)). In contrast, the record contained the type of hourly rate evidence that we have approvingly cited to the in the past, <span class="Italic">see Willis</span>, 245 F.3d at 1339-40 (explaining that "[a] representation contract specifying hourly rates is evidence that the contract rates are consistent with local market rates"); <span class="Italic">see also Biery</span>, 818 F.3d at 714 (acknowledging that the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix includes "reasonable rates for attorneys in the Washington, DC metropolitan area" (punctuation omitted)), but the MSPB failed to explain why these rates were unusable in this context or why its selected Maryland rate should be preferred. Accordingly, the MSPB abused its discretion by relying on rates established in an unrelated case from a different jurisdiction to calculate Mr. Hickey's attorney fee award.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While DHS argues that the MSPB did not abuse its discretion by using the Maryland rate because rates should not exceed the rates set forth in the retainer agreement, the fees awarded using the Maryland rate, which caps fee petition rates, are lower than the fees agreed to in the retainer agreement, <span class="Italic">see</span> Oral Arg. at 25:16-28, (explaining, by the court, "[t]hat's what makes [the retainer agreement] reasonable, they're charging less than what they would normally be entitled to as a DC firm"). TELG customarily practices in Washington, DC as evinced by the record, J.A. 393 (explaining that one of Mr. Hickey's attorneys "is the President Elect of the Washington Employment Lawyers Association"); <span class="Italic">see</span> Oral Arg. at 15:02-05 (agreeing, by the Government, with the court that "this was a DC firm"), and the rates charged in the retainer agreement were lower than the customary billing rates of other law firms in the Washington, DC metro area and significantly less than they are normally entitled to as Washington, DC law firm pursuant to the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix. <span class="Italic">See</span> J.A. 11 (explaining, by the MSPB, that "the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> [M]atrix rates do not correspond with the rates agreed to in the [retainer] agreement" because the <span class="Italic">Laffey</span> Matrix rates are higher than those in the retainer agreement). The DHS provided no evidence to the MSPB that the Washington, DC-based law firm should be awarded rates of a different jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may adjust rates of counsel based on the Board's view of the relative experience or inexperience of counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Krape v. DOD</span>, 97 MSPR 430, 436-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2004) (adjusting rates by the year of work on a case when the attorney's fee agreement set a floor and ceiling rate).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How does an agency contradict counsel's representations concerning the reasonableness of the rate that he sets in his retainer agreement? <span class="Italic">Kelly v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 430, 434 (1990), demonstrated that the task is not easy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Besides submitting a copy of the actual retainer agreement showing the agreed-upon rate of $125 per hour, counsel stated in his affidavit that this rate represents his customary rate. In addition, he submitted affidavits from three attorneys who practice in the Philadelphia area and who verified that even $150 per hour is a reasonable rate for the representation of clients in Federal administrative proceedings. Moreover, the evidence submitted by the agency does not contradict the appellant's attorney's evidentiary submissions regarding the prevailing community rate. Specifically, the agency's "Summary of Recent Rate Decisions by the <span id="Page_4677"></span>Board in Attorney Fees Cases Involving the Navy" suggests only that in 1985 and 1986, the Board awarded attorney fees against the Navy in 3 cases assigned to the Board's Philadelphia Regional Office at rates ranging from $60 to $100 per hour. Even if true, the agency's submission does not indicate whether the cases were of a degree of complexity similar to that of the instant case, whether the attorneys possessed similar qualifications and expertise, and whether they practiced in Philadelphia, as does the appellant's counsel in this case. Thus, we find that the agency's submission does not establish that counsel's requested rate of $125 per hour was unreasonable, or that the administrative judge erred in awarding fees at that rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What can one derive from this tangle? First, an appellant's counsel should use a retainer agreement and include the agreement with her sworn statement. Second, if the Board (especially the Board) or some other adjudicator has approved counsel's hourly rate, she should say as much in her sworn statement with a brief description of the nature of the work involved. If the Board has previously approved the rate, appellant's counsel should be home free<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">McKinney v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 267, 269 (1985) (specifically noting past Board decisions approving counsel's rate and noting that "in the absence of any evidence in the record that the requested rate is unreasonable in this case, we find that the presiding official erred in concluding that counsel failed to justify his requested rate[.] "). An appellant provides specific evidence that the prevailing community rate for similar work is a particular rate by establishing that he has received fee awards at that hourly rate from the Board. <span class="Italic">McLane v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 404, 408 (1987). But there is always the need for that first approval. Once a rate has been approved, some flexibility in billing rates is established by a retainer escalator clause permitting an annual increase in the hourly rate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If no adjudicator has approved counsel's rate, she may have a community standards problem. Counsel should look for other Board cases arising in her area approving fees. Another possibility is to request discovery on the rate issue and send an interrogatory or document request to agency counsel asking the agency to disclose what fees it previously paid to counsel in her area for civil service or EEO representation. If appellant's counsel plans to pursue discovery, she should request the AJ to schedule time for discovery before the record closes. Counsel should match her skills with those of an attorney whose fees were approved. If this is not practical, counsel should impose on her brothers and sisters at the bar and get reasonably detailed sworn statements or affidavits stating their hourly rates and skills, and then match those skills with hers, or get the supporting counsel to state in affidavits that the rates of appellant's counsel are commensurate with theirs for similar work or work of like complexity. Bar association studies are also helpful. <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 31 MSPR 115, 118 (1986), determined hourly rates of $75 and $100 to be reasonable on the basis of a statement by the attorney of the terms of the arrangement agreed to with the client (that the appellant would be billed and would pay for all legal services rendered at the attorney's regular billable rate of $75 (later increased)), and a reference in the attorney's affidavit to a survey of billing rates conducted by the State Bar of Michigan showing that the rates claimed were in the low range charged for legal services by counsel with comparable qualifications and experience. A bar survey of rate structures was approved as admissible and probative in <span class="Italic">Mathis v. Spears</span>, 857 F.2d 749 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (a patent case).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Defensive submissions must be as detailed and responsive as the submissions from appellant's counsel. The Board approved $125 an hour for a partner in a Washington law firm whose regular billing rate ranged from $125 to $200 per hour. The attorney, with 28 years of experience, participated in other cases before the Board. Although the appellant's counsel did not submit evidence of fees charged by other counsel in similar cases, OPM submitted information suggesting that the range of fee awards within the Washington metropolitan area for representing an appellant in a personnel action before the Board had not exceeded $100 per hour. The OPM evidence was not entitled to significant weight because the OPM submissions did not establish the ability, standing, or experience of counsel in the decisions it cited. The $125 per hour fee was "not clearly beyond the range of rates in the community for comparably situated counsel in similar cases." <span class="Italic">Losure v. ICC</span>, 18 MSPR 388, 392-93 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Sowa v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 408, 417-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22 (2004), the agency submitted to the Board information concerning a fee petition (at a lower hourly rate) of another attorney in a related case, and the Board considered the evidence sufficiently significant to remand the case to the AJ for further analysis of the claimed hourly rate:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that the attorney fee agreement in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> constitutes new and material evidence. The February 3, 2003 attorney fee application in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> is new because it occurred after the January 15, 2003 initial decision awarding attorney fees below.

See Johnson v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 202, 203-04 (1984); <span class="Italic">Russo v. Veterans Administration</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 345, 349 (1980);<span class="Italic"> Kling v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the fees requested and paid in <span class="Italic">Von Zemenszky</span> are so far below the fees both requested and awarded here, we find that the fees here must be further scrutinized and reduced. We also find that the appeal must be remanded for determining the reduction because the administrative judge is in the best position to make this determination<span class="Italic">. See Gensburg</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 198 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Heath</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 106.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not say how it makes final judgments concerning the reasonableness of fees, or on whom the burden falls to demonstrate unreasonableness. Consider a statement in <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 32 MSPR 497, 502 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The two counsel did not present sufficient proof to establish the reasonableness of their billing rates. The Board has concluded, however, that it will not deny attorney fees when they are warranted in the interest of justice unless the record suggests that the hourly rate was unreasonable or that the hours claimed were excessive. Where the Board awards fees in such a situation (i.e., the appellant's request was not outrageous but fell short of case law proof requirements), the fee request will be subject to disallowances based on the Board's judgment in similar cases before it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the statement in <span class="Italic">Naekel</span>, the Board approved the fees requested for consultations, but did not give any specific reference to "cases before it" that would have shed light on the reasonableness of the fees awarded.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1994, the Board injected a new element into the already over-lawyered fee formulations when it decided <span class="Italic">Stein v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 685, 690 (1994). The Board determined that when the litigation before it principally involved monetary claims, i.e., counsel fees, the AJ may award fees for fee litigation based on the results achieved. This means that if the fee demanded is significantly more than the fee awarded, the AJ may proportionately reduce the supplemental fee award. Previously, the Board occasionally engaged in a kind of rough justice. Under <span class="Italic">Erdman v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 6 MSPR 51, 54, 6 MSPB 54 (1981), the AJ deducted 10% of the fee claimed for time spent on two issues that the appellant's attorney should have known would most likely be fruitless. The justification offered was that the AJ may impose fair standards of efficiency and economy of time on counsel. For other issues lost by appellant, time was compensable. The attorney could reasonably have believed that he might prevail. The <span class="Italic">Erdman</span> approach has been replaced by the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> formulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The element of success achieved through litigation, balanced against the cost in counsel fees for the litigation, again surfaced in a USERRA appeal, <span class="Italic">Jacobsen v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant requested attorney fees under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), which states as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board pursuant to subsection (b) that such person is entitled to an order referred to in paragraph (2), the Board may, in its discretion, award such person reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is thus eligible for attorney fees under USERRA if the Board issues an order that directs an agency to comply with the provisions of USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2). An appellant's eligibility for attorney fees does not make him entitled to those fees, however. <span class="Italic">See Arnold v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 19 (2003). Congress' inclusion of a discretionary standard in section 4324(c)(4) necessitates that the Board consider whether and how much the appellant should be awarded attorney fees under the circumstances. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, in exercising her discretion, specifically considered the rationale contained in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103 (1992), where the Supreme Court considered the appellant's "degree of overall success" in determining whether fees requested under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988 were reasonable. ID at 3; <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114. In <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Court stated that a prevailing party who wins only nominal damages might reasonably be denied any attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 115.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant appeal, the appellant filed a claim for relief covering a 7-year period, stating that he was improperly charged military leave which caused him to use annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay. The administrative judge ordered the parties to submit specific evidence regarding the appellant's military leave during the relevant period. The appellant responded with evidence that failed to show specifically on which days the agency charged him military leave. Further, the appellant submitted an affidavit that stated only that he "may have been forced to use annual leave or leave without pay." The administrative judge found that the appellant submitted no relevant evidence to support his claim except for a time and attendance report for pay period 13 in 2000. Based <span id="Page_4678"></span>on the agency's research of the appellant's attendance records, the administrative judge determined that the agency improperly charged the appellant for 2 days of military leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In considering the appellant's motion for attorney fees, the administrative judge noted that the agency had an internal procedure for making retroactive military leave adjustments, which the appellant did not utilize, but under which the appellant may have achieved the same result without filing a Board appeal. The administrative judge also found that the appellant's claim for relief was very broad and unsupported by specific evidence with the exception of one time and attendance report. Based on these two factors and on the fact that the appellant was only awarded 16 hours of restored military leave, the administrative judge found that the appellant achieved only limited success in filing his appeal. Therefore, the administrative judge denied the appellant's request for attorney fees as unreasonable given his limited success.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 4324(c)(4) does not set forth any specific factors that the Board must consider in exercising its discretion to award or not to award attorney fees under USERRA. We find that the factors to be considered will necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each individual case. In the case now before us, the relatively limited degree of the appellant's success in relation to the relief originally sought is certainly an appropriate consideration, and we see no basis on which to disturb the administrative judge's exercise of discretion in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly denied the appellant's motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal the Federal Circuit affirmed in <span class="Italic">Jacobsen v. DOJ</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1394213.html">500 F.3d 1376</a>, 1378-81 (Fed. Cir. 2007), denying fees under USERRA to an individual who obtained only nominal success in an appeal based on a denial of military leave:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992), the Board stated that an appellant's "degree of overall success" is a proper consideration in determining whether an award of attorney fees is reasonable. The Board held that attorney fees were properly denied in this case based upon Jacobsen's "limited" degree of overall success on the merits of his claim. In this regard, the Board characterized Jacobsen's success as nominal based upon two factors described below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the Board stated that Jacobsen's claim for relief was very broad and mostly unsupported by specific evidence. The Board pointed out that Jacobsen did not specify in his initial request the dates upon which he was allegedly charged military leave improperly. In response to an order by the AJ to support his allegations with specific evidence, Jacobsen submitted (1) a "Chronological Statement of Retirement Points," provided by the U.S. Army showing that Jacobsen engaged in fifteen days of reserve duty each year from 1984 to 2003, (2) a time and attendance record from the agency showing that he was charged with military leave on a Saturday and Sunday (presumably non-work days) during the pay period from June 18, 2000 to July 1, 2000, and (3) an affidavit in which he averred that he "may have been forced to use annual leave or leave without pay" in order to fulfill his military obligations during the time period of 1995 to 2001. The Board held that this evidence failed to show specifically the days on which the agency improperly charged Jacobsen military leave. Because Jacobsen's claim for relief covered unspecified days of a seven-year period, and the agency was eventually ordered to restore only two days of leave, the Board reasoned that Jacobsen's success in relation to the relief he originally sought was nominal. Thus, relying on <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, the Board held that denial of attorney fees was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the Board relied on the fact that Jacobsen failed to utilize the agency's administrative process for making retroactive military leave adjustments, but rather chose to litigate an appeal before the Board. The Board pointed out that the AJ also ordered the agency to search its records and produce any evidence showing whether Jacobsen was charged military leave on non-work days. The agency responded that it reviewed leave records for the years 1996 through 2000, and based upon its review, conceded that Jacobsen was improperly charged sixteen hours of military leave for days he was not scheduled to work for the agency. Had he utilized the agency's internal procedure in the first place, the Board rationalized, Jacobsen would have obtained the same result before the agency without filing an appeal before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that "these two factors coupled with the fact that Jacobsen was only awarded sixteen hours of restored military leave" justified a denial of attorney fees. This appeal followed. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">USERRA allows for an award of attorney fees under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4), which provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the Board determines as a result of a hearing or adjudication conducted pursuant to a complaint submitted by a person directly to the Board...that such person is entitled to an order [which authorizes the Board, upon finding a USERRA violation, to "enter an order" requiring the agency or Office of Personnel Management to comply with the provision violated and to compensate the employee for any loss of wages or benefits], the Board may, in its discretion, award such person reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unlike other attorney fees-permitting provisions administered by the Board, such as 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), section 4324(c)(4) does not require that the petitioner be a "prevailing party" who may only be awarded attorney fees in the "interest of justice." <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sacco v. United States</span>, 452 F.3d 1305, 1309 (Fed. Cir. 2006). Rather, section 4324(c)(4) merely requires that the Board have issued an "order" requiring the agency to correct its violation of USERRA. Congress left the decision whether to award reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses to the Board's discretion. In such a case where Congress left the precise application of a fees-permitting provision to the Board's discretion, and in the absence of any Constitutional challenge thereto, we accord broad deference to the Board's decision to deny fees. <span class="Italic">See James v. Santella</span>, 328 F.3d 1374, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his brief, Jacobsen initially contends that the Board does not actually have "discretion" to refuse an award of attorney fees notwithstanding the statute. Specifically, Jacobsen argues that the Board exhausted its "discretion" under the statute when it promulgated the regulations 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.203(a) and 1208.15(b), and that only these regulations must be satisfied in order to establish entitlement to attorney fees. Pursuant to its authority from Congress, the Board promulgated regulations governing the award of attorney fees under USERRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1208.15(b), 1201.203(a). Section 1208.15(b) provides in relevant part that the Board has discretion to order payment of reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and other litigation expenses under 38 U.S.C. 4324(c)(4), while the provisions of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a) instruct as to form and content of a request for attorney fees. Specifically, under section 1201.203(a), a motion for attorney fees must be supported with at least the following evidence: (1) accurate and current time records; (2) a copy of the terms of the fee agreement (if any); (3) a statement of the attorney's customary billing rate for similar work, with evidence that that rate is consistent with the prevailing community rate for similar services in the community in which the attorney ordinarily practices; and (4) an established attorney-client relationship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jacobsen asserts that as long as a petitioner provides the Board with the evidence enumerated above, the Board is required to award attorney fees to the petitioner. Because he satisfied the requirement of an "order" under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4) and presented sufficient evidence under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.203(a), Jacobsen contends that he is automatically entitled to attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not persuaded. The controlling statute clearly provides that the Board <span class="Italic">may</span> award reasonable attorney fees in its discretion. 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(4). Jacobsen has provided absolutely no case law, legislative history, or persuasive theory suggesting that "discretion" may be properly read out of the statute, or that the Board's "discretion" was somehow extinguished by its enactment of implementing regulations 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.203(a) and 1208.15(b), and we know of none. For these reasons, we find Jacobsen's initial arguments here to be without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party disputes that Jacobsen meets the statutory requirement under section 4324(c)(4) for issuance of an "order" and therefore is eligible for an award. Rather, the narrow issue presented by this appeal, to which we now turn, is whether the factors the Board considered in discretionarily denying Jacobsen's motion for attorney fees under the USERRA fee-shifting provision are permissible and lawful.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Limited Degree of Success Factor</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Jacobsen asserts that the Board erred in concluding that he only enjoyed a nominal degree of success. Jacobsen argues that he asked for and was restored all of the military leave days to which he was entitled, namely two. Since he obtained all he requested, Jacobsen asserts, his degree of success is actually entire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Resolution of this issue centers on an examination of the claim Jacobsen presented to the Board. As noted above, Jacobsen failed to allege any specific non-work days on which he was improperly charged military leave. Rather, Jacobsen merely alleged that he may have been forced to use other leave to fulfill his military obligations over a seven-year period. Because the record is devoid of any specific dates Jacobsen actually engaged in military duty (except for the lone June to July 2000 pay period record), we reasonably construe the claim as alleging that the agency improperly charged him military leave for each year he was obligated to serve. Assuming then that in each year from 1995 to 2001 Jacobsen performed two consecutive weeks of military duty, at least two non-work days (representing the intervening weekend) were improperly charged per year. The record shows, however, that in all seven of the years Jacobsen served, the agency only <span class="Italic">once</span> improperly charged him with military leave in violation of USERRA, i.e., two days, not fourteen days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Jacobsen's claim is reasonably construed as claiming at least one error per year for each of the seven years he served and the agency <span id="Page_4679"></span>only improperly charged him military leave in one on those years, the Board did not err in finding that Jacobsen's success in relation to the relief he sought was nominal, constituting one-seventh of the implicit claim. Further, because Jacobsen does not contend that the Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Farrar</span> is in error, we hold for the purposes of this opinion that Jacobsen's degree of success is an appropriate consideration in the Board's discretion. As such, we must affirm the Board's denial of attorney fees based upon Jacobsen's limited success on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Failure to Utilize Agency's Administrative Process Factor</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, Jacobsen argues that the Board erred by considering the fact that Jacobsen chose to file a complaint with the Board rather than go though the agency's internal administrative process for making retroactive military leave adjustments. We agree that the Board's reliance on the fact that Jacobsen could have achieved the same result though the administrative process as he did before the Board is in error because USERRA contains no requirement that a petitioner pursue, much less exhaust, his or her administrative remedies prior to bringing an appeal before the Board. Indeed, Congress provided Jacobsen with the right to file his appeal by enacting section 4324(b)(1) which provides that "[a] person may submit a complaint against a Federal executive agency or the Office of Personnel Management...directly to the Merit Systems Protection Board if that person has chosen not to apply to the Secretary for assistance...." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Butterbaugh</span>, 336 F.3d at 1336; <span class="Italic">Yates v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 145 F.3d 1480, 1483 &#x0026; n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1998). Nevertheless, since we hold that the Board properly found that Jacobsen claimed much more than he was awarded and therefore obtained limited success on his claim, the Board's reliance on the second factor is harmless error.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Jacobsen,</span> the Federal Circuit endorsed an approach to fees under the EAJA that considered results achieved in the litigation, although the court rejected an approach based on a simple arithmetical comparison of the amounts demanded and received, <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. United States</span>, 480 F.3d 1327, 1332-34 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424 (1983), the Supreme Court "clarif[ied] the proper relationship of the results obtained to an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 432. The Court stated that "[t]he most useful starting point for determining the amount of a reasonable fee is the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 433. After calculating this amount, the court must then consider whether to increase or decrease the fee based on a number of factors, of which "the most critical factor is the degree of success obtained." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 436. "If, on the other hand, a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">h[e]ld that the extent of a plaintiff's success is a crucial factor in determining the proper amount of an award of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988...where the plaintiff achieved only limited success, the district court should award only that amount of fees that is reasonable in relation to the results obtained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 440.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court reiterated this principle in <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> where it stated, citing <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> that "[i]ndeed, 'the most critical factor' in determining the reasonableness of a fee award 'is the degree of success obtained.'" 506 U.S. at 114 (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley,</span> 461 U.S. at 436, and <span class="Italic">Marek v. Chesny,</span> 473 U.S. 1, 11 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although those cases involved the fee-shifting provision of the Civil Rights Act, we see no reason why the foregoing principles there announced should not be equally applicable to the parallel fee-shifting provision of the Equal Access to Justice Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the Court of Federal Claims determined the fee award by multiplying the hours spent by the hourly rate--the first step of the <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> analysis. It did not, however, then proceed to the second step of determining whether there were circumstances that required a reduction in the fee thus calculated--particularly whether such fee would be excessive in light of the results achieved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the trial court explained the basis for its attorney fees award as follows: "Because of the clear bad faith shown by the Navy in dealing with Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Hubbard has been forced to appeal to this court.... Accordingly, plaintiff is entitled to recover all its attorney's costs, fees and expenses related to his litigation." <span class="Italic">Hubbard,</span> 52 Fed. Cl. at 200. In other words, the court concluded that because of the government's misconduct in its pre-litigation relations with Hubbard, the latter was entitled to be reimbursed by the government for all of the expenses he incurred, including his attorney fees, in conducting this litigation. Although the court properly considered the government's pre-litigation conduct in determining whether the government's position was substantially justified, such conduct did not make irrelevant Hubbard's lack of success in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although at trial Hubbard sought damages of $627,000, he recovered only $400--less than 1/10th of 1% of the amount sought. The $110,000 attorney's fee awarded was 275 times the amount of the recovery. The trial court made no attempt to explain why that fee--which on its face seems grossly excessive in light of the small recovery--could be deemed a reasonable one in the light of "the degree of success obtained." <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 114.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Once civil rights litigation materially alters the legal relationship between the parties, 'the degree of the plaintiff's overall success goes to the reasonableness' of a fee award under <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart,</span> 461 U.S. 424 (1983)." <span class="Italic">Farrar,</span> 506 U.S. at 114. A fortiori, this principle applies in a simple breach of contract suit where attorney fees are sought under the Equal Access to Justice Act. The present case involves only a garden variety contract claim that, unlike civil rights litigation, involves no broad public policy issues and the only relief sought was damages for the loss Hubbard allegedly suffered because of the breach.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government contends that if Hubbard is entitled to any fee it should be $80.11. It calculates this amount by multiplying the total of the fees and costs incurred ($125,000) by the percentage of the damages Hubbard claimed ($625,000) that he actually recovered ($400), or .06%. This mechanical mathematical analysis is inconsistent with the nuanced approach we have determined the trial court should take. Indeed, in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> the Court "agree[d] with the District Court's rejection of 'a mathematical approach comparing the total number of issues in the case with those actually prevailed upon.' Such a ratio provides little aid in determining what is a reasonable fee in light of all the relevant factors." 461 U.S. at 435 n.11 (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Del Prete v. USPS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DEL_PRETE_SALVATORE_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_DISSENT_246074.pdf">104 MSPR 429</a>, 431-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3-17, 2007 MSPB 13 (2007) (overruled in its approach in <span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 662, 673-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-29, 2011 MSPB 80 (2011), <span class="Italic">post</span>), although confusing in its analysis, reached a bottom line requiring reduction in fees when charges are sustained but a penalty is mitigated. The Board confused matters by attempting to deal with the merits of the appeal (validity of the charges) and the reasonableness of the penalty as separate claims that could be separately analyzed relative to the reasonableness of fees. The merits and penalty are related issues within a single claim--a single appeal from an adverse action. But the Board mixed its analysis of claims with reference to a separate analytical criterion: the degree of success in the appeal. The approach was to suggest that mitigation of a removal to a suspension represents a limited degree of success and therefore supplies a basis to reduce fees awardable to the appellant. Over the dissent of the Chairman (who felt that no fees should be awarded), <span class="Italic">Del Prete</span> remanded the case to the AJ for consideration of how to reduce the fees awarded to the appellant on the underlying appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant appealed his removal claiming that he did not engage in the charged misconduct and, further, that the penalty of removal was unreasonable. After a hearing, the administrative judge sustained the agency's charge, but not all the specifications. The administrative judge further found that the appellant failed to prove that the agency committed harmful procedural error and that the agency had established a nexus between his misconduct and the efficiency of the service. The administrative judge mitigated the removal penalty, however, to a 60-day suspension upon finding that, although the appellant's misconduct was serious, the removal penalty exceeded the bounds of reasonableness because the deciding official failed to properly consider various mitigating factors. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the deciding official gave too much weight to the amount of the shortage and to his belief that the appellant was an acting supervisor and should have been held to a higher standard. The administrative judge further found that the deciding official failed to consider mitigating factors, such as the appellant's 34 years of unblemished service, prior work record, lack of intent and culpability, time away from the station, and his wife's illness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party petitioned for review, and so the initial decision became the Board's final decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the administrative judge erroneously applied the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category to find that attorney fees were warranted in the interest of justice. Attorney fees are warranted under the "knew or should have known" category when the Board sustains the charge in an adverse action appeal, but mitigates the penalty based on evidence before, or readily available to, the agency at the time it took the action. <span class="Italic">Capeless v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 619, 621-22 (1998); <span class="Italic">Matthews v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 523, 525 (1998). Penalty mitigation alone, however, does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors. <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency spends considerable time summarizing the hearing testimony of the deciding official in an attempt to relitigate and reargue the reasonableness of its removal penalty....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's decision on the merits, including her findings with regard to the relevant mitigating factors, however, is the Board's final <span id="Page_4680"></span>decision and is not subject to recharacterization and reargument in the attorney fees proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Yorkshire v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1458-59 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (an attempt to recharacterize the evidence and the conclusions of the administrative judge in the underlying appeal is inappropriate during adjudication of the attorney fees request)....&#8197;Because the agency chose not to file a petition for review of the initial decision, the administrative judge's findings in the initial decision became the final decision of the Board. <span class="Italic">See Madera v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 310, 314 (1992). It is those findings that control the determination of whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, not the arguments now proffered by the agency in its petition for review. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the evidence relied on by the administrative judge in mitigating the removal penalty was before the agency when it took the removal action. [<span class="Italic">S</span>] <span class="Italic">ee Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. 501, 507 (1987) (fees are warranted in the interest of justice under category 5 of <span class="Italic">Allen</span> where the Board's decision to mitigate is based on information or evidence that was presented to the agency at the time it made its decision to remove the appellant). Further, no new information was introduced at the hearing that was unavailable to the agency before it removed the appellant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the attorney fees proceeding below, the agency argued that the appellant's attorney fee award should be reduced because he achieved only partial relief in the underlying case, i.e., the administrative judge sustained the agency's charge, but mitigated the removal penalty to a 60-day suspension, and that it should not be liable for fees regarding claims that did not prevail. The agency further argued that the Board should "either identify the hours associated with the unsuccessful claim, or reduce the amount of the award in an otherwise appropriate manner to account for the limited success." We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once a plaintiff meets the threshold requirement of being the prevailing party, as the appellant has done here, the degree of success he obtained is "the most critical factor" in determining the reasonableness of an attorney fee award. <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, 506 U.S. 103, 114 (1992) (citing <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 436 (1983)). This factor is particularly crucial where, as here, a party is deemed prevailing even though he succeeded on only some of his claims for relief. <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436. "[i]f 'a plaintiff has achieved only partial or limited success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a whole times a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount.'" <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we first clarify that, generally, an award of attorney fees is not "all or nothing" in a case where the appellant prevails only on the issue of an appropriate penalty, i.e., penalty mitigation. Instead, where, as here, the administrative judge has found that an award of attorney fees is warranted in the "interest of justice" for the change in penalty, the award of fees is limited to legal fees attributed to the change in penalty, and does not include fees and expenses unrelated to the penalty issue. Our holding here is consistent with Board precedent finding that, "[i]f a party 'fail[s] to prevail on a claim that is distinct in all respects from his successful claims, the hours spent on the unsuccessful claim should be excluded in considering the amount of a reasonable fee.'" <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 299, 304 (1996) (citing <span class="Italic">Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 604, 607 (1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 440)); <span class="Italic">Freeman v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 125, 133 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also Boese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 784 F.2d 388, 391 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (where the penalty has been mitigated, attorney fees related to a sustained charge should be eliminated if it is practicable to segregate them).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in the present appeal failed to prevail on his challenge to the merits of the agency's charge. As the administrative judge found, the appellant failed to explain a $45,000 shortage in postal funds for which he was responsible and violated agency rules by telling two agency employees the combination to the Unit Reserve safe, by failing to have a second agency employee witness and verify a withdrawal from the safe, and by not requiring two employees to conduct inventories, instead conducting inventories by himself at 4:00 <span class="small">A.M</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts and legal theories employed in the appellant's successful claim, i.e., his challenge of the removal penalty, were different from, and unrelated to, those employed in his unsuccessful challenge to the merits of the agency's charge. For example, as discussed above, in mitigating the removal penalty, the administrative judge relied primarily on the appellant's lack of intent to defraud the agency (which was not an element of the agency's charge), his "approximately 34 years of unblemished service," and the fact that the agency erroneously held him to a higher standard of conduct, despite the fact that he was only an "acting" supervisor. The administrative judge also found that the deciding official gave too much weight to the amount of the shortage and failed to consider the appellant's previous record, years of service, lack of discipline, time away from the station, and his wife's illness. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's attorney fee award should be limited to the fees and expenses attributed to the penalty issue only, and that the fees attributed to the appellant's unsuccessful challenge to the merits of the agency's charge are not compensable. <span class="Italic">See Farrar</span>, 506 U.S. at 114; <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. 424; <span class="Italic">Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an attorney fee award is disproportionate to the appellant's overall degree of success, the attorney fee award can be reduced either by identifying the hours associated with the unsuccessful issues or by "simply reduc[ing] the award to account for the limited success." <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436-37. Based on the existing record, we cannot identify precisely the hours associated with the appellant's unsuccessful challenge to the merits of the agency's charge. Further, if the reduction must be made on a basis other than by identifying specific hours, the administrative judge is better able to make such a determination because she is more intimately familiar with the adjudication of this appeal. <span class="Italic">See Smit v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 612, 619 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also Coon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 180, 186 (1994) (the administrative judge is in the best position to gauge the reasonableness of an attorney fee request that is based on the legal services rendered below).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Driscoll v. USPS</span>, 116 MSPR 662, 675-76 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 26-27, 2011 MSPB 80 (2011), overruled the approach in <span class="Italic">Del Prete:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429 (2007), the Board suggested that the first approach should be followed where an appellant prevails only on the issue of penalty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 15. In such a case, the Board held, the award of fees is limited to legal fees attributed to the change in penalty, and any other argument pursued by the appellant, such as an unsuccessful challenge to the charge, should be treated as an unrelated claim for which the appellant may not receive compensation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. That holding was incorrect, and we hereby overrule it. In a typical removal appeal, such as the one before us, the appellant asserts a single claim for relief under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d) and 7701, and seeks a single desired outcome, namely, that the Board set aside the removal action. The appellant may raise alternative arguments in support of that effort--for example, as the appellant did here, by challenging the charges, the reasonableness of the penalty, and raising an affirmative defense of discrimination. These, however, are not distinct claims for relief that could be treated "as if they had been raised in separate lawsuits." <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 434-35. Thus, such a case does not fall into the first <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> category, and the Board should not automatically disallow compensation for fees relating to other issues.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board should instead consider whether the degree of success warrants an award based on all hours reasonably spent on the litigation and, if not, what adjustment is appropriate. In doing so, the Board will weigh the significance of the relief obtained against the relief sought. <span class="Italic">Smit</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. at 617. As the Court emphasized in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, there is no "precise rule or formula" for making such a determination. 461 U.S. at 436. In some cases, the Board has found that an appellant who obtained mitigation of a penalty is entitled to compensation for attorney time devoted to unsuccessful alternative arguments. <span class="Italic">See Freeman</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. at 128-29, 133-34 (where the appellant obtained mitigation of the removal penalty to a 90-day suspension, based on a finding of whistleblowing reprisal, hours reasonably spent on unsuccessful discrimination and retaliation claims and a challenge to the sustained charge were compensable); <span class="Italic">Nickerson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 92, 96-97 (1992) (awarding all hours claimed where the charge was sustained but the appellant obtained mitigation of the penalty from removal to a 120-day suspension). In other cases, the appellant's incomplete success may warrant an adjustment to the lodestar. <span class="Italic">See Boese</span>, 784 F.2d at 391 (remanding for determination of the appropriate reduction of the fee award).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The entire exercise has become too complex, this chapter too long. The purpose of the Reform Act fee provisions is to defray the appellant's cost of counsel. MSPB appeals are not antitrust litigation brought by "private attorneys general." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 453, 2 MSPB 604 (1980). It would be simpler if, in the unexceptional case, the Board ordered that the appellant be repaid directly for what he has spent or is obliged to pay for fees, saving the elaborate analysis of rates for the cases involving appellants whose counsel seek recovery through the Board because they have not been paid by their clients. The decisions concerning reasonableness of fees, and particularly the <span class="Italic">Mitchell</span> case, involving analysis of theoretical community rates, turn fee determinations into complex ratemaking proceedings. This is unfortunate. Often, once fee entitlement is clear, agencies do not contest the amount of fees. This means that the Board compels a lengthy exercise in brief writing and preparation of affidavits (all paid for by the agency), although the party who will pay the bill would be just as happy to forego the formality of it all and pay a smaller bill. The Board's position as protector of the treasury places it in the unenviable position of an antagonist to the bar that practices before it, sometimes creating the appearance if not the reality of institutional bias. Only a small fraction of Board appeals result in fee awards; these awards are usually relatively small, perhaps five to fifteen thousand dollars. It would make more <span id="Page_4681"></span>sense to limit the extraordinary procedural requirements either to those cases resulting in an agency objection to the amount of (as opposed to the right to) fees or to those the AJ firmly believes demonstrate overreaching by counsel. This approach might provide slightly higher fees to a few lawyers (and few lawyers have significant numbers of Board cases), but the end result would be a significant reduction in fee litigation that ultimately costs taxpayers more than it saves.</p>
