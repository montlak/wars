<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-132"><span class="space">2.</span> Effect of Retirement on Appealable Action</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments, 5 USC 7701(j), governing general MSPB appellate jurisdiction, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the appealability under this section of any case involving a removal from the service (other than the removal of a reemployed annuitant), neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1990 amendment applies only to appeals brought after August 17, 1990. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 61 MSPR 289, 291 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Guzman v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-15-0170-C-1 (NP 1/6/2023), explained the effect of the anti-abatement statute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j), an appellant who retires in the face of a final removal decision, and whose removal subsequently is invalidated, is entitled to the same relief as if he did not retire, i.e., <span class="italic">status quo ante</span> relief. <span class="italic">Paula v. Social Security Administration</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 138, &#x00B6; 14 (2013). <span class="italic">Status quo ante</span> relief requires placing the injured party, as near as possible, in the position he would have held had the wrong not been committed. <span class="italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For Individual Right of Action cases, the Whistleblower Protection Act amended existing legislation to provide, 5 USC 1221(j):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining the appealability of any case involving an allegation made by an individual under the provisions of this chapter, neither the status of an individual under any retirement system established under a Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considers the facts to determined the status of an adverse action and an associated retirement. An SF-50 is not controlling. <span class="italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Laurenza v. VA</span>, NY-0752-17-0122-I-1 (NP 2/3/2023) ("The administrative judge appears to have relied on the fact that the appellant's removal was never processed and that the agency never issued an SF-50 recording the removal, instead issuing an SF-50 recording a voluntary retirement. However, the Board has held that although the issuance of an SF-50 is the customary determination for a personnel action, it does not effect the personnel action. <span class="italic">Toyens v. Department of Justice,</span> 58 M.S.P.R. 634, 637 (1993). The Board in <span class="italic">Toyens</span> further stated that, rather than the issuance of an SF-50, it is the decision notice approved by an individual with the proper authority that effects the personnel action. <span class="italic">Id</span>.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Case law usually addresses adverse action rather than IRA appeals. Section 7701 applies to removals, not to demotions that lead to retirement. <span class="Italic">See Betts v. VA</span>, DE-0752-13-0190-I-1 n.1 (NP 1/22/2014) ("He likewise has not cited any authority to show that the provision set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) extends to retirement in the face of a pending demotion."). As a result of the statute and interpretations of the law by the Board and the Federal Circuit, an employee who is eligible to retire may appeal a decided removal action, without regard to whether the date of his or her retirement falls on or after the effective date of the removal. The most straightforward explanation of the effect of the anti-abatement statutes on Board appeals intertwined with retirement appears in <span class="Italic">Mays v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1577-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994), rejecting the Board's reasoning that an individual is separated by retirement rather than removal if he retires on the same day as the effective date of a removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 7, 1992, the agency proposed that Mays be removed from her position as an Equal Employment Specialist at the United States Coast Guard Headquarters in Washington, D.C. for unacceptable performance....&#8197;[T]he removal was approved on December 1, 1992 and effective on December 4, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mays met twice with Cavanagh on December 2, 1992. At the first meeting Mays submitted retirement forms to Cavanagh. At the second meeting Cavanagh explained the retirement annuities that Mays would receive. Mays and Cavanagh next met on December 4, 1992 to review the retirement forms completed by Cavanagh so that Mays could verify and sign the forms. Cavanagh had entered "12-04-92" in the box titled "Date of Final Separation" on Mays' Application for Immediate Retirement. Mays questioned the entry "Retirement-ILIA" made by Cavanagh on the SF-50 form providing notification of the retirement. Cavanagh explained the entry meant "retirement in lieu of involuntary action" and the entry was made so that Mays could appeal the removal action. The remarks portion of the SF-50 read: "Reason for retirement: No reason given. Agency Finding: Retired after receiving written notice on 12-01-92 of decision to separate for unacceptable performance." On December 21, 1992, Cavanagh reminded Mays that the deadline for filing an appeal of the removal action was December 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mays filed a timely appeal on December 18, 1992. The Administrative Judge (AJ) raised the issue of Board jurisdiction <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> based on <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 441 (1992), which holds that an employee does not have an appeal right when her retirement is effective on or before the effective date of the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Accord Willis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 433, 437 (1993). According to the AJ, Mays' retirement divested the Board of jurisdiction over her appeal of the removal action unless she could establish that her retirement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> the Board interpreted section 7701(j) to allow an appeal of a removal action only when an employee retires after the removal is effective. The Board held that it does not have jurisdiction over an appeal, like that of Mays, in which an employee's retirement is effective on or before the date on which the removal is scheduled to occur. <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span>, 55 MSPR at 444. The Board reasoned that when an employee retires on or before the effective date of the removal, the removal cannot be appealed because it never occurred<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. According to the Board, the <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> appellant retired on the scheduled effective date of her removal and, therefore, was actually separated by retirement<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In this case, the AJ concluded that based on the interpretation 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span>, Mays' retirement divested the Board of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> rationale is correct because when an employee voluntarily retires on or before the effective date of removal, her removal action is "uneffectuated" and only proposed. Although the Board clearly has jurisdiction over removals, 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303(e) (1988), its jurisdiction does not extend to proposed removals. <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>). The government further asserts that this longstanding limitation upon the Board's jurisdiction must be overturned clearly and expressly by the applicable legislation, which was not done here. <span class="Italic">See Midatlantic Natl Bank v. New Jersey Dept. of Envtl. Protection</span>, 474 U.S. 494, 501, 106 S. Ct. 755, 759, 88 L. Ed.2d 859 (1986) ("The normal rule of statutory construction is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific."). In support, the government emphasizes that section 7701(j) addresses "removals" rather than proposed removals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government cites the Report of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee pertaining to section 7701(j) which states that the section "protects the appellate rights of employees who retire during the pendency of their disputes." H.R. Rep. No. 328, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 2 (1990), <span class="Italic">reprinted</span> <span class="Italic">in</span> 1990 USCCAN 695, 696, According to the government, the sole purpose of section 7701(j) is to overturn Court of Claims precedent holding that an employee's retirement after the effective date of the agency action mooted any appeal of that action. <span class="Italic">See Taylor v. United States</span>, 219 Ct. Cl. 86, 591 F.2d 688 (1979); <span class="Italic">Kestner v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 772, (1982), WL 25954 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the government contends that where there has been no "effectuated" removal because the employee voluntarily retires on or before the date her proposed removal is effective, section 7701(j) is not implicated. According to the government, Mays' case is different than one in which the employee retires after removal because Mays' "separation from service occurs not because of the proposed action, but because of her own intervening voluntary retirement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain language of section 7701(j) means that retirement status cannot be taken into account in determining the appealability of "any case involving a removal." Thus, the issue presented here is whether <span id="Page_1065"></span>Mays has a case "involving a removal" as that phrase is used in section 7701(j). For the several reasons discussed below, we hold that section 7701(j) does apply to Mays' case and gives the Board jurisdiction over her removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, Mays' removal was not a proposed removal as that term is used in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. The Navy sent Cruz a Notice of Proposed Removal on January 29, 1988. The notice set forth Cruz's right to respond and stated that the proposed removal action, "if found warranted," would not be taken before 30 days had passed and Cruz had received a final decision letter. On February 16, 1988, Cruz resigned effective March 1, 1988. The Navy informed Cruz that his resignation precluded issuance of a final removal decision, but at Cruz's request, processed his resignation<span class="Italic">. Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1241. This court concluded that the sole agency action pertinent to Cruz's appeal to the Board was the agency's January 28 notification of the proposal to remove him. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1243. We stated, "[b]ecause mere proposals to remove are not listed in [5 USC] &#x00A7; 7512, they are not appealable adverse actions in themselves and the Board has no jurisdiction over them." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Cruz's voluntary resignation "resulted in the agency's taking no action at all, much less an appealable action, on the proposed removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1244.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In contrast to <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, where the agency never issued a final decision as to whether Cruz's removal was warranted, on December 1, 1992, the Department of Transportation notified Mays that she would be terminated effective December 4, 1992. The agency made a final decision and took action when it issued the decision letter and the SF-50 Notification of Personnel Action form. Her removal was no longer "proposed" in the normal sense of the word or as that word is used in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>. Therefore, that case does not prohibit a conclusion that the Board has jurisdiction here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Secondly, Mays cannot escape the final agency decision to remove her, making this a "case involving a removal." By the government's own admission, Mays' official personnel file contains the December 4, 1992 SF-50 indicating "Retirement-ILIA" and stating in the remarks section, "[r]etired after receiving written notice on 12-01-92 of decision to separate for unacceptable performance." Moreover, the agency does not dispute that Mays would not have retired when she did if it had not been for the removal action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thirdly, when the statute states that neither "status" nor any "election" regarding retirement may be taken into account, it does not make any distinction depending on when the retirement status becomes effective. The statute says nothing about pre- or postremoval retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the legislative history supports a conclusion of Board jurisdiction. Congress intended to end the situation which forced federal employees to choose between appealing a removal action and accepting retirement benefits. The House Committee Report supports the contention that an employee should be able to retire and appeal a removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Simply put, the bill allows an employee who is eligible to retire but who the agency wants to fire to take his or her annuity and still challenge the adverse action before the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">H.R. Rep. No. 328, 6, reprinted in 1990 USCCAN at 700. While this rather broad language should not be read as being inconsistent with the principles concerning proposed removals enunciated in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>, it certainly supports the proposition that pursuant to section 7701(j), an employee, stigmatized with an adverse final decision reflected in her government employment record, may challenge the final removal decision while also opting to retire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history cited by the government does not support a different interpretation. Moreover, the government has not cited, and neither have we found, any legislative history referring to the <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> and <span class="Italic">Kestner</span> cases. Therefore, we see no reason to accept the government's argument that section 7701(j) should be limited to overturning those cases and not extended to Mays' situation involving a removal and retirement effective on the same day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Statutes should be interpreted to avoid untenable distinctions and unreasonable results whenever possible," <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson</span>, 456 U.S. 63, 71, 102 S. Ct. 1534, 1538, 71 L. Ed.2d 748 (1982). We see no principled reason for distinguishing between Mays and an employee whose personnel officer wrote "December 5, 1992" as the effective date of retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span>, who retired under the discontinued service provision of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d), was allowed to appeal her removal because she could not have retired but for the removal. The Board found that the appellant's retirement was based on the discontinued service provisions of 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d), and, in the absence of her involuntary separation, the appellant would not have been eligible to retire because she lacked the necessary years of service to qualify for voluntary retirement under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(a). Because the appellant could not have retired but for her removal, the Board held that the appellant's retirement did not divest the Board of jurisdiction over her removal. <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span>, 55 MSPR at 445. The only difference between Mays and the <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> appellant is that Mays is older and has more years-of-service so that she may retire under 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(a). Certainly, this is not a principled reason to deny Mays the appeal rights which were awarded to the <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no basis in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) or its legislative history for making the distinction found by the Board in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> between employees whose retirement is effective after their removal and those whose retirement is effective the same day as their removal. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> holds otherwise, we disagree with it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As indicated in her personnel file, Geneva Mays filed an application to retire after learning that the agency had made the final decision to remove her effective December 4, 1992. Therefore, this is a "case involving a removal" and the Board has jurisdiction under section 7701(j). For this reason, we reverse the decision of the Board dismissing Mays' appeal of the removal action for lack of jurisdiction and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> applies to retirements, not to resignations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="italic">Rios-Rivera v. VA</span>, NY-0752-16-0316-I-1 (NP 11/17/2022) (remanding for consideration of claim of forced resignation, with the burden of proof on the appellant: "However, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) and the holding in <span class="italic">Mays</span> do not apply to the instant appeal because the appellant here did not retire but resigned prior to the effective date of her removal. <span class="italic">Baldwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 111 M.S.P.R. 586, &#x00B6; 41 (2009); <span class="italic">see, e.g</span>., <span class="italic">Quiet v.

Thus, we find that the administrative judge erred in adjudicating the appellant's resignation as a removal, and we vacate the initial decision."); <span class="Italic">Weng v. Dept. of Labor</span>, CB-7121-13-0180-V-1 n.3 (NP 4/17/2014) ("The Board has found that an employee who resigns in the face of a removal decision must show that her resignation was involuntary to be able to pursue her appeal, and that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) applies only to retirements.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> was applied in <span class="Italic">Scalese v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 247, 248-59 (1995), so that when the appellant retired rather than be faced with removal for physical inability to perform his job, the Board treated the case as an appeal from the removal decision rather than as a constructive adverse action appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged in his petition for appeal, as he does on review, that he retired because the agency had decided to remove him. An individual's retirement status may not be taken into account "in determining the appealability...of any case involving a removal." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j). The administrative judge, relying on the interpretation of section 7701(j) set forth in <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Department of the Army</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 441, 444 (1992), held that the appellant's decision to retire on the same date that his removal was to be effective deprived him of the right to appeal the removal. The <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> interpretation of section 7701(j) is not the law, however. Where, as here, an employee decides to retire because his employing agency has issued a decision to remove him, and the employee retires on the date the removal was to become effective, the employee does not lose the right to file a Board appeal contesting the removal. <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-80 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">see also Williams v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 436, 438-40 (1994) (applying <span class="Italic">Mays</span> retrospectively). Accordingly, the initial decision is REVERSED. We note here that, although the appellant claimed in his pleadings that his retirement was coerced, his claim that the agency did not conduct an adequate search for a position to which he could be reassigned before deciding to remove him makes plain that he intended to appeal the removal decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary, as he claims, need not be addressed. If the agency is unable to support its removal decision, then the appellant is entitled to all the relief he could receive if he could show that his retirement was coerced, and his involuntary retirement claim would thereby be mooted. Conversely, if the agency is able to show that it properly decided to remove the appellant based on physical inability to perform, then he could not establish that his retirement was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136<span class="Italic">-</span>37 (Fed. Cir. 1987) where an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal..., such limited choices do not make the [employee's] resulting resignation an involuntary act"; rather, the resignation is involuntary only if the agency "knew that the reason for the threatened removal could not be substantiated"). Therefore, the appeal, which is properly before the Board as an appeal from an express decision of removal, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d), can be adjudicated without regard to "constructive removal" (involuntary resignation or retirement) doctrine.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> was again applied as to an individual who retired on or before the date a removal decision became effective, <span class="Italic">Mungaray v. DHS</span>, DC-0752-15-0622-I-1 (NP 6/9/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1066"></span>A retirement is presumed to be a voluntary act and, therefore, beyond the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Heining v. General Services Administration</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 513, 519 (1995); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(9). However, once a decision to remove has been issued, the appellant retains the right to appeal the removal to the Board, even if he separates from Federal service through retirement on or before the date the removal would have become effective. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j); <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994). In such cases, the Board analyzes the appeal as a removal action. <span class="Italic">Norton v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 2 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge analyzed the appellant's appeal as an involuntary retirement, and he dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. However, because the agency finalized and issued its removal decision, the appeal should have been analyzed as a removal action. <span class="Italic">See Richards v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 17, 18, 20 (1997) (remanding an appeal for adjudication as a removal action because, although the appellant applied to retire while a proposed removal was pending, the agency subsequently issued an appealable decision directing the appellant's removal). Whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary need not be addressed on remand. <span class="Italic">Scalese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 247, 249 (1995).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mays</span> was reaffirmed in court, <span class="Italic">Jimenez v. VA</span>, 662 Fed. Appx. 975, 978-79 (Fed. Cir. 2016 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have previously held that when an employee voluntarily retires upon receiving a proposed notice of removal a claim based on that notice may be moot. <span class="Italic">See Cruz v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 934 F.2d 1240, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). But that is not the case where, as here, before the employee retires there is a final, appealable V.A. action giving the employee the right to file a claim. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. Dep't of Transp</span>., 27 F.3d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994). As such, this case is not moot.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the Government's mootness argument does not comport with our holding in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>. In that case, the appellant, Ms. Mays, retired before her removal went into effect. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1577-78. Specifically, "[o]n October 7, 1992, the agency proposed that Mays be removed from her position," and subsequently, "Mays submitted both a written and an oral response to the proposed adverse action." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. "On December 1, 1992, the agency informed Mays by letter that 'you will be removed from your position effective the close of business 4 December 1992.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1578. The letter also "set forth Mays' appeal rights." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. After receiving that letter, Ms. Mays retired on December 4, 1992 and subsequently filed an appeal regarding her removal. The Government argued there, as it does here, that there was no jurisdiction because Ms. Mays retired before her removal went into effect. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1579.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagreed. We held that, because "[t]he agency made a final decision and took action when it issued the decision letter" and because Ms. Mays's "removal was no longer 'proposed' in the normal sense of the word or as that word is used in <span class="Italic">Cruz</span>," Ms. Mays's case was not moot. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1580. We further explained in Mays that it was "a case involving removal," as evidenced by Ms. Mays's SF-50 retirement form "stating in the remarks section, '[r]etired after receiving written notice on 12-01-92 of decision to separate for unacceptable performance.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1578. For these reasons, we found that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j)--which provides that an employee's retirement status may not be taken into account in appealability of removal actions--established our jurisdiction over Ms. Mays's case and that her case was not moot. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1581.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case fall squarely in line with those in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>: here, as in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, Mr. Jimenez received proposed, and then final, removal letters and subsequently retired in light of that removal. Specifically, the V.A. sent Mr. Jimenez a proposed removal letter on December 23, 2011, to which Mr. Jimenez responded both in writing and orally. Ultimately, the V.A. decided to remove Mr. Jimenez and informed him with a final removal notice on February 22, 2012. The February 22, 2012 notice indicated that, "[i]n connection with the letter of December 23, 2011, in which you were given advance notice of your proposed removal, <span class="Italic">a decision has been made to remove you from federal employment</span> effective March 5, 2012 based on the following reasons." The notice also expressly informed Mr. Jimenez of his right to appeal: "You may appeal this action to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) or [&#8197;] under the grievance procedure (non-bargain) or under the negotiated grievance procedure...." Moreover, just like in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the remarks section in Mr. Jimenez's SF-50 retirement form indicated that he "retired after receiving written notice on 02/22/2012 of decision to separate for endangering patient health and safety of others." Thus, Mr. Jimenez's retirement did not moot his claim. <span class="Italic">See Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1580-81.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, during prehearing conferences, the Board determined that Mr. Jimenez "retired on March 2, 2012, because the agency had issued a decision to remove him on February 22, 2012, effective March 5, 2012." The Board cited <span class="Italic">Mays</span>--under no objection by the Government, as it concedes--to hold that the February 22 removal notice constituted an appealable action that conferred jurisdiction in this case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Government now unconvincingly argues in the abstract that this case is moot without either addressing the Board's specific holding on the issue or responding to its reliance on <span class="Italic">Mays</span> in reaching that holding. We conclude that the Board's holding was correct and that jurisdiction exists in this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 United States Code, section 7701(j) provides that "[i]n determining the appealability under [section 7701] of any case involving a removal from the service..., neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the record contains an SF-50 indicating that the appellant was removed on July 12, 2011. The appellant has challenged the accuracy of the SF-50 on the grounds that her retirement was effective on or before that date. While an executed SF-50 is the customary documentation for a personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself and does not on its face control an employee's status and rights. <span class="Italic">Hunt-O'Neal v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 286, &#x00B6; 10 (2011). Rather, we must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine the date and nature of the appellant's separation. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Thus, the administrative judge erred in treating the SF-50 as dispositive evidence that the appellant had been removed. However, the SF-50 is consistent with the decision letter, which provided for the appellant's removal effective July 12, 2011, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agency failed to effect that action at the time, even if the SF-50 has since been superseded by a retroactive grant of retirement. Furthermore, the appellant did not file her retirement application until July 13, 2011, the day after her separation. Thus, regardless of the effective date of the appellant's retirement, we conclude the Board has jurisdiction to review the agency's decision to remove her.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Willis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 433, 436-37 (1993), concluded that a Chapter 43 performance-based action was not removed from Board jurisdiction by retirement subsequent to removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jesko v. VA</span>, 52 MSPR 517, 521 (1992), the Board found that this provision applies to adverse actions taken under 5 USC Chapter 75. Based on the plain language of the statute, we find that removals taken under 5 USC Chapter 43 are also covered by 5 USC 7701(j).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The starting point in every case involving construction of a statute is the language of the statute itself. <span class="Italic">Landreth Timber Co. v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, 5 USC 7701(j) applies to "any [removal] case" filed under 7701. Section 7701 is the jurisdictional basis not only for adverse actions taken to promote the efficiency of the service pursuant to 5 USC 7513(d), but also for actions based on unacceptable performance under 5 USC 4303(e). Moreover, the provision specifically states that it does not apply to the removal of a reemployed annuitant. Because it does not explicitly exclude any other removal action from coverage, other exclusions should not be readily implied. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Andrus v. Glover Construction Co.</span>, 446 U.S. 608, 100 S. Ct. 1905, 64 L.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The language of a statutory provision must be regarded as conclusive absent a clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">CPSC v. GTE Sylvania</span>, 447 U.S. 102, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980). Based on our review of the legislative history, we do not believe that Congress provided any clear message that it intended 5 USC 7701(j) to apply only to removals taken under Chapter 75. Rather, we believe that Congress intended to protect the due process rights of an employee who is removed under either Chapter 43 or Chapter 75.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(j) was first drafted as part of the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1987. The legislative history of that Act establishes that one of the committee's primary objectives in drafting the section was to protect an employee's due process rights. The committee stated that it "believes it is unfair to force an employee to choose between exercising due process rights and claiming an entitlement to an annuity." <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 274, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(j) was later eliminated from the Whistleblower Protection Act and incorporated into the Civil Service Due Process Amendments. As reported out of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, these Amendments granted Board appeal rights to members of the excepted service affected by "adverse personnel actions." H. Rep. No. 328, 101st Cong., 2d Sess. 1 (1990); 1990 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Admin. News 695.

News 696. The text of 7701(j) was identical to the provision as enacted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Jesko</span>, 52 MSPR at 520-21, the Board found that 5 USC 7701(j) would not provide a basis for Board jurisdiction where an appellant retired rather than be demoted or separated pursuant to a reduction in force. For the reasons discussed above, however, we find that a separation by reduction in force is distinguishable from a removal under Chapter 75 or Chapter 43. The word "removal" is a term of art employed in a personnel action based on poor performance under Chapter 43 or Chapter 75, or a personnel action based on misconduct under Chapter 75. Indeed, the words "remove" and "removal" are used in Chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 USC 4302, 4302a, 4303.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that under certain circumstances, 5 USC 7701(j) might provide a basis for Board jurisdiction in a case involving a removal under Chapter 43....</p>

The decision also demonstrated the significance of the distinction between a coerced retirement and the underlying removal determination leading to the retirement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge analyzed the issue of jurisdiction under the law governing coercive resignations and retirements. <span class="Italic">[S]</span> <span class="Italic">ee, e.g., Terban v. Department of Energy,</span> 216 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (to overcome the presumption that a retirement was voluntary, an employee must prove that the retirement was the product of the agency's misinformation, deception, or coercion). Finding the appellant had not shown that he retired due to the agency's coercion, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Under the circumstances of this appeal, the initial decision was in error. The standard the administrative judge employed to analyze the case would have been correct had the agency not issued a final decision, but a final decision was issued in this matter. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Transportation,</span> 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-80 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Board have held that the Board retains jurisdiction over an appeal where an employee retires when faced with an agency's final decision to remove him. <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> 27 F.3d at 1579-80; <span class="Italic">Cunningham v.

This is true even if the effective date of his retirement is on or before that of the removal. <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 519 &#x00B6; 4. The rationale upon which these holdings were based is found at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j), which provides that "neither an individual's status under any federal retirement system, nor any election made by such individual under such system, may be taken into account in determining the appealability, of the individual's removal from the service." <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 519 &#x00B6; 4. This is because "an employee should not be forced to choose between electing to receive his retirement benefits and appealing the agency's decision to remove him." <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 518, 522 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the appellant elected to retire after the agency rendered a final decision to remove him for failure to accept a directed reassignment. We find, therefore, that the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal, and that adjudication of the jurisdictional issue under the case law governing coercive resignations and reassignments was inappropriate. <span class="Italic">See Cunningham,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 519 &#x00B6; 4; <span class="Italic">Black</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 562.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, the administrative judge should have adjudicated the appeal under the standard for removal for failure to accept a directed reassignment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On November 20, 2009, the agency proposed to remove the appellant based on a charge of conduct unbecoming a federal agent. On February 2, 2010, following the appellant's oral and written responses, the agency issued a final decision sustaining the proposed removal, effective February 12, 2010. On February 12, 2010 the date his removal would have taken effect the appellant retired pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely appealed his removal to the Board. On April 21, 2011, the administrative judge issued an Initial Decision affirming the removal. On April 18, 2012, the Board issued a Final Order reversing the Initial Decision and ordering the agency to cancel the appellant's removal. Citing <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2011), and <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1999), the Board held that the agency violated the appellant's constitutional due process rights when it considered new and material information in assessing the penalty without providing him notice and an opportunity to respond. The Board ordered the agency to cancel the removal action; restore the appellant effective February 12, 2010; and pay him the correct amount of back pay, interest on back pay, and other benefits pursuant to the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the Final Order, the agency canceled the appellant's removal but refused to restore him to duty or pay him back pay, interest, or benefits. The agency asserted that the appellant retired voluntarily on February 12, 2010, and that his retirement "completely and permanently separated him from the Agency, and cannot be revoked or withdrawn despite the" Board's Final Order. The agency informed the appellant it would satisfy its compliance obligations by issuing a new SF-50 noting that the appellant retired voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant timely filed a petition for enforcement. He asserted that his retirement was based solely on the agency's final decision to remove him and was not voluntary because the Board subsequently reversed the removal action. He contended that in arguing otherwise, the agency relied on outdated case law, preceding the Civil Service Due Process Amendments of 1990. Among other things, these reforms provided that the "appealability...of any case involving a removal from the service" should be decided without regard to "an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under any Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 7701(j). The appellant contended that this provision entitled him to the same relief that would have been available had he not retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued that &#x00A7; 7701(j) governed only the "appealability," in the jurisdictional sense, of cases involving both removal and retirement, and not the relief to which prevailing appellants were entitled. ("Appealability and reinstatement are two separate matters."). The agency asserted that the provision's legislative history indicates Congress intended a retired employee to contest his removal only to obtain a "clean record," not to obtain full reinstatement and back pay. The agency denied that its cases were outdated, or that &#x00A7; 7701(j) overruled them, and contended that, under its cases, the appellant retired voluntarily and thus was not entitled to restoration or back pay.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Section 7701(j)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency relies on the<span class="Italic"> Taylor</span> line of cases, beginning in 1979, in which the Board's reviewing court held that when an appellant retired after receiving a final decision of removal, he was not entitled to back pay or reinstatement if the removal action later was reversed. The Court of Claims held that "[t]he controlling issue is whether plaintiff's retirement was voluntary. The clear import of the statutes, regulations, and decisional law is that a voluntary retirement, like a resignation, results in the employee's complete separation from the Federal service--a separation which, after it becomes effective, may not thereafter be revoked or withdrawn at his option." <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 591 F.2d 688, 690 (Ct. Cl. 1979). <span class="Italic">Accord Kestner v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 229 Ct. Cl. 772, 774-75 (Ct. Cl. 1982); <span class="Italic">Ballentine v. Department of Justice</span>, 39 M.S.P.R. 543, 546 (1989) ("a voluntary retirement results in an employee's complete separation from the service and...the employee is not entitled to rescind his voluntary retirement because he subsequently prevails in an appeal of an adverse action before the Board"); <span class="Italic">Collier v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 38, 42 (1985) ("Appellant's voluntary retirement was a discrete, intervening factor limiting appellant's right to reinstatement").[2] The agency contends that under these cases, the appellant voluntarily retired on February 12, 2010, and the Board's subsequent reversal of his removal does not entitle him to withdraw his retirement, to be reinstated, or to receive back pay. The agency maintains that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) (one of the 1990 Civil Service Due Process Amendments) and subsequent cases interpreting it did not supersede or overrule Taylor's reasoning because &#x00A7; 7701(j) governs only whether the Board has jurisdiction over joint removal and retirement cases, and not the relief that may be awarded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The agency also cites <span class="Italic">Young v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 563 (2005), asserting that <span class="Italic">Young</span> indicates the viability of the <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> line of cases. <span class="Italic">Young</span> is distinguishable, however, as it dealt with a disability retirement, not a retirement stemming from an adverse action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. As explained below, our cases following the enactment of &#x00A7; 7701(j) consistently have recognized that an appellant who retires in the face of a final removal decision, and whose removal is reversed, is entitled to all the relief he could have received if he had appealed the removal but had not retired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In determining the appealability under this section of any case involving a removal from the service (other than the removal of a reemployed annuitant), neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The plain meaning of this provision is that the Board may not base its jurisdictional determination in a removal appeal on whether the appellant retired when faced with a final removal decision. Thus, as the Federal Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, this provision overruled <span class="Italic">Taylor's</span> holding that a retirement stemming from a final decision of removal is voluntary and outside the Board's jurisdiction. 27 F.3d 1577, 1579-81 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the Board analyzed joint removal and retirement claims as removal actions, without regard to the voluntariness of the retirement decision, and did not limit the relief available to prevailing appellants. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Scalese v. Department of the Air Force</span>, the Board held:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where...an employee decides to retire because his employing agency has issued a decision to remove him, and the employee retires on the date the removal was to become effective, the employee does not lose the right to file a Board appeal contesting the removal....&#8197;Whether the appellant's retirement was involuntary...need not be addressed. If the agency is unable to support its removal decision, then the appellant is entitled to all the relief he could receive if he could show that his retirement was coerced, and his involuntary retirement claim would thereby be mooted. Conversely, if the agency is able to show that it properly decided to remove the appellant...then he could not establish that his retirement was involuntary. Therefore, the appeal, which is properly before the Board as an appeal from an express decision of removal, can be adjudicated without regard to "constructive removal" (involuntary resignation or retirement) doctrine.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">68 M.S.P.R. 247, 248-49 (1995) (internal citations omitted). The Board's subsequent cases applied the same framework. <span class="Italic">See Norton v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We disagree with the agency's attempt to distinguish <span class="Italic">Norton</span>. The agency asserts that <span class="Italic">Norton</span> "focuses on the appellant's right to 'interim relief' and does not address the issue presented in this case." However, like Mr. Paula, Mr. Norton both received a final decision of removal and retired. His entitlement to interim relief was based on the Board's reversal of the removal action. Under the agency's theory, Mr. Norton would not have been entitled to any relief--interim or final--because of his retirement. The Board, however, held that he was entitled to both.<span class="Italic"> See</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;We disagree with the agency's reading of <span class="Italic">Sink</span> and <span class="Italic">Williams</span>. Neither demonstrates, as the agency claims, that an appellant's remedy following retirement is to "pursue restoration of reputation and alleviation of the stigma associated with a removal action." In <span class="Italic">Sink</span>, as explained above, the Board did not award reinstatement or back pay because the appellant's decision to retire was not based on a subsequently invalidated removal. 110 M.S.P.R. 153, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22. In <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, the Board affirmed that the appellant's removal and involuntary retirement claims should be adjudicated as a single removal action, consistent with<span class="Italic"> Norton</span> and <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span>. 112 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. The Board then dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the appellant previously had entered into a settlement agreement waiving her right to appeal her removal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no error in these cases, and no sound policy or other reason to limit the relief awarded to an appellant who retires in the face of a final removal decision, but whose removal subsequently is reversed. As <span class="Italic">Scalese</span> established, the Board has jurisdiction over and adjudicates such cases as it would a pure removal action; appellants therefore should receive the same relief. As we implicitly held in <span class="Italic">Scalese</span> and subsequent cases, we now explicitly affirm: pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j), an appellant who retires in the face of a final removal decision, and whose removal subsequently is invalidated, is entitled to the same relief as if he did not retire. To the extent <span class="Italic">Taylor</span> and its progeny may be read to hold otherwise, they are overruled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject the agency's claim that Congress intended &#x00A7; 7701(j) to overturn only <span class="Italic">Taylor's</span> holding regarding jurisdiction, leaving intact<span class="Italic"> Taylor's</span> reasoning regarding the limited relief awarded to employees who retire due to final removal decisions. The agency asserts that the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7701(j) evinces only an intent to permit employees to "pursue a 'clean record' through the appeal process," rather than to obtain full reinstatement and back pay. For this proposition, the agency relies on a single statement in <span class="Italic">Mays</span>. There, the Federal Circuit quoted the House Committee Report, which stated: "Simply put, the bill allows an employee who is eligible to retire but who the agency wants to fire to take his or her annuity and still challenge the adverse action before the Merit Systems Protection Board." <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> 27 F.3d at 1580 (quoting 101 H. Rpt. 328, at 6 (1989)). The court then noted that this "rather broad language...certainly supports the proposition that pursuant to section 7701(j), an employee, stigmatized with an adverse final decision reflected in her government employment record, may challenge the final removal decision while also opting to retire." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not read the court's statement as narrowly as the agency urges us to do. The court noted the breadth of the statutory language and neither stated nor implied that correcting the stigma of an adverse final decision was Congress's sole consideration. Indeed, in the preceding sentences, the court recognized that Congress "intended to end the situation which forced federal employees to choose between appealing a removal action and accepting retirement benefits." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This broader statement contains no qualifiers as to the scope of relief an employee might obtain on appeal. Nor do we see any such limitation in the legislative history quoted by the court or in any other portion of the legislative history related to this amendment. We therefore reject the agency's claim that Congress intended &#x00A7; 7701(j) to limit the relief awarded to a retired employee who prevails on his removal claim.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;We also reject the agency's contention that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.805(e)(2) does not apply to employees who appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) and prevail on their removal claims. The agency's argument is founded on the voluntary/involuntary framework of adjudicating retirement appeals--which, as we have explained, does not apply to joint removal and retirement appeals over which the Board has jurisdiction pursuant to &#x00A7; 7701(j). In addition, the agency continues to claim that the appellant's removal was "both warranted and justified," in the face of the Board's Final Order reversing it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Appellant's Petition for Enforcement</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for enforcement, the appellant asserted that he retired solely due to the agency's final decision to remove him. We see nothing in the record to contradict this statement.[6] The Board's April 18, 2012 Final Order reversed the appellant's removal on procedural grounds. He therefore falls squarely within the Norton line of cases, under which the Board awards to an appellant who both retired and was removed all the relief he could have obtained had he pursued his removal action without retiring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The agency insists that the appellant is not entitled to reinstatement because he retired "voluntarily." As we have explained, the Board no longer uses the voluntary/involuntary framework in adjudicating express removal and retirement appeals. <span class="Italic">See Scalese</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 249. Rather, the Board adjudicates the removal action, whose outcome determines both the removal and the retirement claims. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, even if the Board did use such a framework, the appellant's retirement would not be considered voluntary because it was based on a final removal decision that the Board reversed. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board reverses a personnel action, the agency must return the appellant as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus, the Board properly ordered the agency to cancel the appellant's removal, reinstate him, and pay him appropriate back pay, with interest, and benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden to prove its compliance with the Board's order. The agency's assertions of compliance must include a clear explanation of its compliance actions supported by documentary evidence. <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 319, &#x00B6; 5 (2011). Here, the agency canceled the appellant's removal but neither reinstated him nor paid him back pay or benefits. Accordingly, we find the agency noncompliant with the April 18, 2012 Final Order and order appropriate relief. This is the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board in this compliance proceeding. Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations, section 1201.183(c)(1) (5 C.F.R. 1201.183(c)(1)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, however, in appeals other than retirements based on involuntary separations, the underlying appealed personnel action is rescinded and the employee's personnel folder is completely cleansed of any reference to a removal, <span class="Italic">Cooper v.

The <span class="Italic">Cooper</span> dismissal is avoided and an appeal from a retirement is not mooted by a clean OPF if, in the appeal from the removal, the appellant alleges that the removal was a violation of the civil rights laws entitling him or her to compensatory damages. <span class="Italic">Lamberson v. VA</span>, 80 MSPR 648, 654 &#x00B6; 12 (1999), <span class="Italic">post</span>.

<p class="Body-Text">Until 1989 federal employees who retired at the same time that they suffered an action appealable to the Board risked mooting their appeals through their retirements. There was one exception to the effect of concurrent removal and retirement, or retirement retroactive to the date of an adverse action: if the basis of the removal served as the basis for discontinued service retirement, the retirement would not moot the adverse action if the adverse action was set aside by the Board. <span class="Italic">Dobratz v. DHHS</span>, 53 MSPR 9, 11-16 (1992). A somewhat similar approach was voiced by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Covington v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 937 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The court sent an appeal back to the Board for a hearing on an appeal from a RIF that led to a discontinued service annuity.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Until recently, appeals by employees who had retired voluntarily after their agencies had decided to take the appealed actions generally could not be heard. If the employee retired on or before the effective date of the action at issue, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the ground that the action had never been effected and therefore could not be appealed....&#8197;If the employee retired after the effective date of the action at issue, the retirement generally caused the appeal to be moot because the employee would not be entitled to reinstatement or back pay if he prevailed in his appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. United States</span>, 591 F.2d 688, 692-93, 219 Ct.

Cl. 772, 773-75 (1982) (if retirement preceded reduction-in-force action, Board lacked jurisdiction over appeal of latter action, and if retirement occurred after reduction-in-force action, petitioner would not be entitled to reinstatement and back pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, however, Congress enacted legislation intended in part to <span id="Page_1070"></span>"protect[&#8197;] the appellate rights of employees who retire[d] during the pendency of their disputes."[1] H.

<p class="Block-Quote2">In determining the appealability under [section 7701] of any case involving a removal from the service (other than the removal of a reemployed annuitant), neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j).[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A similar provision, 5 USC 1221(j), was added by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989). For the reasons stated below, we need not determine whether that provision, which concerns "any case involving an allegation made by an individual under the provisions of [chapter 12 of title 5] ," applies to this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Section 7701, the section to which the quoted provision refers, applies to appeals to the Board from any actions that are "appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation," 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(a), including the law that provides appeal rights from removals, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a), 7512(A), 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The anti-abatement statute was interpreted by the Board to extend to disability retirements initiated after, but retroactive to, the date of removals for medical inability to perform work. The Board had jurisdiction if "the appellant's removal was effected before the granting of his disability retirement" even though the effective date of the retirement was the same date of the removal. <span class="Italic">Coltin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 56 MSPR 3, 4-6 (1992). If there was a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute concerning whether the retirement occurred before or after the effective date of a removal, the appellant should receive a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Willis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 433, 438-39 (1993), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Williams v. EEOC</span>, 64 MSPR 436, 439-40 (1994), clarified matters for those wondering when retirement defeated the ability to appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As amended by the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990), 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) prohibits the Board from taking into account "an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute" when "determining the appealability under [section 7701] of any case involving a removal from the service..." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cooper v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 600, 602 (1994). Here, the administrative judge found, relying on <span class="Italic">Drumheller v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 441, 443-45 (1992), that this appeal is outside the Board's jurisdiction because the appellant retired on the effective date of his removal and, thus, the removal was never effected.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the administrative judge issued her initial decision, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued <span class="Italic">Mays v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 F.3d 1577 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the agency informed the appellant on December 1, 1992 that it would effect her removal on December 4, 1992; the appellant retired effective December 4, 1992. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1577-1578. When the appellant attempted to appeal her removal, the Board dismissed her appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction, reasoning that, because she retired on the effective date of her removal, the removal was merely proposed and not effectuated.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit reversed. It found that Mays's removal was not merely "proposed" because the agency made a final decision on December 1, 1992 to remove her on December 4, 1992. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1579. It also found that, the appellant could not escape the final agency decision to remove her because her SF-50 showed that she retired in lieu of involuntary action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. The court noted that it was not disputed that the appellant would not have retired when she did but for the removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1580. The court further found that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) states only that retirement status may not be taken into account; it makes no distinction as to when retirement status becomes effective. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court therefore found that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> was incorrect to the extent that it distinguished between employees whose retirement was effective after the removals and those whose retirement was effective the same day as their removals. <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1581. It thus determined that the Board had jurisdiction over Mays's appeal. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this appeal are squarely on point with those of <span class="Italic">Mays.</span> The appellant was informed on July 19, 1990, that the agency would effect his removal on July 23, 1990; he retired on July 23, 1990. It is not disputed that the appellant would not have retired on that date but for the agency's removal action. Therefore, under <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the Board has jurisdiction over this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, shortly after the court issued <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Jankowski v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 63 MSPR 596 (1994). In <span class="Italic">Jankowski</span>, the appellant resigned on January 18, 1991 and later filed a petition for appeal of his resignation, contending that it was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, 63 MSPR at 597. He thereafter filed a November 29, 1991 application for disability retirement, which the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) eventually approved retroactive to January 17, 1991, one day before the effective date of his alleged involuntary resignation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the action was effected before OPM granted the appellant's retirement and the appellant failed to show that his resignation was involuntary. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598-599. The Board emphasized that, as long as the agency's action was effected prior to OPM's grant of retirement, the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal regardless of the effective date of retirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598. The Board also noted, however, that, where an agency has decided but not yet effected a removal action, and the employee retires before the removal action becomes effective, no appealable action has occurred and the Board would lack jurisdiction over an appeal of the removal action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 598.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal does not involve a situation in which OPM approves a retirement application after the effective date of a removal action but retroactive to a date before the effective date of the removal action. Thus, <span class="Italic">Jankowski</span> is distinguishable from this appeal. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Jankowski</span> suggested in dicta that the Board lacks jurisdiction over an appeal of a removal action where the appellant retires after the agency makes its final decision to remove him, but on or before the date the removal becomes effective, such dicta is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Mays</span> and we therefore clarify it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Matos v. VA</span>, NY-0752-13-0136-I-1 (NP 9/13/2013) ("[T]he Board retains jurisdiction over a case involving the removal of an employee who retires when faced with a decided removal action against him, regardless of whether the date of his retirement falls on or before the effective date of his removal"); <span class="Italic">Lewis v.

<p class="Body-Text">It is jurisdictionally insignificant if the retirement is requested by the appellant for reasons, as stated on his retirement application, that do not reflect the proposed removal, as long as the record reflects, through the timing of the retirement, the removal decision, as well as other circumstances, e.g., timing of the action and agency notations in personnel records, that the adverse action prompted the retirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anderson v. SBA</span>, 78 MSPR 518, 522 &#x00B6; 4 (1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Significant in the jurisdictional analysis is the issuance of a removal decision with an effective date. <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. VA</span>, 86 MSPR 519, 522 (2000), implied that a proposal alone will not support the removal appeal of a retired employee:</p>

In so holding, the court distinguished situations in which an employee's removal was only proposed, finding that the agency had made a final decision to remove Mays<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1579-80. We find that the agency's April 19 memorandum to the appellant was a final decision to terminate his employment. Contrary to the agency's assertion that the termination was only "contemplated" at that point, the April 19 memorandum flatly informed that appellant that his "term appointment has been expired effective May 3, 1999." Nothing in this memorandum indicates that the agency was only "contemplating" the termination of the appellant's employment. It informed him unequivocally that his employment was going to end on May 3....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Analyzing the issue as one of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Charles v. DHUD</span>, DA-0752-13-0242-I-1 (NP 5/19/2014), noted of the rescission of a removal before an appeal was filed with a retirement caused by the removal notice (with no adverse notation on the SF-50):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant correctly notes, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j), an employee who retires on or before the scheduled effective date of his removal may still appeal his removal to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (pursuant to section 7701(j), an employee stigmatized with an adverse final decision reflected in his government employment record may challenge the final removal decision while also opting to retire). However, the appellant is incorrect in <span id="Page_1071"></span>arguing that "the Board should have retained jurisdiction over this appeal irrespective of the removal being cancelled or rescinded before" he filed his appeal because Board jurisdiction attached when the removal was effectuated. Board jurisdiction does not attach if an agency modifies its action <span class="Italic">before</span> an appeal is filed. <span class="Italic">Anderson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 494, 498 (1997). Thus, the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's removal because, given that the agency cancelled the removal action when the appellant retired prior to filing his Board appeal, the removal was no longer an appealable action at the time he filed his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See Taber</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 9 (finding no jurisdiction over an appeal from an agency's decision to remove because the record established that the decision to remove had been cancelled by the time the appellant filed his appeal).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">There may be a question of whether the agency well and truly cancels an action, and whether the appellant learned of the cancelation before retiring, as in <span class="italic">Sullivan v. DHHS</span>, DE-0752-16-0309-I-1 (NP 7/27/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant primarily relies on <span class="italic">Tennyson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, to support his contention that the agency failed to effectively cancel his removal before he appealed. 3 M.S.P.R. 416, 419 (1980), <span class="italic">overruled on other grounds by Koop v. Federal Emergency Management Agency</span>, 16 M.S.P.R. 605 (1983). In <span class="italic">Tennyson</span>, the appellant resigned and applied for retirement after the agency notified him of its final decision to remove him. 3 M.S.P.R. at 417. As a result, a personnel specialist stopped the processing of the appellant's removal in its computer system, and the agency instead processed his retirement. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 417-18. The Board found that it had jurisdiction over the appeal because there was no evidence that the individual who stopped processing the appellant's removal had the authority to cancel the action, and the appellant had not been notified at the time that he filed his appeal of the cancellation. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 419. We find the underlying facts analogous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that <span class="italic">Tennyson</span> is inapplicable because there, the agency issued the resignation SF-50 after the appellant filed his appeal, whereas here, the agency issued an SF-50 effecting the appellant's retirement before he filed his appeal. We disagree. As here, the relevant inquiry in <span class="italic">Tennyson</span> was whether the agency effectively cancelled the removal action before the appellant filed his appeal. Moreover, an SF-50 does not constitute a personnel action itself and does not on its face control an employee's status and rights. <span class="italic">Fox v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 22 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must look to the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the agency's removal action was effective at the time that the appellant filed his appeal. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Looking to past precedent, some potential factors to consider include, but are not limited to: (1) who authorized the cancellation and the basis for his or her authority to make that decision; (2) whether the agency issued a cancellation SF-50, sent a cancellation letter, or completed some other similar cancellation procedure; (3) whether the agency notified the appellant of its decision to cancel the removal action; and (4) the timing of the agency's cancellation efforts. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Jenkins v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 911 F.3d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (holding that the agency completely rescinded the action by cancelling the removal and scrubbing the appellant's personnel file of any reference of it); <span class="italic">Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 22 (finding that the agency removed the appellant, notwithstanding her subsequent retroactive retirement, when it issued the removal decision, as evidenced by the accompanying removal SF-50); <span class="italic">Taber</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 9 (finding that, although the effective date of the removal decision had passed, the Board lacked jurisdiction over the appeal because the agency mailed the appellant a letter notifying him of the cancellation of his removal before he filed his appeal); <span class="italic">Tennyson</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. at 419 (finding that the agency failed to effectively cancel the removal action because there was no indication that an authorized official made the cancellation decision or that the appellant was notified of it).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant argues that the administrative judge erred in not following <span class="italic">Johnson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 14 M.S.P.R. 181, 184-85 (1982), which requires complete rescission of the action being appealed and restoration to <span class="italic">status quo ante</span> for a cancellation to be effective. We find that <span class="italic">Johnson</span> is inapposite to the instant appeal. The rule set forth in Johnson applies to cancellations of actions that occur after an appeal has been filed. 14 M.S.P.R. at 184. Rather, <span class="italic">Anderson</span> is applicable here because it concerns an agency's cancellation of an otherwise appealable action before an appeal is filed. 75 M.S.P.R. at 498.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant represents that he first learned of the cancellation SF-50 during the pendency of the Board appeal. The agency, on the other hand, has provided no evidence on the notice issue. The administrative judge did not identify this aspect of the appellant's jurisdictional burden in his orders or the initial decision, and he made no finding as to whether the appellant received proper notice of the cancellation before filing his appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the appellant alleges that the agency failed to effectively document its decision to cancel his removal, the employees involved lacked the authority to cancel his removal, and the agency did not notify him of its cancellation decision before he filed his appeal. As stated previously, the administrative judge dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, without holding his requested hearing. However, if an appellant makes a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction over his appeal, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994). Nonfrivolous allegations of Board jurisdiction are allegations of fact that, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 329. We find that the appellant's allegations constitute a nonfrivolous allegation that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the agency did not cancel his removal before filing his appeal.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Preliminary discussions leading to retirement do not create a right of appeal from a retirement-based separation as a termination, although the appellant may still, with appropriate grounds, challenge the ensuing retirement as involuntary. In <span class="Italic">Gustavson v. Dept. of Army</span>, 79 MSPR 638, 641 &#x00B6; 4 (1998), the employee was informed that his position would be abolished and that he would be separated by RIF. Based on that information, the employee took early retirement. He did not receive a written RIF separation notice. He could not appeal the RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the Board has jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal based on her determination that the agency's oral communication to the appellant that he would be separated was sufficient to enable him to appeal to the Board under <span class="Italic">Mays</span>. This was error. In <span class="Italic">Mays,</span> the agency acted upon its proposed removal by issuing the appellant a written notice of its final decision to remove her for unacceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See Mays,</span> 27 F.3d at 1580. Here, the appellant's VSIP application expressly provided that such a payment would preclude his separation by RIF. Further, the agency took no action with regard to the appellant's separation once he had elected early retirement, and never issued him a formal written notice of its decision to separate him. <span class="Italic">Compare Cruz v. Department of the Navy,</span> 934 F.2d 1240, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Board lacks jurisdiction over actions which are not effected, but merely proposed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appeal is moot as a matter of law, 5 USC 7701(j) does not change the result, according to <span class="Italic">Tunik v. MSPB</span>, <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/fed/033286p.pdf">407 F.3d 1326</a>, 1331-32 (Fed. Cir. 2005), involving the Board's jurisdiction over actions brought by or against ALJs:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Tunik's complaint only seeks prospective relief to prevent his supervisors from interfering with his decisional independence. Given that Tunik has retired, it is difficult to see how any of Tunik's supervisors could interfere with his decisional independence in the future. Thus, Tunik's appeal is moot and must be dismissed. <span class="Italic">County of Los Angeles v. Davis</span>, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) ("[J]urisdiction, properly acquired, may abate if the case becomes moot because (1) it can be said with assurance that 'there is no reasonable expectation...' that the alleged violation will recur and (2) interim relief or events have completely and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation." (citation omitted)); <span class="Italic">United States v. Concentrated Phosphate Exp. Ass'n</span>, 393 U.S. 199, 203 (1968) ("A case might become moot if subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Tunik's appeal is moot is not changed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j). That statute states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In determining the appealability under this section of any case involving a removal from the service (other than the removal of a reemployed annuitant), neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(j) (2000). In <span class="Italic">Mays v. Department of Transportation</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1994), we held that "[t]he plain language of section <span id="Page_1072"></span>7701(j) means that retirement status cannot be taken into account in determining the appealability of 'any case involving a removal.'" That case involved an employee of the Department of Transportation that retired on the effective date of her removal. We held that her before us, it could not confer authority on this court to hear a case where that authority, 404 U.S. 403, 407 (1972) ("retirement did not render her appeal moot under the statute.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> However, Mays involved an involuntary retirement.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1580 ("[T]he agency does not dispute that Mays would not have retired when she did if it had not been for the removal action."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Heelen v. Dep't of Commerce</span>, 154 F.3d 1306, 1309 n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (applying section 7701(j) again in the context of an involuntary retirement). If Mays prevailed in her action, presumably she would have been entitled to some relief, even though she retired in the interim. Here, however, even if Tunik prevails, it is "absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur." <span class="Italic">Concentrated Phosphate,</span> 393 U.S. at 203. Even if the statute extended to the situation before us, it could not confer authority on this court to hear a case where that authority is constitutionally lacking. <span class="Italic">See Sec. &#x0026; Exch. Comm'n v. Med. Comm. for Human Rights.</span> 404 U.S. 403, 407 (1972). ("Our lack of jurisdiction to review moot cases derives from the requirement of Article III of the Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy." (quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that Tunik retired prior to the Board's decision in this case raises an additional issue. Although the Board is a creature of statute and is not necessarily subject to the requirements of Article III of the Constitution, Congress has nonetheless provided that "[t]he Board shall not issue advisory opinions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204(h) (2000). Given that Tunik's appeal was moot when the Board issued its decision in this case, the Board's opinion was advisory and must be vacated. Because the remaining appeals relied on and thus implicate the rationale of the Board's decision in Tunik's case, we will address that rationale to the extent it relates to the other appeals before us.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Most of the decisions involving the effect of retirement involve removals or separations by RIF. In <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 21 MSPR 290, 293 (1984), the employee was placed on enforced leave while his agency successfully pursued a retirement application on his behalf. The appellant claimed that the enforced leave was a suspension and, in response to the mootness argument advanced by the agency, the appellant asserted that retroactive retirement would not make him whole because he would still be entitled to the difference between his regular pay and his annuity during the period of enforced leave. The Board agreed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's contention that appellant's arguments are moot because OPM subsequently approved the disability retirement application, effective the first day of the enforced leave status, is without merit. OPM's determination that appellant was disabled for his field auditing position is not dispositive as to whether appellant was fit to perform the office duties provided by the agency. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McQuerter v. Department of the Army,</span> 10 MSPB 780 (1982). Additionally, if it is ultimately determined that appellant was improperly suspended, he would be entitled to back pay in excess of his annuity for the time in enforced leave status and the additional service time and leave accruing to him during this period could affect the amount of his disability annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8339(g); 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831.302, 831.701(f). Thus, OPM's determination does not moot appellant's petition, and appellant is entitled to a hearing on this matter....</p>
