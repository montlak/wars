<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-42"><span class="space">f.</span> Expertise of Whistleblower</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 WPEA amended 5 USC 2302(b)(14) to provide that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A] determination as to whether an employee or applicant reasonably believes that such employee or applicant has disclosed information that evidences any violation of law, rule, regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety shall be made by determining whether a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee or applicant could reasonably conclude that the actions of the Government evidence such violations, mismanagement, waste, abuse, or danger.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unless there are unusual circumstances, no special expertise is required to recognize gross mismanagement or abuse of authority. <span class="Italic">Berkley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 71 MSPR 341, 349 (1996). A commonsense approach suffices. <span class="Italic">Owen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 63 MSPR 621, 628-29 (1994), provided an example of a "reasonable belief" analysis in the specific context of an individual who made complaints to OSHA and to an agency safety office of the agency's failure to prevent his exposure to fumes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish protected whistleblowing under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), the appellant must show that a reasonable person in his position would have reasonably believed that the information he disclosed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">White</span>, 63 MSPR at 95-96; <span class="Italic">Geyer</span>, 63 MSPR at 16, 18-19. The administrative judge did not address the reasonableness of the appellant's belief, and, thus, we do so now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant contacted OSHA and reported that he was being constantly exposed to chemical fumes at the workplace. As an individual with respiratory sensitivity and having filed grievances against the agency in the past concerning that sensitivity, the appellant was likely aware that an agency's allowing an employee with respiratory <span id="Page_3695"></span>problems to work around chemical fumes was a violation of a law, rule, or regulation. If the appellant had been unaware that such a law, rule, or regulation was being violated, there would have been no reason for him to have contacted OSHA. Moreover, OSHA's citation of the agency for a violation involving the matter disclosed by the appellant further bolsters the finding that the appellant reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced a violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the appellant's respiratory sensitivity and his prior experience at the agency likely made him aware that smoking in the area near his office was not allowed. Thus, we find that the appellant's disclosure to the agency's safety office about the smoking near his office also evidenced a reasonable belief of a violation of a law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's experiences and the circumstances of this case also make it likely that he reasonably believed that his disclosures evidenced a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety. He was aware that at least one other employee with respiratory problems also suffered from exposure to the violations he reported.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's expertise may carry weight in the analysis of what constitutes a reasonable belief, <span class="Italic">Gupta v. DHHS,</span> DC-1221-13-0650-W-1 (NP 4/22/2016) ("The appellant's expertise in the area of public health further supports our conclusion that he, at least, has made a nonfrivolous allegation that his belief was reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Department of the Interior</span>, 602 F.3d 1370, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (finding that the appellant's expertise in public safety supported the reasonableness of her belief that the reallocation of police officers constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety)."); <span class="Italic">see Dabner v. EPA</span>, CH-1221-17-0112-W-1 (NP 5/3/2023) ("Considering the low standard for a nonfrivolous allegation and the appellant's professional expertise in this area, we find that she made a nonfrivolous allegation that she reasonably believed that such violations occurred. <span class="Italic">See Embree v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. 79, 85 (1996) (considering the appellant's asserted subject matter expertise in finding that she made a nonfrivolous allegation of gross mismanagement in connection with agency collection efforts)"). Specialized experience or knowledge may render a whistleblower's assertion more likely to be reasonable. An individual with specialized knowledge, e.g., a law enforcement officer with proficiency in firearms, was credited with forming a reasonable belief as to whether a supervisor was falsely reporting firearms qualifications scores. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johns v. VA</span>, 95 MSPR 106, 110-11 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2003). An attorney with a position requiring expertise in the matters that he reported had a reasonable belief in his disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kalil v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 77, 84 &#x00B6; 16 (2004). The Board noted of a disclosure in <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., 114 MSPR 155, 159 &#x00B6; 12, 2010 MSPB 106 (2010), <span class="Italic">following remand</span>, <span class="Italic">Massie v. Dept. of Transp</span>., DA-1221-11-0224-B-1 (NP 6/18/2103):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...He alleged that he disclosed to the IG that named management officials granted Eclipse Aviation a Type Certificate even though it was not in compliance with various airworthiness regulations, and that accommodating Eclipse Aviation in this manner essentially allowed that company to show regulatory compliance at a future date, even though FAA orders require companies to show compliance before the Type Certificate is issued for airplane design data. The appellant's position as an Aerospace Engineer afforded him personal knowledge of the information that formed the basis for his disclosures, <span class="Italic">see Schlosser v. Department of the Interior,</span> 75 M.S.P.R. 15, 22 (1997), and, while that circumstance does not establish that the appellant's disclosures are protected, it does provide support for his claim that he reasonably believed that the information he disclosed evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation and a substantial or specific danger to public safety. We therefore find that he made a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's expertise may be evaluated to determine that the appellant lacked a reasonable belief in his allegations, <span class="Italic">Carolyn v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 63 MSPR 684, 691-92 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that there was no gross waste or mismanagement in this case. Instead, there is simply the appellant's disagreement with the investment decisions of his superior. Not only does even a passing familiarity with the wide variety of investment vehicles available argue against finding gross waste or mismanagement, but the information and articles submitted by the appellant with his appeal, clearly demonstrate that there is ample reason to conclude that persons with the expertise and responsibility for making investments could easily have agreed with the decisions or strategies adopted by Parris and disagreed with those recommended by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether gross waste or mismanagement actually occurred, however, as noted above, a determination must still be made as to whether the appellant reasonably believed that there was gross waste or mismanagement. While the reasonable belief test is partly subjective, it is primarily objective, i.e., whether "the matter reported was one which a reasonable person in the employee's position would believe to evidence mismanagement...or any of the other situations specified in 5 USC 2302(b)(8)." <span class="Italic">See Ramos v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 4 MSPB 446, 4 MSPR 388, 392 n.1 (1980). On review, we conclude that the appellant did not possess such a reasonable belief. Consideration must be given to the fact that the appellant obviously possessed the necessary education, training, and skills to serve in the high-level position of Financial Economist. <span class="Italic">See Haley v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 557 (Fed. Cir. 1992), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 2440, 124 L. Ed.2d 658 (1993). It is beyond dispute that investment professionals can, and do, disagree on the merits of investments and these particular investments. Under the circumstances, we find that a person with the appellant's experience and qualifications could not reasonably have believed that Parris' decisions amounted to gross waste or mismanagement, but rather, that there was a simple disagreement as to which investment was better. The appellant cannot blindly elevate his disagreement with his supervisor's investment preferences into a reasonable belief of gross waste or mismanagement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude, therefore, that the appellant's stated disagreement with Parris' investment decisions was not a protected disclosure under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Expertise suggested that whistleblowing allegations were not reasonably founded, <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/nonprecedential/STEVENS_R_SCOTT_AT_1221_15_0481_W_1_FINAL_ORDER_1314784.pdf">AT-1221-15-0481-W-1</a> (NP 7/1/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected whistleblowing disclosure is an allegation of facts that, if proven, would show that the appellant disclosed a matter that a reasonable person in his position would believe evidences one of the categories of wrongdoing specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Salerno</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 230, &#x00B6; 6. An appellant need not establish an actual violation of one of the categories of wrongdoing listed in section 2302(b)(8) to demonstrate that he had a reasonable belief that he made a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Stiles v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 263, &#x00B6; 17 (2011). Rather, he need prove only that a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by him could reasonably conclude the agency's actions evidenced one of the categories of wrongdoing listed therein. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(13); <span class="Italic">Shannon v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 22 (2014). When we consider the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the appellant, however, we note that he is a supervisory employee with managerial aspirations, he has 32 years of supervisory and technical leadership experience, 24 years in the U.S. Navy, and is certified as a project management professional. His Government sector experience suggests at least some familiarity with agency reorganization and sources of authority for the reassignment of employees in some circumstances. Thus, the appellant could not have had a reasonable belief to speculate, as he seems to do here, that a noncompetitive reassignment is by its very nature suspect. <span class="Italic">See Phillip v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, No. 2016-1002, 2016 WL 929856, at *2 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 11, 2016) (holding that a claim that "possible unscrupulous practices" were occurring at the workplace did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure); <span class="Italic">Barela v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 388 F. App'x 965, 967 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Linder v. Department of Justice</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 14 (2014).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the appellant's assertion that the IG's lengthy investigation establishes the reasonableness of his belief, does not provide a basis for disturbing the initial decision, as many factors could delay or extend an investigation. We further note that the IG found no violation of policy or merit system principles and that the agency's authority and rationale to reassign employees noncompetitively appeared sufficient on its face. At most, notwithstanding the IG investigation and report, the appellant's disclosure constitutes a general philosophical or policy disagreement with the agency regarding the reorganization, which does not otherwise constitute a protected disclosure under the WPEA. <span class="Italic">Webb v. Department of the Interior</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 248, &#x00B6; 8 (2015) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(D)); <span class="Italic">Luecht v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 297, &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (concluding that the appellant's statement that he met with the agency IG to report "ongoing fraud in [Resource Sharing] contracts" lacked the detail necessary to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety). After extensively reviewing the appellant's written submissions, we conclude that he failed to allege nonfrivolously any of the types of wrongdoing set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), and he did not make a protected disclosure.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an appeal involving an employee's complaint that his agency, a bank regulator, violated law or regulation by its treatment of an audited bank, the Board and reviewing court examined the statutory and agency guidance governing the regulatory process. The Board and court determined that the agency had substantial discretion in its treatment of the bank and concluded that the "[p]etitioner's experience as an Examiner and the clear language of the relevant authorities" made "untenable" the employee's claim that his agency's action approving the capital plan of the bank constituted a violation of law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Haley v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 977 F.2d 553, 557 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sanders v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 595, 600-01 (1994) (appellant's whistleblowing contentions were not reasonable when he should have known that his position was not sustained by an agency policy and practice concerning the assignment of inmates to work release programs). [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-20-123.html#sec13-119">Duty of Judge to Inform Appellant of Jurisdictional Requirements</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3696"></span>"[T]he Board does not require appellants...to study the law before making what is otherwise a facially reasonable claim of a violation of law." <span class="Italic">Kinan v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 561, 568 &#x00B6; 15 (2001) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 2022 MSPB 9 (2022). But a commonsense approach may dispel the alleged reasonableness of belief in a disclosure. <span class="Italic">Ally v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 58 MSPR 680, 684-85 (1993), determined that an employee did not qualify as a whistleblower because of her complaint to a senator concerning the search of her car on a military post. The Board determined that the employee was told that under agency regulations, she consented to a search of her car when she drove it onto government property. Additionally, she was told that she would consent to a search by opening her car door. Under those circumstances, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Ally</span>, "we find that the appellant had reason to believe only that the search was legal[.]" <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Kalil v. USDA</span>, 96 MSPR 77, 84 &#x00B6; 16 (2004) (considering the appellant's status as an attorney well versed in the subject matter of his disclosures).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although expertise may not be required, an employee's expertise may demonstrate the reasonableness of his belief in disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Paul v. USDA</span>, 66 MSPR 643, 648 (1995) ("The fact that the appellant was responsible for applying the mineral patent laws in preparing mineral reports would support a conclusion that he reasonably believed that he was disclosing violations of those laws."). The fact that a better informed employee might have known that there was no misconduct, however, does not mean that the less knowledgeable employee's disclosure is unprotected when, after all the facts are known, it is determined that the conduct disclosed was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Spears</span>, 75 MSPR 639, 659-60 (1997) ("Without knowledge of this key fact, the author of the anonymous letter could reasonably have believed that...the training trip was entirely unnecessary.... [W]e cannot add requirements not found in the statute, such as a full investigation by the whistleblower before making a disclosure.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit examined what constitutes the measure of reasonableness when assessing disclosures leading to alleged violations. In <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 521, 527 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the appellant claimed that his disclosures concerning unnecessary foreign travel expense resulted in reprisals. The disclosures did not rise to the level of protected activity. The appellant should not have believed he was presenting <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> complaints of gross waste of funds:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision whether to send two scientists to address a scientific meeting, even on the same topic, was a matter within the discretion of the Director for Research and Laboratory Management, Dr. Kamely. She properly could have concluded that two presentations on even the same topic would be desirable to present different views on the subject. Dr. Ward, himself a scientist, presumably was aware of this. He could not reasonably have believed the travel to permit different perspectives on the same scientific topic constituted a "waste of funds." The Board therefore properly concluded that Dr. Ward's allegations relating to Dr. Kamely's authorization of Dr. DeFrank's travel to Portugal did not constitute whistleblowing under 5 USC 2302(b)(8)(A)(ii).</p>
