<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-193"><span class="space">2.</span> Accretion</h4>
<p class="noindent">Accretion involves the addition of a group of employees to an existing bargaining unit without an election, based on a triggering event or change in agency operations or organization. Where employees sought to be accreted are specifically excluded from the unit description in a bargaining certificate, these employees may only be accreted into that unit where there were meaningful changes in the employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances that eliminate the original distinctions between employees and warrant their unit inclusion The related concept of successorship, discussed below, also arises from changes in agency structure, but it involves different criteria: (a) an entire recognized unit, or a portion thereof, is transferred; (b) the transferred employees are in an appropriate bargaining unit, under section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute, after the transfer; and (c) they constitute a majority (or a predominant number--more than 70%--if more than one union is involved) of the employees in the unit; (d) the gaining entity has substantially the same organizational mission as the losing entity, with the transferred employees performing substantially the same duties and functions under substantially similar working conditions in the gaining entity; and (e) It is not demonstrated that an election is necessary to determine representation. Successorship results in the continuation of a union's status as exclusive representative of a bargaining unit without a new, secret ballot election. Successorship depends on the union involved being the choice of the majority of employees in the claimed successor unit.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Fleet and Indus. Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 53</span>, 52 FLRA 950 (1997) ("<span class="Italic">FISC, Norfolk II</span>"), discussed below, clarified the distinction between successorship and accretion in reorganization cases:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;if transferred employees are not included in, and constitute a majority of the employees in, a separate appropriate unit, a petition claiming successorship will be dismissed;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;claims of accretion are then considered, and if the transferred employees are functionally and administratively integrated into the gaining organization's pre-existing unit(s), and that adding the transferred employees to the unit(s) would be appropriate under section 7112(a), an accretion will be found and the unit will be clarified;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;if including the transferred employees in an established unit would not be appropriate, any petitions claiming an accretion, as well as the petitions claiming successorship, will be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Key to accretion is a change in agency operations or organization, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Columbia-Cascades Area Office and IBEW Local 77</span>, 65 FLRA 491, 493-94 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_187"></span>The legal framework for resolving accretion issues is set forth in the Authority's case law. Accretion involves the addition of a group of employees to an existing bargaining unit, without an election, based on a "triggering event" or change in agency operations or organization. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Nw. Region, Grand Coulee Power Office, Wash., </span>62 FLRA 522, 524 (2008) (<span class="Italic">Grand Coulee Power Office, Wash.</span>). Because accretion precludes employee self-determination, the accretion doctrine is narrowly applied. <span class="Italic">See id. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where employees sought to be accreted have been "specifically excluded from the unit description in a bargaining certificate," these employees may "only be accreted into that unit" where there have been "meaningful changes" in the employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances that eliminate the original distinctions between employees and thus warrant their inclusion into the unit. <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Supply Ctr., Columbus, Columbus, Ohio, </span>53 FLRA 1114, 1123-1124 (1998) (<span class="Italic">DLA Columbus</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the RD failed to apply established law when he found that having the same area manager, who could establish working conditions for both groups of employees after the 2009 reorganization, was not a "meaningful change" in the GSPP employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances. However, as discussed below, the Union fails to substantiate its claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that having the same area manager is a "meaningful change" because the area manager "impacts everything that an employee does every day." However, the Union fails to explain how a change in manager, or having the same manager as employees in the prevailing rate bargaining unit, changed GSPP employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances so as to constitute a "meaningful change."

<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the Union argues that the RD failed to apply established law because the RD did not determine whether there have been meaningful changes in the interns' job circumstances, and thus did not properly consider whether the interns may accrete to the unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accretion is a longstanding doctrine that involves the addition of a group of employees to an existing bargaining unit without an election, based on a "triggering event" or change in agency operations or organization.[11] Because accretion precludes employee self-determination, the Authority applies the accretion doctrine narrowly.[12] In order for employees to accrete to a unit from which they have been expressly excluded, there must be meaningful changes in the employees' duties, functions, or job circumstances that eliminate the original distinctions that led to their exclusion in the first place.[13] If there have not been meaningful changes, then accretion is not permitted.[14]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Union petitioned the RD to clarify the unit to include the interns based on the claim that there have been meaningful changes in the interns' job circumstances.

<p class="noindent-1">Although the Agency claims that the RD "rejected" the Union's claim that meaningful changes have occurred, the RD actually found it unnecessary to make this determination.

<p class="noindent-1">And, contrary to the dissent's characterization of <span class="Italic">FTC</span>, that decision does <span class="Italic">not</span> hold that accretion is "<span class="Italic">not appropriate</span> for including employees <span class="Italic">who were excluded</span> from the original certification <span class="Italic">pursuant to a voluntary pre-election agreement</span>...because they were temporary employees, supervisors, management officials[,] or confidential employees.

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, <span class="Italic">FTC</span> does not support the RD's refusal to determine whether there have been any meaningful changes in this case. Further, the Agency does not dispute that Authority precedent requires an analysis of whether "meaningful changes" have occurred. While the Agency claims that the RD did not fail to apply established law--asserting that a change "could not have occurred" and that a hearing was not required--the Agency does not argue that the meaningful-change analysis does not apply.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because the RD did not determine whether the interns have undergone meaningful changes, the RD failed to apply established law. And the record does not permit us to resolve the question of whether there have been meaningful changes. Accordingly, we remand the petition to the RD.[37]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[37]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Ocean Energy Mgmt. &#x0026; U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Safety &#x0026; Envtl. Enforcement, New Orleans, La</span>., 67 FLRA 98, 100 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Safety</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In remanding the petition, we note that the Union also argues that established policy warrants reconsideration of the RD's denial of a hearing. The Agency contends that the Union did not request a hearing below, and that &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations precludes the Union from raising any claims that it did not raise below. But even assuming that the Union's argument is properly before us, the Union does not explain why established policy warrants reconsideration. Instead, the Union argues that the RD should have held a hearing because it is "established policy that the [Authority] convenes a hearing to establish record evidence when questions regarding the factual basis of a [clarification] petition arise." However, as the Agency suggests, Authority precedent establishes that RDs have broad discretion to determine whether a hearing is necessary. As such, and as the Union does not demonstrate that the RD abused this discretion, there is no basis for finding that established policy warrants reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Union argues that an election could result in fragmentation that would violate the Statute. But it is unclear at this time whether, on remand, the RD would direct an election--particularly given that there is no pending petition for an election. Therefore, the Union's argument is premature, and we do not consider it at this time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note the following. First, as set forth above, the accretion doctrine is a well-settled, longstanding doctrine in the federal sector.[47] And the doctrine is even longer-standing in the private sector.[48] Thus, our action today is consistent with--and not at all an extension of--existing precedent.[49] Second, the accretion doctrine has nothing whatsoever to do with union shops (where covered employees must join the union)[50] or agency shops (where covered employees must join the union or pay the union a service fee).[51] These are banned by the Statute in &#x00A7; 7102, which provides that employees have the right to "form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to <span class="Italic">refrain from any such activity</span>."[52] Consistent with &#x00A7; 7102, Authority precedent--beginning thirty-five years ago--confirms that exclusive representatives under the Statute may not compel members of the units they represent to pay service fees.[53] For these reasons, a suggestion that inclusion in a unit through accretion is akin, in any way, to creation of a union shop or agency shop, while undoubtedly provocative, is both rash and wrong.</p>

In this regard, there were no changes in the location, the function, or the duties of the HHFO employees as a result of the realignment that preceded the 1996 certification.

<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a unit is appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute, the Authority considers whether the unit would: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959.

<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the first criterion--that employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--the Authority examines such factors as whether the employees in the proposed unit: are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are administered by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960-61. In addition, factors such as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation may be relevant. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In assessing the effective-dealings requirement, the Authority examines such factors as: the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor-relations policy is set in the agency. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Factors to be examined in assessing efficiency of agency operations pertain to the effect of the proposed unit on agency operations in terms of cost, productivity, and use of resources. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 962.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD stated that because "the units in Biloxi, Mobile, Panama City and Pensacola have been certified and are each appropriate units,...the unit(s) at [Eglin] is also appropriate under the Statute[,]" given the similarities between the positions and duties of the employees in those respective units. The RD then concluded that the Eglin employees could not properly be accreted into the VHCS units. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Thus, the RD assessed whether the Eglin employees constituted a separate appropriate unit based solely on their similarity to employees in other separately certified units.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As an initial matter, the premise of the RD's appropriate-unit determination--that the other units are "each appropriate units"--is not entirely correct. As the RD acknowledged in his factual findings, the professional employees of the Mobile and Pensacola clinics were included in the consolidated professional unit through clarification, not through an election, and there is no indication in the record that they were certified as separate appropriate units. In this regard, the record indicates that the Mobile and Pensacola professional employees were included in the bargaining unit by accretion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">More importantly, the RD failed to examine each of the requisite statutory criteria in determining that the Eglin employees constitute a separate appropriate unit. Further, the record does not provide a sufficient basis for the Authority to determine whether the Eglin employees constitute a separate appropriate unit. Because the RD did not conduct a hearing, the record before us is limited to the stipulations of the parties. Although the stipulations include information about the Eglin employees' mission and positions, and the organizational level at which personnel and labor relations are handled for Eglin employees, the parties' stipulations do not sufficiently address the variety of additional factors set forth above that the Authority may consider in appropriate unit determinations. <span class="Italic">See also</span>, <span class="Italic">FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960-62 (discussing factors examined by the Authority for each of the three appropriate-unit criteria).

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we grant AFGE's application for review in part on the ground that the RD failed to apply established law by failing to consider the requisite statutory criteria when analyzing whether the Eglin employees constitute a separate appropriate unit, and we remand to the RD to assess whether the Eglin employees constitute a separate appropriate unit under &#x00A7; 7112(a). If, on remand, the RD determines that the Eglin employees constitute a separate, appropriate unit, then they may not be accreted to the existing unit. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 959.</p>

McPherson and AFGE Local 1759</span>, 57 FLRA 95, 96 (2001). Accretion may occur when, through reorganization, employees are assigned to a unit represented by one union and the unit represented by another union ceases to exist, and when, as a result of the reorganization, there is no longer a separate community of interest, the employment origins of the employees become indistinguishable, and the unit represented by the gaining union continues to promote effective dealings and efficiency of agency operations.

To determine accretion questions FLRA looks to the organizational structure of the activity after reorganization, the geographical location of the employees and their duties, and the labor relations and management structure following the reorganization. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Corps of Eng'rs and AFGE Local 3310</span>, 57 FLRA 620, 623 (2001) ("Determining whether employees are sufficiently integrated [in accretion case] is based on, among other things, degree of interchange between employees, the similarities in positions and duties, and the commonality of administrative and organizational functions, missions and chains of command."); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Supply Ctr., Oakland, Cal. and IAM Lodge 739</span>, 5 FLRA 775, 777 (1981) (under reorganization, administratively transferred employees of NAS Supply Department "were organizationally and operationally integrated into NSC and thus accreted to the bargaining unit of NSC employees exclusively represented by AFGE").</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In deciding questions concerning the accretion of employees to an existing bargaining unit, the Authority is bound by the criteria for determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit set forth in section 7112(a)(1) of the Statute. Thus, the Authority may determine that a unit is appropriate only if the determination will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; and (2) promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of, the agency involved. In making determinations under section 7112(a)(1) the Authority examines the factors presented on a case-by-case basis. The Authority has not specified individual factors or the number of such factors needed to conclude that groups of employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Region II, New York, New York</span>, 43 FLRA 1245, 1254 (1992); and <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 39 FLRA at 101. The Authority has further held that it will find an accretion only where the evidence clearly shows that the employees at issue have been so organizationally and operationally integrated with the employees of the established exclusively recognized unit as to lose their separate identity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the RD did not depart from Authority precedent in determining that the centralization of the Activity's personnel functions does not warrant a finding that the Panama and Mediterranean employees have accreted into the OEA unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that evidence of centralized control of operating procedures does not alone require a finding that only a nationwide unit is appropriate.&#x2003;If the Authority were required to find local units inappropriate merely because the facts indicate some centralized control of administrative and personnel matters, we would find few local units to be appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, 48 FLRA at 636.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts in this case establish only that the Activity is in the process of centralizing its personnel function.&#x2003;The regional/area structure remains in place and the regional or area directors continue to have latitude in establishing policies, procedures, and working conditions within their respective regions. In these circumstances, we agree with the RD that the consolidation of the Activity's personnel functions did not substantially change the character of the bargaining units. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">DODDS</span> [6 FLRA 297 (1982)], where the Activity's realignment of its regional structure resulted in a substantial change in the character and scope of the Activity's organization such that the recognized units were no longer appropriate. We find, contrary to the OEA's contention, that the area or regional directors have retained the authority to accept, reject or modify grievances drafted by the centralized personnel staff. In this regard, the only change resulting from the Activity's consolidation of its personnel functions is that the regional directors obtain their management-employee relations advice and assistance from a centralized support staff rather than the regional staff that had reported directly to them. The deciding official on grievances continues to be the regional director, or in the case of Panama, the assistant area director. It is significant that a labor relations advisor remains in both the Panama and Mediterranean offices and that the Intervenors continue to deal with those labor relations personnel on unit matters. Accordingly, in agreement with the RD, we find that the regional directors continue to have authority to administer the operations of their respective regions, insofar as they involve local conditions of employment and personnel issues that are distinct to each region. Further, as found by the RD, there is no evidence that the area or regional directors are precluded from effectively administering a negotiated agreement at the local level. Indeed, since the reorganization, the local agreements have continued to be effectively administered at that level. Therefore, we find that the reorganization of personnel functions did not affect the ability of the individual units to promote effective dealings with, and the efficiency of operations of, the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the reorganization of the Activity's personnel functions did not destroy the separate community of interest shared by the employees in the two units. As the RD found, the reorganization did not involve any movement of unit employees. The employees represented by the OFT and the PCFT continue to perform the same work, in the same locations, as before the reorganization. Further, except for the addition of the assistant area director in Panama, there have been no significant changes in the Activity's line authority and there has been no interaction between the employees represented by the Intervenors with their counterparts in the other regions represented by the OEA. Therefore, we conclude that the centralization of the personnel functions for all the regions has not resulted in the organizational and operational integration of the Panama and Mediterranean employees into OEA's worldwide unit.</p>
<p class="noindent">After a reorganization, a group of employees will not be transferred to the gaining unit's representative through accretion, but will remain with the prior exclusive representative, if there is no physical relocation, the same work continues to be performed in the same location under the same supervision, there is no commingling of employees within the gaining organization, and their work is dissimilar. <span class="Italic">GSA, Nat'l Capital Region and Steamfitters Local 602</span>, 5 <span id="page_191"></span>FLRA 285, 287 (1981).

Although there may be some functional relationship among the various tenants, if on the whole the tenants constitute functionally distinct groups of employees under separate commanding officers with personnel and labor relations authority, there is insufficient community of interest to grant the petition even though the employees are subject to similar personnel policies, practices and working conditions and are serviced through a common personnel office through a support agreement.

<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atl. and NAIL</span>, 64 FLRA 782, 785-87 (2010), summarized the rules governing accretion and successorship (described below) on a reorganization that resulted in the BRAC transfer of employees from one installation to another:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Established Law </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA 950, the Authority adopted the following framework for resolving cases arising from a reorganization where employees are transferred to a preexisting or newly established organization (the "gaining organization") and both successorship and accretion principles are claimed to apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;Initially, the Authority will determine whether, under [&#x00A7;] 7112(a) of the Statute, the transferred employees are included in, and constitute a majority of, a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization. The outcome of this inquiry will govern whether successorship or accretion principles should next be applied.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees are included in and constitute a majority of a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization, [then] the Authority will apply the remainder of the successorship factors set forth in [<span class="Italic">Naval Facilities Ertg'g Serv. Ctr., Port Hueneme, Cal.,</span> 50 FLRA 363 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Port Hueneme</span>)] to the unit determined to be appropriate. The outcome of the <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme </span>analysis will determine whether the gaining organization is a successor for purposes of collective bargaining with the labor organization that represented the transferred employees at their previous employer.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;If it is determined that the transferred employees are not included in or do not constitute a majority of a separate appropriate unit in the gaining organization, [then the Authority] will apply accretion principles. The outcome of this analysis will determine whether the transferred employees have accreted to a pre-existing unit in the gaining organization.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The first step in the above framework "corresponds to the first factor set forth in <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme,</span> which requires, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the post-transfer unit must be appropriate[.]'" <span class="Italic">FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 959 (quoting <span class="Italic">Port Hueneme,</span> 50 FLRA at 368). As discussed previously, a unit may be deemed to be appropriate under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute only if it will: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency involved; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency involved. <span class="Italic">FISC</span> at 959-62. A proposed unit must meet all three criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">Military Traffic Mgmt. Command,</span> 60 FLRA at 394. Determinations as to each of these criteria are made on a case-by-case basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Authority has set out factors for assessing each criterion, but has not specified the weight of individual factors or a particular number of factors necessary to establish an appropriate unit. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD applied established law.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the first appropriate unit criterion--whether employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest--the Authority examines factors such as geographic proximity, unique conditions of employment, distinct local concerns, degree of interchange between other organizational components, and functional or operational separation. <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 960-961 (citations omitted). In addition, the Authority considers factors such as whether the employees in the proposed unit are a part of the same organizational component of the agency; support the same mission; are subject to the same chain of command; have similar or related duties, job titles, and work assignments; are subject to the same general working conditions; and are governed by the same personnel office. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL argues that the transferred employees share an identifiable community of interest that is separate and distinct from the other NAF employees represented by AFGE.&#x2003;However, considering the relevant factors, the RD found that the transferred employees were administratively and organizationally integrated into the Activity. In this regard, the RD found that the transferred employees do not have an employment relationship or work situation materially different from the NAF employees represented by AFGE. The RD further found that the transferred employees and the employees represented by AFGE are all part of the same organizational component. The RD found that the two groups support the same mission, are subject to the same chain of command, have similar or related duties, job titles, and work assignments, and are subject to the same general working conditions. The RD also found that the two groups are governed by the same personnel and labor relations policies that are centrally established and administered by the same human resources office. The RD concluded that the work situation or employment relationship of the transferred employees and the employees represented by AFGE is essentially the same.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAIL's assertions do not dispute the above findings, and do not demonstrate that the RD inappropriately applied the community of interest criterion. In this regard, NAIL has not established that the transferred employees have duties that are different from the employees represented by AFGE, report to a different chain of command, support a different mission, or are subject to working conditions, organizational components, or job titles that are different from those of the employees represented by AFGE. <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 960-61. Based on the foregoing, NAIL has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law in finding that the transferred employees do not share a clear and identifiable community of interest separate and distinct from other AFGE employees.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;As set forth in <span class="Italic">Military Traffic Mgmt. Command,</span> 60 FLRA at 394, all three criteria under &#x00A7; 7112(a) must be satisfied in order to establish that a unit remains appropriate after a transfer. Here, as the first criterion is not met, it is unnecessary to consider whether the proposed unit would promote effective dealings with the Activity or promote the efficiency of the Activity's operations. For purposes of this decision, however, we nonetheless analyze the other factors, as set forth below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also applied established law when he considered the effective dealings criterion.&#x2003;To apply this criterion, the Authority examines factors such as the past collective bargaining experience of the parties; the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies covering employees in the proposed unit; the limitations, if any, on the negotiation of matters of critical concern to the employees in the proposed unit; and the level at which labor relations is set by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 961.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that NAIL's continued representation of the transferred employees would not promote effective dealings with the Activity because supervisors at Fort Story no longer have the authority to establish policies, procedures, or working conditions or to negotiate over such matters. Rather, all personnel and labor relations matters, including the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, are administered centrally from the Activity's human resources office. The RD found that effective dealings are not promoted by a unit that would require the Activity's human resources office to negotiate and administer a separate collective bargaining agreement for the 31 NAF employees who share a community of interest with the 840 employees in the AFGE bargaining unit. In this regard, we note that NAIL's claim regarding employee benefits under its contract, in contrast to AFGE's contract, has no relevance when determining effective dealings between the Union and the Activity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the RD's findings support his conclusion that allowing NAIL to represent a separate unit of 31 employees would not promote effective dealings with the Activity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the RD applied established law when he considered the efficiency of agency operations criterion. This criterion concerns the benefits to be derived from a unit structure bearing a rational relationship to the operations and organizational structure of the agency. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The record here does not establish that the unit proposed by NAIL would promote the efficiency of the Activity's operations. As found by the RD, the Activity has a centralized operational and organizational structure. Therefore, the establishment of a small unit of 31 employees would result in an artificial, unwarranted fragmentation of the Activity's organizational and operational structure, thereby interfering with the efficiency of the Activity's operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The foregoing demonstrates that the RD correctly applied established law in determining that the transferred employees do not constitute a separate appropriate unit under &#x00A7; 7112 of the Statute. Accordingly, as NAIL has not established that the RD failed to apply established law, we deny NAIL's application for review as to this matter as well.</p>
<p class="noindent">Accretion was approved in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Fleet &#x0026; Industrial Supply Ctr. and AFGE Local 2326,</span> 62 FLRA 497, 499-500, 501-02 (2008), following a reorganization of personnel that involved substantial continuity of job duties, organizational mission and functions:</p>

In this regard, the RD found that all of the employees are a part of the same organizational component of FISCN, support the same mission, and are subject to the same chain of command and general working conditions. The RD also determined that recognitions of separate units of employees would not promote effective dealings and efficiency of Activity operations. As relevant here, the RD found that the locus and scope of authority of the responsible personnel office administering personnel policies that cover employees in those units was within FISCN and not at the respective geographic locations<span class="Italic">.</span> In addition, the RD determined that separating the employees into smaller units that would coexist with a larger unit consisting of many geographical sites would result in unwarranted fragmentation. While acknowledging that "the Statute requires only that a proposed unit be an appropriate unit, not the most, or the only, appropriate unit[,]" the RD concluded that the transferred employees are not included in, and do not constitute, separate appropriate units under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[1]&#x2003;Section 7112(a) provides, in pertinent part, that the Authority "shall determine any unit to be an appropriate unit only if the determination will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit and will promote effective dealings with, and efficiency of the operations of the agency involved."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then<span class="Italic">,</span> the RD applied the accretion principles set forth in <span class="Italic">FISC.</span> In this connection, she determined that the transferred employees share a clear and identifiable community of interest with the employees represented by AFGE, Local 53, and that the transferred employees have been so organizationally and operationally integrated with those employees that they have lost their separate identity. The RD also determined that the AFGE, Local 53 unit is co-extensive with the Agency's organizational structure and exists at the level at which personnel and labor relations policies are established. Accordingly, she found that accreting the numerous units of transferred employees into the AFGE, Local 53 unit would promote effective dealings and enhance the efficiency of the Agency's operations. Consequently, the RD concluded that including the transferred employees in the unit represented by AFGE, Local 53 would result in an appropriate unit under &#x00A7; 7112(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further,<span class="Italic"> </span>the RD found that AFGE, Local 53 represents 620 employees, while all of the other incumbent labor organizations represent 265 employees combined. Applying <span class="Italic">Department of the Army, U.S. Army Aviation Missile Command (AMCOM), Redstone Arsenal, Ala</span>., 56 FLRA 126 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Redstone Arsenal</span>), the RD found that AFGE, Local 53 represents slightly more than 70 percent of the new bargaining unit and, thus, that an election was unnecessary.[2] Accordingly, the RD found that the transferred employees had accreted into the unit represented by AFGE, Local 53.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;In discussing the requirements used to determine whether a gaining entity is a successor employer, such that an election among labor unions that previously represented employees in the new unit is not necessary, the Authority held in<span class="Italic"> Redstone Arsenal</span> that "absent special circumstances...a union that represents more than 70 percent of the employees in a newly combined unit formerly represented by two or more unions is sufficiently predominant to render an election unnecessary because such an election would be a useless exercise." 56 FLRA at 131 (citation omitted). As noted below, we find it unnecessary to address whether the 70 percent "sufficiently predominant" test applies in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE argues that because the RD failed to hold an election, the transferred employees were not given an opportunity to choose an exclusive representative. In this regard, NAGE asserts that, while the petition was pending, the Activity continued to adjust the number of employees already represented by the AFGE, Local 53 bargaining unit so that those employees would constitute 70 percent or more of the combined bargaining unit.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;We note that no party is contesting the RD's decision to apply in this accretion case the 70 percent "sufficiently predominant" rule developed in successorship cases. Accordingly, we find it unnecessary to resolve whether this is the appropriate rule to apply in accretion cases.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE contends that the RD erroneously determined what would be the most appropriate unit, not whether the existing units would continue to be appropriate, citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA 969, 972 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>). In this connection, NAGE challenges the RD determination that separate recognitions of units of employees would not promote effective dealings and efficiency of Activity operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a petitioned-for unit is appropriate, the Authority considers whether the unit would: (1) ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees in the unit; (2) promote effective dealings with the agency; and (3) promote efficiency of the operations of the agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7112(a). <span class="Italic">See FISC,</span> 52 FLRA at 959. A proposed unit must meet all three appropriate unit criteria in order to be found appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 961 n.6. Moreover, the Authority does not specify the weight of individual factors to be considered in making appropriate unit determinations. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, United States Army Reserve Command, Fort McPherson, Ga., </span>57 FLRA 95, 96 (2001); <span class="Italic">Local 2004</span>, 47 FLRA at 972. However, for a petitioned-for separate bargaining unit to be appropriate, the employees at issue must have significant employment concerns or personnel issues that are different or unique from those of other employees. <span class="Italic">See FISC</span>, 52 FLRA at 960; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 55 FLRA 311, 315 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD cited pertinent Authority precedent and determined that the employees who transferred from the various facilities do not constitute separate appropriate units under &#x00A7; 7112(a). First, as set forth above, the RD determined that the employees transferred to FISCN do not enjoy a clear and identifiable community of interest that is distinct from the existing unit represented by AFGE, Local 53. Next, as also set forth above, the RD determined that separate recognitions of units of employees would not promote effective dealings and efficiency of Activity operations. In addition, the RD determined that separating the employees into very small units that would coexist with a larger unit consisting of many geographical sites would result in "unwarranted fragmentation."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consequently, the RD concluded that the employees who transferred from the various Naval facilities are not included in, and do not constitute, separate appropriate units defined by their respective geographic locations or former certifications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NAGE has not provided any evidence to the Authority showing that RD erred in making that determination.&#x2003;In addition, NAGE did not provide any evidence to the RD regarding how the appropriate unit factors applied to employees in the individual bargaining units, and NAGE has not sufficiently explained why it could not have introduced such evidence to the RD.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, contrary to NAGE's claim, the RD did not apply a "most appropriate unit" standard. Thus, NAGE's claim provides no basis for finding that the RD erred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that NAGE has not demonstrated that the RD erred as a matter of law in making her appropriate unit determination.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to issue a policy statement that an election is always required when a group of employees is added to a bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, Inc</span>., 71 FLRA 502 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring).</p>
