<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-186"><span class="space">12.</span> Inspector General Investigation</h4>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1979 (1999), determined that inspectors general operate as components of agencies they serve when they conduct investigations. As a result, employees being interrogated have the same right to union representation that is provided to employees being questioned by supervisors and managers about conduct that may lead to disciplinary action against them. Law developed before <span class="Italic">NASA</span> does not favor negotiability of proposals seeking to influence the process of IG investigations. Other IG inquiries, e.g., program audits that involve employee input, may not require advance notice to the union or the opportunity for union representation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE VA Council 33 and VA</span>, 70 FLRA 697, 697-700 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) (agency was not required to provide advance notice concerning, or allow representation during, employee interviews conducted by IG as part of healthcare survey).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA initially concluded that proposals were outside the duty to bargain to the extent they concerned the manner that inspector general investigations would be conducted. Authority over, and control of, IG operations cannot by law be delegated below the level of the officer next in rank to the agency head. Although ordinarily the agency cannot avoid bargaining obligations by refusing to delegate authority to negotiate when that authority can be negotiated, the Inspector General Act of 1978 precluded the delegation that was required to negotiate the proposals at issue. The union could not require that the agency bargain as to recommendations pertaining to the IG's operations. By law the IG is to function independent of interference from agency program managers. FLRA considered the negotiability of some of the proposals, notwithstanding that it determined them to be inconsistent with the legal authority and the statutory independence of the IG. As to periodic progress reports concerning an investigation of an employee, contacts by the IG with friends and relatives of an employee, limits on the use of a polygraph during investigation (or conditions on its use), preclusion of sworn statements in some circumstances, and notification to parties to an investigation that an employee was exonerated, negotiations were precluded either because the requests interfered with the right of management to determine internal security practices, or because they involved matters not pertaining to working conditions. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1300 and GSA</span>, 18 FLRA 789, 795 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">GSA</span> result was abandoned in <span class="Italic">NTEU and NRC</span>, 47 FLRA 370, 377-79 (1993), permitting negotiation of proposals providing investigatory protections despite IG involvement. <span class="Italic">NRC</span> explained, as FLRA approved the negotiability of Proposals 1-4 (requiring certain disclosures and advice of rights during the course of an investigatory interview):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that all criminal and noncriminal investigations within the Agency are conducted by the OIG.&#x2003;Relying on <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, in which the Authority held that proposals pertaining to IG investigations are nonnegotiable under section 3(a) of the IG Act, the Agency contends that Proposals 1-4 pertain to investigations by the OIG and, therefore, are nonnegotiable. The Union does not dispute the Agency's contention that all criminal and noncriminal investigations within the Agency are conducted by the OIG. However, the Union asserts that the proposals would not affect the actions of IG personnel because the proposals apply to Agency representatives, other than IG personnel, who are present at the interviews.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the absence of any reference to IG personnel in Proposals 1-4 does not change the fact that the proposals concern IG investigations. However, on reconsideration of <span class="Italic">GSA</span> [<span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1300 and GSA</span>, 18 FLRA 789 (1985)] in light of the court's decision in <span class="Italic">DCIS</span> [<span class="Italic">Defense Criminal Investigative Service v. FLRA</span>, 855 F.2d 93 (3d Cir. 1988)] we conclude that we will no longer follow <span class="Italic">GSA</span> to the extent that it holds that an agency is not obligated to bargain on a proposal merely because the proposal concerns the conduct of IG investigations under the IG Act. Rather, proposals that concern the conduct of IG investigations under the IG Act will be found nonnegotiable if they are inconsistent with the IG Act or are nonnegotiable on other grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_754"></span>In <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority concluded that because, under section 3(a) of the IG Act, an IG is subject only to the head of the agency or the officer next in rank below the head of the agency, an agency is not obligated to provide representatives to bargain over the conduct of IG investigations at a local level. In short, the Authority held that the independence of the IG precluded negotiations on any proposals concerning the conduct of IG investigations. In our view, this aspect of <span class="Italic">GSA</span> can no longer be supported in light of our decision to adopt the court's reasoning and findings in <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>, in affirming the underlying decision of the Authority, the court rejected an agency's claim that, under the IG Act, an element of the IG's office was sufficiently independent within the agency that its representatives did not conduct employee interviews as the representatives of the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>, 855 F.2d at 100. The court found that investigators who were part of the IG's office were employees of the agency. The court stated that the "degree of supervision" exercised by management of that agency over the IG's office was "irrelevant." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>, we find that because IG representatives are employees of an agency and, thus, are subject to the agency's obligations under the Statute, an agency cannot declare proposals concerning IG investigations nonnegotiable solely on the ground that, under section 3(a) of the IG Act, all proposals concerning IG investigations are outside the duty to bargain. Consequently, we conclude that, insofar as GSA holds that an agency is not obligated to bargain on a proposal merely because the proposal concerns the conduct of IG investigations, we will no longer follow that decision. Rather, proposals that concern the conduct of IG investigations under the IG Act will be found nonnegotiable if they are inconsistent with the IG Act or are nonnegotiable on other grounds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's sole contention as to the negotiability of Proposals 1-4 under the IG Act is based on the Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">GSA</span>. The Agency has provided no other reasons to support its claim that the "requirements" of the proposals are inconsistent with the IG Act. That is, the Agency has not explained how any of the proposals, by their terms, are inconsistent with any provision of the IG Act and it is not otherwise apparent to us that Proposals 1-4 are inconsistent with the IG Act or are nonnegotiable on other grounds....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we note that the Authority has consistently held that proposals which supplement employees' rights to union representation under section 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute are negotiable, if they are otherwise consistent with law and regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Washington, D.C.</span>, 43 FLRA 1442, 1445 (1992).... The Authority has also held that proposals requiring an agency, in appropriate circumstances, to give <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> and <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> warnings are negotiable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Customs</span>, 9 FLRA at 986.</p>
<p class="noindent">In 1994 the Fourth Circuit returned FLRA to the rule of <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, as the court determined that an IG was to have operational independence--meaning that agencies could not negotiate proposals affecting the means used by IGs to conduct their investigations. <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 25 F.3d 229, 232-36 (4th Cir. 1994). But in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span>, 119 S. Ct. 1979 (1999), the Supreme Court decided that inspectors general act as components of the agencies they serve when they conduct investigations. As a result, employees being interrogated have the same right to union representation that is provided to employees being questioned by supervisors and managers about conduct that may lead to disciplinary action against them.</p>
<p class="noindent">Attempting to balance the views of the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">NRC</span> and the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, in <span class="Italic">NTEU and DHS, C&#x0026;BP</span>, 66 FLRA 892, 894-900 (2012) (recon. den., 66 FLRA 1028 (2012)) (rev'd, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Homeland Security v. FLRA</span>, 751 F.3d 665 (D.C. Cir. 2014), <span class="Italic">post</span>), FLRA determined to be negotiable a proposal that employees interviewed by OIG representatives have certain contract rights. The proposal was "An employee being interviewed by a representative of the Agency (e.g., [DHS] Office of Inspector General) in connection with either a criminal or non-criminal matter has certain entitlements/rights regardless of who is conducting the interview." The operative provisions of the proposal were set out in a contract article relating to agency investigations; among those included were the obligation of notice of investigations to the union, specification of the location of interviews, standards for conduct of interviews, and notice of <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights. FLRA determined that the proposal was negotiable, despite the functional separation of the agency and its OIG:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' arguments in this case present two substantive issues: (1) Has DHS demonstrated that the IG Act bars agreements concerning all IG-investigation procedures, regardless of their nature?; and (2) If not, then has DHS demonstrated that the provision is contrary to any specific terms of the IG Act? We answer these two questions separately below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DHS has not demonstrated that the IG Act bars all agreements concerning all IG-investigation procedures. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, the Authority addressed the negotiability of certain proposals that applied to criminal and noncriminal investigatory interviews--including those conducted by the agency's OIG--and were intended to "codify and supplement" employees' <span class="Italic">Weingarten </span>right. 47 FLRA at 377. The Authority stated that it would not find proposals outside the duty to bargain "merely because the[y]...concern[ ] the conduct of IG investigations under the IG Act." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 378. The Authority found that, instead, proposals concerning IG-investigation procedures "will be found nonnegotiable [only] if they are inconsistent with the IG Act or are nonnegotiable on other grounds." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>. The court assessed the provisions of the IG Act and found that "[t]he bulk of [those] provisions are...devoted to establishing the independence of the [IGs] from the agencies that they oversee." <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 233. According to the court, proposals concerning IG-investigation procedures "are not appropriately the subject of bargaining," because to allow such bargaining "would impinge on the statutory independence of the IG." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 234. Specifically, the court stated that "if we were to interpret the [Statute] to require the [agency] to bargain over rights and procedures for investigatory interviews conducted by the [IG], we would indirectly be authorizing the parties to collective bargaining to compromise, limit, and interfere with the independent status of the [IG] under the [IG Act]." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 235. Thus, the court found that parties may not negotiate over proposals concerning IG-investigation procedures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 236.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has not previously expressly addressed whether it would adopt the reasoning of <span class="Italic">NRC</span>. The issue of whether the Authority should do so is squarely presented here. For the following reasons, to the extent that <span class="Italic">NRC</span> holds that parties may not bargain over <span class="Italic">any</span> IG-investigation procedures, regardless of their particular terms, we respectfully disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, in <span class="Italic">Headquarters NASA Washington, D.C.</span>, 50 FLRA 601 (1995) (<span class="Italic">NASA HQ</span>), the Authority held that an OIG investigator is a "representative of the agency" for purposes of investigatory interviews under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. 50 FLRA at 602. While acknowledging that the IG Act gives OIGs "a degree of independence" from their own parent agencies, the Authority found that "the text of the IG Act establishes that the IG plays an integral role in assisting the agency and its subcomponent offices in meeting the agency's objectives." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 617. In this regard, the Authority stated that the IG's activities "support, rather than threaten, broader agency interests and make the IG a participant, with other agency components, in meeting various statutory obligations, including the agency's labor relations obligations under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Quoting a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the Authority stated that it was "unwilling...'to find a partial, implied repeal of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) based solely on Congress' decision in 1978 to authorize the creation of [IG] offices in a number of federal agencies.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 619 (quoting <span class="Italic">Def. Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS), Dep't of Def. (DOD) v. FLRA, </span>855 F.2d 93, 100 (3d Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">DCIS</span>)). The Authority concluded that the IG Act had "no inconsistency with the Statute in general, or &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) in particular." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 617.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit upheld the Authority's decision.<span class="Italic"> See FLRA v. NASA</span>, 120 F.3d 1208 (11th Cir. 1997). The court acknowledged that "Congress believed it necessary to grant OIGs a significant degree of independence from the agencies they were charged with investigating." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1214. Specifically, the court stated that Congress believed "such independence was necessary to prevent agency managers from covering up wrongdoing within their agencies," and that, "[i]n light of the potentially conflicting agendas of agency management and [IGs], Congress created the safeguards necessary to ensure that [IGs] could conduct their investigations without interference from agency management personnel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Despite this significant degree of independence, the court found "nothing in the text or legislative history of the IG Act...to justify exempting OIG investigators from compliance with the federal <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> provision." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In this regard, the court stated that "[n]o provision of the IG Act suggests that Congress intended to excuse OIG investigators from honoring otherwise applicable federal statutes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the court "refuse[d] to read the IG Act to have impliedly repealed" &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1215. In addition, the court stated that "[i]n conducting investigations within the agency, [the OIG] serves the interest of [the agency] by soliciting information of possible misconduct committed by...employees," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1216, and that "the Authority's order directing [the agency] to order [the OIG] to comply with" &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) "d[id] not intrude on the independence of" the OIG, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1217. According to the court, "the OIG need only have enough independence from agency management so that it can effectively discover and cure abuses and inefficiency within the agency," and "[r]equiring agency management to order the OIG to comply with a congressional directive does not...intrude on the statutory independence of the OIG." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1217.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Supreme Court affirmed.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. 229. Like the Authority and the Eleventh Circuit, the Court acknowledged that Congress intended OIGs to "enjoy a great deal of autonomy," including the authority under &#x00A7; 3(a) of the IG Act to "initiate and conduct investigations and audits without interference from the agency head." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 230. But the Court also found that "management-prompted investigations are not rare." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 241. In this regard, the Court stated <span id="page_755"></span>that "not all OIG examinations subject to &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) will implicate an actual or apparent conflict of interest with the rest of the agency; and in many cases we can expect honest cooperation between an OIG and management-level agency personnel." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 242. The Court further stated that the need for cooperation between OIGs and management "becomes more obvious when the practical operation of OIG interviews and &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) rights are considered." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In particular, the Court found that the IG Act limits IGs' authority in some ways--such as not giving them the authority to subpoena witnesses or to discipline employees--and determined that "[s]uch limitations...enhance the likelihood and importance of cooperation between the agency and its OIG." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Further, the Court stated that despite OIGs' authority to initiate investigations and audits without interference from the agency head, "those characteristics do not make [the agency's] OIG any less a representative of [the agency] when it investigates a[n] [agency] employee." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 241. In this connection, the Court stated that, "unlike the jurisdiction of many law enforcement agencies, an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by the [IG Act], is performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 240. Consequently, the Court found that "[a]s far as the [IG Act] is concerned, [the agency's OIG] investigators [were] employed by, act[ed] on behalf of, and operate[d] for the benefit of [the agency]," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 241, and that the agency's IG investigators were "unquestionably 'representatives' of [the agency] when acting within the scope of their employment," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 240. Finally, the Court noted that "representation is not the equivalent of obstruction," and that "[i]n many cases the participation of a union representative will facilitate the factfinding process and a fair resolution of an agency investigation--or at least Congress must have thought so." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 245.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, the Court found that the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right set forth in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute does not conflict with the IG Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 242-43. In other words, the Supreme Court held that, regardless of IGs' statutory authority to conduct independent investigations, that independence is not unfettered and may be limited by rights set forth in other laws. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that the statutory provision involved in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> was &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, which is not at issue here. We also acknowledge that the Supreme Court did not resolve whether it would conflict with the IG Act to require bargaining over IG-investigation procedures. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 244 n.8. However, for the following reasons, we find no basis in the Statute or the IG Act for reaching the broad conclusion urged by DHS here: that <span class="Italic">all</span> such procedures, regardless of their particular terms, <span class="Italic">necessarily</span> conflict with the IG Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We begin with the plain wording of the Statute.&#x2003;Section 7102(2) expressly provides employees with the right "to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under" the Statute. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102(2). Section 7114(a)(1) expressly provides, in pertinent part, that exclusive representatives are "entitled to...negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering[ ] all employees" in the bargaining unit that they represent. And, in turn, &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4) expressly obligates agencies and exclusive representatives to "negotiate in good faith for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no indication in the Statute that the bargaining rights and obligations set forth in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) and (4) are less significant, or should be accorded any less weight, than the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right set forth in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)--which is part of the very same section of the Statute. In fact, in setting out the congressional findings underlying the Statute, &#x00A7; 7101(a) states, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The Congress finds that...experience in both private and public employment indicates that the statutory protection of the right of employees to...bargain collectively...safeguards the public interest,...contributes to the effective conduct of public business, and...facilitates and encourages the amicable settlement of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment[.]...Therefore,...collective bargaining in the civil service [is] in the public interest.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a). Put simply, one of the primary purposes that Congress had in enacting the Statute was to protect the right to bargain collectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This right is not unlimited.&#x2003;For example, agencies are obligated to bargain over a matter only if it is a "condition[ ] of employment," as defined in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(14), and only to the extent that the matter is consistent with "Federal law[,]...Government-wide rule or regulation," and agency-wide rules or regulations for which there is a "compelling need," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(2); <span class="Italic">see also Library of Cong. v. FLRA</span>, 699 F.2d 1280, 1284 &#x0026; n.16 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (summarizing the exceptions to the duty to bargain) (<span class="Italic">Library</span>). If parties bargain and reach an agreement that is contrary to the Statute or "any other applicable law, rule, or regulation," then the head of the agency may disapprove it within thirty days from the date on which the agreement is executed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(c)(2). And if the agency head does not timely disapprove the agreement, then the agreement takes effect "subject to the provisions [of the Statute] and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7114(c)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But "Congress manifestly established a generalized obligation on an agency to bargain with the exclusive representative of the agency's employees," and "[t]he statutory framework...may be envisioned as imposing a broadly defined duty to bargain over conditions of employment that is subject only to the express statutory exceptions." <span class="Italic">Library</span>, 699 F.2d at 1285. That Congress listed specific exclusions from the duty to bargain indicates that we should be cautious not to infer additional ones. <span class="Italic">See Horner v. Andrzjewski</span>, 811 F.2d 571, 575 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[A]s a general rule of statutory construction, the expression of one exception indicates that no other exceptions apply."); 2A Norman J. Singer &#x0026; J.D. Shambie Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47.23, at 418 (7th ed. 2007) ("The enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically included."); <span class="Italic">see also Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co.</span>, 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980) ("Where Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Nothing in the plain wording of the Statute indicates that IG-investigation procedures are always exempted from the statutory duty to bargain or, if agreed upon, are always unlawful. In fact, the Statute does not mention IG investigations at all. Further, Congress enacted the Statute only one day after it enacted the IG Act. <span class="Italic">See NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 229. Presumably, it was aware that the Act did not expressly preclude bargaining over IG-investigation procedures. <span class="Italic">Cf. Cannon v. Univ. of Chi.</span>,441 U.S. 677, 696-99 (1979) (presuming Congress was aware of interpretations of statute after which new statute was modeled). Yet Congress did not give any indication in the Statute that IG-investigation procedures should receive special treatment and be excluded from the scope of bargaining. That fact is significant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the terms of the IG Act, when Congress has intended laws outside the Statute to completely preclude bargaining over subject matters, it has made that intent clear, either through statutory text or legislative history. <span class="Italic">See Int'l Ass'n of Machinists &#x0026; Aerospace Workers, Franklin Lodge No. 2135 &#x0026; Int'l Plate Printers, Die Stampers &#x0026; Engravers Union of N. Am. Local Nos. 2, 24, &#x0026; 32, &#x0026; Graphic Commc'ns Int'l Union Local No. 285, &#x0026; Int'l Ass'n of Siderographers Wash. Ass'n</span>,50 FLRA 677, 691-92 (1995);<span class="Italic"> NFFE, Council of VA Locals</span>, 49 FLRA 923, 933 (1994) (in determining whether matter is outside the duty to bargain, Authority looks to whether statute or regulation gives agency sole and exclusive discretion "without regard to other laws" (citing <span class="Italic">Ill. NG v. FLRA</span>, 854 F.2d 1396, 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (statute providing agency with discretion "notwithstanding any other provision of law" precluded bargaining)). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3295 v. FLRA</span>,46 F.3d 73, 74 (D.C. Cir. 1995) ("The presumption that an agency is obliged to negotiate most subjects of concern to employees can be overcome by indications that Congress intended the agency in question to enjoy complete discretion over the particular matter at issue."). DHS does not cite any provision of the IG Act or its legislative history that indicates that IG-investigation procedures are entirely nonnegotiable, regardless of their particular terms. Although DHS relies on the fact that the IG Act gives IGs the authority to conduct "independent investigations," that authority is not unlimited. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 1071, at 28 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in </span>1978 USSCAN 2676, 2703 ("Broad as it is, the [IG's] mandate is not unlimited.") <span class="Italic">See also NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 242 (investigative independence limited); <span class="Italic">Burlington N. R.R. Co. v. OIG, R.R. Retirement Bd.</span>,983 F.2d 631, 641-42 (5th Cir. 1993) (same); <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>,855 F.2d at 100 (same). In fact, the IG Act (as amended) expressly allows the Secretary of DHS to prohibit DHS-OIG from conducting certain audits and investigations. <span class="Italic">See</span> IG Act, 5 U.S.C. App. 3 &#x00A7; 8I(a)(2). DHS' position encompasses the proposition that DHS may not negotiate over OIG investigations that it may entirely prohibit. Neither law nor logic supports such a proposition.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, courts have held that, in some circumstances, authority is limited even where statutes contain wording that provides that authority may be exercised without regard to other laws. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Or. Natural Res. Council v. Thomas</span>, 92 F.3d 792, 795, 797 (9th Cir. 1996) (authority limited despite wording saying "[n]otwithstanding any other law...the Secretary concerned shall" perform certain acts); <span class="Italic">D.C. Fed'n of Civic Assoc., Inc. v. Volpe</span>, 434 F.2d 436, 437, 447 (D.C. Cir. 1970) (authority limited despite wording saying that "[n]otwithstanding any other provision or law, or any court decision or administrative action to the contrary, the Secretary of Transportation and the government of the District of Columbia shall" take certain actions). If a statute that <span class="Italic">does</span> contain such wording is compatible with limited authority, then the IG Act--which DHS has not alleged contains such wording--is certainly compatible with limited authority. For these reasons, we find that DHS has not demonstrated that there is any basis in the IG Act--including its provision for independent investigations--that supports the sweeping conclusion that bargaining over all IG-investigation procedures is unlawful.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the DHS-OIG's investigators are representatives of DHS, and "[a]s far as the [IG Act] is concerned, [DHS]-OIG's investigators are employed <span id="page_756"></span>by, act on behalf of, and operate for the benefit of [DHS]." <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 527 U.S. at 241. The Authority repeatedly has held that "'a component of an agency is obligated to bargain with the exclusive representative of its employees over conditions of employment even though control over a particular condition of employment resides in another component of the same agency[,]' unless the discretion is limited by law, government-wide rule or regulation, or agency regulations supported by a compelling need." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Def. Dependents Schools, Alexandria, Va.</span>, 41 FLRA 982, 1000 (1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n</span>,29 FLRA 485, 492 (1987)). <span class="Italic">See also NFFE, Local 2050</span>,36 FLRA 618, 622 (1990); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Guard Bureau &#x0026; Adjutant Gen. State of Pa.</span>,35 FLRA 48, 53 (1990); <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n Inc.,</span>29 FLRA 734, 772 (1987); <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n, Inc., </span>22 FLRA 351, 361 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Overseas Educ. Ass'n, Inc. v. FLRA</span>,827 F.2d 814 (D.C. Cir. 1987). As applied here, that means that CBP (which, like DHS-OIG, is a component of DHS) was obligated to bargain over conditions of employment affecting unit employees, even if DHS-OIG had control over those conditions of employment. And there is no basis for finding that the result of such bargaining is unenforceable merely because DHS-OIG allegedly controls the conditions of employment that were the subject of that bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">By arguing that we should find that the IG Act precludes bargaining over any and all IG-investigation procedures, "in effect, [DHS] asks [the Authority] to find a partial, implied repeal of [the bargaining rights and obligations set forth in the Statute] based solely on Congress' decision...to authorize the creation of [an] IG office[ ] in [DHS]. This we decline to do." <span class="Italic">DCIS</span>, 855 F.2d at 100. <span class="Italic">See also NASA HQ</span>, 50 FLRA at 619. DHS's employees "are, after all, federal employees to whom Congress has given important bargaining rights--rights that should not be blithely ignored absent some explicit or compelling reason of governmental prerogative." <span class="Italic">Library</span>, 699 F.2d at 1289. Based on the foregoing, we find that DHS has not demonstrated that the IG Act completely forecloses bargaining over IG-investigation procedures, regardless of the nature of the particular procedures at issue. Accordingly, we address whether DHS has demonstrated that the provision is contrary to any specific terms of the IG Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DHS has not demonstrated that the provision is contrary to any specific terms of the IG Act. </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons stated below, we conclude that DHS has not met its regulatory burden to demonstrate that the provision is contrary to any specific terms of the IG Act. In this regard, we find that, as discussed further below, despite being on notice that it must "supply all arguments and authorities in support of its position" in its SOP, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2424.24(a), DHS: (1) in its SOP, has not met its burden of proving that the provision is contrary to the IG Act, and (2) is precluded from making certain arguments for the first time in its reply. In order to explain these findings, it is necessary to discuss the relevant provisions of the Statute and the Authority's regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in addition to its argument that we should rely on <span class="Italic">NRC</span> to find the provision contrary to law (which we have rejected above), DHS provides only general arguments regarding the provision, the IG Act, and DHS-OIG's rights to conduct independent investigations. <span class="Italic">See</span> SOP at 3 ("the procedures to be followed by the OIG in conducting its investigations are nonnegotiable"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> (the provision "impermissibly interferes with the independent status of the OIG as set forth in the [IG Act]" because "the procedures set forth in Article 22 extend far beyond the 'Weingarten' right"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 4 (the "effect of [the provision] is...to compromise, limit, and interfere with the independent status of the [IG], which is clearly inconsistent with the IG Act"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 5 ("the [IG] in each agency is entrusted with the responsibility of auditing and investigating the agency, a function which may be exercised in the judgment of the [IG] as each deems it necessary or desirable'"); <span class="Italic">id.</span> (the DHS-OIG is "'shielded with independence from agency interference' and collective bargaining affecting the [DHS-]OIG directly interferes with the statutory independence granted to" IGs under the IG Act (quoting <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 234)); <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 4 (the IG Act "carefully defines and preserves the independence of [IGs], both in organization and function," and "[b]argaining over the auditing and investigating functions of the [IGs] allows parties to collective bargaining to compromise, limit, and interfere with the independent status of [DHS-OIG], which is clearly inconsistent with the IG Act.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DHS cites only one section of the--quite lengthy--IG Act, and does so only indirectly. Specifically, DHS quotes a passage from <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, and, in its citation to that decision, notes the court's citation to &#x00A7; 6(a)(2) of the IG Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 5. Even assuming that this is sufficient to raise a claim that the provision is contrary to &#x00A7; 6(a)(2)--which provides that the IGs are authorized "to make such investigations and reports relating to the administration of the programs and operations of the applicable establishment as are, in the judgment of the [IG], necessary or desirable," 5 U.S.C. App. 3 &#x00A7; 6(a)(2)--DHS does not provide any arguments regarding how any of the fifteen sections, or any of the appendices, of Article 22 are contrary to that wording. In this regard, DHS quotes two sections of Article 22 (Sections 3 and 5)--which concern certain aspects of advance notice to the Union, the location of investigatory interviews, giving employees certain general information, and giving employees forms to sign and date--and asserts that "[t]hese procedures, and the others which follow, extend far beyond the statutory right of representation established by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, and amount to interference with the OIG's statutory right to conduct independent investigations." This blanket assertion is insufficient to meet DHS's regulatory burden to demonstrate how particular sections of the provision are contrary to specific terms of the IG Act. Accordingly, we find that DHS's arguments are insufficient to demonstrate that the provision is contrary to the IG Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DHS also contends, for the first time in its reply, that the OIG cannot be bound to a contract to which it is not a party. For support, DHS cites <span class="Italic">Motorsport</span>,316 F.3d at 29; <span class="Italic">Rockney</span>,877 F.2d at 644; and <span class="Italic">Greyhound</span>,595 F. Supp. at 1226. DHS could, and should, have made this contention and cited these decisions in its SOP. In this regard, DHS relies on this contention and the cited decisions to support its claim that the provision is nonnegotiable--not to respond to an issue raised for the first time in the Union's response. As such, &#x00A7; 2424.26(c) of the Authority's regulations precludes DHS from raising this argument and citing these decisions, and we do not consider them.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that DHS has not met its burden of demonstrating that the provision is contrary to law, rule, or regulation, and we direct DHS to rescind its disapproval of the provision. And, as the provision as a whole has not been shown to be contrary to law, rule, or regulation, we find it unnecessary to resolve the Union's request to sever the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit reversed FLRA as to the negotiability of protections during IG investigations, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Homeland Security v. FLRA</span>, 751 F.3d 665, 666-73 (D.C. Cir. 2014):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents a petition for review filed by the United States Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") challenging a decision by the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA" or "Authority"). The dispute arose with the FLRA on a negotiability appeal filed by the National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU" or "Union") under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute ("FSLMRS").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU and Customs and Border Protection ("CBP")--an agency within DHS--had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement that included the following provision:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">An employee [in CBP] being interviewed by a representative of the Agency (e.g., Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General) in connection with either a criminal or non-criminal matter has certain entitlements/rights regardless of who is conducting the interview.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 22, Section 2 ("Section 2"). NTEU explained that the proposed Section 2 was intended to have the following effects:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The impact of the proposal is to obligate all employer representatives to abide by Article 22. Among other things, Article 22 requires that union officials receive advance notice of employee interviews; that interviews be conducted at the worksite; that employer representatives act professionally; that the employer representatives provide employees with specific negotiated forms with their rights outlined prior to conducting the interview; and that employer representatives advise employees of their right to union representation if the employee may be subject to discipline or adverse action before the interview is conducted. The impact, therefore, of the provision at issue is to obligate all employer representatives to adhere to these negotiated provisions when conducting investigatory interviews (criminal and noncriminal) of CBP bargaining unit employees. It specifically identifies employees from DHS's OIG as employer representatives when they conduct these investigations of CBP employees, but the provision would apply to any other individuals acting in that capacity, for that purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DHS objected to the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to &#x00A7; 7114(c) of the FSLMRS on the ground that procedures followed by DHS's Office of Inspector General ("OIG") in conducting its investigations are nonnegotiable. After the Union and CBP severed Section 2 from their collective bargaining agreement, DHS approved the agreement without the provision, and the Union then filed a negotiability appeal with the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Before the FLRA, DHS pointed out that the OIG is an independent entity located within the agency but excluded from collective bargaining. DHS also pointed out that the OIG did not participate in the negotiations that culminated in the adoption of the disputed contract provision. DHS's principal argument, however, both before the Authority and in this court, rests on the Inspector General Act of 1978 ("IG Act"), 5 U.S.C. App. 3 &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1-13:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="page_757"></span>An agency's duty to bargain in good faith under the FSLMRS applies only "to the extent" that duty is "not inconsistent with any Federal law." 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(1). Collective bargaining for restrictions on the techniques and procedures employed by an OIG in conducting its investigations is inconsistent with federal law, namely, the Inspector General Act. The latter describes the OIG as an independent entity free from agency interference--including restrictions arrived at through collective bargaining--in the investigation of agency activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In advancing this position, DHS relied heavily on the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n v. FLRA</span> ("<span class="Italic">NRC</span>"), 25 F.3d 229, 235-36 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that the OIG is not subject to collective bargaining under the FSLMRS, and it may not be bound by the terms of an agreement negotiated by a union on behalf of other employees in an agency).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority rejected DHS's position and ruled that the disputed contract provision was negotiable. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 892, 892 (2012) ("<span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>"). The FLRA held that the terms of Section 2 are not contrary to law, and therefore ordered DHS to rescind its disapproval of the provision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 900. The Authority declined to follow the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NRC</span>. <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 894. Instead, the Authority's decision rested principally on its interpretation of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">NASA v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NASA</span>), 527 U.S. 229 (1999). <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 895-96.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NASA</span> holds that, because an OIG investigator is a "representative of the agency" in certain circumstances, an employee may seek union representation during an OIG-conducted interview pursuant to the so-called "<span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights" embodied in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). 527 U.S. at 246. This section of the FSLMRS was patterned after the decision in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc</span>., 420 U.S. 251 (1975) (upholding a National Labor Relations Board decision that an employer's denial of an employee's request to have a union representative present at an investigatory interview, which the employee reasonably believed might result in disciplinary action, was an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statutory <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights provide:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;An exclusive representative of an appropriate unit in an agency shall be given the opportunity to be represented at--...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;any examination of an employee in the unit by a representative of the agency in connection with an investigation i--(i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee requests representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). The Authority acknowledged "that the statutory provision involved in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> was &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) of the Statute, which is not at issue here." <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 895. The Authority "also acknowledge[d] that the Supreme Court did not resolve whether it would conflict with the IG Act to require bargaining over IG-investigation procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Nonetheless, it held that "one of the primary purposes that Congress had in enacting the [FSLMRS] was to protect the right to bargain collectively," and this includes the right to bargain over the implementation of <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 896. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OIG is an independent entity.&#x2003;Although it is situated within an agency, it is excluded from the collective bargaining requirements of the FSLMRS. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 39 F.3d 361, 365 &#x0026; n.5 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that section 7112(b)(7) "forbids the formation of bargaining units containing employees primarily engaged in investigating other agency employees to ensure they are acting honestly--an apt description of investigators working for the Inspector General"). Furthermore, proposals concerning Inspector General-investigation procedures are not "appropriately the subject of bargaining," because to allow such bargaining "would impinge on the statutory independence of the IG." <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 234. "[I]f we were to interpret the FSLMRS to require [an agency] to bargain over rights and procedures for investigatory interviews conducted by the Inspector General, we would indirectly be authorizing the parties to collective bargaining to compromise, limit, and interfere with the independent status of the Inspector General under the [IG Act]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 235.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because we conclude that the proposal in Section 2 advanced by NTEU here would compromise the independence of the OIG and would be "inconsistent" with the IG Act within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), we grant DHS's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Normally, "the court's role in reviewing the FLRA's negotiability determinations is narrow." <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Emps. v. FLRA</span>, 866 F.2d 1443, 1446 (D.C. Cir. 1989). Thus, in a typical case of this sort, we "will only reverse a negotiability finding of the Authority when the finding is not supported by substantial evidence, is inconsistent with the governing statute, represents an unexplained departure from prior agency determinations, or is otherwise arbitrary or capricious or not in accordance with the law." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, however, the FLRA's order was based on its conclusion that NTEU's bargaining proposal was not inconsistent with other federal law. In particular, the Authority determined that NTEU's proposed Section 2 was not inconsistent with the IG Act as it interpreted that Act. The FLRA, however, has no special competence in the interpretation of the IG Act, so we accord no deference to its interpretation of that statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., IRS v. FLRA</span>, 902 F.2d 998, 1000 (D.C. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. FLRA</span>, 864 F.2d 165, 171 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Therefore, we review <span class="Italic">de novo</span> the Authority's decision insofar as it purports to construe the requirements of the IG Act. <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 232-33.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's decision in this case rests on two critical contentions: First, the Authority argues that it "properly concluded that [DHS's] claim was negated by the Supreme Court's (post-<span class="Italic">NRC</span>) holding in <span class="Italic">NASA</span>...that IG independence already is constrained by employees' <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right under the Statute." Second, the Authority argues that NTEU's proposed Section 2 is not inconsistent with the IG Act in purporting to regulate OIG investigation procedures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 10-11. We disagree with both points for the reasons explained below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Supreme Court's Decision in</span> NASA v. FLRA</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NASA</span>, the Supreme Court held that "&#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is not limited to agency investigators representing an 'entity' that collectively bargains with the employee's union." 527 U.S. at 237. In other words, the Court made it clear that even though the OIG does not engage in collective bargaining under the FSLMRS, OIG investigators who work for an agency such as DHS can be "representatives of the agency" <span class="Italic">under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B).</span> Because "an OIG's investigative office, as contemplated by the [IG Act], is performed with regard to, and on behalf of, the particular agency in which it is stationed...the investigators employed in [the agency's] OIG are unquestionably 'representatives' of [the agency] when acting within the scope of their employment." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 240.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> further explained that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he right Congress created in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) vindicates obvious countervailing federal policies. It provides a procedural safeguard for employees who are under investigation by their agency, and the mere existence of the right can only strengthen the morale of the federal workforce. The interest in fair treatment for employees under investigation is equally strong whether they are being questioned by employees in [the agency's] OIG or by other representatives of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 244-45. The Court's holding is no more surprising than would be a decision that OIG investigators are subject to proscriptions against employment discrimination based on race or sex. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 240 n.4. The <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right embodied in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) is an overriding federal protection that takes precedence over the right to engage in collective bargaining under the FSLMRS and the OIG's authority to pursue investigations under the IG Act. Unions and federal employers cannot negotiate a collective bargaining agreement that diminishes the rights afforded by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), and OIG investigators cannot deny federal employees their <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights during the course of OIG investigations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the Supreme Court's decision in NASA does not justify the Authority's position in this case. The Authority has essentially conceded this. <span class="Italic">FLRA Decision</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. at 895. Indeed, the Authority has acknowledged "that the Supreme Court did not resolve whether it would conflict with the IG Act to require bargaining over IG-investigation procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Court in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> found it unnecessary to "consider whether the outer limits of the Authority's interpretation [of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B)] so obstruct the performance of an OIG's statutory responsibilities that the right must be more confined." 527 U.S. at 244. It is noteworthy, however, that the Court cited the Fourth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NRC</span> to highlight the "OIG's concerns that the reach of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B) will become the subject of collective bargaining between agencies and unions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 244 n.8. If the FLRA's decision in this case were upheld, the concerns noted in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> would be realized.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">DHS makes the telling point that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> does not in any way suggest that the OIG is the representative of an agency for collective bargaining purposes under the FSLMRS:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">NASA</span> did not hold that the OIG is a "representative of the agency" <span class="Italic">for all purposes</span> and, indeed, specifically said its decision was limited to the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> right itself and no more. <span class="Italic">NASA</span> found a specific textual basis for holding that an OIG is "a representative of the agency" for purposes of Section 7114(a)(2)(B), but no textual source exists for extending representative status to collective bargaining or the results of such bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The holding in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> is limited to the right of a union representative to attend an employee examination as specified in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B), which is only if "(i) the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee; and (ii) the employee <span id="page_758"></span>requests representation." Section 7114(a)(2)(B) says nothing about the matters covered by the NTEU's proposal in Section 2, such as "the extent to which a union representative may participate in the examination (by raising objections or asking for breaks in the examination to discuss questions with the employee), whether the union or the employee is entitled to notice of the examination, what type of notice is required, whether the employee is entitled to warnings, or what such warnings might say." And the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">NASA</span> certainly does not suggest that OIG investigations can be regulated in any of these ways pursuant to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we reject the Authority's interpretation of the <span class="Italic">NASA</span> decision. The Court's decision in that case simply cannot be stretched to support the Authority's decision here.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Proposals to Regulate OIG Investigations Authorized by the IG Act Are Not Proper Subjects of Collective Bargaining Under the FSLMRS</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The OIG is not subject to collective bargaining under the FSLMRS.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 235; <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Justice v. FLRA</span>, 39 F.3d at 365 &#x0026; n.5. The Authority does not dispute this. Therefore, "[h]aving excluded employees of the Office of Inspector General from any collective bargaining, Congress surely could not have intended that other employees in an agency be given the right to negotiate the conditions of work for Inspector General employees." <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 235. OIG inspectors are obliged to respect an employee's <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights as required by &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). But public sector unions and agencies can neither add to nor subtract from the OIG's investigatory authority through collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, the FSLMRS exempts from its negotiation requirements any provisions that are "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1). It cannot be disputed that the intended reach of NTEU's proposed Section 2 is much broader than the <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> rights embodied in &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(B). Therefore, Section 2 impermissibly interferes with the OIG in two ways: first, it requires more of OIG inspectors than <span class="Italic">Weingarten</span> itself requires; second, it purports to impose contractual obligations on the OIG even though the OIG is not a party to the collective bargaining agreement and is not subject to the bargaining requirements of the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2 would require employee investigations to be conducted as the Union would prefer, not as an OIG investigator might think best depending upon the circumstances of the case. This is inconsistent with the OIG's authority under the IG Act to serve as an "independent and objective" unit, "to conduct and supervise audits and investigations relating to [certain] programs and operations...[and] provide leadership and coordination and recommend policies for activities designed (A) to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of, and (B) to prevent and detect fraud and abuse in, such programs and operations." 5 U.S.C. app. 3 &#x00A7; 2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The important point, however, "is not that particular negotiated procedures interfere with specific aspects of OIG authority under the Inspector General Act but, rather, that negotiation in and of itself is antithetical to OIG independence established by the Inspector General Act." Under the IG Act, Inspectors General are "appointed by the President" with "the advice and consent of the Senate, without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations." 5 U.S.C. app. 3 &#x00A7; 3(a). The IG Act also forbids the OIG from having any "program operating responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 9(a). The OIG has power to select and employ whatever personnel are necessary to conduct its business, to employ experts and consultants, and to enter into contracts for audits, studies, and other necessary services. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3(d), 6(a). And other than the "general supervision" of the agency head and one deputy, an OIG "shall not report to, or be subject to supervision by, any other officer of such [agency]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">NRC</span>, the Fourth Circuit further explained the OIG's investigatory authority under the IG Act:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[S]hielded with independence from agency interference, the Inspector General in each agency is entrusted with the responsibility of auditing and investigating the agency, a function which may be exercised in the judgment of the Inspector General as each deems it "necessary or desirable." 5 U.S.C. App. 3 &#x00A7; 6(a)(2). To facilitate that function, the Act gives to each Inspector General access to the agency's documents and agency personnel. The Inspector General may issue subpoenas, administer oaths, and investigate complaints and information from any employee of the agency "concerning the possible existence of an activity constituting a violation of law, rules, or regulations, or mismanagement, gross waste of funds, abuse of authority or a substantial and specific danger to the public health and safety." 5 U.S.C. App. 3 &#x00A7; 7(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 234.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In light of the foregoing, we agree with the judgment of the Fourth Circuit in <span class="Italic">NRC</span>. Because we cannot say it better, we adopt the reasoning of our sister circuit:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[P]roposals which concern investigations conducted by the Inspector General, such as those at issue here, are not appropriately the subject of bargaining between an agency and a union. Such proposals run afoul of the Inspector General Act's mandate that it is the Inspector General who has the authority to "conduct, supervise, and coordinate audits and investigations" relating to the [agency]. Congress intended that the Inspector General's investigatory authority include the power to determine when and how to investigate. To allow the [agency] and the Union, which represents the [agency's] employees, to bargain over restrictions that would apply in the course of the Inspector General's investigatory interviews in the agency would impinge on the statutory independence of the Inspector General.... [Proposals] establishing employee rights and procedures for conducting investigatory interviews are therefore inconsistent with the Inspector General's independence and the Inspector General Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 234. We also agree with the Fourth Circuit that, in reaching this conclusion, "we do not limit the right of the [agency] and the Union to negotiate employee rights and procedures for any investigations that may be conducted by other employees of the [agency], who are not from the Office of the Inspector General." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons discussed above, we hereby reverse the decision of the Authority and grant DHS's petition for review.</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing an arbitrator's award, FLRA discerned no error in enforcement through arbitration of provisions of a negotiated agreement designed to protect employees during IG inquiries, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 904, 908 (2012) (recon. den., 66 FLRA 1042 (2012)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">CBP argues that the award is contrary to law because the Arbitrator should have applied the holding in <span class="Italic">NRC</span> and concluded that Article 41 is contrary to the IG Act, and that he erred by relying on <span class="Italic">NASA </span>to reach a contrary conclusion. In <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 66 FLRA 892 (2012) (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>), the Authority declined to follow <span class="Italic">NRC</span> "to the extent that <span class="Italic">NRC</span> held that parties may not bargain over <span class="Italic">any</span> IG-investigation procedures, regardless of their particular terms." 66 FLRA at 894. Instead, the Authority stated that it will assess whether particular provisions of such agreements are contrary to specific terms of the IG Act. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 897. And agreements that are not contrary to law, rule, or regulation are enforceable in arbitration. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 65 FLRA 509, 513 (2011) (Member Beck dissenting in part), <span class="Italic">pet. for review denied sub nom.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, CBP does not explain how any of the particular terms of Article 41 are inconsistent with any specific provisions of the IG Act, or any other law, rule, or regulation. In fact, the "Law and Arguments" section of CBP's exceptions does not include a single citation to the wording of Article 41. Rather, CBP makes a "mere citation" to the IG Act as a whole, without the supporting "explanation or analysis" that is required to demonstrate that the award is contrary to any specific provisions of that Act. <span class="Italic">Local 3354</span>, 64 FLRA at 334. Thus, CBP's argument regarding the IG Act does not satisfy CBP's "burden of ensuring that the record contains sufficient information for the Authority to render a decision on" whether the Arbitrator's enforcement of Article 41 is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">Fort Campbell</span>, 37 FLRA at 195 n.2.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, CBP argues that the award is contrary to law because DHS-OIG is not a party to the agreement, and that the Arbitrator erred by "fashioning a remedy which improperly imposed contractual obligations on" DHS-OIG. <span class="Italic">See also id.</span> at 14 (citing <span class="Italic">Ortiz</span>, 527 U.S. at 846; <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 490 U.S. at 768). As an initial matter, the Arbitrator found that <span class="Italic">CBP</span> violated Article 41, and directed CBP to take certain actions; he did not find that DHS-OIG violated the agreement or direct DHS-OIG to take any actions. Additionally, the Authority has held that DHS-OIG investigators are representatives of CBP. <span class="Italic">See NTEU II</span>, 66 FLRA at 897. In this regard, as DHS-OIG is charged with investigating the conduct of <span class="Italic">all </span>DHS employees--including CBP employees--it serves as CBP's own OIG. Moreover, the Authority has stated that "there is no basis for finding that the result of...bargaining" between the Union and CBP "is unenforceable merely because DHS-OIG allegedly controls the conditions of employment that were the subject of that bargaining." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This principle applies to Article 41, which is the result of bargaining between the Union and CBP's predecessor, Customs. Further, the court decisions cited by CBP are inapposite because they involve whether a settlement agreement entered into by one group of private plaintiffs is binding upon a different group of private plaintiffs; they do not address the circumstances under which one component of a federal agency may enter into enforceable agreements that impose obligations on another component of the same agency. <span class="Italic">See Ortiz</span>, 527 U.S. at 846; <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 490 U.S. at 768. Accordingly, that the award may affect how DHS-OIG conducts investigations does not alone demonstrate that the award is contrary to law.</p>
