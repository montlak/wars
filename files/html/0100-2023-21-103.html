<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-102"><span class="space">1.</span> Eligibility of Employee for Retirement as Condition to Annuity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Hollander v. OPM</span>, 39 MSPR 195, 198-201 (1988) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Horner v. Hollander</span>, 895 F.2d 759 (Fed. Cir. 1990)), the question was whether an individual who was severely ill, and later died as a result of the illness, was "eligible to retire" so to confer a survivor annuity on his spouse. The employee did not have sufficient service credit for an immediate retirement when he died. The Board remanded the case to permit OPM to make a determination of whether the employee would have been approved for a disability annuity even though no application was filed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, the appellant contends that the issue presented in her appeal is whether her former husband was "eligible to retire" before his death within the meaning of the Spouse Equity Act, Pub. L. No. 98-615, as amended by the Federal Employee Benefits Improvement Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-251 (<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note). She further argues that, if her former husband was "eligible to retire," it will follow that she is entitled to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, the appellant contends that part of the regulation disqualifying survivor benefits to the former spouses of persons eligible for disability retirement, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622(a)(2), conflicts with the amended Spouse Equity Act. She argues that, since that part of the regulation is unauthorized and improper, it should be abrogated. While conceding that her former husband did not meet the age and service requirements to have been eligible for civil service retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336,[6] the appellant contends that she should have been allowed to prove that her former husband was "eligible to retire" for disability under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337. We agree.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The minimum age and service requirement for an employee to be eligible for immediate civil service retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336(a) is 55 years of age with 30 years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Of course, the appellant would still have the burden of proving that her former husband was eligible to retire and that she has met the statutory requirements for a former spouse survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See Prestien v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 8 M.S.P.R. 698, 704 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The word "retirement" found in subchapter II of chapter 83, title 5, United States Code, includes both immediate retirement due to meeting the statute's age and service requirements under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8336 or meeting the statute's requirements for disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337. Therefore, we find that "eligible to retire" means membership in <span id="Page_4219"></span>the class of those meeting the requirements for entitlement to retirement benefits,[9] including disability retirement; the phrase is not limited to those persons who have actually been found to qualify for retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In this case, the administrative judge found that the appellant's former husband could not have been "eligible to retire" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337 because he did not submit to OPM an application for disability. However, as we discussed above, the phrase "eligible to retire" means membership in the class of those meeting the requirements for entitlement to retirement benefits. Since the appellant's former husband had not separated from Federal Service before his death, he would have met the time filing requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b) and thus was not excluded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the legislative history [11] of &#x00A7; 4(b)(1) of the Spouse Equity Act, Pub. L. No. 98-615, as amended in 1986 by &#x00A7; 201(b)(1)(A) of Pub. L. No. 99-251, does not address whether it was intended to cover employees eligible for disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337, we find that restricting the meaning of the term "eligible to retire" would be inconsistent with the overall purpose of the Spouse Equity Act and its amendments. The stated purpose of the Spouse Equity Act was to establish certain spousal rights under the Civil Service Retirement System. <span class="Italic">See</span> 130 Cong. Reg. H9983 (daily ed. Sept. 24, 1984). The legislation was targeted toward problems arising in two areas: (1) The inequities of existing law that left many former spouses of Federal employees without retirement benefits; and (2) procedural problems which had prevented current spouses of Federal retirees from receiving such benefits. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Underlying the expressed purpose of the legislation was a broader Congressional concern with the high incidence of poverty among elderly women, particularly divorced and widowed women. According to the bill's sponsor, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, "[i]t is the horror stories of elderly divorced women left in poverty that prompted this legislation."<span class="Italic">See id.</span> at H9985.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Our review of the legislative history does not reveal any Congressional intent to authorize OPM to exclude disability retirement from coverage of the phrase "eligible to retire." The 1986 Amendment that added the term "eligible to retire" was added on the Floor of the Senate on December 11, 1985, without debate or Committee report explaining it. 131 Cong. Rec. S17448 (daily ed.). Similarly, there is no record of discussion or explanation by the House on December 16, 1985. 131 Cong. Rec. H11994 (daily ed.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1986, the Act was amended, consistent with its original purpose, to include a greater class of widows and former spouses. For example, it deleted as a condition of eligibility that former spouses have no other retirement income. In addition, in the amendment at issue here, it provided eligibility for survivor benefits to former spouses whose husbands had not retired, but who were eligible to retire at the time of death. <span class="Italic">See</span> Federal Employee Benefits Improvement Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-251, &#x00A7; 201(b)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since it is clear that the 1986 amendment was designed to remedy the situation for those women whose husbands had not retired before death, although eligible to do so, it must be liberally construed to achieve its purpose. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Kleindienst</span>, 357 F. Supp. 749, 751 (D.D.C. 1973). We find that the part of OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.622 (a)(2), which excludes survivor benefits to former spouses of those employees who were eligible for disability retirement before their death, is an arbitrary and capricious construction of the statute that OPM was charged to implement because it is overly restrictive without apparent reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the initial decision must be reversed and the case remanded to OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ORDER</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, OPM shall make a determination concerning the eligibility of the appellant's former husband for disability retirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337 prior to his death. Based on this determination, OPM shall decide whether the appellant has met the requirements for a former spouse survivor's annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-615, &#x00A7; 4(b)(1), as amended by the Federal Employees Benefits Improvement Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-251, &#x00A7; 201(b)(1)(A). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 note.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">McCurry v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 393, 396 (1990) ("As the administrative judge noted in his initial decision, the appellant evidently would have been entitled to receive a survivor annuity if the decedent had been a Federal employee when he died, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(d) (widow of employee who dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service is entitled to survivor annuity). She also might have been entitled to a survivor annuity if the decedent had retired. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b) (widow of annuitant is entitled to survivor annuities under certain circumstances). As we have indicated above, however, the decedent was neither a Federal employee nor a retiree when he died. The appellant therefore is not entitled to receive a survivor annuity on either of these bases.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a survivor annuity claim based on an employee whose disability retirement was discontinued based on regained earning capacity and who was not receiving another CSRS benefit at the time of his death, <span class="Italic">Ziencik v. OPM</span>, PH-0831-17-0327-I-1 (NP 3/2/2023), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Specifically, the appellant did not demonstrate that her now-deceased husband's income was below the earning limitation amount when the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) terminated his disability retirement annuity for regaining earning capacity, nor did she prove that this annuity was reinstated prior to his death. <span class="Italic">See White v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 672, 674-75 (1996) (finding that a widow of a disability annuitant was not entitled to a survivor annuity, as the annuitant regained earning capacity but died before having his disability annuity reinstated). Relatedly, the appellant's husband did not file for a deferred retirement annuity when he became eligible at age 62, nor was he receiving any other benefit under the CSRS at the time of his death. <span class="Italic">See Dickerson v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 109, 111, 113-14 (1991) (holding that the appellant was not entitled to a survivor annuity, as her former husband, who retired on a disability annuity and recovered, had not filed for his deferred annuity and was not receiving payments under the CSRS when he died)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The initial decision, <span class="Italic">Ziencik v. OPM</span>, PH-0831-17-0327-I-1 (ID Sept. 28, 2017), provides some background:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant and Michael E. Ziencik, a former federal employee, were married in 1981. Mr. Ziencik retired on disability annuity on March 27, 1998, electing a maximum survivor annuity for the appellant. In 2005, Mr. Ziencik accepted a one-year contract position which took him to Kuwait and Iraq. In this position, OPM determined that Mr. Ziencik earned $104,500.00, exceeding the 80 percent earning limitation ($39,419.25) for the current rate of his retiring position ($49,274.07) and his disability benefit would terminate June 30, 2006. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(d), 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1209.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated November 10, 2006, Mr. Ziencik was advised that he would be entitled to a future deferred annuity effective on his 62nd birthday, September 27, 2011, at which point he would be able to elect survivor benefits for his spouse. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1210(2)(b). Mr. Ziencik never made an application for survivor benefits before his death on August 4, 2012.</p>
