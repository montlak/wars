<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-213"><span class="space">2.</span> Fully Recovered After a Year</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM regulations provide, 5 CFR 353.301 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year</span>. An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began (or from the time compensable disability recurs if the recurrence begins after the injured employee resumes regular full-time employment with the United States), is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's reemployment priority list for the competitive service or reemployment list for the excepted service. If the individual cannot be placed in the former commuting area, he or she is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. (See parts 302 and 330 of this chapter for more information on how this may be accomplished for the excepted and competitive services, respectively.) This subpart also applies when an injured employee accepts a lower-graded position in lieu of separation and subsequently fully recovers.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The priority consideration restoration rights for employees who recover after one year following OWCP benefits eligibility were summarized by <span class="Italic">Cooper-Meister v. USPS</span>, AT-0353-11-0211-B-1 (NP 4/21/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In order for the appellant to establish Board jurisdiction over her claim that the agency denied her request to restoration following her full recovery from her work-related injury after one year from the date her eligibility for benefits began, the appellant must nonfrivolously allege that: (1) she was separated from employment due to a compensable injury; (2) she fully recovered from her work-related injury more than one year after she became eligible for OWCP benefits; (3) she requested restoration to duty within 30 days after the cessation of her OWCP benefits; and (4) the agency violated her priority reemployment rights. <span class="Italic">See Welby v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 17, &#x00B6; 16 (2006). Unlike an employee who fully recovers within one year from the date of eligibility for OWCP benefits, an employee who fully recovers more than one year from the date of eligibility for such benefits--such as the appellant--is only entitled to priority consideration for reemployment. <span class="Italic">See McFarlane v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 126, &#x00B6; 20 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delalat v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 455, 459-63 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 15-21 (2000), outlined the rights, including agency-wide placement, the possibility of retroactive placement, and burdens of proof of the appellant asserting that the agency failed to provide restoration rights when he fully recovered more than a year after the onset of a compensable injury:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was an employee in the competitive service. OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.204-.208 govern the restoration rights of employees in the competitive service whose full recovery from a work-related injury takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for OWCP benefits begins. Section 330.204(a) refers to the regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 353 for information on eligibility. Section 353.301(b) provides that an eligible employee "is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one." This regulation is consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.206(b)(1), which provides that if an individual cannot be restored to his former position or an equivalent one in the commuting area, he "is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency at the time and in a manner as the agency determines will provide the individual with maximum opportunities for consideration."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of proving jurisdiction in an appeal of an alleged denial of restoration rights. <span class="Italic">Key v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 7 (1999).[1] An appellant who makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on the jurisdictional question. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A nonfrivolous allegation is an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over an appeal.</p>

However, the Board here will rely on cases involving section 302 where the provisions in that section accord the same priority reemployment rights as their counterparts in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330 or where the general propositions of law that apply in cases involving reemployment rights for individuals in the excepted service would apply equally to cases involving persons in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a nonfrivolous allegation of the Board's jurisdiction over an appeal based on the denial of priority consideration for restoration, an appellant is required to satisfy a two-pronged test, namely, he must allege that (1) he applied to the agency for restoration rights, and (2) the agency's employment of another person deprived him of those rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00B6; 8. However, it is part of the agency's burden to submit evidence regarding available positions, and any restrictive qualification requirements, to show that it made all reasonable efforts to place the appellant in his former position or an equivalent one. <span class="Italic">Pugh v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 81 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 12 (1999). In determining whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him to a hearing, the administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions; however, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive. <span class="Italic">Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge improperly resolved disputed jurisdictional facts without first notifying the appellant of the jurisdictional issue raised by his amended appeal and without affording him an opportunity to request discovery and a hearing on the new issue. Nonetheless and as explained below, we find that the appellant has satisfied his jurisdictional burden, and that the appeal must be remanded to provide him with the procedures to which he is entitled and a hearing on the jurisdictional issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence shows that the appellant made a request for restoration when he notified the agency in his June 2, 1999 letter that he was able to return to work. The agency only considered the appellant for placement beginning with the date he formally applied for restoration, July 14, 1999. The Board, however, has held that a valid request for restoration may be made in a manner other than a formal application, e.g., it may be made orally. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Key,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 10. In a July 9, 1999 letter to the appellant, the agency acknowledged receipt of his June 2, 1999 letter requesting reemployment with the federal government. Thus, the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that he requested restoration on June 2, 1999, and that the agency should have considered him for priority placement beginning earlier than July 14, 1999.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the second prong of the two-pronged test, i.e., the requirement of an assertion that denial of restoration rights was based on the agency's employment of another person, the Board has rejected a restrictive reading of the reemployment regulations, holding that an appellant need not present specific factual information that his restoration rights were violated before the Board's jurisdiction attaches. <span class="Italic">Hogg v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 153, 156-57 (1985) (construing the regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 302.501); <span class="Italic">accord, Metsopulos,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. at 539. In restoration cases, the Board has implicitly recognized that an appellant may meet his jurisdictional burden as to the requirement relating to the employment of another person by addressing the issue in jurisdictional submissions. <span class="Italic">Key,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 13, <span class="Italic">citing Tisdale v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 390, 394-95 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted copies of vacancy announcements for Engineer positions in the San Diego area, his former commuting area. The opening date for all four positions is June 21, 1999, and the closing dates for applications were either July 20 or 21, 1999. The appellant asserts that he is qualified for all of the positions, and the agency has not directly disputed that assertion. He also states that he was informed that there were other positions available, but that the positions are more particularly known to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the appellant is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he left or an equivalent one. If he cannot be placed in his former commuting area, he is entitled to priority consideration for an equivalent position elsewhere in the agency. Ms. Hager stated in her declaration that she identified seven vacancies for which the appellant appeared qualified, but that because his "RPL eligibility is only applicable within the San Diego commuting area," he was not considered for the five vacancies which were outside of the San Diego commuting area.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hager said that the agency did not consider the appellant for the five vacancies outside of his former commuting area because they were outside of that area; she did not aver that any other factors went into that decision. It therefore appears that in addition to not considering the appellant for vacancies prior to July 14, 1999, the agency also failed to <span id="Page_4466"></span>consider him for vacancies for which he may have been qualified simply because those vacancies were outside of his former commuting area. If so, the agency may have violated his right to be considered for placement agencywide. <span class="Italic">See Phillips v. Department of Transportation,</span> 22 M.S.P.R. 223, 226-27 (1984) (under 5 C.F.R. Part 353, the agency may not restrict consideration for priority placement to the region in which the appellant was formerly located). Accordingly, the parties on remand may submit argument and evidence in connection with the appellant's entitlement to be considered for the five vacancies to which Ms. Hager referred and to any other vacancies which occurred after he became entitled to priority placement, either in or outside of the San Diego commuting area. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Justice,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 685, &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (the Board remanded the appeal to afford the parties an opportunity to submit evidence and argument to 9 determine the date on which the agency first had a "vacancy agencywide," starting from the date OWCP notified the agency that the appellant's compensation payments had stopped); <span class="Italic">Black v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 561, 565-66 (1998) (the appellant was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing where he consistently claimed that he was not advised of vacancies for which he might qualify while he was on the RPL).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that the Board should order his restoration with back pay retroactive to the date he requested restoration. In support of this argument, he cites <span class="Italic">Beltran v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. 425 (1991). In <span class="Italic">Beltran,</span> the Board ordered the agency to reinstate the appellant "to his former or an equivalent position retroactive to the date on which the agency first had an <span class="Italic">appropriate vacancy</span> after the appellant requested reemployment." 50 M.S.P.R. at 431 (emphasis added). In the instant appeal, no findings have as yet been made regarding whether, from the date the appellant was entitled to restoration, there existed appropriate vacancies for which he was qualified and in which he could be placed. Instead, that question is one on which the administrative judge will take argument and evidence on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that the Board should award him immediate restoration with retroactive back pay, the appellant contends that any violations of his restoration rights cannot otherwise be remedied because he "cannot be retroactively considered for positions that have already been filled." Where an agency has not placed an appellant on an RPL at the earliest date to which he was entitled to such placement, the Board may order the agency to retroactively place him on the RPL, consider him for positions that became vacant during the period of the retroactive placement, and appoint him to a position which he would have received if he had been properly placed on the RPL. <span class="Italic">See Welber v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 70 M.S.P.R. 231, 232 (1996). The appellant therefore is mistaken when he argues that the agency cannot retroactively consider him for positions that have already been filled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Delatat</span> was modified by <span class="Italic">Welby v. USDA</span>, 101 MSPR 17, 22-27 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-20 (2006), stating that a nonfrivolous allegation of the denial of a restoration right for an employee who recovers after more than one year is sufficient to carry the case to a hearing:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bears the burden of establishing the Board's jurisdiction over his restoration appeal, which in the context of the allegations he has made, is an appeal of a denial of a reemployment priority right. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)] ; <span class="Italic">Key v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 7 (1999). Although restoration rights following a compensable injury are statutory, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8151(b)(2), the statute does not confer a right of appeal to the Board. Rather, Board appeal rights derive from Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b) provides, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Fully recovered after 1 year</span>. An employee who separated because of a compensable injury and whose full recovery takes longer than 1 year from the date eligibility for compensation began is entitled to priority consideration, agencywide, for restoration to the position he or she left or an equivalent one provided he or she applies for reappointment within 30 days of the cessation of compensation. Priority consideration is accorded by entering the individual on the agency's [RPL] for the competitive service or [RPL] for the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 353.301(b) states that 5 C.F.R. part 330 contains information on how priority consideration is accomplished for individuals in the competitive service. Part 330 applies to this appeal because the appellant's LEO position was in the competitive service. The appeal rights in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209 are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual who believes that his or her reemployment priority rights under [subpart B of part 330] have been violated because of the employment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of the Board's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Navy,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 262 (2003), the Board stated that "[a]n appellant who nonfrivolously alleges facts which, if proven, would establish Board jurisdiction over his restoration appeal is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if there are factual issues related to jurisdiction that cannot be resolved on the written record." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 16. The Board in <span class="Italic">Delalat v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 455 (2000), also stated that an appellant who makes a nonfrivolous allegation that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal of an alleged denial of restoration rights "is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing on the jurisdictional question." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's statements in <span class="Italic">Hall</span> and in <span class="Italic">Delalat</span> regarding a right to a "jurisdictional hearing" based on nonfrivolous allegations of a denial of restoration rights suggest that an appellant must prove his case on the merits to establish the Board's jurisdiction over his appeal. Such an approach is contrary to the broad principle stated by the Board in <span class="Italic">Bartels v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 98 M.S.P.R. 280 (2005), that "where jurisdictional elements and merits elements are intertwined, the [adjudicating body] should find that jurisdiction has attached when the requisite non-frivolous allegations are made." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 11. As further stated in <span class="Italic">Bartels,</span> this is a "logical" approach because "it does not require the appellant to prove his entire case on the merits in order to invoke the power of the Board to decide his case in the first place." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, to the extent that decisions such as <span class="Italic">Hall</span> and <span class="Italic">Delalat</span> hold that an individual who has fully recovered from a compensable injury after one year of becoming eligible for OWCP benefits is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing when he makes nonfrivolous allegations that the agency denied him reemployment priority rights, we modify them to hold that if such an individual makes the required nonfrivolous allegations, he is entitled to a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Accord Walley v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 279 F.3d 1010, 1016-21 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the court held that when an individual who had partially recovered from a compensable injury filed an appeal claiming that the agency terminated her because of a compensable injury and denied her restoration rights, the Board would have jurisdiction over the appeal if she made nonfrivolous allegations corresponding to those matters); <span class="Italic">Chen v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 97 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 12 (2004) (citing <span class="Italic">Walley,</span> the Board found that it has jurisdiction over a restoration rights appeal under 5 C.F.R. part 353, subpart C, "if the appellant made a non-frivolous allegation of facts sufficient to establish, if proven, that the agency violated her restoration rights under part 353"); <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 298, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12, 20 (2002) (the Board overruled its precedent to find that an appellant establishes the Board's jurisdiction over his individual right of action appeal and is entitled to a hearing on the merits if he exhausted proceedings before the Office of Special Counsel and makes nonfrivolous allegations that he made a protected disclosure that was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action against him).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 353.301(b), 330.209 provide Board appeal rights to an individual who occupied a position in the competitive service, fully recovered from a compensable injury more than one year after he became eligible for OWCP benefits, and believes that his RPL rights have been violated because of the appointment of another person who otherwise could not have been appointed properly. The issue of whether the agency appointed "another person" to a position in derogation of the appellant's reemployment priority rights is one of production that goes to the merits of the appeal because it is part of the agency's burden in a restoration appeal to submit evidence regarding the positions that were available during the relevant time period for which the appellant may have been qualified and that were filled by "another person" who may not have been appointed properly. Hall, 94 M.S.P.R. 262, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 25-27. Thus, the jurisdictional test in an appeal involving an individual who has fully recovered from a compensable injury after one year of becoming eligible for OWCP benefits is whether he makes nonfrivolous allegations that: (1) He was separated because of a compensable injury; (2) he has fully recovered more than one year after the date he became eligible for OWCP benefits; (3) he requested restoration after the cessation of OWCP compensation; and (4) he believes that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 330.209, 353.301(b). If there is a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> dispute as to any of these elements, the appellant bears the burden of proving them because they are issues that implicate both jurisdiction and the merits. <span class="Italic">Cf. Walley,</span> 279 F.3d at 1019-20 (in a partial recovery restoration case, the appellant has the burden of proving that he was separated because of a compensable injury, which is both a jurisdictional and merits element). If the appellant establishes the Board's jurisdiction over his reemployment priority claim under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.209, the agency has the burden, on the merits, of proving by preponderant evidence that it did not violate the appellant's reemployment priority rights, including proof that it did not appoint another person who could not have been appointed properly. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)] ; <span class="Italic">Hudson v. Department of the Navy,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6; 5 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 15 Fed. Appx. 812 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the agency separated the appellant on January 10, 2003, because he was unable to perform the duties of his position as a result of a compensable injury. The appellant has acknowledged that he fully recovered from his compensable injury more than one year after the date he became eligible for OWCP benefits, and he has not challenged <span id="Page_4467"></span>the statement in the agency's March 25, 2004 letter to him that he was, as of that date, still receiving OWCP benefits. The record shows that the appellant requested restoration in an April 15, 2004 letter to Patrol Commander Wears, although he mistakenly requested restoration as an individual who had fully recovered from a compensable injury within one year after being separated. It was not until the agency issued its May 24, 2004 letter to the appellant that it advised him that his entitlement was to enrollment on its RPL because he was an individual whose full recovery from a compensable injury took longer than one year after the date his eligibility for compensation began, and that it sent the appellant an application to enroll for the RPL. The appellant signed the RPL application on May 28, 2004. With its response to the appellant's petition for review, the agency has submitted an exhibit of what appears to a copy of its RPL as of October 12, 2004, which does not list the appellant's name as being enrolled in the RPL, but seems only to show his January 10, 2003 separation date. In its response, the agency relies on that exhibit to support its allegation that "the appellant was ultimately placed on the RPL."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant effectively notified the agency in his April 15, 2004 letter to Patrol Commander Wears that his OWCP benefits had ceased, and that he was requesting restoration. We also find that the agency did not comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.202(b) by enrolling the appellant in its RPL no later than ten calendar days after it received the appellant's April 15, 2004 letter that the agency should have considered as his request to be registered on its RPL. We therefore find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights by not placing him on its RPL in a timely manner or perhaps not enrolling him on its RPL at all, and has established the Board's jurisdiction over this appeal so as to entitle him to a decision on the merits. <span class="Italic">See Walley,</span> 279 F.3d at 1019 ("Once the Board has jurisdiction, it may address the merits.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the last element of the jurisdictional test, OWCP's March 31, 2004 letter to the appellant shows that it deemed him fully recovered from his compensable injury at least by that date, although the letter does not state the exact date when workers' compensation benefits ceased. The appellant has not disputed the administrative judge's finding that his OWCP benefits ended as of March 20, 2004. The appellant stated that sometime in December 2003 he spoke with Patrol Commander Wears and told her that he had heard that the agency hired another person for a LEO position in the district where he worked before he was injured. The agency argues that this statement is irrelevant because the appellant did not qualify for the RPL on or before December 2003 and therefore did not have a right to priority consideration for the position to which he refers. If "another person" was appointed to a LEO position before or in December 2003, then that appointment could not have violated the appellant's reemployment priority rights because he had no such rights in December 2003 while he was still receiving OWCP benefits. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301(b). As stated above, however, if the appellant proves on the merits that the agency violated his reemployment priority rights, then the agency has the burden to show by preponderant evidence that any violation did not deny the appellant an appointment to a position for which the appellant was qualified and to which another person was not appointed properly if the agency had timely provided the appellant with his reemployment priority rights after the cessation of his OWCP benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If, on the merits, the administrative judge finds that the agency violated the appellant's RPL rights, the most appropriate remedy that will return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> would be for the administrative judge to determine if the appellant was denied a position for which he was qualified and for which "another person" was not appointed properly for the period of time that the appellant should have been enrolled on the agency's RPL. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hudson</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 398, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8. If there was no denial of the appellant's appointment to a position to which he should have been appointed but for a violation of his reemployment priority rights, the more appropriate remedy that will return the appellant to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> is for the agency to extend the appellant's RPL eligibility for the period of time that the administrative judge may find that the agency did not properly enroll the appellant on its RPL, unless the agency has already provided the appellant with such an extension.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The record shows that the appellant is a tenure group I employee.
