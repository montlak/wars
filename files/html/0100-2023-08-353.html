<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-345"><span class="space">b.</span> Equitable Tolling of DOL Time Limit; Waiver of Administrative Exhaustion Requirement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army,</span> <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1247104.html">412 F.3d 1273</a>, 1275-78 (Fed. Cir. 2005) [(on subsequent appeal, <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 573 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2009), finding VEOA violation and remanding to Board for remedial order)], determined that equitable tolling is possible if the employee does not timely initiate a claim under VEOA with the Labor Department or with MSPB:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends that the board lacks jurisdiction over Kirkendall's VEOA claim for two reasons. First, he failed to file his complaint with DoL within 60 days of the decision not to list him on the Certificate of Eligibles as required by subsection 3330a(a)(2)(A). Second, he failed to appeal DoL's determination to the board within 15 days as required by subsection 3330a(d)(1)(B). In response, Kirkendall argues that both filing periods are subject to equitable tolling and that his severe disability justifies tolling in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), the Supreme Court established a presumption in favor of equitable tolling in suits against the government when permitted in analogous private litigation. In an attempt to honor congressional intent, the Court later held that this presumption can be rebutted if "there [is] good reason to believe that Congress did <span class="Italic">not</span> want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply." <span class="Italic">United States v. Brockamp</span>, 519 U.S. 347, 350 (1997). Five factors evince a contrary congressional intent: "[a] statute's detail, its technical language, its multiple iterations of the limitations period in procedural and substantive form, its explicit inclusion of exceptions, and its underlying subject matter." <span class="Italic">Brice v. Sec'y of Health &#x0026; Human Serv.</span>, 240 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There can be little doubt that Kirkendall's employment discrimination claim is analogous to claims brought pursuant to Title VII. <span class="Italic">See Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 95 (holding that "the statutory time limits applicable to lawsuits against private employers under Title VII are subject to equitable tolling"); <span class="Italic">Brice</span>, 240 F.3d at 1372 (holding that claims under the Vaccine Act are sufficiently similar to tort claims so as to invoke the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption). We therefore begin our analysis by assuming that equitable tolling applies. As a result, we need only determine whether the language and context of section 3330a indicate that Congress desired otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we must dispose of the agency's contention that the failure to meet the filing deadline in subsection 3330a(a)(2)(A) irrevocably forecloses a veteran from exhausting his administrative remedies, thus precluding jurisdiction in the board. The agency's theory does not comport with our holding in <span class="Italic">Bailey v. West</span>, 160 F.3d 1360, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), that the Supreme Court has "not distinguish[ed] among the various kinds of time limitations that may act as conditions to the waiver of sovereign immunity." Furthermore, the agency's theory directly contradicts <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.</span>, 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982), a Title VII case, which held that "filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other courts have likewise held that filing deadlines contained in statutes requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies are not jurisdictional, but rather are subject to equitable relief. For example, in <span class="Italic">Edelman v. Lynchburg College</span>, 300 F.3d 400, 404 (4th Cir. 2002), another Title VII case, the Fourth Circuit held that the exhaustion requirement, like a statute of limitations, can be tolled. <span class="Italic">See also Leong v. Potter</span>, 347 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir. 2003) ("The exhaustion requirement is akin to a statute of limitations and is subject to waiver, equitable estoppel, and equitable tolling."). Similarly, <span class="Italic">Harms v. Internal Revenue Service</span>, 321 F.3d 1001, 1009 (10th Cir. 2003), held that "the failure to <span class="Italic">timely</span> exhaust administrative remedies [with the MSPB] is not a jurisdictional deficiency but rather is in the nature of a violation of a statute of limitations." In the context of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Tenth Circuit held that the requirement that an employee must file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor within 30 days of a violation could be tolled. <span class="Italic">Donovan v. Hahner, Foreman &#x0026; Harness, Inc.</span>, 736 F.2d 1421, 1424 (10th Cir. 1984) (analyzing 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 660(c)(2)). And, the Second Circuit held that the failure to timely exhaust administrative remedies prescribed in the Financial Institution Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act can be excused when required by equity. <span class="Italic">Carlyle Towers Condo. Ass'n v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.</span>, 170 F.3d 301, 307 (2d Cir. 1999). We therefore hold that the exhaustion requirement contained in subsection 3330a(a)(2)(A) that a veteran file a complaint with DoL within 60 days of the alleged violation is akin to a statute of limitations. As such, we apply the same analysis to subsection 3330a(a)(2)(A) as we apply to subsection 3330a(d)(1)(B) in determining whether equitable tolling is allowed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the focus of our inquiry, we consider each of the five factors outlined in <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span>, 519 U.S. at 350-53, to determine whether Congress intended that equitable tolling not be allowed. First, section 3330a is not detailed. This is especially true in comparison with other administrative schemes held subject to equitable tolling, such as Title VII, <span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 92, and Social Security, <span class="Italic">Bowen v. City of N.Y.</span>, 476 U.S. 467, 469 (1986). Similarly, section 3330a is less detailed than the highly complex scheme used to provide benefits to veterans. <span class="Italic">See Bailey</span>, 160 F.3d 1360 (holding that 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7266 is subject to equitable tolling). <span class="Italic">But see Brice</span>, 240 F.3d at 1373 (holding that the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act is "part of a detailed statutory scheme which includes other strict deadlines").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, section 3330a's language is not technical. And, although the language used in subsection 3330a(d)(1)(B) is fairly forceful, the Supreme Court has held that the use of "barred" is, by itself, not sufficient to persuade it that Congress intended to prohibit equitable tolling. <span id="Page_620"></span><span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, 498 U.S. at 95. Our court came to the same conclusion in <span class="Italic">Former Employees of Sonoco Products Co. v. Chao</span>, 372 F.3d 1291, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2004), where we held that 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2636(d) could be tolled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, the timing provisions in section 3330a are not repeated. <span class="Italic">See Brockamp</span>, 519 U.S. at 351 ("[section] 6511 reiterates its limitations several times in several different ways"). Fourth, section 3330a does not contain explicit exceptions to the two filing deadlines. <span class="Italic">See Bailey</span>, 160 F.3d at 1365 ("Likewise, section 7266 does not provide its own exceptions to the general rule."); <span class="Italic">see also Brockamp</span>, 519 U.S. at 351 ("[section] 6511 sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits, and those very specific exceptions do not include 'equitable tolling.'"); <span class="Italic">Martinez v. United States</span>, 333 F.3d 1295, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (finding that 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2501 contains an explicit exception for "persons 'under legal disability'"); <span class="Italic">Brice</span>, 240 F.3d at 1373 ("[T]he Act includes a specific exception from the limitations period for a petition improperly filed in state or federal court.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The final, and most persuasive of the five <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span> factors, is the underlying subject matter of section 3330a. The purpose of the VEOA is to assist veterans in obtaining gainful employment with the federal government and to provide a mechanism for enforcing this right. In a very real sense, the VEOA is an expression of gratitude by the federal government to the men and women who have risked their lives in defense of the United States. It is clear to us that, far from intending a strict interpretation, Congress understood the availability of the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption, which was well established by 1998 when the VEOA was adopted. We further note that veterans who seek to enforce their rights under the VEOA will often proceed without the benefit of representation, just as Kirkendall did. Under such circumstances, it is "particularly inappropriate" to foreclose equitable relief. <span class="Italic">Zipes</span>, 455 U.S. at 397 (quoting <span class="Italic">Love v. Pullman</span>, 404 U.S. 522, 527 (1972)); <span class="Italic">see also Bowen</span>, 476 U.S. at 480 ("The statute of limitations we construe in this case is contained in a statute that Congress designed to be unusually protective of claimants." (internal quotation marks omitted)). And, finally, the limitations periods in section 3330a are exceedingly short--far shorter than the 120-day period we held subject to equitable tolling in <span class="Italic">Bailey</span>, 160 F.3d at 1366.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having considered the five <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span> factors we are left with the definite and firm conviction that Congress did not intend to override the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption as to either filing period in section 3330a. As such, we hold that both subsection 3330a(a)(1)(A) and subsection 3330a(d)(1)(B) are subject to equitable tolling. On remand, the board is instructed to assess whether Kirkendall's disability prevented him from complying with the filing requirements. <span class="Italic">See Arbas v. Nicholson</span>, 403 F.3d 1379, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Principi</span>, 363 F.3d 1316, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2004 <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> decision on the availability of equitable tolling under VEOA was affirmed <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, <span class="Italic">Kirkendall v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-federal-circuit/1247104.html">479 F.3d 830</a>, 835-36 (Fed. Cir. 2007). The decision was joined with concurring and dissenting opinions. The court readily determined that it and the Board could review the Labor Department's determination on the timeliness of Kirkendall's complaint:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Preliminarily, we find no merit in the government's suggestion that DoL's rejection of Kirkendall's complaint as untimely under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies depriving both the board and this court of jurisdiction over his VEOA claim. Because the question of whether section 3330a(a)(2)(A) is subject to equitable tolling was at issue, the board had the authority and the obligation to consider whether DoL's action was in error. <span class="Italic">See Bowen v. City of N.Y.,</span> 476 U.S. 467, 482 (1986) (excusing claimants' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies for the same reasons the Court found the underlying timeliness requirement subject to equitable tolling); <span class="Italic">Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc.,</span> 455 U.S. 385, 393 (1982) ("[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling."); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.,</span> 437 F.3d 1322, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (The board has "jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Cruz v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>)). To conclude otherwise would foreclose judicial review of DoL's rejection, despite the possibility of tolling, and conflict with the "strong presumption that Congress intends judicial review of administrative action." <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Family Physicians,</span> 476 U.S. 667, 670 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also Conoco, Inc. v. U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Bd.,</span> 18 F.3d 1581, 1585 (Fed. Cir. 1994) ("It is well established that judicial review of agency action is to be presumed, absent clear and convincing evidence of Congressional intent to the contrary."). We, of course, have authority to review the board's decision under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1295(a)(9).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> explained, at greater length than the original decision, the bases for the court's determination that equitable tolling applies to VEOA claims, 479 F.3d at 836-42:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In deciding whether the timing provisions at issue here are subject to equitable tolling, we are guided by <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89 (1990). There the Supreme Court established the presumption that equitable tolling is available in suits against the government when permitted in analogous private litigation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 95-96. A precise private analogue is not required; only that there be sufficient similarity between the suits. <span class="Italic">See Scarborough v. Principi,</span> 541 U.S. 401, 422 (2004) ("Litigation against the United States exists because Congress has enacted legislation creating rights against the Government, often in matters peculiar to the Government's engagements with private persons&#8722;matters such as the administration of benefit programs. Because many statutes that create claims for relief against the United States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants, Irwin's reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so establishing the presumption in favor of equitable tolling, the Court recognized that once the government has consented to be sued through a waiver of sovereign immunity, "making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable to private suits, amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver." <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 95. Instead, "[s]uch a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful principle of interpretation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Moreover, it cautioned that "we must be careful not to assume the authority to narrow the waiver that Congress intended, or construe the waiver unduly restrictively." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 94 (quoting <span class="Italic">Bowen,</span> 476 U.S. at 479) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, in order to honor congressional intent, the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption can be rebutted if "there [is] good reason to believe that Congress did <span class="Italic">not</span> want the equitable tolling doctrine to apply." <span class="Italic">United States v. Brockamp,</span> 519 U.S. 347, 350 (1997); <span class="Italic">see also Young v. United States,</span> 535 U.S. 43, 49 (2002) ("It is hornbook law that limitations periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless tolling would be inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <span class="Italic">United States v. Beggerly,</span> 524 U.S. 38, 48 (1998) ("Equitable tolling is not permissible where it is inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute."). We have interpreted this to mean that "absent a <span class="Italic">clear contrary intent</span> of Congress to limit jurisdiction created by a particular statute," we will apply the presumption. <span class="Italic">Bailey v. West,</span> 160 F.3d 1360, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (emphasis added). To make this determination, we look to the factors enumerated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span>: "the statute's detail, its technical language, its multiple iterations of the limitations period in procedural and substantive form, its explicit inclusion of exceptions, and its underlying subject matter." <span class="Italic">Brice v. Sec'y of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 240 F.3d 1367, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (citing <span class="Italic">Brockamp,</span> 519 U.S. at 350-52). Every factor need not be present to find that Congress intended to preclude tolling, <span class="Italic">Brice,</span> 240 F.3d at 1372-73, and while unlikely, it is possible for a single factor to be dispositive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, to determine the availability of equitable tolling in suits against the government, we engage in a two-part inquiry. First, we determine whether such tolling is available in a sufficiently analogous private suit. If so, we look to the <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span> factors to determine whether Congress expressed a "clear intent" that equitable tolling not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the matter at hand, the purpose of the VEOA is to provide preference eligible veterans with a method for seeking redress where their veterans' preference rights have been violated in hiring decisions made by the federal government. Where a veteran establishes a violation, the agency is ordered to comply with the veterans' preference statutes and award compensation for any lost wages or benefits suffered by reason of the violation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330c(a). Moreover, if the violation is found to be willful, the agency is ordered to pay the aggrieved veteran "an amount equal to backpay as liquidated damages." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, we find that Kirkendall's VEOA claim is sufficiently analogous to private actions brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> to invoke the presumption that equitable tolling applies here. <span class="Italic">See Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 95 (holding that "the statutory time limits applicable to lawsuits against private employers under Title VII are subject to equitable tolling"); <span class="Italic">Brice,</span> 240 F.3d at 1372 (holding that claims under the Vaccine Act are sufficiently similar to tort claims so as to invoke the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption). This leaves only the question of whether Congress has evinced a clear intent to rebut that presumption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> missed both relevant timing provisions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. Therefore, if either period is not subject to equitable tolling, his VEOA claim is barred. Because the government concedes that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A)[3] is subject to equitable tolling, and because, if anything, it is comparatively less emphatic, less detailed, and less technical than 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1),[4] we begin our analysis with section 3330a(d)(1). The government argues, based primarily on section 3330a(d)(1)'s "in no event" clause, that Congress manifested a clear intent to rebut the Irwin presumption. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">A complaint under this subsection must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint <span id="Page_621"></span>under subsection (a) within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the Merit Systems Protection Board in accordance with such procedures as the Merit Systems Protection Board shall prescribe, <span class="Italic">except that in no event may any such appeal be brought--</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(A)&#x2003;before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(B)&#x2003;later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary under subsection (c)(2). (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the "in no event" clause is certainly strong, when the statute's language is considered as a whole and that clause is evaluated in context, the statute's technical language is little more than a neutral factor in our analysis under <span class="Italic">Brockamp.</span> When taken together with the remaining factors, it certainly does not operate to rebut the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption. To begin, the clause at issue, "except that in no event," introduces section 3330a(d)(1)(A), which provides that an appeal may not be brought "before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed." Because section 3330a(d)(1) explicitly stipulates that the Secretary of Labor is to have 60 days to resolve veterans' VEOA complaints before they may seek redress from the board, the clause primarily operates to emphasize Congress' intent to provide a 60-day window left exclusively for DoL review. Because the "in no event" clause first introduces a timing requirement that is not a "deadline" that a complainant can "miss" in a manner giving rise to a late filing, which would thereby invoke considerations of equitable tolling, that clause can hardly be viewed as either clear or emphatic evidence of Congress' intent to foreclose equitable tolling under section 3330a(d)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 95, which "adopt[ed] a more general rule to govern the applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government," cautioned against reading too much into seemingly stringent language setting forth a statute's timing requirements. There, the Supreme Court found equitable tolling equally available in two statutes providing for actions against the government, one of which stated, "[w]ithin thirty days...an employee...<span class="Italic">may file</span> a civil action," while the other provided, "[e]very claim...<span class="Italic">shall be barred</span> unless the petition...is filed...within six years." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 94-95 (emphases added). As the Court explained, "An argument can undoubtedly be made that the latter language is more stringent than the former, but we are not persuaded that the difference between them is enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability of equitable tolling." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lending additional support, <span class="Italic">Bailey v. Glover,</span> 88 U.S. 342 (1874), involved statutory language that is decidedly analogous to that found here, and further illustrates the limited role that these more subtle distinctions in Congress' choice of language play in a court's analysis into whether it may equitably relax a deadline. There, the Supreme Court allowed a plaintiff's late-filed claim to proceed despite statutory language that provided, "<span class="Italic">no suit</span> at law or in equity <span class="Italic">shall in any case be maintainable...</span>in any court whatsoever, unless...brought within two years." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 344 (emphasis added). While <span class="Italic">Bailey</span> <span class="Italic">v. Glover</span> specifically relates to claim accrual, not equitable tolling, the Supreme Court nevertheless cites it in <span class="Italic">Young,</span> 535 U.S. at 49, to support the proposition that limitation periods are customarily subject to equitable tolling, unless it "would be 'inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute.'" (citations omitted). In other words, despite the statute's admonishment that "no suit...shall in any case be maintainable," the Court, nonetheless, found that equitable relief was not inconsistent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the propriety of applying <span class="Italic">Bailey v. Glover,</span> to an equitable tolling case, the Supreme Court also cited it in <span class="Italic">Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &#x0026; Petigraw v. Gilbertson,</span> 501 U.S. 350, 363 (1991), as a case relating to equitable tolling. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern District Terminal,</span> 359 U.S. 231, 231 (1959), which was cited in <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> held that despite the statutory command, "No action shall be maintained...unless commenced within three years from the day the cause of action accrued," because the defendant's fraud caused the plaintiff to let the filing period lapse, the defendant was equitably estopped from using the late filing to bar the action. <span class="Italic">Glus</span> is an equitable estoppel case, but <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> relied on it for the proposition that, "We have allowed <span class="Italic">equitable tolling</span> in situations...where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." 498 U.S. at 96 n.4 (emphasis added). Certainly, the availability of the various equitable remedies for relaxing limitations periods are governed by differing considerations, but as the Supreme Court makes clear, these remedies are sufficiently similar that precedents relating to the availability of one are applicable to the others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, further analysis of <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span> illustrates the error and weakness in the government's reliance on the "in no event" clause. The statute at issue there, 26 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6511, provides that a "[c]laim for...refund...<span class="Italic">shall be filed</span>...within 3 years." 519 U.S. at 349-54. Despite the similarity between the "shall be filed" language and the "shall be barred" clause in <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> where equitable tolling was found to apply, <span class="Italic">Brockamp</span> found equitable tolling unavailable under section 6511. It even characterized the manner in which the statute set forth time limitations as "unusually emphatic." 519 U.S. at 350. This apparent contradiction is readily explained, however, because the Court paid little, if any, attention to the specific language introducing section 6511's timing provision. Instead, the Court based its conclusion on the fact that the statute "sets forth its limitations in a highly detailed technical manner, that, linguistically speaking, cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions. Moreover, &#x00A7; 6511 reiterates its limitations several times in several different ways." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 350-51. It further elaborated that "&#x00A7; 6511 sets forth explicit exceptions to its basic time limits, and those very specific exceptions do not include 'equitable tolling'" and "to read an 'equitable tolling' provision into these provisions, one would have to assume an implied exception for tolling virtually every time a number appears. To do so would work a kind of linguistic havoc." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 351-52. The Court also pointed to policy considerations underscoring the need for repose and administrative simplicity in tax cases. In other words, it was a comprehensive view of the statute as a whole and the purpose of the statutory scheme that drove the analysis, not rudimentary reliance on the seemingly, or not so seemingly, stringent nature of the language introducing the statute's timing provisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, section 3330a's purpose and the statutory scheme in which it operates make it abundantly clear that the Irwin presumption is not rebutted. The purpose of the VEOA is to assist veterans in obtaining gainful employment with the federal government and to provide a mechanism for enforcing this right. In a very real sense, it is an expression of gratitude by the federal government to the men and women who have risked their lives in defense of the United States. It defies logic to suppose that when Congress adopted the VEOA in 1998, well after the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Irwin</span>, it intended the narrow interpretation that the government gives it. <span class="Italic">See Young,</span> 535 U.S. at 49-50 ("Congress must be presumed to draft limitations periods in light of [the <span class="Italic">Irwin</span> presumption].") (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also relevant that veterans who seek to enforce their rights under the VEOA often proceed without the benefit of representation, just as Kirkendall did.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Setting aside the apparent fact that the appellant never submitted a complaint to the DoL in writing, we recognize that a question may exist as to whether the doctrine of equitable tolling is applicable to this case under the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall.</span> In finding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) and 3330a(d)(1)(B) are subject to equitable tolling, the Federal Circuit was guided by the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89 (1990), which "established the presumption that equitable tolling is available in suits against the government when permitted in analogous private litigation." <span class="Italic">Kirkendall,</span> 479 F.3d at 836. In <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> the Supreme Court noted that "Federal courts have typically extended equitable relief only sparingly"; specifically, the Supreme Court acknowledged that it has "allowed equitable tolling in situations where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="Italic">Irwin,</span> 498 U.S. at 96 (footnotes omitted). The appellant's pleadings and supporting evidence contain no suggestion that he actively pursued his remedies in any forum during the statutory 60-day period, nor do they suggest that either the Census Bureau or the DoL "induced or tricked [him] into allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Rather, the record strongly suggests that the appellant's failure to file a complaint with the DoL resulted from his "fail[ure] to exercise due diligence in preserving his legal rights," which the Supreme Court has indicated is an excuse for which it has "generally been much less forgiving" in terms of applying the doctrine of equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Although the appellant contends on petition for review that he was not "aware of the injustice" of the Census <span id="Page_622"></span>Bureau's selection procedure until August 2006, such an argument does not fall within the limited scope of cases to which equitable tolling is applicable.</p>

The appellant argued equitable tolling should apply because she relied on the agency's determination that she was ineligible for the positions at issue. This argument goes to the merits of the appellant's VEOA claim and does not explain why she did not meet the filing deadline. Similarly, the appellant's assertion that she was unaware of her right to file a VEOA complaint is not a sufficient reason to equitably toll the filing deadline, <span class="Italic">Gingery</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (explaining that equitable tolling is applied sparingly, such as when the appellant has actively pursued his remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period or been "induced or tricked" by an agency representative into filing late (quoting <span class="Italic">Irwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 498 U.S. 89 (1990), the Supreme Court addressed the equitable tolling of statutory time limits in lawsuits against the Government. As between private litigants, the Court acknowledged extending equitable relief only sparingly, allowing equitable tolling in situations "where the claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where the complainant has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct in allowing the filing deadline to pass." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 96. The Court determined that "[b]ecause the time limits imposed by Congress in a suit against the Government involve a waiver of sovereign immunity, it is evident that no more favorable tolling doctrine may be employed against the Government than is employed in suits between private litigants." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board has applied these criteria in adjudicating cases when, as here, an appellant fails to meet the 60-day filing deadline set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(a). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gingery v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 43, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-18 (2012); <span class="Italic">Roesel v.

Department of Agriculture</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 371, &#x00B6; 6 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant challenges the administrative judge's finding that he failed to meet either criterion. He first argues, as he did below, that since, in three of his appeals, he erroneously filed complaints with OSC, he thereby "filed a defective pleading during the statutory period." In examining this claim, the administrative judge considered only whether the mistakenly filed complaints constituted an allegation by the appellant that he was induced or tricked by the agency, concluding that it did not because he never alleged that anyone at the agency sent him to OSC instead of DOL and that, in any event, ignorance of one's rights is not covered by equitable tolling. The appellant has not specifically challenged this finding and we find no basis upon which to disturb it. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 400, &#x00B6; 20 (2003) (finding that an agency's failure to advise an individual of appeal rights does not equate with inducing or tricking that individual into allowing a filing deadline to pass), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 89 F. App'x 714 (Fed. Cir. 2004).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not, however, consider whether any complaints the appellant allegedly filed with OSC constituted defective pleadings filed during the statutory 60-day time period so as to support the application of equitable tolling. We therefore do so now. The appellant argued incongruously below that he filed complaints with OSC on November 19, 2015, challenging alleged violations of veterans' preference that did not occur until January 5, 2016, and May 15, 2016. In any event, he did not submit below any such complaints to establish when they were in fact filed or whether they attempted to raise veterans' preference claims. <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 13. We find, therefore, that there is no evidence that the appellant filed a defective pleading within the statutory 60-day time period.
The appellant also disputes on review the administrative judge's finding that he did not establish that he was induced by the agency's misconduct to delay filing his VEOA complaints. The administrative judge considered the appellant's claim that his immediate supervisor "threatened" him with termination if he filed a VEOA complaint and that therefore he was justified in waiting until after he had resigned to file his VEOA claims. Relying on several Federal court decisions, the administrative judge found that any such threat did not serve to equitably toll the statutory filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Beckel v. Wal-Mart Associates, Inc</span>., 301 F.3d 621, 624 (7th Cir. 2002) (holding that applying equitable estoppel to a threat to fire an employee if he sued would "distort the doctrine of equitable estoppel" as well as "circumvent the limitations that Title VII imposes on suits for retaliation"); <span class="Italic">Carter v. West Publishing Co</span>., 225 F.3d 1258, 1266 (11th Cir. 2000) (holding that equitable estoppel did not apply where plaintiff waited to bring an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charge out of fear of retaliation for doing so).[5] The administrative judge reasoned that the appellant also could have been fired after his probationary period, and that to allow him to wait until he was no longer an employee to file a VEOA complaint would mean that he could possibly wait years to file, an action that would not be in accordance with the principles and purpose of equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Similar to equitable tolling, equitable estoppel is a principle that applies when a party makes false representations to induce another party to act and that party reasonably relies on the misrepresentations to his or her detriment. <span class="Italic">Blaha v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 21, &#x00B6; 9 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that he was not, in fact, a probationary employee but rather had 6 years of Federal service. Regardless of his status, however, even if his allegation that he was apprehensive about possible retaliation because he was threatened with removal is true, it does not reflect that he was thereby tricked or induced into allowing the filing deadline to pass and is not a ground for equitable tolling of that deadline. <span class="Italic">Beckel</span>, 301 F.3d at 626; <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 225 F.3d at 1266.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant argues that he was denied a hearing at which he could have provided witness testimony regarding his VEOA claims and the propriety of his nonselections. The Board has held, however, that it has the authority to decide a VEOA appeal on the merits, without a hearing, when there is no genuine dispute of material fact. <span class="Italic">Waters-Lindo v. Department of Defense</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 5 (2009).

The 60-day filing deadline set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) is subject to equitable tolling, however, and an employee's failure to file a complaint with DOL within that 60-day period does not summarily foreclose the Board from exercising jurisdiction to review the appeal. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Department of the Army</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6; 10 (2009). The Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Irwin v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the timeliness of the appellant's DOL complaint, the administrative judge rejected the appellant's argument that the 60-day period for filing a DOL complaint did not begin to run until November 16, 2012, when he reviewed the selectee's biosketch and discovered that she was not a veteran. Instead, the administrative judge found, at the latest, the date the appellant was notified of his nonselection is the date of the alleged violation. The administrative judge found that, because the appellant was notified of his nonselection on August 23, 2012, the deadline for filing his DOL complaint was October 22, 2012. Therefore, the administrative judge found, the appellant's November 16, 2012 complaint was 25 days late.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the equitable tolling issue, the administrative judge found that the appellant adduced no evidence that he filed a defective pleading within the statutory period. The administrative judge further found that there is no evidence of misconduct by the agency and no evidence that its actions induced or tricked the appellant into allowing the DOL filing deadline to pass. The administrative judge noted that, while the appellant argued that he did not have information to show that his veterans' preference rights may have been violated until November 16, 2012, the Board has held that "such an argument does not fall within the limited scope of cases to which equitable tolling is applicable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

Therefore, the administrative judge found, the appellant failed to demonstrate that equitable tolling should apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review the appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's finding that equitable tolling does not apply here. Based on our review of the record, we discern no reason to disturb this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the appellant alleges that the administrative judge erred in finding that his DOL complaint was untimely. Specifically, he asserts that the administrative judge erred by interpreting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) as requiring that the aggrieved party file a complaint with DOL within 60 days of the alleged violation, regardless of whether he or she has any knowledge of the hired candidate's veteran status. The appellant argues, as he did below, that the Board should instead apply the "discovery rule" to VEOA claims for purposes of determining the timeliness of an appellant's DOL complaint. The appellant explains that, under the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run when the "plaintiff's cause of action accrues," which occurs not on the date of the wrong that injures the plaintiff but on the date that the plaintiff discovers that he/she has been injured. The appellant reiterates his argument from below that he did not discover that his veterans' preference rights may have been violated until November 16, 2012, when he received the biosketch of the selectee. Therefore, he contends, his November 16, 2012 DOL complaint is timely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the 60-day period for filing his complaint with DOL began on August 23, 2012, when the appellant learned of his nonselection for the DSD position. The appellant's assertion that his knowledge of the selectee's veteran status rather than his knowledge of the nonselection was the trigger for the 60-day time limit is not consistent with the express language of the statute itself or Board precedent.[4] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) ("A complaint under this subsection must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation."); <span class="Italic">see also Hayes</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 41, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2 11 (finding that where the agency selected another person for the position on February 3, 2005, the appellant's December 1, 2005 complaint to DOL was filed nearly ten months after the date of the agency's action, and nearly 8 months after the expiration of the statutory 60-day time limit for filing set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A)). Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant did not timely file his VEOA complaint with DOL and failed to establish that the deadline for filing such a complaint should be equitably tolled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant's argument is also inconsistent with the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Jones v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 497 F.

<p class="Body-Text">Although equitable tolling may apply to the VEOA DOL deadline, that deadline starts running from the time of notice of nonselection, and it was not tolled when the appellant later learned information that he asserted led him to believe there was an improper nonselection, <span class="Italic">Santa Teresa v.

Such a complaint "must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A). If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve such a complaint within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may appeal the alleged violation to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the alleged veterans' preference violation occurred on September 21, 2015, when the appellant was notified that he was not selected for the Attorney Advisor position. Accordingly, the appellant had until November 20, 2015, to file a complaint with DOL. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a. The appellant acknowledges that he did not file his DOL complaint until December 31, 2015, more than 3 months after the alleged violation occurred.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's assertion that his knowledge of the selectee's veteran status and qualifications, rather than his knowledge of the nonselection, was the trigger for the 60-day time limit is not consistent with the express language of the statute itself or Board precedent.[3] <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) ("A complaint under this subsection must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation."); <span class="Italic">see also Hayes v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant has not shown that either criterion is met, and equitable tolling therefore does not apply. As the administrative judge found, the appellant does not claim that he actively pursued his remedies in any forum during the statutory 60-day period. Rather, the appellant argues that the agency official who interviewed him deceived him into believing that the agency had properly conducted the hiring process, causing him to miss the filing deadline. He argues that, after learning of his nonselection, during a follow up telephone call with his interviewer, he was led to believe that <span id="Page_624"></span>the selectee was a veteran with qualifications similar to his own through the interviewer's statements that it was "neck and neck" between the appellant and the selectee on qualifications and if it were a race, it was a "classic photo finish."

The appellant appears to allege that as a result of this discussion, he should be deemed to have filed a "defective pleading" within the 60-day time period for filing a complaint under VEOA. However, the appellant has not shown that such a discussion with an EEO counselor, as opposed to the filing of an EEO complaint, constitutes the filing of a defective pleading warranting the application of equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">Cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends, as she did below, that she was induced by the agency's misinformation to allow the 60-day deadline to pass. Specifically, the appellant asserts that, on September 15, 2011, after learning that interviews were being conducted for the position, she spoke to an agency Human Resources Consultant to inquire why she was not placed on the certificate of eligibles. The Human Resources Consultant allegedly informed her that she had not been placed on the certificate of eligibles because six displaced federal employees who were eligible under ICTAP authority had preference over disabled veterans. The appellant alleged that in March 2012, her sister-in-law, who had applied for a different position with the agency, told her that the agency was contradicting its earlier claim and stating that veterans had preference over displaced employees, and that the appellant promptly filed her complaint with VETS thereafter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accepting the appellant's account as true, we agree with the administrative judge that the Human Resources Consultant's statements are not evidence that the agency intended to trick the appellant into foregoing any right to challenge her nonselection by filing a complaint with VETS. Rather, the record evidence only shows that the agency communicated to the appellant the basis for its actions in processing her application, that the agency's actions were based on a misinterpretation of the applicable rules governing selection, and that the agency has since taken steps to correct its errors. ID at 6 (agency admission that the six ICTAP applicants were not entitled to priority and statement that it has begun reconstructing selection process). These statements concern the merits of the appellant's complaint rather than her right to seek corrective action from VETS. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that there are insufficient grounds upon which to equitably toll the 60-day deadline to file a complaint with VETS. <span class="Italic">See Brown</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 381, &#x00B6; 12 (that the appellant was unaware veterans' preference rights had been violated until after 60-day deadline had passed was not within the limited scope of reasons for application of equitable tolling).</p>

Mr. Hill argues that equitable tolling should apply, but without a filed complaint with the DOL there is no date to be tolled.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's presentation fails to resolve his failure to exhaust his remedy with DOL. Until the appellant has exhausted his DOL remedy, the Board simply has no jurisdiction to consider his VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Department of Defense</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (Congress conditioned the Board's authority to adjudicate VEOA appeals upon the appellant having first exhausted his remedy with DOL); <span class="Italic">Gingery v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the appellant's suggestion that any attempt to file a DOL complaint now would be futile, the appellant is correct that such a complaint must be filed with DOL within 60-days of the alleged violation to be timely. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In her jurisdictional order, the administrative judge did not include the requirement that, before the appellant can file a VEOA appeal with the Board, he must receive a response from DOL or submit evidence that he provided notice to DOL that he was appealing to the Board. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Burroughs</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 647, &#x00B6; 7;<span class="Italic"> Becker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In certain instances, the Board considers whether to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to a statutory deadline under which the filing period is suspended for equitable reasons. For instance, the Board has considered equitable tolling in individual right of action (IRA) appeals and Veterans Employment Opportunities Act of 1998 (VEOA) appeals to determine whether a case should be considered timely filed. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Heimberger v.

The Board considers whether to apply equitable tolling in these situations because the statutory basis for the deadlines in these appeals does not provide for waiving the time limit for good cause. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A), 3330a(a)(2)(A), (d)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Heimberger</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 10, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Alegre</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 17; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1209.5(b).

<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, the Board is considering the appellant's petition for enforcement in a VEOA appeal, as opposed to the VEOA appeal itself, the Board may apply its own regulations, as set forth in chapter II, subchapter A, part 1201 of title 5, to address procedural matters. <span class="Italic">See generally Marshall v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 587 F.3d 1310, 1314-15 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Under these regulations, instead of considering equitable tolling, the Board considers whether the appellant's petition was timely filed or whether there was good cause for the delay. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even if we considered the applicability of the doctrine of equitable tolling, we would find it inapplicable here.

Accordingly, even if we did consider the doctrine of equitable tolling, we would find no basis for waiving the deadline in this case.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1)(A), a preference eligible who alleges that an agency has violated such individual's rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor. Such a complaint "must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A). If the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve such a complaint within 60 days after the date on which it is filed, the complainant may appeal the alleged violation to the Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). The Board has held that in order to establish jurisdiction over a VEOA appeal, an appellant must: (1) show that he exhausted his remedy with DOL; and (2) make nonfrivolous allegations that (i) he is a preference eligible within the meaning of VEOA; (ii) the action at issue took place on or after the October 30, 1998 enactment date of VEOA, and (iii) the agency violated <span id="Page_626"></span>his rights under a statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference. <span class="Italic">Heckman</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 133, &#x00B6; 6.

The court, in addressing the agency's contention that the Board lacked jurisdiction over the VEOA claim because Mr. Kirkendall had failed to file his complaint with DOL within 60 days of the decision not to list him on the certificate of eligibles, and in finding that the 60-day deadline was subject to equitable tolling, held as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_627"></span>As an initial matter, we must dispose of the agency's contention that the failure to meet the filing deadline in subsection 3330a(a)(2)(A) irrevocably forecloses a veteran from exhausting his administrative remedies, thus precluding jurisdiction in the board.

(<span class="Italic">en banc</span>), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 128 S.

The court preliminarily found "no merit in the government's suggestion that DoL's rejection of [the appellant's] complaint as untimely under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A) constitutes a failure to exhaust administrative remedies depriving both the board and this court of jurisdiction over his VEOA claim." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 835. The court held that because the question of whether section 3330a(a)(2)(A) was subject to equitable tolling was at issue, the Board had the authority and obligation to consider whether DOL's action was in error. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.

City of New York</span>, 476 U.S. 467, 482 (1986) (excusing claimants' failure to exhaust their administrative remedies for the same reasons the Court found the underlying timeliness requirement subject to equitable tolling), and <span class="Italic">Zipes</span>, 455 U.S. at 393 ("[F]iling a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling."). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[3] The court noted that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[b]efore the merits panel, the government argued that the board was without jurisdiction to consider Kirkendall's VEOA appeal because of his alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We addressed that argument, and rejected it. In its petition for rehearing <span class="Italic">en banc</span>, the government did not renew this argument, and we did not grant rehearing on it. As a general rule, the scope of our <span class="Italic">en banc</span> review is limited to the issues set out in the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> order. It is, therefore, inappropriate for the government now to reargue exhaustion. However, because exhaustion calls into question our jurisdiction over the tolling issues, we address it to clarify that there are no jurisdictional impediments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 835 n.2. Thus, upon finding that there was "no merit" to the government's suggestion that DOL's rejection of Mr. Kirkendall's complaint as untimely filed constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies depriving the Board of jurisdiction over the VEOA claim, and that there were "no jurisdictional impediments" in the case, the court went on to find that the timing provisions at issue in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> were subject to equitable tolling. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 836-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In support of its determination that the Board had the authority and obligation to consider whether DOL's action was in error, the court in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> also cited to <span class="Italic">Garcia v.

Given the reasoning in the earlier panel decision, however, as well as the court's clear statements in <span class="Italic">Kirkendall</span> that there was no merit to the idea that the Board lacked jurisdiction over a VEOA claim when DOL rejected the underlying complaint as untimely filed, and there were no jurisdictional impediments in the case, and considering the court's reliance on <span class="Italic">Bowen</span> and <span class="Italic">Zipes</span>, we do not read the court's citation to <span class="Italic">Garcia</span> as requiring the Board to dismiss a VEOA appeal for lack of jurisdiction when there is an insufficient factual showing to invoke equitable tolling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether a limitation on claims which may be brought against the government is jurisdictional, i.e., limits the scope of the government's waiver of sovereign immunity, or is merely an affirmative defense that may be raised by the government, depends on the language and context of the statute at issue. <span class="Italic">See Blueport Co., LLC v.

USPS</span>, 100 MSPR 328 (2005), resolved that the Board could not waive the 60 day period for initiating a VEOA complaint with the Labor Department:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The VEOA provides that a preference eligible who believes that an agency has violated his rights "under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1). Such a complaint "must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A). The "complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation" to the Board, no later than 15 days from the date the complainant receives written notification from DoL of the results of DoL's investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1). Exhaustion of the DoL complaint process is a jurisdictional prerequisite to pursuit of a Board appeal under the VEOA<span class="Italic">. Augustine v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, <span id="Page_628"></span>88 M.S.P.R. 407 &#x00B6; 7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 208 &#x00B6; 5 (2001). The Board cannot exercise jurisdiction over a claim that an agency violated an individual's veterans' preference rights if that individual did not first file a complaint with DoL. <span class="Italic">Tindall v. Department of the Army</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 669 (2002), we held that the VEOA's 15-day deadline for filing an appeal with the Board following exhaustion of the DoL complaint procedure, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1), cannot be waived, and that an appeal filed beyond that deadline must be dismissed. We have not yet had occasion, however, to address the effect of an individual's failure to meet the VEOA's 60-day deadline for filing a complaint with DoL under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant concedes that his complaint to DoL was over two years late.[3] We disagree with the appellant's assertion that DoL considered his claim on the merits. The appellant's argument stems from the statement in DoL's letter to him that "[b]ased on our investigation, we have determined that your complaint does not have merit." This sentence is preceded by a finding that the appellant's complaint was untimely under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2)(A), and is followed by a discussion of the timing of events and the observation that over two years elapsed between the non-selection and the filing of the complaint. When read as a whole, DoL's letter concludes that the appellant's complaint "does not have merit" because it was untimely. There is no indication that DoL conducted any inquiry into the substance of the appellant's allegations or that it formed any opinion about whether the agency may have violated the appellant's veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We do not decide whether the Board has authority to review DoL's factual finding that a VEOA complaint was untimely because in this case, the appellant admits that his complaint to DoL was late; he does not seek Board review of this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given that DoL rejected the appellant's complaint as untimely without considering its substance, the question becomes whether this appeal can proceed. As noted above, exhaustion of the DoL complaint procedure is a jurisdictional prerequisite to a Board appeal under the VEOA. Accordingly, DoL's rejection of the appellant's complaint as untimely with no consideration of its substance leads us to conclude that the appellant failed to exhaust his remedy before DoL. The VEOA is a waiver of sovereign immunity, and as such, it must be "strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign." <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (<span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed.2d 486 (1996)). We hold that when the appellant concedes that his VEOA complaint to DoL was untimely and DoL disposes of that complaint as untimely without addressing its substance, the Board cannot exercise jurisdiction over that individual's subsequent VEOA appeal concerning the same alleged violation of veterans' preference rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contends that his lateness in submitting his complaint to DoL should be excused because he did not learn about DoL's role in assisting veterans until October 2001 and he filed his complaint with DoL shortly thereafter. We held in <span class="Italic">Williams</span> that the 15-day statutory deadline for filing a VEOA appeal with the Board after exhaustion of the DoL process cannot be waived for good cause shown. 90 M.S.P.R. 669 &#x00B6; 10. The 15-day deadline contains no provision for waiver, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00B6; 8, and although the 60-day deadline for submission of a complaint to DoL is worded somewhat differently, it too contains no provision for waiver<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(B) ("in no event may any such appeal [to the Board] be brought...later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification" from DoL of the results of its investigation) <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(2)(A) ("[a] complaint [to DoL] under this subsection must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation" of veterans' preference rights). We also have found nothing in the Senate committee report on the bill that became the VEOA that would suggest that the 60-day deadline may be waived. S. Rep. No. 105-340, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need not determine, however, whether the 60-day deadline can be waived because here, DoL did not excuse the appellant's lateness. Assuming solely for the sake of argument that DoL has authority to waive the 60-day deadline, we have no basis to conclude that we are authorized to rule that DoL should have waived the deadline in this or any other case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this connection, it is useful to contrast the VEOA exhaustion scheme with another instance in which an individual must meet a statutory deadline for submitting a claim to another agency before proceedings before the Board may be instituted. An application for disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) must be submitted to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) while the applicant is employed or within one year of the applicant's separation from employment. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(b). The applicable statute provides for waiver of the deadline under one circumstance<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. (lateness may be excused when mental incompetence prevented timely filing). Furthermore, the Board may review OPM's decision not to waive this deadline, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Hass v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 110 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5 (1999), because when OPM makes a decision affecting an individual's rights or interests under the CSRS, it is OPM's decision that is appealed to the Board, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8347(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A VEOA claim differs from the disability retirement application process because, as already noted, the VEOA does not provide for waiver of the 60-day deadline for filing a complaint with DoL. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a). In addition, under the VEOA it is some other agency's determination (here, the Postal Service's) that is subject to Board review; DoL's determination on a VEOA complaint, while a prerequisite to a VEOA appeal before the Board, is not itself the action appealed. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d). Considering these two aspects of the VEOA exhaustion process, we conclude that where, as here, DoL rejects a VEOA complaint as untimely, we have no authority to decide whether DoL should have waived the deadline. Indeed, given that we lack authority to waive the 15-day statutory deadline for filing a VEOA appeal before us, <span class="Italic">Williams</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 669 &#x00B6; 10, we see no basis for us to review DoL's decision not to waive the 60-day statutory deadline for filing a complaint with DoL.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our holding in this case is limited to the situation presented, namely, where an individual files what he admits is an untimely VEOA complaint with DoL that DoL disposes of as untimely without addressing its substance. We do not decide whether DoL has the authority to excuse a VEOA complainant's failure to meet the 60-day deadline. Likewise, we do not decide whether the Board could exercise jurisdiction over a VEOA claim where DoL either explicitly excused an individual's lateness in filing a complaint with DoL or made a determination on the substance of a complaint without addressing any apparent untimeliness.</p>

The Board did not exclude the possibility of an extension of the statutory appeal period:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On May 22, 2001, the appellant, a disabled veteran, filed an appeal challenging his failure to be selected for three identical GS-7 Accountant positions advertised by the Department of the Navy for which he had applied. He alleged that his score was too low, that he had received different explanations for why he was not selected, and that his veterans' preference rights were violated. He also stated that the Department of Labor (DOL) had conducted an investigation into the matter, and he enclosed a copy of a September 8, 2000 letter DOL had sent him regarding his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review of the appeal, the administrative judge (AJ) ordered the appellant to explain how his veterans' preference rights were violated, and to file evidence and argument showing that the appeal was timely filed. In response, the appellant indicated his belief that, when the Department of the Navy reviewed and considered his applications, it did not afford him the 10 points to which, as a disabled veteran, he was entitled. He also argued that he was not advised by DOL, and had only recently become aware, that he could file an appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her ID, the AJ found that the appellant's appeal was, by his own admission, filed after the 15-day statutory time limit, and that the time limit could not be waived. Accordingly, she dismissed the appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his PFR, the appellant argues, as he did below, that DOL never informed him that he had the right to appeal to the Board, or of the applicable time limits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This is the first case in which the Board has addressed the application of the VEOA filing deadlines. The statutory framework governing VEOA appeals provides that, where the Secretary of Labor is unable to resolve a complaint filed under the VEOA, the individual may file an appeal with the Board, but not before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed, and not later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary of the results of his investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(A) and (B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board has not yet considered how to apply the statutory filing deadlines set forth in the VEOA, it has considered the application of another filing deadline for a remedial statute, the deadline for filing individual right of action (IRA) appeals. That statutory filing deadline is similar to the VEOA statutory filing deadline in that they both require the appellant to first bring his claim to another agency, and to, in essence, exhaust his remedy there, before he can properly bring his appeal to the Board.[2] In analyzing the matter before us, therefore, we look for guidance to the way in which the Board has applied the IRA statutory filing deadline. In pertinent part, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii) provides that an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board if he has first sought corrective action from the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), OSC has notified him that its investigation concerning him has been terminated, and not more than 60 days have elapsed since that notification was provided. In considering an IRA appeal filed after the 60-day limit, where the AJ had declined to waive the deadline for good cause shown, the Board agreed with that disposition. It concluded that the filing deadline could not be waived because: (1) The statute itself did not specify circumstances in which the time limit would be waived; (2) the appellant had alleged no affirmative misconduct on the part of the agency that would preclude it from enforcing the filing deadline under the doctrine of equitable tolling; and (3) OSC had not failed to notify him that it was terminating its investigation of his allegations of reprisal for whistleblowing activities, as required by the statute<span class="Italic">. Wood v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592-93 (1992); <span class="Italic">cf. Jeter v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 495, 500 (1996) (former employee was not entitled to waiver of statutory filing deadline for application of her disability retirement benefits under the Federal Employees' Retirement System; 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8453 provides for specific filing deadline which was not met, and only one basis for waiver of that deadline, the employee's mental incompetence, which was not shown; the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress must be given effect).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In a contemporaneous remedial statute, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), Congress chose to include no deadline for filing an appeal with the Board. An appellant can file an appeal directly with the Board or file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor under 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4322. If he elects the latter route, he may file his appeal with the Board after he exhausts the Department of Labor procedure. Either way, however, there is no time limit under chapter 43 of Title 38 for filing a USERRA appeal with the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In examining the VEOA statute, we first note that it differs from the IRA statute in that its language providing that "<span class="Italic">in no event</span> may any such appeal be brought...<span class="Italic">later than 15 days</span> after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary..." is even more restrictive than the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3) which, as set forth above, simply sets the deadline for filing an IRA appeal. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(A) and (B) (emphasis added). On the other-hand, the VEOA statute, like the IRA statute, contains no provision for waiver of the filing requirements. <span class="Italic">See Tindall v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 230 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). And the VEOA statute does not require that DOL give the appellant notice of his appeal rights to the Board in order to trigger the time limit for filing a VEOA appeal. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bauer v. Department of the Army,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 352 &#x00B6; 7 (2001) (OSC is not required to give an appellant notice of his appeal rights to the Board in order to trigger the 60-day statutory time limit for filing an individual right of action appeal). Rather, the VEOA statute requires only that the Secretary of Labor notify the person who submitted the complaint, in writing, of the results of its investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with regard to equitable tolling, the Board in <span class="Italic">Wood</span> noted that the Supreme Court has described several situations where the doctrine may be applied to a statutory deadline, that is, where a claimant has actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where he has been induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. The doctrine does not extend, however, to mere "excusable neglect." <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. at 593 (citing <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed2d 435 (1990)). Here, the appellant has alleged no facts that would bring him within that doctrine such as to excuse his 8-month delay in filing this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, therefore, that the time limit set forth in the VEOA statute, like that in the IRA statute, may not be waived for good cause shown. Accordingly we DISMISS the appellant's appeal as untimely filed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit deemed insufficient the Board's analysis of VEOA and the Board's own regulations calling for notice to appellants by agencies of their rights to appeal to the Board, vacating the Board's <span class="Italic">Williams</span> decision and remanding the case for further consideration. <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, 55 Fed. Appx. 538 (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP). In the remand decision, the Board would have nothing to do with extensions of VEOA filing deadlines or regulations requiring specific notice of those deadlines, <span class="Italic">Williams v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant petitioned the Federal Circuit for review. In an unpublished opinion, the court noted that the appellant had raised the question of whether he could be excused for the filing delay because of DOL's alleged "inconsistent practice" of sometimes advising veterans that they could appeal to the Board, and sometimes, as here, not so advising them. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 55 Fed. Appx. 538, 540 (2002). Observing that no apparent regulation addresses the appellant's circumstances, the court questioned whether 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.3 should be interpreted to require the promulgation of regulations that would afford notice of appeal rights to VEOA applicants and employees, or whether that regulation requires such notice. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 540-41.

<p class="Block-Quote1">ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To answer the Federal Circuit's questions, we will start with the VEOA since "[i]t is axiomatic that statutory interpretation begins with the language of the statute." <span class="Italic">VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co.,</span> 917 F.2d 1574, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1990), <span class="Italic">citing Mallard v.

"If...the language of the statute is clear and fits the case, the plain meaning of the statute will be regarded as conclusive." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant procedures for seeking redress of an alleged violation of preference eligible rights is set forth in the VEOA provisions codified at 5 U.S.C. H 3330a(a)(1), (a)(2) and (d)(1). Under the statute, a preference eligible who believes that an agency has violated his rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans' preference "may file a complaint with the Secretary of Labor." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(1). Such a complaint "must be filed within 60 days after the date of the alleged violation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3330a(a)(2). Subsection (d)(1) of the statute provides that if DOL is unable to resolve the complaint within 60 days of the date it was filed,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the complainant may elect to appeal the alleged violation to the <span id="Page_630"></span>Board in accordance with such procedures as [the Board] shall prescribe, except that <span class="Italic">in no event</span> may any such appeal be brought--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; before the 61st day after the date on which the complaint is filed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary [that DOL was unable to resolve the complaint] . [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The language which is directly applicable to this case is the provision that "in no event" can an individual file a Board appeal "later than 15 days" after he receives notification from DOL that it could not resolve his VEOA complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellate courts that have interpreted the phrase "in no event" in statutes that relate to time limits and filing rights have found that there are no exceptions to the statutory deadlines unless the statute so provides. For instance, the statute at issue in <span class="Italic">Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie,</span> 239 F.3d 307 (3rd Cir. 2001), 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1915, served much the same purpose as the VEOA provision at issue here, in that it established a condition for bringing an action or appeal. The statute reads as follows.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">In no event</span> shall a prisoner bring a civil action or a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, <span class="Italic">unless the</span> prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 312-13 [Emphasis added] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit applied the "ordinary meaning" of the phrase "in no event" and found that it "simply means may not."' <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 313. The court found that the term "in no event" had the "preclusive effect" of preventing a prisoner who met the conditions in the statute from filing a civil action or appeal. As the court put it, section 1915(g) "obviously means 'a prisoner may not file a new civil complaint'" if he meets those conditions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court observed that the preclusive effect of section 1915(g) has only one exception, and that is the one set by Congress in the statute, namely, such prisoner can bring a new action or appeal only if he "is under imminent danger of serious physical injury." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, as explained in <span class="Italic">Securities &#x0026; Exchange Commission v. Seaboard</span> <span class="Italic">Corp.,</span> 677 F.2d 1301 (9th Cir. 1982), the Securities Act of 1933 includes a statute of limitations for bringing an action based on a securities law violation. The statute provides that "in no event" can an action be brought more than 3 years after the security was offered to the public. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1308. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit found that, in using the term "in no event," "Congress meant the bar to be absolute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also found that because the statutory time limit is absolute, equitable tolling does not apply. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court of the United States addressed the Securities Act in <span class="Italic">Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &#x0026; Petigrow v. Gilbertson,</span> 501 U.S. 350, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed. 2d 321 (1991). There, the Court noted that the 1933 Act, as amended, states, in relevant part, that no action shall be maintained to enforce any liability regarding alleged securities fraud "'unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of due diligence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 360 n.7, 111 S. Ct. at 2780 n.7. The Act further provides, as discussed above, that "[i]n no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created [under the statute] more than three years after the security was <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> offered to the public." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court found that the phrase "in no event" indicated a congressional determination that any and all actions must be brought within the 3-year period<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 362, 111 S. Ct. at 2781. The Court further held that equitable tolling is "fundamentally inconsistent" with the limitation expressly established by Congress. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 363, 111 S. Ct. at 2782. According to the Court, the "in no event" limitation set by Congress was meant to be an "outside limit" for filing an action under the securities law. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such a deadline, in the Court's view, serves as a "period of repose inconsistent with tolling." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The limit applies even if the fraud was not discovered within the 3-year period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Following the guidance of the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals that have addressed similar statutory provisions, we find that the term "in no event" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1) is a congressionally-mandated absolute bar to filing a Board appeal in a VEOA matter more than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from DOL that it was unable to resolve his complaint.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we apply the well-established and fundamental principle of statutory construction that "'a section of a statute should not be read in isolation from the context of the whole Act." <span class="Italic">Horner v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 815 F.2d 668, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">quoting Richards v. United States,</span> 369 U.S. 1, 11, 82 S. Ct. 585, 592, 7 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1962). The phrase "in no event" applies not only to subsection 3330a(d)(1)(B), which contains the 15-day time limit for filing a Board appeal, but also to subsection 3330a(d)(1)(A), which provides that a Board appeal may not be filed any earlier than the 61st day after the DOL complaint is filed. If we were to allow exceptions to the "in no event" language of subsection (d)(1)(B), then we would necessarily have to interpret the "in no event" portion of subsection (d)(1)(A) as permitting VEOA cases to be filed earlier than 61 days after a complaint is submitted to DOL. That plainly is not what Congress intended, and to accept VEOA appeals filed earlier than the 61st day would expand our jurisdiction beyond that given to us by Congress. Thus, reading section 3330(d)(1) consistently and as a whole, the phrase "in no event" has to mean that a Board appeal cannot be filed <span class="Italic">any earlier</span> than the 61st day after filing a complaint with DOL <span class="Italic">or any later</span> than 15 days after receipt of the DOL letter notifying the complainant that the case could not be resolved.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above reasons and for the reasons given by the Supreme Court and the courts of appeals in similar situations, we further find that the doctrine of equitable tolling cannot be invoked to toll or extend the deadline. In the same way that the Court found that the "in no event" filing deadline in securities cases acts as a period of repose, the "in no event" deadline in the VEOA indicates a congressional intent to establish a period of repose for VEOA claims. The instant appeal illustrates that VEOA cases can implicate hiring decisions. If a veterans' preference statute or regulation were violated in the selection process, it is conceivable that the entire process may have to be redone. This could result in some persons who were appointed to positions forfeiting their jobs. Because of the disruption and uncertainty which could ensue, it makes sense that Congress would not want Board appeals in VEOA cases to be filed months or even years after DOL concludes its inquiry. Thus, there is a very real benefit to having a "period of repose" for such appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant claims that DOL has an "inconsistent practice" of sometimes giving VEOA complainants notice of appeal rights to the Board, and sometimes not. The court questions whether that practice is arbitrary and qualifies the appellant for relief from the 15-day filing requirement. The court posits two theories in this respect. Neither theory, in our estimation, changes the result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first theory provides that a filing deadline may be waived when an agency is required by statute or regulation to provide a notice of appeal rights and the filing deadline, but fails to do so. <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 55 Fed. Appx. at 540; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Wood v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592 (1992); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Speker v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 45 M.S.P.R. 380, 385 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table). The VEOA, however, does not require that DOL give notice of Board appeal rights in order to trigger the time limit for filing a Board appeal. Nor, as the court acknowledges, do the substantive regulations governing VEOA appeals, 5 C.F.R. Part 1208, require DOL to give notice of appeal rights to veterans who are denied relief. <span class="Italic">Williams,</span> 55 Fed. Appx. at 541. The VEOA requires only that the Secretary of Labor notify the veteran who submitted the complaint, in writing, of the results of its investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2). To the extent DOL may have been inconsistent in advising veterans of their appeal rights, such inconsistency cannot serve to allow an appellant to escape the consequences of a statutory filing deadline when the statute does not require DOL to give notice of that deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Guidance on this issue is provided in an unpublished Federal Circuit opinion that addressed a like issue. In <span class="Italic">Machulas v. Merit Systems Protection</span> <span class="Italic">Board,</span> 185 F.3d 885 (Table), 1999 WL 128874 (Fed. Cir.), the court reviewed a similar statutory framework found in the Whistleblower Protection Act, specifically, the provision that allows an appellant to file an individual right of action (IRA) appeal if no more than 60 days have elapsed since the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) provided the employee notice that its investigation into his claim has terminated. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii). Although it was undisputed that the Special Counsel had failed to notify the appellant of his appeal rights in that case, the court agreed with the Board that the filing deadline could not be waived for good cause because the statute unambiguously does not allow for such extensions. <span class="Italic">Machulas,</span> 1999 WL 128874 at *1; <span class="Italic">see also Wood v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 587, 592 (1992) (60-day statutory deadline for filing an individual right of action appeal cannot be waived for good cause shown, given the language of the statute). We find similarly that DOL's alleged "inconsistent practice" does not entitle the appellant to relief from the VEOA 15-day statutory filing deadline.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In further support of our conclusion is the fact that the VEOA states that a complaint filed with DOL "must" be filed with DOL within 60 days of the date of the alleged violation, but that a Board appeal can "in no event" be filed later than 15 days after the individual receives DOL's close-out letter. The difference in terminology presumably has significance since we are required to "'give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.'" <span class="Italic">Duncan v. Walker,</span> 533 U.S. 167, 174, 121 S. Ct. 2120, 2125, 150 L. Ed. 2d 251 (2001) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed in <span class="Italic">Waddell v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> MSPB Docket No. AT-3443-02-0153-I-2, 2003 WL 22239236 (September 24, 2003), the DOL has <span id="Page_631"></span>apparently interpreted the word "must" as allowing for waiver of the 60-day deadline for filing a VEOA complaint in some situations. Such an interpretation is consistent with the Board's reading of its own regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b), which states that, with respect to certain actions, "an appeal <span class="Italic">must</span> be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed." [Emphasis added.] Despite the word "must" in the regulation, the Board will nonetheless excuse a late filing for good cause shown. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). The term "in no event" therefore has to mean something different than the word "must" in the VEOA, otherwise Congress would have simply used the word "must" when it referred to the 15-day deadline for filing a Board VEOA appeal. Consistent with the case law discussed above, the phrase "in no event" has to mean what it says--in <span class="Italic">no</span> event may a Board appeal be filed beyond the 15-day statutory time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit also questions whether the appellant might qualify for relief from the statutory filing deadline under the second theory it advances, that of equitable tolling. In <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1990), the Supreme Court held that there is a rebuttable presumption that the doctrine of equitable tolling can be invoked in certain circumstances to excuse an untimely filed lawsuit against the federal government. The Court determined, however, that lower courts had applied the doctrine to extend relief only "sparingly," as in the situation where the claimant actively pursued his judicial remedies by filing a defective pleading during the statutory period, or where he was induced or tricked by his adversary's misconduct into allowing the filing deadline to pass. The Court stated that the principles of equitable tolling do not extend to "what is at best a garden variety claim of excusable neglect." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming DOL has been inconsistent in advising veterans of their right to appeal to the Board, we are not persuaded that, by its actions, it engaged in misconduct that induced or tricked the appellant into allowing the filing deadline to pass. As noted, no statute or regulation requires DOL to provide veterans with such information. Moreover, the record does not reflect, nor does the appellant allege, that he ever inquired of DOL what his rights were, following his receipt of the September 8, 2000 letter. As such, his case concerns only the "garden variety claim of excusable neglect" to which the Court deemed the principle of equitable tolling would not extend. This result is consistent with the holding of the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gilbertson</span> that an "in no event" absolute time limit cannot be tolled even where the party filing the action discovered the violation after the time limit had expired.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit also questions whether 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.3 should be interpreted as requiring the Board to promulgate regulations requiring DOL to provide notice of appeal rights to applicants and employees, or as itself requiring such notice without the need for other regulations. That regulation states that, with regard to Board appeals filed under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 and the VEOA, the Board will apply subparts A (Jurisdiction and Definitions), B (Procedures for Appellate Cases), C (Petitions for Review of Initial Decisions), and F (Enforcement of Final Decisions and Orders) of 5 C.F.R. part 1201. Subpart B, specifically 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a), provides that, when an agency issues a "decision notice" to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board, the agency must provide the employee with notice of the time limits for appealing to the Board. The court did not resolve the question of how the regulation should be interpreted, saying that the matter should be addressed by the Board in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We need look no farther than the VEOA to answer the court's question. In 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1)(B), Congress stated that the Board may prescribe procedures for the filing of VEOA appeals, <span class="Italic">"except that</span> in no event may any such appeal be brought later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification from the Secretary [of Labor] " that DOL could not resolve his complaint. [Emphasis added.] Thus, Congress permitted the Board to promulgate regulations covering all phases of the VEOA filing process, "except that" the Board may not issue regulations which allow an appeal to be filed any later than the statutory 15-day deadline, which begins upon receipt of the DOL close-out letter. Thus, irrespective of how the appellant may want to interpret the Board's regulations, the provisions of the statute govern<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Justice,</span> 71 M.S.P.R. 59, 67 (1996) (provisions of a statute will prevail in any case where there is a conflict between a statute and a regulation).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the letter issued by DOL in this case, and in other cases which may give rise to VEOA appeals, are not "decision notice[s]" of the type that agencies routinely issue in other kinds of cases that come before the Board on appeal (adverse actions, reductions in force, performance-based actions, and retirement matters). Those cases are governed by the Board's own regulatory filing deadline which the Board can interpret as it wishes, excusing an appellant's failure to meet the deadline when it determines that a decision letter is deficient. DOL's close-out letters, however, are not "decision notices." Rather, they signify notification to the veteran of the results of DOL's investigation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(c)(2). DOL does not make appealable decisions and it did not do so here; the Department of the Navy did. <span class="Italic">See Bagunas v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 5 &#x00B6; 13 (2002) (under the VEOA, it is not DOL's, but some other agency's, determination that is subject to Board review; DOL's determination, while a prerequisite to a VEOA appeal before the Board, is not itself the action appealed). Indeed, it is the Navy that is the named party against whom this appeal has been brought. This distinction is significant, and renders VEOA cases different from most other cases that come before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One exception is IRA appeals, which are similar to VEOA appeals in that OSC, like DOL, does not issue "decision notice[s]," but rather close-out letters which signify to the employee or applicant the results of its investigation. In considering IRA appeals, the Board has not read 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a) as requiring the promulgation of regulations that would require OSC to provide whistleblower claimants with notice of their appeal rights to the Board, or as itself requiring such notice. <span class="Italic">See Bauer v. Department of the Army,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 352 &#x00B6; 8 (2001); <span class="Italic">Wood,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. at 592. Thus, in addition to the fact that the VEOA itself has, by its own terms, precluded us from issuing the regulations suggested by the court, our decision is also consistent with analogous case law regarding IRA appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having fully examined the legal issues presented by the appellant and the court, we again find that this VEOA appeal must be dismissed as untimely filed. The statutory language in question, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3330a(d)(1), is unambiguous: "In no event may any such appeal [to the Board] be brought...later than 15 days after the date on which the complainant receives written notification" from DOL. The statute's plain meaning is conclusive absent clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Delong v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 264 F.3d 1334, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 536 U.S. 958, 122 S. Ct. 2661, 153 L. Ed. 2d 836 (2002). Nothing in VEOA's legislative history suggests that the filing deadline is not absolute and can be waived. S. Rep. No. 105-340, 105th Cong., 2d Sess. (1998); H.R. Rep. No. 105-40(l), 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997). Moreover, in the Federal Register notice announcing the interim VEOA regulations, the Board stated that the "VEOA does not provide for waiver of any of its statutory filing time limits for good cause shown." 65 Fed. Reg. 5410, 5411 (daily ed. Feb. 4, 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The DOL notice to the appellant was dated September 8, 2000. The appellant filed his Board appeal on May 22, 2001. There is no dispute that the appeal was filed months beyond the 15-day statutory time limit. Thus, we must dismiss the appellant's VEOA appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Back to court--but the court then affirmed the Board and determined in <span class="Italic">Williams v. MSPB</span>, 89 Fed. Appx. 714, 717-18 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), that the Board's regulations reasonably construed the VEOA statutory scheme and that no notice of the right to appeal was required from the Labor Department:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue that led to the previous remand in this case was whether the Board's regulations required DOL to apprise veterans with VEOA complaints of their right to appeal to the Board and the time period within which such an appeal could be taken. That issue involves the Board's interpretation of its own rules of practice and procedure, which the Board has promulgated to govern practice in Board appeals. When a court is asked to review an agency's interpretation of its own rules, the court grants "great deference" to the agency's interpretation, which is given controlling weight unless it is "plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the [language of the] regulation." <span class="Italic">Krizman v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 77 F.3d 434, 439 (Fed. Cir. 1996), <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">Bowles v. Seminole Rock &#x0026; Sand Co.,</span> 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S. Ct. 1215, 89 L. Ed. 1700 (1945). Accordingly, in light of the Board's interpretation of two provisions of its own rules, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21 and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1208.3, following the remand from this court's earlier decision, our task is to determine whether the Board's interpretation of those rules is legally insupportable or plainly inconsistent with their text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board ruled that section 1201.21 does not apply to DOL notification letters in VEOA cases because they are not "decision notices" within the meaning of the regulation. The Board further explained that it regarded the 15-day limitation period in the VEOA as mandatory and therefore declined to interpret its regulations as permitting the Board to excuse noncompliance with the 15-day limitation because of the absence of notification of appeal rights in the DOL letter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the great deference that is due to the Board's interpretation of its own procedural rules, we cannot say that the Board's interpretation is legally insupportable or inconsistent with the regulatory text. There is no statutory requirement that DOL provide notification of appeal rights; accordingly, if DOL has such an obligation, it can only be the product of a regulatory requirement. The regulation at issue, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21(a), provides that notice of appellate rights must be given "[w]hen an agency issues a decision notice to an employee on a matter that is appealable to the Board." The text of the regulation does not directly apply to a case such as this one. Not only is the DOL letter not a "decision notice," as the Board ruled, but a job applicant such as Mr. Williams is not an "employee." It was therefore reasonable for the Board to conclude that the regulation did not impose a notification requirement on DOL. Although the Board <span id="Page_632"></span>might have given the regulation a broad interpretation and treated it as rendering DOL letters to VEOA complainants ineffective to trigger the filing deadline in the absence of notification of appeal rights, the Board did not interpret its regulation in that fashion, and we cannot conclude that the Board's interpretation was plainly wrong. To be sure, it would be sound policy for DOL to apprise veterans of their appeal rights in all VEOA cases, particularly in light of the very short time limitation for filing a Board appeal. That is not to say, however, that the Board's regulations must be interpreted to incorporate that policy, particularly in light of the regulatory language, which does not directly apply to VEOA cases. Accordingly, we uphold the Board's ruling that its regulations do not require DOL to include notification of appeal rights in its VEOA letters and that the absence of such notification does not prevent those letters from triggering the 15-day appeal period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams continues to press his argument that the Board should have applied the doctrine of equitable tolling in his case. On that issue, we agree with the Board that the time limitation in section 3330(a)(d)(1)(B) is mandatory and that it does not permit equitable tolling. That ruling is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &#x0026; Petigrow v. Gilbertson,</span> 501 U.S. 350, 362, 111 S. Ct. 2773, 115 L. Ed.2d 321 (1991), which held that equitable tolling was not available under another federal statute that contained similar language providing that "[i]n no event" could suits be brought after a three-year period. Moreover, as the Board noted, Mr. Williams has not pointed to any misleading conduct or trickery on the part of DOL (or any other agency involved in his case). Thus, his claim is simply one of excusable neglect, which is not sufficient to trigger equitable tolling against the government even under statutes that have been held to permit equitable tolling of limitations periods. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Irwin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S. Ct. 453, 112 L. Ed.2d 435 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Equitable tolling concerns timeliness, not lack of jurisdiction in a VEOA case for failure to file a complaint with the Labor Department. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Midyett v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP No. 2014-3131) ("The Board, however, did not dismiss Dr. Midyett's appeal due to an untimely filing, but because he failed to produce the evidence required by statute for the Board to have jurisdiction over his VEOA appeal. Thus, neither doctrine is presently relevant. Dr. Midyett's other arguments involve the merits of his VEOA claim and are therefore not before us on appeal.").
