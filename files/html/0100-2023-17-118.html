<p class="Body-Text">To establish age discrimination in a RIF, under <span class="Italic">Borowski v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 372, 374 (1989):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n employee must show (a) coverage under the [Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 USC 621], (b) an unfavorable employment action, and (c) that the employee's age was the determinative factor in the agency's challenged action....&#8197;Under this standard, the fact finder weighs all credible evidence that in sum must support the inference with substantial or reasonable probability, that the employee's age was the determining factor in the separation or demotion action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board declined to find age discrimination in a RIF challenged because the appellants were counseled concerning their retirement options in connection with the RIF. OPM guidance in the FPM permitted surveys of employees eligible for and interested in retirement to reduce the agency ceiling through attrition and to minimize the impact of a RIF. <span class="Italic">Waksman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 37 MSPR 640, 648 (1988); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 133-34 (1989) ("Both the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-253 &#x00A7; 308(a)) and OPM guidelines authorize federal agencies considering a RIF to survey employees eligible for retirement as a means of using voluntary retirement to lower employee complements and thereby reduce the number of employees affected by the RIF action....&#8197;Therefore, absent evidence that Robertson suggested Berg retire, her inquiries of Berg regarding <span class="Italic">his</span> retirement eligibility cannot properly be relied upon as "evidence" of her intent to later discriminate against Berg, because Robertson's questions do not show that she thought Berg should retire."); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 8 MSPR 695, 697-98 (1981) ("At most, appellant's evidence...only establishes that agency officials were aware of his retirement eligibility because he broached the subject with them. It does not support a finding that he was assigned to a lower graded position because of his eligibility for retirement.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Comments by agency executives suggesting a desire for younger employees, and efforts by an agency to broaden employment opportunities (allegedly a cover for racial hiring preferences), were insufficient to establish a case of discrimination in the RIF appeal of <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 476, 485-87 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-17 (1999):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...As evidence of a discriminatory animus, the appellant offered a videotape of comments made by General Joe N. Ballard, Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The videotape depicted district meetings in which General Ballard responded to a question concerning the selection process for GS 13-15 positions with the Corps of Engineers by stating that 85% of the positions at the GS-14, 15, and SES level were occupied by white males, over 45 years old, and that diversity needed to be taken into account in making selections for those positions as they became vacant. The appellant also submitted a memorandum that General Ballard issued concerning reengineering positions as a recruitment tool.[1] According to the memorandum, this topic was raised at a Blacks in Government National Training Conference, and General <span id="Page_3129"></span>Ballard strongly encouraged the "use of reengineering of positions as a recruitment tool in the wide variety of situations where it is appropriate." According to the appellant, this evidence is indicative of an agency policy that discriminated against white males over 45 years of age. He also stated that "General Ballard said that white females and females in general will be selected over males," although he offered no evidence to corroborate this claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;According to the memorandum, "[r]eengineering occurs when a position is redescribed at below the full performance level to increase the applicant pool. D[epartment of the] A[rmy] policy for positions covered by career programs is to entertain recruitment below the full performance level when efforts to fill the position at the higher grade resulted in fewer than three promotion eligible candidates."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essentially, the appellant offered the videotape and the memorandum as direct evidence that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of age, sex, and race. Direct evidence of discrimination may consist of documentary or testimonial evidence, and "[I]t may be any written or verbal policy or statement made by an employer that 'both reflects] directly the allegedly discriminatory attitude and bear[s] directly on the contested employment decision.'" <span class="Italic">See George v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 74 MSPR 71, 80 (1997). With respect to his claims of sex and race discrimination, the appellant would have been entitled to prevail if direct evidence showed that the appellant's membership in a protected class was a motivating factor in the unfavorable employment action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 2000e-2(m); <span class="Italic">Beam v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 66 MSPR 469, 475 &#x0026; n.1 (1995). To establish age discrimination, the appellant was required to show that his age was a determinative factor in the action. <span class="Italic">See Biter v. Interstate Commerce</span> <span class="Italic">Commission,</span> 76 MSPR 82, 92 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the following reasons, however, we find that the "direct" evidence that the appellant offered was insufficient to establish his discrimination claims. First, even if the reengineering memorandum could be viewed as a written policy, it did not directly reflect an allegedly discriminatory attitude. Aside from the fact that the memorandum mentioned that the reengineering issue was raised during a Blacks in Government National Training Conference, on its face, the memorandum was neutral with respect to age, sex, or race. Second, neither the memorandum nor General Ballard's comments bore directly on the contested employment decision, namely, the decision to abolish the appellant's position during the RIF. General Ballard's comments were directed to selection and promotion of individuals to fill the higher GS positions within the Corps of Engineers, and the memorandum concerned reengineering positions to increase the applicant pool. Finally, even if General Ballard's comments might be construed as a general employment policy disfavoring white males over the age of 45, the appellant offered no evidence to establish that the persons involved in selecting his position for abolishment were aware of these comments. Therefore, the administrative judge did not err in finding that the appellant failed to establish his discrimination affirmative defenses through direct evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, also attempted to offer circumstantial evidence to prove these defenses. According to the appellant, there were four GS-0802-11 Civil Engineering Technician positions within the Charleston District and the agency chose to abolish the two positions encumbered by white males over the age of 45. According to the appellant, the other positions were held by white females. The administrative judge correctly treated this claim as one of disparate treatment. In order to establish discrimination based on disparate treatment, the appellant must establish that he was a member of a protected group, that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of the protected group, and that he was treated more harshly or disparately than the individual who was not a member of his protected group. <span class="Italic">See Buckler</span>, 73 MSPR at 497. The appellant, however, failed to offer circumstantial evidence of discrimination on the basis of his race because he did not show that he was similarly situated to an individual who was not a member of his racial group. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jaramillo v. Department of the Army,</span> 81 MSPR 469 &#x00B6; 26 (1999). The appellant also failed to establish age discrimination. The appellant offered no evidence to prove that the employees who encumbered the Civil Engineering Technician positions that survived the RIF were younger than the appellant. Finally, with respect to his claim of sex discrimination, the appellant did not establish that he was similarly situated to the female employees who encumbered the Civil Engineering Technician positions that survived the RIF. Although the appellant's position had the same grade and series identifier as those of the female technicians, they were assigned to a different branch, and they performed duties that were significantly different than those performed by the appellant. <span class="Italic">[S]</span><span class="Italic"></span> <span class="Italic">ee Richard,</span> 66 MSPR at 153 (in order for comparative employees to be considered similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be nearly identical to those of the comparative employees). Because the appellant did not establish that he was similarly situated to individuals who were not a member of his protected group with respect to race, age, or sex, we find that the administrative judge did not err in finding that the appellant failed to prove these affirmative defenses by circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Viscardi v. DOD,</span> NY-0752-13-0938-I-1 (NP 3/24/2015), disfavored the appellant's disparate impact argument in a furlough appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under a disparate impact theory, a facially neutral employment practice may be deemed to violate Title VII of the U.S. Code without the evidence of an employer's subjective intent to discriminate that is required in a disparate treatment case. <span class="Italic">Stern v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 46 M.S.P.R. 328, 332-33 (1990). To establish a case of a disparate impact violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), an employee must: (1) identify the specific employment practices that are allegedly responsible for any observed statistical disparities; and (2) offer statistical evidence of a kind and degree showing that the practices at issue have caused the disparate impact. <span class="Italic">Warner v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 281, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). Unlike Title VII, the ADEA significantly narrows coverage for disparate impact cases by precluding agency liability if the adverse impact was attributable to reasonable factors other than age. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is treated as an affirmative defense for which the agency bears the burden of production and persuasion. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As set forth above, the appellant filed a motion to compel discovery requesting names, job titles, and duty stations for any and all DOD civilian employees age 40 and above, and age 39 and below, who were exempt or not exempt from the furlough, with the intent of proving disparate impact age discrimination. Although the appellant contends that his reason for requesting such information regarding all DOD civilian employees was to capture a statistically significant and material sample, he has not provided any authority which would support a finding that such information was reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.72(a). The appellant has not explained, for example, how information regarding all DOD civilian employees would be relevant to the furlough action taken by DCMA, which is the acting agency in this case. <span class="Italic">See Watson v. Fort Worth Bank &#x0026; Trust</span>, 487 U.S. 977, 995 (1988) (statistical disparities must be sufficiently substantial that they raise an inference of causation); <span class="Italic">see also Yee v. Department of the Navy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 686, &#x00B6; 10 (2014) (finding that the agency that took the furlough action was the Department of the Navy, not DOD). In any event, as set forth above, the information provided to the appellant by the agency shows that the agency furloughed all employees in DCMA's Eastern Region, which encompassed several competitive areas including the appellant's competitive area consisting of offices in New York and New Jersey, and did not exempt any of those employees. The record reflects that there were 3,268 individuals under the command of the DCMA Eastern Region. Thus, based upon a sample size consisting of all individuals who worked under the Commander of DCMA's Eastern Region, there was no statistical disparity based on age or any other factor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the agency had produced information showing a statistical disparity involving age, the appellant has shown no error in the administrative judge's alternative finding that the agency met its burden of proving by preponderant evidence a reasonable factor other than age for the furlough, i.e., a shortage of funds suffered by DCMA due to sequestration and the agency's decision to furlough employees as a reasonable solution to this problem. Accordingly, even assuming an abuse of discretion by the administrative judge regarding discovery, the appellant has shown no basis for reversal of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Panter v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 22 M.S.P.R. 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision).</p>

FDIC</span>, 41 MSPR 637, 641 (1989) ("the fact that qualified employees over age 40 are selected for RIF is not inherently suspect because there is no automatic presumption that every termination of such employees constitutes prohibited discrimination."); <span class="Italic">Decker v. DHHS</span>, 40 MSPR 119, 131-35 (1989) (discounting reliance on age discrimination relative to work force statistics; aging considered a "universal" process leading to an older work force), <span class="Italic">supra</span>; <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Stern v.
