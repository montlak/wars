<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-243"><span class="space">1.</span> Termination</h4>
<p class="noindent">Probationers lost union protection as a result of judicial interpretation of the Reform Act. In <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 730 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the court determined that a proposal allowing grievances over the termination of probationers was inconsistent with law and nonnegotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has long recognized both that federal employees are due certain procedural protections and that federal agencies must be able to terminate employees for unacceptable work performance or conduct.&#x2003;In accommodating these competing concerns, Congress created the concept of the probationary term and authorized agencies to terminate employees summarily during this period. It saw summary terminations as essential to an effective and efficient service, and it has repeatedly acted to preserve the agencies' discretion summarily to remove probationary employees. We detect no retreat from this position in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 or in the OPM regulations that implement the congressional mandate. Accordingly, we find the union proposal to be inconsistent with other law, and we reverse FLRA's order that INS bargain over the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Contract coverage of the separation of a probationer is impermissible, inconsistent with government-wide regulation. It is immaterial that justification is offered for a proposal relating to probationary separations as an appropriate procedure for those employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 29 and Army Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist.</span>, 20 FLRA 788, 790-91 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fourth Circuit affirmed the exclusion from negotiability of proposals affecting probationary terminations, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 737 F.3d 273, 274-80 (4th Cir. 2013) (reviewing 67 FLRA 24, 24 (2012)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) sought to amend its collective bargaining agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to permit probationary employees to use the agreement's grievance procedures to challenge removals alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures. The IRS refused to negotiate over NTEU's proposal on the grounds that the proposal would grant probationary employees greater procedural protections than were authorized under law and regulation. NTEU appealed to the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), which held for the IRS. NTEU now asks us to reverse the FLRA and find its proposal negotiable. We decline to do so because such a decision would ignore both the statutory and regulatory frameworks that Congress and the executive branch have put in place, create a stark circuit split, and overturn nearly thirty years of settled public-employee practice.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Most federal agencies, including the IRS, are required by law to "negotiate in good faith" with public-sector unions "for the purposes of arriving at a collective bargaining agreement." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(4); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(3) (defining "agency"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5) (listing the refusal to negotiate in good faith as an unfair labor practice); <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 25 F.3d 229, 231 (4th Cir. 1994). Such agreements must, subject to certain limited exceptions, contain "procedures for the settlement of grievances, including questions of arbitrability." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(a)(1). A "grievance" encompasses "any complaint...by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). However, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117 limits the good-faith-negotiation requirement to provisions that are "not inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1); <span class="Italic">see also NRC</span>, 25 F.3d at 231.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Within the competitive service--that part of the civil service whose members are generally selected by open and competitive examination, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2102(a)(1), 3304(a), (b)--federal law distinguishes between probationary and non-probationary employees. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321 permits the President to set up a "period of probation" for new employees "before an appointment in the competitive service becomes final." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 3321(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is tasked with establishing the rules for the competitive service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1301. Pursuant to its authority, OPM has codified the rules for probationary employees at 5 C.F.R. part 315, subpart H (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.801-315.806). The rules set the length of the probationary period at a non-extendable one year from the start of employment, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.801(a), 315.802(a), and grant probationary employees some protections against removal, such as notice of a pending removal and limited rights of appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 315.804(a), 315.805, 315.806. The rules do not affirmatively grant probationary employees the right to grieve removals alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU sought to amend its existing collective-bargaining agreement with the IRS to permit probationary employees to grieve removals where "the grievance <span class="Italic">is confined to enforcing the procedures or rights contained in a statute</span>, and any subsequent arbitration decision is controlled solely by the requirements of law and government-wide regulation such that the arbitrator is merely substituting for the federal authority that would hear the employee's challenge." <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 67 F.L.R.A. 24, 24 (2012) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IRS refused to negotiate over NTEU's proposal, arguing that it was outside &#x00A7; 7117's duty to negotiate because it was "contrary to law and regulation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The IRS argued that, based on D.C. Circuit and FLRA precedent, probationary employees may not grieve removals as a matter of law, and that such a procedure would be contrary to the OPM regulations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 24-25.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU appealed to the FLRA, which ruled in favor of the IRS. The FLRA cited nearly three decades of FLRA precedent holding that collective-bargaining proposals violate &#x00A7; 3321 and the OPM regulations to the extent they "grant probationary employees: (1) separation-related procedural protections beyond those required by statute or OPM regulations; or (2) the ability to grieve separation disputes." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 26. Such proposals thus fall outside of &#x00A7; 7117's good-faith-negotiation requirement. Relying upon two decisions by the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273, 270 U.S. App. D.C. 241 (D.C. Cir. 1988), and <span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 228 U.S. App. D.C. 285 (D.C. Cir. 1983), the FLRA reasoned that while probationary employees have some rights to challenge removals in certain administrative and judicial forums, they are authorized to "receive only minimal due process in connection with their separation," which does not include the right to grieve removals. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU appeals the FLRA's decision. We must uphold the decision "unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law." <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 647 F.3d 514, 517 (4th Cir. 2011). NTEU contends that we should not defer to the FLRA's interpretations of the OPM regulations. It argues that the regulations are outside the FLRA's organic statute and regulatory domain, and are thus "beyond the [FLRA's] special area of expertise." Appellant's Br. at 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Shanty Town Assoc. Ltd. P'ship v. EPA</span>, 843 F.2d 782, 790 n.12 (4th Cir. 1988)). The FLRA responds that "[d]ue deference is paid to an FLRA determination of negotiability," Appellee's Br. at 8 (quoting <span class="Italic">NRC v. FLRA</span>, 895 F.2d 152, 154 (4th Cir. 1990)), while the FLRA's interpretations of law outside its organic statute and implementing regulations should be followed "to the extent the reasoning is 'sound,'" <span class="Italic">id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Tex. Lone Star Chapter 100 v. FLRA</span>, 250 F.3d 778, 782, 346 U.S. App. D.C. 105 (D.C. Cir. 2001)). We need not entertain the question of the specific level of deference the FLRA should receive when interpreting the OPM regulations, however, inasmuch as we conclude that the FLRA's interpretation of the relevant law and regulations was correct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU's argument is simple. Because Congress did not exclude probationary employees from the definitions of "employee" and "grievance" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(2), (a)(9), probationary employees are generally covered by the grievance procedure. And because Congress explicitly excluded some disputes from the procedure--such as those over examinations, certifications, or appointments, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7121(c)(4), or removals for national-security reasons, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7121(c)(3); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 7532--but did not explicitly exclude disputes over removals generally, probationary employees should be able to grieve such disputes where the removals are alleged to be in violation of statutory rights or procedures. As we explain below, this reading of the statute runs counter to the whole statutory and regulatory scheme governing probationary employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has provided for a probationary period since it created the modern civil-service system with the 1883 Pendleton Act, 22 Stat. 403, ch. 27 (amended 1978). <span class="Italic">See</span> 22 Stat. 404, ch. 27, &#x00A7; 2(4); <span class="Italic">see also Kato v. Ishihara</span>, 360 F.3d 106, 113 (2d Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 725 n.1, 228 U.S. App. D.C. 285 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Congress's continuing belief in the importance of a probationary period was reflected in the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101-7135, which both preserved the probationary period for new employees and expanded it to cover new appointments to managerial and supervisory positions. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321 (1976) (authorizing [*8] the creation of a "period of probation before an appointment in the competitive service becomes absolute"), <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(a) (1982) (authorizing the creation of a probationary period for both new employees and appointments to managerial and supervisory positions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the term "probationary" implies, employees so designated are on probation and subject to summary dismissal. They are, of course, just as entitled to be free of illegal or discriminatory treatment from their employers as are non-probationary employees, and thus NTEU is correct <span id="page_790"></span>in arguing that its proposal "is not designed to provide any substantive legal protections to probationary employees that do not already exist."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This does not mean, however, that Congress intended for the same <span class="Italic">remedies</span> to be available to probationary and non-probationary employees. <span class="Italic">See NTEU v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>), 848 F.2d 1273, 1276, 270 U.S. App. D.C. 241 (D.C. Cir. 1988). This is reflected in the numerous ways that the law treats probationary and non-probationary employees differently. For example, probationary employees are explicitly excluded from the protections against demotion or removal for unacceptable performance under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303(f)(2). These protections include written notice thirty days in advance of the adverse employment action, representation "by an attorney or other representative," and a final written decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1). Probationary employees are not afforded the full rights that non-probationary employees have to appeal a removal or demotion for unacceptable performance to the MSPB. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 4303(e). Similarly, probationary employees do not possess the protections granted to non-probationary employees against removals for such reasons "as will promote the efficiency of the service." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7513(a); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(i). As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, "The substantial protections that Congress made available only to tenured employees indicate that Congress recognized and approved of the inextricable link between the effective operation of the probationary period and the agency's right to summary termination." <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 709 F.2d at 728.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Numerous other courts have recognized the important distinction between probationary and non-probationary employees and Congress's intention to provide fewer protections to the former. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bante v. MSPB</span>, 966 F.2d 647, 650 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The language of the current statute establishes that Congress clearly intends review of the termination of probationary employees be more limited than that of other employees."); <span class="Italic">Booher v. USPS</span>, 843 F.2d 943, 945 (6th Cir. 1988) ("Congress, in enacting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, did not provide federal remedies for probationary postal workers nor the full panoply of administrative remedies as in the case of non-probationary workers."); <span class="Italic">United States v. Connolly</span>, 716 F.2d 882, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (noting that "Congress could have permitted probationers to challenge removals [in the Court of Federal Claims], but expressly declined to do so"); <span class="Italic">Budnick v. MSPB</span>, 643 F.2d 278, 279 n.2 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (characterizing the "distinction between probationary and tenured employees" as "sharp").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress's intention to grant probationary employees fewer procedural protections against removal is clearly expressed in the legislative history of the CSRA. As the Senate report explains, "The probationary or trial period...is an extension of the examining process to determine an employee's ability to actually perform the duties of the position. It is inappropriate to restrict an agency's authority to separate an employee who does not perform acceptably during this period." S. Rep. 95-969, at 45 (1978). NTEU argues that, while this language might support excluding removals for poor performance from the grievance procedure, "it provides no evidence of a congressional intent to prevent probationers from filing grievances to protest removals in violation of statutorily conferred rights." NTEU's position ignores the real-world result of its proposal: through artful pleading, employees faced with a merit-based dismissal could impose substantial costs on their employers by alleging insubstantial statutory violations to access the grievance procedures. Thus, NTEU's proposal would "substantially thwart Congress's intention to allow summary termination of probationary employees." <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 848 F.2d at 1275.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Office of Personnel Management is the agency charged with implementing Congress's intent. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301; <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 709 F.2d at 725 n.3. Pursuant to its statutory authority to administer the competitive service, OPM has issued regulations regarding the probationary period. OPM's regulations faithfully reflect Congress's intention for the probationary program. Granting probationary and non-probationary employees different procedural protections is necessary to accomplish the probationary period's purpose, which the regulations describe: "to determine the fitness of the employee and...terminate his services during this period if he fails to demonstrate fully his qualifications for continued employment." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.803(a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to balance the rights of probationary employees against unlawful removals with the government's need for flexibility and discretion in removing them, OPM has explicitly granted probationary employees a number of protections. They are entitled to written notification and explanation of a dismissal for unsatisfactory performance or conduct, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.804(a), as well as notice of a proposed removal, opportunity for reply, and notice and explanation for the removal in cases where the removal is based in whole or in part on conditions arising before the probationer's employment, <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.805. Probationary employees also have limited rights of appeal to the MSPB: they may challenge removals based on partisan political reasons or marital status; improper procedures; or other forms of discrimination, if such discrimination is accompanied by terminations based on partisan politics, marital status, or improper procedure. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 315.806.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two features stand out from this review of OPM regulations regarding probationary employees.&#x2003;First, the regulations are extensive, encompassing a wide range of disputes and remedial procedures. They give probationary employees both fair notice of removal and the right to appeal those removals in certain circumstances. Second, they sharply limit probationary employees' rights to challenge removals. In doing so, they preserve a meaningful distinction between probationary and non-probationary employees in accordance with the language and purpose of the statutory scheme. The structure of the OPM regulations indicates that any additional protections not explicitly provided for--such as those in NTEU's proposal--would conflict with the regulations and thus be outside the IRS's bargaining obligations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU correctly observes that probationary employees have remedial options beyond those granted by OPM.&#x2003;Indeed, in some contexts their avenues for relief are much the same as those afforded non-federal employees. They may file charges of unfair labor practices with the FLRA's general counsel, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7118(a)(1), and may file complaints of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and ultimately in federal court, <span class="Italic">see</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(c); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.407. The availability of these remedies, however, does not imply the permissibility of other remedies, among which is NTEU's proposed expansion of the grievance procedure.[*] In sum, Congress has clearly granted certain remedies to all employees, including probationary ones. By contrast, Congress refrained from granting probationary employees the right to grieve removals in violation of statutory rights or procedures, thereby giving OPM, which prescribes the rules for the competitive service, the discretion whether or not to grant such a right. If we were to step in and declare proposals to grieve such allegations negotiable, when neither Congress nor OPM has done so, we would risk unraveling what, by any measure, is a meticulously crafted statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[*] NTEU cites the Supreme Court's recognition of a "liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements" to support its position. Appellant's Br. at 24 (quoting <span class="Italic">Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp</span>., 500 U.S. 20, 25, 111 S. Ct. 1647, 114 L. Ed. 2d 26 (1991)); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. at 24-25 (citing pro-arbitration language in <span class="Italic">14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett</span>, 556 U.S. 247, 129 S. Ct. 1456, 173 L. Ed. 2d 398 (2009)). But that general principle, articulated in a case between private parties under a different statute and having nothing to do with the unique employment status of federal probationary employees, can hardly require a federal agency to negotiate over a proposal that, as here, would clearly violate law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We are not the first court to arrive at this outcome.&#x2003;The District of Columbia Circuit addressed this issue in a pair of cases more than twenty-five years ago. It came to the same result we arrive at today, and we find no reason to quarrel with or depart from its conclusions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The D.C. Circuit first addressed the availability of grievance procedures for probationary employees challenging removals in <span class="Italic">INS v. FLRA</span>, 709 F.2d 724, 228 U.S. App. D.C. 285 (D.C. Cir. 1983). In that case, the INS labor union proposed that probationary employees be able to grieve all removals on the basis of whether they were "reasonable and not arbitrary and capricious." <span class="Italic">INS</span>, 709 F.2d at 726 (internal quotation marks omitted). The FLRA had ruled that permitting probationary employees to grieve terminations would not violate the statutory scheme, and thus that INS was required to negotiate over the proposal. In reversing the FLRA, the D.C. Circuit emphasized Congress's intent to provide probationary employees with fewer protections against removal and the incompatibility of the union's proposal with that goal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 728-29. As have we, it quoted from the Senate report in concluding that Congress did not intend to impede the ability of managers to summarily dismiss probationary employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 727-28.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The court revisited the issue five years later, in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span> (<span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>), 848 F.2d 1273, 270 U.S. App. D.C. 241 (D.C. Cir 1988). In that case, NTEU had proposed a provision, very similar to the one at issue here, allowing probationary employees to grieve removals that were "the product of unlawful discrimination." <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span>, 848 F.2d at 1274 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). The D.C. Circuit again rejected the proposed expansion of probationary employees' grievance rights. It held, as it had in <span class="Italic">INS</span>, that Congress's failure to exclude probationary employees from the definitions of "employee" and "grievance" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a) did not imply that probationary employees could grieve removals alleged to be discriminatory. Instead, it read the relevant sections against the background of "Congress's expressed intent for the probationary period," which included "agencies' right to fire probationers with minimal procedural obstacles." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1276.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While accepting <span class="Italic">INS</span>, NTEU argues that <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span> was wrongly decided. It bases its criticism of <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span> in large part on the claim that the <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span> court failed to consider the Senate report language that underlay the <span class="Italic">INS</span> decision. NTEU argues that this language was limited to removals for poor performance rather than those alleged to be in violation of <span id="page_791"></span>statutory rights or procedures. But, as we have already explained, <span class="Italic">see ante</span> at 10, this argument ignores the reality that permitting probationary employees to grieve removals based on a mere allegation of violation of statutory rights or procedures would eviscerate the entire purpose of the probationary program.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree fully with the approach and outcome of the aforementioned opinions, as have several of our sister circuits. <span class="Italic">See Yates v. Dep't of the Air Force</span>, 115 F. App'x 57, 58-59 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">INS</span> approvingly); <span class="Italic">HHS v. FLRA</span>, 858 F.2d 1278, 1284-85 (7th Cir. 1988) (citing <span class="Italic">INS</span> and <span class="Italic">NTEU II</span> approvingly). But even were our judgment more ambivalent, there would be costs in this area to holding differently and creating a circuit split. To give probationary employees different procedural rights depending on the circuit in which they live or work would create confusion and inequity in the federal civil service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7123(a) (permitting appeals of FLRA orders in the circuit "in which the person resides or transacts business"). Nothing in law commands such disregard of practicality, and the practical drawbacks of petitioner's position are substantial.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the issue of administrative precedent counsels in favor of upholding the FLRA. NTEU would have us upset nearly thirty years of FLRA decisions holding that probationary employees are not permitted under law or regulation to grieve removals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NFFE, Local 29</span>, 20 F.L.R.A. 788, 790 (1985); <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 14 F.L.R.A. 164, 164-65 (1984). The FLRA has reasserted this holding numerous times since those early decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NTEU Chapter 103</span>, 66 F.L.R.A. 416, 418 (2011); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 45 F.L.R.A. 696, 718 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The uniform course of court and agency decisions has made it clear for decades that probationary employees cannot grieve separation disputes, including those alleging violations of statutory rights or procedures. Both Congress and OPM understand this and have taken no action over these many years to change this reality. There is value in having settled practice remain settled practice, especially when the bodies that have every right to change it have made no move to do so.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal allowing a grievance over the discriminatory termination of a probationer. <span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv.</span>, 25 FLRA 1067, 1076-78 (1987). <span class="Italic">Food and Nutrition Serv.</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was affirmed on appeal. <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 848 F.2d 1273, 1275 (D.C. Cir. 1988), determined that to allow a discharged probationer to use an allegation of discrimination as a means of access to the grievance procedure, with the concomitant power of the arbitrator to award reinstatement, would substantially thwart Congress's intention to allow summary termination of probationary employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bremerton Metal Trades Council and Naval Supply Ctr. Puget Sound</span>, 32 FLRA 643, 661-62 (1988) (disapproving negotiability of proposals extending negotiated grievance procedure to disputes over procedural propriety of probationary terminations); <span class="Italic">USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv. and NTEU</span>, 28 FLRA 580, 582-83 (1987) (provisions nonnegotiable extending grievance procedure to allegedly discriminatory termination of probationer); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1409 and Army Adjutant Gen. Publications Ctr.</span>, 27 FLRA 869, 870 (1987) (proposal nonnegotiable that permitted grievance procedure to be extended to allegations of discriminatory dismissals of probationers).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU and USDA, Food and Nutrition Serv., Mountain Plains Region</span>, 30 FLRA 502, 503-04 (1987), barred negotiation of a provision requiring (as to competitive service probationers) that, after considering the employee's response to an advance notice of separation, the employer advise the affected employee in writing whether the decision to terminate had changed:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an agency terminates a probationary employee based on deficiencies in performance or conduct after entrance on duty, OPM regulations require only that the agency notify the employee, in writing, of the reasons for the termination and the effective date of the action. Although the notice must include the agency's conclusions on the inadequacies of the employee's performance or conduct, the notice need not contain complete and specific reasons. The employee has no right to reply. FPM chapter 315, subchapter 8-4a.(3). The OPM regulations further provide that although it is not required, it is good personnel practice to furnish the probationer with enough factual information to make the agency's basis for the action clear. The regulations suggest that one means of accomplishing this result is to have an appropriate agency official discuss the basis for the agency's action with the employee. FPM chapter 315, subchapter 8-4a.(4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The undisputed portion of section 4 of the proposal allows a probationer to request a discussion regarding his/her termination and to have union representation if a discussion is held. The last sentence, which is in dispute, would require the Agency, under certain circumstances, to reconsider its decision to terminate the probationer and to inform the probationer, in writing, of the results of that reconsideration. That is, the Agency would have to determine whether the decision to terminate has changed as a result of the meeting in order to comply with the requirements of the provision. Requiring the Agency to reconsider its decision is a procedural protection which is beyond those provided in the OPM regulations. We find that the disputed proposal is inconsistent with law and regulation because it would create, through collective bargaining, a procedural protection for probationary employees. It is, therefore, not within the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even modest protections limiting termination of probationers are beyond the scope of negotiations, e.g., a proposal for five days' advance notice of termination. <span class="Italic">AFGE Council of Marine Corps Locals and Dept. of Navy, Marine Corps</span>, 35 FLRA 1023, 1026 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv.</span>, 46 FLRA 696, 767 (1992) (advance notice and "informal meeting" requirements of Provision 34 nonnegotiable). FLRA's views concerning the arbitrability of probationary dismissals led to a determination of nonnegotiability for a set of proposals defining the conditions of retention of probationers and requiring that probationers be informed of their performance deficiencies in sufficient time for them to make improvement. Also nonnegotiable was a provision requiring that the SF-50 form documenting the separation of a probationer state all the reasons for separation. The proposal concerning the annotation of the SF-50 was contrary to the late FPM Supp. 296-33, prohibiting agencies from placing reasons on the SF-50 in agency-initiated separations involving employees serving appointments that do not afford them appeal rights. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2302 and Dept. of Army, Army Armor Ctr., Ft.

Cir. 1983), the Authority has stated that "OPM [Office of Personnel Management] is 'to provide whatever procedural protections are necessary for probationary employees.'" <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 15 FLRA at 715. In that decision, the Authority also stated that "in enacting the Statute, <span class="Italic">Congress did not intend that procedural protections for probationary employees be established through collective bargaining under the Statute</span>."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The provision establishes...four steps as prerequisites to termination. By doing so, it establishes procedural protections beyond those provided in the FPM....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that Provision 7 is inconsistent with law and regulation because it would create, through collective bargaining, procedural protections for probationary employees.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 38 FLRA 1366, 1370-73 (1991) (rejecting as nonnegotiable provisions (Proposal 3) establishing requirements for advance notice of termination for probationers, meetings or written statements concerning the termination, and requirements that employer consider employees' responsive statements).</p>
<p class="noindent">The probationer briefly enjoyed the protection of a negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE and Dept. of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376, 379 (1980), determined that arbitrators could review the dismissal of probationers. [Refer to Chapter 9, "Dismissals of Probationers, Term or Temporary Employees; Students," for the decision.] FLRA reaffirmed that the Reform Act did not preclude grievances or arbitration of disputes concerning the termination of probationers in <span class="Italic">Corps of Eng'rs, Kansas City Dist. and NFFE Local 29</span>, 8 FLRA 86, 88 (1982). Under the authority of <span class="Italic">Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals, AFGE and Dept. of Labor</span>, 4 FLRA 376 (1980), FLRA decided once again in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l INS Council and DOJ, INS</span>, 8 FLRA 347, 366-76 (1982), that a union could negotiate for a grievance procedure extending to termination of probationers. The clause at issue was that "termination of probationary employees shall be grievable on the basis of whether the Service's actions were reasonable and not arbitrary and capricious, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement." FLRA restated its position that termination of probationers is a matter both grievable and arbitrable under a contractual "just cause" clause in <span class="Italic">VA Hosp. and AFGE Local 2281</span>, 9 FLRA 1075, 1076 (1982).</p>
