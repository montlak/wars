<section>
<h4 class="h4" id="sec3-10"><span class="space">4.</span> Control by Judge</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The remainder of this chapter discusses decisions defining the appellant's right to a hearing under Board regulations. Most of the regulations vest considerable discretion in the AJ to conduct prehearing and hearing procedures. What is implied in the regulations is made explicit in Board cases: "[A] presiding official, by virtue of 5 CFR 1201.41, is given wide discretion to control the proceedings before him[.] " <span class="Italic">West v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 11 MSPR 28, 30 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's regulations summarize the AJ's authority, 5 CFR 1201.41 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Exercise of authority</span>. Judges may exercise authority as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section on their own motion or on the motion of a party, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Authority</span>. Judges will conduct fair and impartial hearings and will issue timely and clear decisions based on statutes and legal precedents. They will have all powers necessary to that end unless those powers are otherwise limited by law. Judges' powers include, but are not limited to, the authority to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Administer oaths and affirmations;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Issue subpoenas under &#x00A7; 1201.81 of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Rule on offers of proof and receive relevant evidence;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Rule on discovery motions under &#x00A7; 1201.73 of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;After notice to the parties, order a hearing on his or her own initiative if the judge determines that a hearing is necessary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;To resolve an important issue of credibility;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;To ensure that the record on significant issues is fully developed; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(iii)&#x2003;To otherwise ensure a fair and just adjudication of the case;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;Convene a hearing as appropriate, regulate the course of the hearing, maintain decorum, and exclude any disruptive persons from the hearing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(7)&#x2003;Exclude any person from all or any part of the proceeding before him or her as provided under &#x00A7; 1201.31(d) of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(8)&#x2003;Rule on all motions, witness and exhibit lists, and proposed findings;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(9)&#x2003;Require the parties to file memoranda of law and to present oral argument with respect to any question of law;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(10)&#x2003;Order the production of evidence and the appearance of witnesses whose testimony would be relevant, material, and nonrepetitious;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(11)&#x2003;Impose sanctions as provided under &#x00A7; 1201.43 of this part;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(12)&#x2003;Hold prehearing conferences for the settlement and simplification of issues;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(13)&#x2003;Require that all persons who can be identified from the record as being clearly and directly affected by a pending retirement-related case be notified of the appeal and of their right to request intervention so that their interests can be considered in the adjudication;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(14)&#x2003;Issue any order that may be necessary to protect a witness or other individual from harassment and provide for enforcement of such order in accordance with subpart F;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(15)&#x2003;Issue initial decisions; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(16)&#x2003;Determine, in decisions in which the appellant is the prevailing party, whether the granting of interim relief is appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Settlement</span>--(1) <span class="Italic">Settlement discussion</span>. The judge may initiate attempts to settle the appeal informally at any time. The parties may agree to waive the prohibitions against <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications during settlement discussions, and they may agree to any limits on the waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Agreement</span>. If the parties agree to settle their dispute, the settlement agreement is the final and binding resolution of the appeal, and the judge will dismiss the appeal with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;If the parties offer the agreement for inclusion in the record, and if the judge approves the agreement, it will be made a part of the record, and the Board will retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;If the agreement is not entered into the record, the Board will not retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Additional guidance for AJs concerning conduct of hearings is in Chapter 10 of the <span class="Italic">Judges' Handbook</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ROLE AND CONDUCT OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Responsibility of Administrative Judge</span>. The AJ is responsible for conducting a fair and impartial hearing and taking all necessary action to ensure adequate development of the record and to avoid delay. An AJ's specific powers and authority are set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Demeanor of Administrative Judge</span>. Hearings are to be conducted in a dignified and orderly manner. The Federal Circuit will require a new hearing, held by a different AJ, only where the original AJ's conduct violated a party's right to due process, and a due process violation will be found only where the standard set by the Supreme Court has been violated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bieber v. Department of the Army</span>, 287 F.3d 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2002). That standard, stated in <span class="Italic">Liteky v. United States</span>, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994), is that "opinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make <span id="Page_1310"></span>fair judgement impossible." Needless to say, however, the Board expects and requires its AJs to exhibit much more exemplary judicial conduct than is necessary simply to defeat a motion for recusal or a finding of bias. Rather, the behavior of the AJ must be characterized by fairness, impartiality, courtesy, decisiveness, and patience. That the <span class="Italic">Liteky</span> standard is not met does not prevent the Board from reassigning a case when the AJ conducted himself or herself inappropriately or was seen to favor one party or the other so that the appearance of partiality would color the proceedings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 441, 443 &#x00B6; 7 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Special Circumstances</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1) <span class="Italic">Assistance for Disabled; Discrimination Complaints</span>. If the appellant, a witness, or a representative is disabled, the AJ must follow 5 C.F.R. part 1207, Enforcement of Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Handicap in Programs or Activities Conducted by the Merit Systems Protection Board, requiring that reasonable accommodations be made to ensure that disabled individuals have meaningful access to the Board's programs and activities. Under section 1207.170 (b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(a)&#x2003;When a party believes he or she has been subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in the AJ's adjudication of the case, the party may raise the allegation in a pleading filed with the AJ and served on all other parties in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(b)&#x2003;An allegation of discrimination in the adjudication of a Board case must be raised within 10 days of the alleged act of discrimination or within 10 days from the date the complainant should reasonably have known of the alleged discrimination. If the complainant does not submit a complaint within that time period, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(c)&#x2003;The AJ to whom the case is assigned shall decide the merits of any timely allegation that is raised at this stage of adjudication, and shall make findings and conclusions regarding the allegation either in an interim order or in the initial decision, recommended decision, or recommendation. Any request for reconsideration of the AJ's decision on the disability discrimination claim must be filed under the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.114 and 1201.115.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">This procedure keeps the discrimination complaint and the appeal proceeding on the same track, so that they will be presented to the Board for decision at the same time. Thus, while no standards have been set for either the complaint or the decision on it, the prerequisites for the filing of a formal complaint, such as counseling, are not required. Nor would the decision seem to require more formality than would be associated with a proper ruling on a motion--a holding supported by the AJ's reasoning for it, sufficient for the Board to review on PFR. As required by the regulation, too, if the complaint is not timely submitted, it should be dismissed on that basis unless the ap[p]ellant shows good cause for the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2) <span class="Italic">Foreign Languages</span>. The Board's policy on requests for language interpreters when parties or witnesses to a proceeding do not speak English has not been set forth in a finalized document, but the draft Limited English Proficiency accessibility plan promulgated by the EEO Office, pursuant to Department of Justice policy guidance, discusses such matters. If issues arise that cannot be handled efficiently in accordance with this paragraph, the RD or CAJ should contact ORO or the Board's EEO Office directly for assistance. The AJ may direct the parties to select a qualified interpreter acceptable to both, or the AJ may select an interpreter from a list of qualified interpreters compiled by the parties or maintained by the U.S. District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1827 (c)(1). However, the AJ must ensure that the record includes sufficient evidence to establish that the interpreter is qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education, and should administer an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(3) <span class="Italic">Appellant's Right to Abandon or Cancel Hearing</span>. An appellant may withdraw his or her request for a hearing at any time. If this occurs, the agency has no right to insist on a hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Callahan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 748 F.2d 1556, 1559 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Kirkpatrick v. Department of the Interior,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 316, 318 (1991); <span class="Italic">Dodd v. Department of the Interior,</span> 48 M.S.P.R. 582, 584 (1991). The parties, however, must be given the opportunity to supplement the record with evidence and argument before the ID is issued, and the appellant should be so informed before the withdrawal is effected. <span class="Italic">See Schucker v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 401 F.3d 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2005), holding that the Board has a longstanding policy to allow parties an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence, and that because it did not allow for rebuttal evidence in this case, and did not explain its change in policy, it acted arbitrarily when earlier in the appeal the agency had presented "only superficial arguments." The court held in that circumstance that the appellant was not required to have submitted her specific and detailed rebuttal evidence prior to the agency's submission of its more specific evidence. As noted earlier, despite 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b)(5), an AJ also does not have a right to order a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(4) <span class="Italic">Agency Request for Hearing</span>. The agency has no statutory right to a hearing, and the Board's regulations do not provide for consideration of an agency's request for a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Thomas v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 51 M.S.P.R. 218, 220 (1991); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.24(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(5) <span class="Italic">Intervenors</span>. Intervenors, who may participate only as to issues affecting them, do not have an independent right to a hearing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.34(d)(1). They retain the other rights of a party, however.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PRELIMINARY CONFERENCE</span>. The AJ may wish to convene a brief preliminary conference immediately preceding the hearing, attended only by the parties and their representatives, to ensure the orderly and expeditious progress of the hearing. When the hearing begins, the AJ must summarize briefly what occurred at the preliminary conference, and ask both parties to state any objections concerning the accuracy of the summary. The summary made of such prehearing rulings must comport with the requirements for rulings made at earlier telephonic (or other) conferences, to assure a complete documented record. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 9, section 5 of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">PUBLIC HEARINGS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">In general</span>. The AJ has wide discretion to conduct the hearing as appropriate. The public's right to know must be balanced against the appellant's right to privacy. The public and the media may be excluded from the hearing when necessary to protect the appellant's privacy or for other reasons, e.g., disclosure of trade secrets or national security information. The record of the hearing can be obtained by filing a FOIA request. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.53 and chapter 17, section 1c of this Handbook.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sensitive Security Information (SSI)</span>. SSI is sensitive but unclassified information controlled by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), obtained or developed in the conduct of security activities, including research and development, the disclosure of which the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has determined would be detrimental to the security of transportation. Contrary to the general rule, absent good cause shown, all hearings in which SSI may be disclosed must be closed to the public. Only "covered persons" under 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.7 may have access. Federal employees, including employees of the OSC and MSPB, are covered persons. 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1520.11(b)(1). Current and former TSA employees and their designated representatives are covered persons under 49 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1520.7(k)-(j) and 1520.11(a)(5). In addition, covered persons include court reporters who are under contract to a covered person and who sign a DHS Non-Disclosure Agreement provided by the agency representative. Paralegals and other support staff assisting appellant's representative are not covered persons and may not be given access to SSI. At any MSPB hearing held by video conference or telephone, the AJ shall require each participant to certify that he or she is in a location providing privacy, i.e., away from the public when there is no risk of being overheard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">E-filing may not be used to file a pleading that contains SSI (49 C.F.R. parts 15 &#x0026; 1520) or classified information (32 C.F.R. part 2001). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.14(c)(4)-(5).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SIZE AND ACCESS TO THE HEARING ROOM</span>. If the AJ is aware of substantial public interest in a particular case, he or she should make arrangements for a hearing room which will accommodate a reasonable number of persons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">6.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">TELEPHONIC OR VIDEO-CONFERENCE HEARINGS</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Hearing method</span>. Years ago, the Board established a rule was that an appellant had a fundamental right to an in-person hearing on the merits if there was a genuine dispute as to any material fact, and when the appellant had such a right, the AJ had no authority to order a telephonic hearing over the appellant's objection. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., McGrath v. Department of Defense</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 112, 115-17 (1994); <span id="Page_1311"></span><span class="Italic">Evono v. Department of Justice</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 541, 545 (1996). The same rule was later applied to hearings held by video conference. Subsequently, relying in part on Rule 43(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Board held that when an appellant in an appeal requiring the AJ to make credibility determinations requested an in-person hearing, that request could not be denied in the absence of a showing of good cause. <span class="Italic">Crickard v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 625 (2002). However, <span class="Italic">Crickard</span> and similar cases were overruled in <span class="Italic">Koehler v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 82 (2005). There, the Board held that while 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1) gives appellants before the Board "the right...to a hearing for which a transcript will be kept," nonetheless "there is no statutory mandate for an unlimited entitlement to an in-person hearing." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. The Board stated as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">We therefore hold today that, in conjunction with the broad discretion afforded them to control proceedings at which they officiate, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41(b), AJs may hold video conference hearings in any case, regardless of whether the appellant objects. [Footnote omitted.] To the extent that Crickard and other such cases hold that, in an appeal where the AJ is required to make credibility determinations, he may not convene a video conference hearing over the appellant's objection in the absence of a showing of good cause, those cases are hereby overruled. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In light of <span class="Italic">Koehler</span>, video hearings are allowed in all circumstances. Of course, it remains in the discretion of the AJ, subject to the approval of the CAJ, to determine whether the circumstances surrounding any given case are such that holding an in-person hearing would be preferable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As to telephone hearings, there is no new law since <span class="Italic">Koehler</span>, which stated that "we need not, nor do we, extend this holding to telephone hearings." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, the rule set by <span class="Italic">McGrath</span> and <span class="Italic">Evono</span> remains in effect, so only when material facts are not in dispute and the sole purpose of the hearing is to allow the parties to make oral arguments, do telephone hearings satisfy an appellant's entitlement. The appeals in which such a presentation can be held in lieu of a full hearing tend to be retirement appeals, which are not brought before the Board under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. <span class="Italic">See Carew v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 878 F.2d 366, 367-68 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Indeed, even when there is no dispute of material facts and it appears that the appellant fails to meet the legal requirements for the benefit sought, the right to a hearing remains, although a telephone hearing may be all that is required. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gowan-Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In <span class="Italic">Robertson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 16 (2009), the Board held that "[w]here an administrative judge improperly holds a telephonic hearing, the Board will undertake a careful review of the record to determine whether the error had a potential adverse effect on the appellant's substantive rights." Since the appellant testified contrary to the testimony of the witness heard by phone, but the AJ relied on the witnesses' testimony, which she found credible, the Board found that the error in accepting testimony over the telephone regarding disputed factual matters did have a potential adverse effect on the appellant's substantive rights. Thus, any testimony where credibility may be at stake continues to require an in-person presentation. That is true even when, as in <span class="Italic">Robertson</span>, most witnesses were heard live, and just two were telephonic.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Recording</span>. If a telephone hearing is appropriate, in most instances the AJ should record the hearing using the phone's Record-a-Call feature, which may eliminate the need for a reporter. ShoreTel has two features that allow you to record calls, 1) ShoreTel SA100 Web Conference, which is the preferred method, and 2) ShoreTel Communicator--Record. The first method allows for a recording as long as 8 hours when used in a "Reservation-less" conference, while a "Scheduled" conference allows you to set a specific date, time and duration for the conference. The Communicator method is to be used to record only those conferences that will last less than 30 minutes, not hearings. Training and assistance in these methods is available through IRM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As noted in section 18.b of this chapter, when the hearing is recorded by telephone, then transferred to a CD, to create an index, it will be necessary to keep track of the amount of time elapsed between witnesses so that the index can indicate the approximate point, by time since the start of the hearing, at which each witness's testimony begins. This task may be done by the AJ or by the support staff who transfers the hearing to the CD and certifies the recording as audible and accurate. Video conference hearings, too, are recorded on CD or other recording medium by a court reporter, who should usually be present with the AJ. The AJ also may record the hearing without the assistance of a court reporter when the hearing will be short and the AJ will be able to concentrate on the proceedings even without a reporter. The AJ must, however, be certain that any recording equipment is in good working order and properly set up to assure good sound quality; thus, testing the equipment a day in advance is recommended.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">9.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">ORDER OF BUSINESS</span>. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.58.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Opening Statements</span>. Given adequate prehearing processing, an AJ should generally not permit oral opening statements at the hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Case-in-Chief</span>. The party having the burden of proof usually presents its case first. The other party then presents its case, including any affirmative defenses. When the agency has the burden of proof, the AJ may require it to address the appellant's affirmative defenses, if any, during the agency's case-in-chief, with the possibility of also making a rebuttal presentation, if appropriate. While in most cases this means the agency presents its case first, in an IRA, VEOA, or USERRA appeal, it is the appellant who has the burden of proof and presents his or her case first.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If an intervenor is participating in the hearing, the intervenor's presentation should immediately follow the presentation of the party with whom the intervenor's interests are allied. If the intervenor is not allied with either party, the AJ must determine if the intervenor should go first so that the parties will have the opportunity to address the intervenor's position in their presentations, or go last so that the intervenor can consider the evidence presented by other parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Rebuttal and Surrebuttal</span>. The AJ may permit the party with the burden of proof to present rebuttal evidence at the conclusion of the opposing party's case, followed by the opposing party's surrebuttal, if any.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Closing Statements</span>. Because closing statements may provide a strong clue to the parties' most significant interests in the case, AJs have the discretion to allow oral or written closing statements. <span class="Italic">See also</span> section 15(a) of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">10.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">DISPOSITION OF MOTIONS AND OBJECTIONS</span>. Motions made during the course of a hearing may be oral or written. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.55. All other parties are given an opportunity to object to a motion on the record. The AJ must promptly rule on the motion and may reverse a ruling, if appropriate, at a later time. Motions and objections should generally not be taken under advisement. If a motion is made, discussed, or ruled upon when the parties have gone off the record, the AJ must assure that the tape or transcript properly documents any such off the record discussions or rulings. <span class="Italic">See</span> chapter 9, section 5, above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board permits its AJs wide discretion in the conduct of hearing and prehearing procedures. This control is left undisturbed when the Board declines to set aside results through PFRs of parties who complain of procedural unfairness after receiving unfavorable initial decisions. The Board uses three principal approaches in its decisions declining to overturn results on procedural grounds: the failure to raise an objection below to the AJ's conduct or rulings; general references to the broad discretion of AJs run hearings; the harmful error rule. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Flanagan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 430, 433-35 (1991); <span class="Italic">Rivezzo v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 447, 447 n.* (1984) (no prejudice in an arguably short notice of hearing date); <span class="Italic">Karapinka v. Department of Energy</span>, 6 MSPR 124, 127, 6 MSPB 114 (1981) (Board follows Fed. R. Civ. P. 61 by disregarding error or defect in proceedings not affecting the parties' substantial rights); <span class="Italic">Gross v. Dept. of Army</span>, 14 MSPR 252, 254 (1982) (same); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hill v. DHHS</span>, 28 MSPR 91, 92-93 (1985) (failure to object to testimony during the hearing precludes a party from raising an objection to the resulting evidence in a PFR).</p>
