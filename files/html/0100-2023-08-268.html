<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-263"><span class="space">2.</span> Absence of Retention; Benefits Declined</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If jobs are reclassified and downgraded without saved pay or saved grade, the affected employees, if otherwise eligible to pursue the appeals, are the objects of adverse actions in the form of reductions in grade, with Board appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Lomartere v. DOD</span>, 4 MSPR 30, 32, 4 MSPB 123 (1980); <span class="Italic">see Pierce v. DOD</span>, 18 MSPR 601, 602-03 (1984) (continuing litigation over the pay rate of school psychologists); <span class="Italic">Cramton v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 10 MSPR 506, 508 (1982) (appeal could be taken from what appeared to be a classification downgrading with a fixed period of grade and pay retention); <span class="Italic">Chicarell v. DOD</span>, 6 MSPR 506, 510 (1981) (setting aside DODDS demotions of guidance counselors for failure to meet statutory procedures concerning the establishment of compensation rates); <span class="Italic">Lane v. USDA</span>, 4 MSPR 379, 382 (1980) ("While the reclassification of appellant's position (that is, the propriety of his present grade level and job classification series) is properly appealable to OPM under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5112(b), the reduction of his grade and pay constituted an adverse action taken for cause, which is appealable to the Board.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's jurisdiction in those appeals arises under 5 USC 7512(4) and 5 USC 7513(d) unless there is grade and pay retention under 5 USC 5362. An adverse action may occur under those circumstances if the employee's job does not qualify for grade and pay retention because it was not classified at the higher (pre-downgrade) level for at least a year. <span class="Italic">See Gibson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 20 MSPR 274, 276 (1984). Under <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, as to the merits of the case, the propriety of the grade and job classification assigned to a position is within OPM's purview. It is improper for the AJ to decide the proper grade. The AJ can decide only whether the agency showed that the reclassification complied with the law. The action followed the law if the agency gave the employee proper notice of the action and took the action according to OPM classification standards<span class="Italic">. See Segal v. Coast Guard</span>, 21 MSPR 705, 706 (1984) (sustaining a classification downgrading; the Board traced classification review efforts by OPM and the agency and noted that the agency followed OPM rules setting pay for individuals not receiving pay retention).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional preclusion is based on saved pay and limited grade retention. If only pay is saved, but grade is cut, the Board has jurisdiction over a demotion, assuming that the demotion is not voluntary, <span class="Italic">Malan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 55 MSPR 283, 290-91 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee has a right of appeal to the Board from a reduction in pay. 5 USC 7512(4), 7513(d). "Pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 USC 7511(a)(4). As an Aircraft Engine Repairer in the Wage Grade (WG) Schedule, the appellant's rate of basic pay was $13.31 per hour, which is equivalent to an annual salary of $27,778. 5 CFR 532.203. The rate of basic pay for the GS-5 position to which the appellant was transferred ranges only from $16,305 to $21,201.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, where an employee has been afforded retained grade and pay as a result of either a reassignment or a demotion, he has not been the subject of an adverse action within the Board's jurisdiction. The line of cases cited by the administrative judge supports only a narrower proposition, however: That employees whose positions are reclassified to a lower grade and who are eligible for and receive the grade and pay retention benefits of 5 USC 5362 and 5363 are precluded from bringing an adverse action appeal to the Board from either the reclassification of the position or the reduction in grade and/or pay. <span class="Italic">See e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Bosco v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 6 MSPR 471, 473-74 (1981); <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 484, 490 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Atwell v. MSPB</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). The instant case is distinguishable from these authorities in two respects. First, the appellant's reduction in pay did not result from a reclassification. Second, he received only pay retention benefits, without grade retention. Although OPM's regulations deny appeal rights where an agency action entitles an employee to grade retention rights,<span class="Italic"> see</span> 5 CFR 752.401(b)(8), no such exclusion applies to an agency action that entitles an employee to pay retention rights only.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, notwithstanding an agency's grant of pay retention benefits, placing a Wage Grade employee into a General Schedule position having a lower rate of basic pay is a demotion because, although an employee may initially preserve the same pay level under pay retention, that pay level would subsequently be reduced pursuant to 5 USC 5363. <span class="Italic">Butler v. OPM</span>, 29 MSPR 598, 600,<span class="Italic"> reconsideration denied</span>, 31 MSPR 7 (1986). We therefore conclude that the appellant's placement in the Supply Clerk position entailed a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Goldberg v. Dept. of Transp.,</span> 97 MSPR 441, 444-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2004), also noted the jurisdictional import of saved pay without saved grade benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Board case law, an appellant who is transferred from a position under one pay system to a position with a lower rate of basic pay under a different pay system and given only retained pay without retained grade has suffered a reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">See Malan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 283, 290-91 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Malan</span>, the appellant was transferred from a Wage Grade position to a lower-paying General Schedule position with retained pay. The Board found that Malan's reassignment constituted a reduction in pay because, although he would initially preserve the same pay level under pay retention, that pay level would subsequently be reduced pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5363. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Board found that, since the appellant was not afforded retained grade under 5 C.F.R. part 536, he was not prohibited under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(8) from appealing his reduction in pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 290.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant has alleged that he was transferred from his Air Traffic Controller position in the AT pay system to a lower-paying Support Specialist position in the FV pay system with retained pay but without retained grade. While the FAA personnel management system is not subject to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5363 or 5 C.F.R. part 536 (the provisions on which the Board relied to find that the appellant in <span class="Italic">Malan</span> suffered an appealable reduction in pay), <span class="Italic">see</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 40122(g)(2) (with certain enumerated exceptions, the provisions of title 5 do not apply to the FAA personnel management system), the SF-50 documenting the appellant's reassignment states that the agency granted the appellant pay retention under the Core Compensation Plan, paragraph Comp-2.13C. A review of the FAA's Human Resource Policy Manual indicates that pay retention under the Core Compensation plan terminates under the same conditions as pay retention under part 536. <span class="Italic">Human Resource Policy Manual: Pay Retention in the Core Compensation Plan</span>, Comp-2.13C, <span class="Italic">at</span> <a href="http://www.faa.gov/ahr/policy/hrpm/comp/comp-2-13c.cfm">http://www.faa.gov/ahr/policy/hrpm/comp/comp-2-13c.cfm</a>. For the purpose of establishing jurisdiction, the Board will consider the FAA's internal policy regarding pay retention as it mirrors the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations under 5 C.F.R. part 536 and therefore makes the relevant facts in the instant appeal identical to the relevant facts in <span class="Italic">Malan</span>. <span class="Italic">Malan</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 290-91; <span class="Italic">Campbell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 273, 279 (1997) (an agency is required to act in accordance with policies it adopts for itself, and the Board will enforce employee rights derived from such rules, regulations, and collective bargaining agreements); <span class="Italic">cf. Broderick v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 254, 260 (1992) (the Board found no jurisdiction after consideration of internal agency procedures that granted grade and pay retention in a way identical to chapter 53, reasoning that the employee's appeal rights were no greater than an employee who received grade and pay retention under that chapter). Although the appellant did not provide additional information concerning the jurisdictional issue in response to the acknowledgment order, we find that the allegations included with his initial appeal were sufficient to establish a non-frivolous allegation that the appellant was subjected to a reduction in pay in accordance with the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Malan</span>. <span class="Italic">See Applewhite v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 300, 305 (2003) (whether allegations of jurisdiction are 'non-frivolous' is determined by the written record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the combination of grade and pay retention as a means to defeat Board jurisdiction was described in an appeal resulting from the reclassification of a position, <span class="Italic">Bobie v. Dept. of Army</span>, 105 MSPR 592, 595 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10, 2007 MSPB 128 (2007), resolving that the Board's jurisdiction extended to a reclassification to a lower grade if the employee was not eligible for grade retention after the reduction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency informed the appellant that it was changing his position to a lower grade to correct a classification error. It is well established that an employee whose position is reclassified to a lower grade may not appeal the reduction in grade if he is eligible for and receives the grade and pay retention benefits of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5362 and 5363. <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 670 F.2d 272, 285-86 (D.C. Cir. 1981); <span class="Italic">Malan v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 283, 290 (1992). Grade retention under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5362 does not apply, however, to a reduction in the grade of a position that was classified at the higher grade for a continuous period of less than a year immediately before the reduction in grade. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5362(b)(2). The appellant's position was classified at the GS-14 level for less than 7 months before it was reduced in grade. Because the appellant was not eligible for grade retention following his reduction in grade, he is not precluded from challenging that action before the Board. <span class="Italic">See Gibson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 274, 276 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant's reduction in grade is appealable to the Board, he has the right to a hearing under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a)(1). The appellant has indicated that he wishes to exercise this right. We are unable, therefore, to resolve this matter on the basis of the parties' written submissions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that, although this matter is within the Board's jurisdiction, the scope of our review is quite limited. The determination of whether the appellant's current position is properly classified at the GS-13 or GS-14 level is within the purview of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and we will not review the merits of that determination. <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 274, 277. Instead, we will review the agency's reclassification of the appellant's position only to determine whether the agency acted <span id="Page_429"></span>in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (concluding that the agency's classification action was proper where the agency provided proper notice to the appellant of the reasons for its reclassification action, followed OPM's applicable rate of pay regulations upon changing the appellant to a lower grade, and acted in accordance with standards published by OPM).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Quinlan v. DHS</span>, 118 MSPR 362, 367-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 9-11, 2012 MSPB 91 (2012), further explained the limited jurisdiction identified in <span class="Italic">Bobie</span>, involving a review of whether the agency acted in accordance with law. Quinlan, who received pay retention but not grade retention, received due process:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge properly found jurisdiction over the appellants' reductions in grade. In <span class="Italic">Atwell v. Department of the Army</span>, the Board held that employees who are assigned to positions that are reclassified downward and who receive the benefits of grade and pay retention under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5362, 5363 may not appeal to the Board. 2 M.S.P.R. 484, 490 (1980), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 670 F.2d 272 (D.C. Cir. 1981). Following this reasoning, in <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, the Board found jurisdiction over a reduction in grade appeal because the appellant was downgraded as a result of a position classification and was not eligible for grade retention under chapter 53. 20 M.S.P.R. at 276; <span class="Italic">see also Bobie</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6; 8 ("Because the appellant was not eligible for grade retention following his reduction in grade, he is not precluded from challenging that action before the Board.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board has held that, in cases in which an employee suffered a reduction in grade due to a downward reclassification decision, the Board's review of the agency's action is limited to whether the agency's action in effecting the reduction in grade was in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See Bobie,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 592, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10; <span class="Italic">Gibson,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. at 277. Thus, we find that the administrative judge correctly examined the agency's adherence to its internal management directives to determine that the agency's actions were in accordance with law. <span class="Italic">See</span> 49 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 114(n); <span class="Italic">Winlock,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 521, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the agency complied with its internal policies regarding notice and an opportunity to respond pursuant to its MD 1100.75-3 Handbook. Under MD 1100.75-3, an agency conducting an adverse action is required to give the employee notice, an opportunity to respond orally and/or in writing, and a final decision. The appellants received a notice of proposed correction of position classification on June 30, 2010. The notice to the appellants informed them that they had 7 days to respond or request more time to respond. They received a 14-day extension to respond and submitted oral and written replies. The deciding official, Roderick Allison, considered the appellants' oral and written replies prior to sustaining the proposal to reduce the appellants to the K band. He responded to several of their contentions in the final decision letter and gave them notice of their right to appeal to the Board. Furthermore, the agency informed the appellants of their right to receive pay retention in accordance with MD 1100.53-8. <span class="Italic">See Gibson,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. at 277. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the agency properly gave the appellants notice, an opportunity to respond, and a final decision in accordance with internal agency policies and due process. <span class="Italic">See Rosenberg v. Department of Transportation,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 130, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2007) (citing <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants rely on an e-mail from William Ferrara, the contractor retained to conduct the classification review, which he drafted prior to his interview with the appellants. The appellants allege that the e-mail demonstrates that he predetermined that their positions should be reclassified prior to interviewing them. This e-mail, however, simply states that the positions encumbered by the appellants do not support the L band based on managerial criteria. It is clear that Mr. Ferrara was relying on preliminary information about the positions of Appellants Vaughan and Lazisky, and he had no position information for Appellant Quinlan. The record reflects that he revised his evaluation after meeting with the appellants. The appellants further stated that they were promised two interviews and did not receive their second interview and that the agency declined to consult with their first-line supervisor, John Moran. The appellants have not, however, argued how the agency's failure to give them two interviews or consult with their first-line supervisor violated any rules, policies, or procedures such that the Board could find the agency's actions not in accordance with law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an employee is entitled to, but declines pay and grade retention benefits, the Board still lacks jurisdiction; the only appeal is to OPM, as described in the discussion that follows. <span class="Italic">Cocciardi v.
