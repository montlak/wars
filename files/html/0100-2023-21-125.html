<h4 class="h4" id="sec14-124"><span class="space">6.</span> Consent of Spouse to Waiver of Survivor Annuity</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Current law establishes a survivor annuity for a spouse, assuming other basic entitlement conditions are met, subject to waiver by that spouse or loss of the automatic entitlement through divorce (allowing for divorce settlements or other arrangements that then provide for a former spouse survivor annuity). If the annuitant is married at the time of retirement, absent the consent of the spouse, the annuity is reduced for a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Jones v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 163, 168 (1988), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he CSRSEA amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), effective May 7, 1985, to provide that an annuity of an employee who is married at the time of retirement must be reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee's spouse, unless the employee and the spouse jointly waive the spouse's right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with the Office of Personnel Management at the time the employee retires.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To determine whether a survivor annuity was to be provided by reason of marriage, it may be necessary to determine whether a common law marriage existed under state law and, if so, whether the common law spouse signed a waiver of a survivor annuity when the employee stated on his annuity application that no survivor annuity was elected. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Keys v. OPM</span>, 107 MSPR 105, 108-09 &#x00B6; 8-10, 2007 MSPB 250 (2007).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A waiver of an annuity suspends rather than forfeits the annuity, and the waiver must be filed with OPM, <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. OPM</span>, 76 MSPR 633, 636-38 (1997) (overruled on other grounds, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 440, 2013 MSPB 95 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(d), "[i]f an employee...dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, his widow or widower is entitled to an annuity...." A "widower" is defined as "the surviving husband of an employee...who...was married to [the employee] for at least 9 months immediately before [the employee's] death...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(2)(A). Margaret and Wade Wallace, Sr. were married on March 19, 1955, in Washington, D.C. There is no evidence of record that Margaret and Wade Wallace were divorced or that the marriage was dissolved by any other means.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her petition for review, appellant Wallace-Ingram states that her mother intended that her father not receive an annuity based on her service, and that her father, knowing of her mother's intentions, willingly signed a statement waiving any rights to annuity benefits based on her mother's federal service. As noted above, the record contains a notarized statement by Wade Wallace, Sr. that he waives "all rights and Legal bond concerning the estate of Margaret Wallace."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge addressed the effect of this affidavit. She found that there are no legal provisions wherein a legal beneficiary may waive his or her rights to survivor annuity benefits. This was error. Contrary to the administrative judge's finding, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) provides that "[a]n individual entitled to an annuity from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with the Office of Personnel Management." <span class="Italic">See Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600, 603 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Ochoa v. Department of the Navy</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 39, 44 (1994). Thus, Wade Wallace, Sr. can waive the annuity awarded to him from the Fund under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite Wade Wallace, Sr.'s ability under statute to waive annuity benefits, however, we find that reading the waiver statement that is part of the record in these appeals as intending to waive a survivor benefit under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), as opposed to waiving, for example, rights to real and personal property in Mrs. Wallace's estate, is reading in too much. Moreover, the statute requires that a waiver must be filed with OPM. Assuming that the waiver statement is an effective waiver of CSRS survivor benefits, there is no evidence that it was ever filed with OPM. Further, assuming that the statement is a wavier of survivor benefits and Wade Wallace, Sr. still wants to file it with OPM, the Board has no authority to act for him by filing the document on his behalf.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute provides at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b) that the annuity of a widow or widower "terminate[s] on the last day of the month before the widow or widower (i) dies; or (ii) remarries before becoming 55 years of age." Waiver of a benefit is not listed as a terminating event. Rather, waiver of a monthly benefit merely suspends payment of an annuity because, as stated in the statute, a waiver "may be revoked in writing at any time." Since a lump-sum benefit is payable only if no one is entitled to a survivor benefit at the time of the employee's death, <span class="Italic">see Canelo v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 217, 219 (1993), and because we are finding that Wade Wallace, Sr. was entitled to a survivor benefit at the time of Mrs. Wallace's death, it is irrelevant for purposes of the lump-sum payment whether Wade Wallace, Sr. intended to waive payment of that benefit for a period of time or whether such a waiver was filed with OPM.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Overruling several decisions, <span class="Italic">Clark v. OPM</span>, 120 MSPR 440, 441-46 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-12, 2013 MSPB 95 (2013), determined that a survivor annuity, once elected, cannot be waived for the purpose of restoring the full value of the annuity of the former employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The pertinent facts are undisputed. The appellant was unmarried in 1995, when he retired from federal service and started receiving an annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). When he married the intervenor in 2007, the appellant elected to receive a reduced annuity in order to provide the maximum survivor annuity benefit to his wife, and OPM approved this election. In October 2010, the appellant requested that OPM terminate the survivor annuity election based on financial hardship. OPM denied that request on the basis that the appellant's 2007 election was irrevocable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). On appeal, the Board affirmed that determination, but informed the appellant that the intervenor could irrevocably request waiver of her entitlement to a survivor annuity, and thus restore the appellant's full annuity under the Board's interpretation of the controlling statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d). <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, MSPB Docket No. AT-0831-11-0615-I-1, Final Order at 2 (Nov. 25, 2011) (0615 Final Order). The intervenor subsequently submitted a letter to OPM stating that she wished to irrevocably waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity. OPM issued a reconsideration decision denying the request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal to the Board, the administrative judge issued an initial decision that reversed OPM's reconsideration decision and ordered it to grant the intervenor's requested irrevocable waiver of survivor annuity benefits and to retroactively restore the appellant's unreduced annuity. The basis for that decision was Board precedent cited by the administrative judge. The administrative judge acknowledged OPM's request that this precedent be overruled, but correctly noted that an administrative judge may not overrule the Board's precedential decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who marries after retiring with a CSRS annuity "may irrevocably elect" a reduction in his current annuity in order to provide a survivor annuity benefit to his spouse or former spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A). Because of the irrevocable nature of this election, the law does not permit an individual, such as the appellant, to rescind his election and return to an unreduced annuity, regardless of whether the election causes him financial hardship. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Under existing precedent, however, the same result can be achieved indirectly by having the person named as the beneficiary of the survivor annuity irrevocably waive her future entitlement to that benefit. <span class="Italic">Mulroy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2002); <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 8 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The source of the principle enunciated in <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelley</span> was a prior decision in <span class="Italic">Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237 (2000), which adopted the reasoning in a non-precedential decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 155 F.3d 566 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (Table).[2] Unlike the present case, which involves an attempt to waive a future survivor annuity in order to restore an annuitant's unreduced retirement annuity, <span class="Italic">Worley</span> involved an attempt by the widow of a deceased annuitant to waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity so that she could receive an immediate lump-sum payment of her late husband's unpaid retirement contributions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8342(d). <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3 &#x0026; 5. The Board ruled that she was entitled to make such a waiver under a statute that provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An individual entitled to annuity from the Fund may decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with the Office of Personnel Management. The waiver may be revoked in writing at any time. Payment of the annuity waived may <span id="Page_4256"></span>not be made for the period during which the waiver was in effect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d). The Board held that an individual who files a waiver of her entitlement to a survivor annuity under CSRS after the death of the annuitant could terminate her entitlement to a survivor annuity as long as the waiver expressly states that it is irrevocable and is done before she files a claim for a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Worley</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. The Board extended the <span class="Italic">Worley</span> holding in <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelley</span> to apply to cases such as the present one, in which the annuitant, whose annuity was reduced to provide a survivor benefit, is still alive and the purpose of the waiver of survivor annuity benefits by the beneficiary is to permit the restoration of an unreduced annuity payable to the annuitant.[3] <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 404, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17; <span class="Italic">Shelley</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 224 &#x00B6; 8.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the court has cited in a precedential decision <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span> and <span class="Italic">Shelley</span> for the proposition that the beneficiary of the survivor annuity may irrevocably waive her future entitlement to that benefit. <span class="Italic">See James v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 372 F.3d 1365, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004). However, the court's discussion was in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> and is not binding precedent for the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Davis v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 6 (2008), the Board extended the holding in <span class="Italic">Shelley</span> and <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span> to cases governed by the Federal Employees' Retirement System, which has a waiver provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a), which is identical in all material respects to the CSRS provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM makes four basic arguments challenging this body of precedent. It first asserts that the Board's decisions violate or nullify other statutory restrictions of the CSRS and the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS) statutes, including the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), which provides that such waivers "may be revoked at any time. Second, OPM points out that the Board's precedent allows someone who has only a future, contingent entitlement to a survivor annuity to waive her entitlement and contends that the statute applies only to those who have a present entitlement. Third, OPM argues that the Board's decisions permitting irrevocable waivers place the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund (CSRDF) in jeopardy of making payments in excess of what is permitted by law. Finally, OPM asserts that any authorization of irrevocable waivers must come from legislation enacted by Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether <span class="Italic">Mulroy</span>, <span class="Italic">Shelley</span>, and <span class="Italic">Worley</span> violate or nullify section 8345(d) and other sections of the CSRS and FERS statutes is a question of statutory interpretation. Therefore, we first must determine, by using "traditional tools of statutory construction," if "Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, [and if so,] that intention is the law and must be given effect." <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc., v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9 (1984); <span class="Italic">see Delverde, SRL v. United States</span>, 202 F.3d 1360, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (explaining that the "traditional tools of statutory construction" include an examination of the statute's text, structure, and legislative history, as well as an application of the relevant canons of interpretation). Further, it is a well-settled principle of statutory interpretation that a "statute is to be construed in a way which gives meaning and effect to all of its parts." <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Secretary of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 25 F.3d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Nordic Village, Inc</span>., 503 U.S. 30, 36 (1982) (noting the "settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect")). Only if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue will the inquiry proceed to the question of whether an agency's interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, we agree with OPM that the Board erred in <span class="Italic">Worley</span> in finding that section 8345(d) authorizes an individual to make an irrevocable waiver. The language of the section expressly states that the waiver "may be revoked at any time." Thus, waivers under this provision are plainly defined as revocable in the section. <span class="Italic">Worley</span> found that the use of the word "may" in the section is permissive language, which gives the individual discretion to make a waiver irrevocable. 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 10. However, this analysis ignores that the provision also states that an individual's discretion to revoke a waiver may be exercised "at any time." By permitting an individual to make an irrevocable waiver, <span class="Italic">Worley</span> does not give meaning and effect to the entire provision. Therefore, we conclude that the only reasonable interpretation of section 8345(d) is that Congress did not intend for it to authorize an irrevocable waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if one could find section 8345(d) to be ambiguous on this issue, which we do not find, it is apparent from the legislative history that Congress did not intend to authorize an irrevocable waiver in this provision. As explained in the legislative history of the 1952 act, the problem to be fixed by the legislation, which is the origin of the language found in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), was a situation in which receipt of an annuity decreased an existing annuitant's total income. H.R. Rep. No. 82-2407, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1952 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2266, 2267 &#x0026; 2269. This unintended and paradoxical result could be avoided if the law allowed the annuitant to waive all or part of his or her annuity. However, it was also important that any such waiver be revocable. If the waiver was not revocable, there could be a second unintended and unwanted consequence should the reason for the waiver cease to exist. In that event, Congress intended that the annuitant must be allowed to revoke the waiver and resume receipt of the full annuity to which he or she was entitled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our briefing order, we requested OPM to identify any prior cases where it has challenged <span class="Italic">Worley's</span> interpretation of section 8345(d) and to present argument on whether Congress has endorsed or rejected the Board's longstanding interpretation of this provision. "Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change." <span class="Italic">Forest Grove School District v. T.A</span>., 557 U.S. 230, 239-40 (2008) (quoting <span class="Italic">Lorillard v. Pons</span>, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978)). In response, OPM demonstrated that it has argued against the <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram</span> and <span class="Italic">Worley</span> interpretation of its statutes in several prior appeals. However, neither the court nor the Board issued a precedential decision responding to OPM's argument in any of these cases. Furthermore, we find that there is insufficient indication that Congress has considered the Board's interpretation of section 8345(d) in any legislation since <span class="Italic">Worley</span>. The section itself was last amended by Congress in 1994 before <span class="Italic">Wallace-Ingram</span> and <span class="Italic">Worley</span>. In addition, there is no indication in any closely related provisions of the CSRS or FERS statutes that Congress has adopted the Board's interpretation of the statute. Therefore, we conclude that the Board's interpretation of section 8345(d) and its corresponding FERS provision has not been endorsed by OPM or Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that we must overrule our previous decisions in <span class="Italic">Davis, Shelley, Mulroy</span>, and <span class="Italic">Worley</span> because the interpretation of the CSRS and FERS statutes to permit an irrevocable waiver by an individual entitled to an annuity from the Fund is not consistent with the express language in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) and 8465(a). We also REVERSE the initial decision and find that the intervenor may not waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity so that the appellant can receive an unreduced retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clark</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Holly v. OPM</span>, 121 MSPR 134, 137-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-14, 2014 MSPB 35 (2014), allowing a former spouse to waive her right to elect a non-vested survivor annuity under a divorce decree to increase the monthly payment of a retirement annuity allocated to her from her husband under the divorce judgment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequent to the issuance of the initial decision and OPM's filing of its petition for review in this case, the Board agreed with OPM's contention that the four decisions on which the administrative judge relied were contrary to the statute and overruled them, holding that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) does not permit an irrevocable waiver of the entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12 (2013). As discussed below, however, the <span class="Italic">Clark</span> decision does not require that we affirm OPM's denial of the appellant's request for waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5, United States Code Section 8445(a) provides that a former spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is "entitled to an annuity...if and to the extent expressly provided for...in the terms of any decree of divorce...or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." As the appellant contends, the "extent" to which the 1999 Property Settlement approved by the 2001 Court Order "expressly provided for" a former spouse survivor annuity was not unconditional or a certainty. The Property Settlement provided that the appellant "shall be awarded the maximum possible Former Spouse Annuity" pursuant to the former spouse survivor annuity statute, while simultaneously providing that the Property Settlement "shall not constitute a waiver...of her rights to receive benefits as a...former spouse survivor," and that, "in the event she <span class="Italic">elects</span> to have survivor rights or survivor annuity rights," she would bear the cost of such a survivor annuity by way of a reduction in her portion of Mr. Holly's retirement annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's understanding of this language is reasonable, i.e., when her former husband retired and she learned how much the election of a survivor annuity would reduce her portion of Mr. Holly's retirement annuity, she could make an informed decision whether to elect a survivor benefit and the accompanying reduction in her portion of Mr. Holly's annuity, or she could waive a survivor benefit and receive the full, unreduced portion of Mr. Holly's annuity. This understanding does not conflict with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a), which provides that an annuitant "may decline to accept all or any part of the amount of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with" OPM, but that the "waiver may be revoked in writing at any time." The waiver filed with OPM by the appellant on September 27, 2010, constituted such a waiver. Although the appellant's waiver cannot be an irrevocable one, it can be an indefinite one.[3] Moreover, finding that the appellant's September 27 waiver was valid and effective does not require giving effect to the 2011 Court Order; the September 27 waiver was valid and effective on its own.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;If the appellant elected to revoke her waiver in the future and provide for a survivor annuity, she would presumably either have to make back payments or the survivor annuity would be reduced to account for the period for which deductions were not made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The only reason that the 2011 Court Order was sought and <span id="Page_4257"></span>issued was that an OPM official advised the appellant that this was necessary for her to waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances of the present case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>. That case involved an annuitant, a former federal employee, who made an irrevocable election pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(k)(2)(A) for a reduction in his own current annuity in order to provide a survivor annuity for his wife, whom he married after retiring. 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 5. Although the law did not permit Mr. Clark to rescind his election of a survivor annuity for his wife, the Board's case law at the time allowed the same result to be achieved indirectly by having his wife irrevocably waive her future entitlement to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 5. The Board in <span class="Italic">Clark</span> agreed with OPM that this line of precedent was inconsistent with the express language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 345(d), which provides that a "waiver may be revoked in writing at any time."[5] <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-12. Accordingly, the Board held that the annuitant's wife could not irrevocably waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity so that her husband could receive an unreduced retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As noted above, the relevant language of the FERS waiver provision, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a), is identical to the CSRS waiver provision in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the Board explained that the origin of the waiver principle articulated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8345(d) and 8465(a) was a 1952 statute intended to address the situation in which a veteran's receipt of an annuity based on civilian federal service could decrease his total income because he could be denied his non-service-connected disability military pension as a result of exceeding a monetary cap. <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 10; H.R. Rep. No. 82-2407, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1952 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2266, 2267 &#x0026; 2269. This unintended and paradoxical result could be avoided if the law allowed the annuitant to waive all or part of his civil service annuity.[6] <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 10. However, it was also important that any such waiver be revocable; otherwise there could be a second unintended and unwanted consequence should the reason for the waiver cease to exist. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In that event, Congress intended that the annuitant must be allowed to revoke the waiver and resume receipt of the full annuity to which he was entitled. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Although the legislative history does not indicate that Congress contemplated waivers in the context of survivor annuities, the plain language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465 does not restrict waivers to the situation described in the legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, there was no election by Mr. Holly to reduce his own retirement annuity in order to provide a former spouse survivor annuity for the appellant. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8417(b) (an employee may elect a survivor annuity for a former spouse). Instead, the court-approved Property Settlement provided that the appellant could elect to receive such a benefit, but only if she bore the entire cost via a reduction in her portion of Mr. Holly's retirement annuity. Honoring the appellant's request to waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity--and thus the obligation to fund that benefit through a reduction in her share of Mr. Holly's annuity--is fully consistent with the purpose of the waiver provision discussed above, as it would allow her to prevent a reduction in her total income at the present time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, it is significant that in <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, the annuitant's wife only was entitled to a future survivor annuity upon the death of her husband, and therefore, at the time she attempted to waive her right to the survivor annuity, she did not meet the statutory requirement for the waiver of being "[a]n individual entitled to an annuity." <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d). The appellant in this matter is currently entitled to an annuity as part of the Property Settlement. Thus, the appellant meets the statutory requirements for declining to accept all or any part of her annuity by signed waiver. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8465(a). Accordingly, we find that under the particular circumstances presented in this case, the appellant may waive her entitlement to a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Holly</span> and <span class="Italic">Clark</span> were discussed and distinguished in <span class="Italic">Moss v. OPM</span>, 122 MSPR 257, 259-60 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5-6, 2015 MSPB 19 (2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, the appellant argued that OPM erroneously denied his request to waive his entitlement to receive a former spouse survivor annuity and allow him to collect an unreduced share of his former spouse's current retirement annuity. He contended that <span class="Italic">Clark v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 440 (2013), and <span class="Italic">Holly v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 134 (2014), support his argument that he has a statutory right to waive his survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d). He also stated that the language of his irrevocable waiver "should be treated as surplusage in view of the <span class="Italic">Clark</span> decision," which held that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) does not authorize an irrevocable waiver of an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Cl</span>ark, 120 M.S.P.R. 440, &#x00B6; 9. In an initial decision based on the written record, the administrative judge affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellants in this case and in <span class="Italic">Holly</span> both received court orders pursuant to divorce proceedings that awarded a portion of their former spouse's retirement annuity and the maximum survivor annuity, with the cost of the survivor annuity borne by the appellants. <span class="Italic">See Holly</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 3.

OPM argues that <span class="Italic">Holly</span> is distinguishable because the appellant there had the right to elect a survivor annuity through a property agreement incorporated by the court order, whereas the appellant here was awarded the survivor annuity without an election right. We agree that this is a distinguishing factor between the cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A former spouse of a deceased employee or annuitant is entitled to a survivor annuity if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of "any decree of divorce or annulment or any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to such decree." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(1).

The Board in <span class="Italic">Holly</span> found persuasive the appellant's argument that the property settlement did not provide an unconditional or certain award of a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Additionally, OPM's regulations specifically allow a former spouse to irrevocably elect not to be eligible for a former spouse survivor annuity when a court order provides an election right. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.932. In contrast, the appellant's court order does not provide a right to elect a former spouse survivor annuity. Because the appellant's former spouse has already retired, OPM must follow the terms of the court order. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 838.806(b), 838.1004(e)(1).</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, when a former spouse was awarded a survivor annuity by court order, although there may be a problem with a successor court order amending the earlier order granting the annuity, the former spouse could request OPM to irrevocably waive the survivor annuity, as <span class="Italic">Shelley v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 224, 227-28 &#x00B6; 7-11 (2001) (overruled by <span class="Italic">Clark v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree with the administrative judge that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) does not allow OPM to give effect to the July 12, 1999 court order because it is a modification of an annuity made after the date of the appellant's retirement, we believe that OPM must give effect to the appellant's former spouse's waiver of the survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's former spouse has the right, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), to decline to accept all or any part of the annuity by a waiver signed and filed with OPM. <span class="Italic">See also Worley v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237 (2000) (finding that a widow was entitled to waive her right to a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d)); <span class="Italic">Vesser v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 29 F.3d 600 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (finding that an annuitant was entitled to waive his right to an annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d)). We recognize that the waiver right granted in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) is revocable, and that such a revocable right may lead to problems for OPM in accurately calculating the amount of the appellant's annuity since the appellant's former spouse could at any time revoke her waiver. Thus, in order for the appellant to be entitled to the full amount of his annuity, his former spouse must irrevocably waive her right to a survivor annuity. Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) states that a waiver "<span class="Italic">may</span> be revoked at any time" (emphasis added), it does not preclude an irrevocable waiver. <span class="Italic">Worley</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 10. Moreover, an irrevocable waiver would be consistent with OPM's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 838.932 which only allows for irrevocable waivers for former spouses who are given an election regarding a survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's former spouse has several times expressed her wish to waive her right to a survivor annuity. As mentioned above, Ms. Shelley wrote to OPM on September 6, 1999, and asked that OPM cancel her right to a survivor annuity. The July 12, 1999 court order was also submitted to OPM and put it on notice that Ms. Shelley wanted to waive her right to a survivor annuity. Moreover, the appellant wrote to OPM on June 1, 1999, <span id="Page_4258"></span>stating that his former spouse was willing to "relinquish" her annuity and asking what steps must be taken to effect this waiver. The record does not show that OPM ever informed the appellant or Ms. Shelley about Ms. Shelley's right to waive the survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d); however, Ms. Shelley met the statutory requirements for waiving her right to a survivor annuity by signing her September 6, 1999 letter asking to cancel her right and filing it with OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the facts of this appeal, we find that, if Ms. Shelley files a waiver with OPM expressly stating that it is irrevocable, then she will have permanently waived her right to a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) and the appellant will then be entitled to his full retirement benefits without any reduction for a survivor annuity. This result is in accord with the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Evans v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 94 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, the Board discussed the legislative history and purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) and found that it should be construed to permit waivers of annuities for limited and legitimate reasons. <span class="Italic">Evans</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 101, 104. For example, the Board stated that a civil service annuity may be waived to permit continued receipt of another retirement benefit, that is, where the annuitant would be financially better off because of the waiver. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 101. The Board allowed that waivers may also be effected for "certain other similar purposes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> We find that the appellant and his former spouse have shown a purpose for Ms. Shelley's waiver request that falls within the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mulroy v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 404, 410-11 &#x00B6; 16 (2002) ("The circumstances in <span class="Italic">Shelley v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 224 (2001), were materially similar to those here. There, the appellant initially filed with OPM a court order acceptable for processing (COAP) which provided for a survivor annuity to benefit his former spouse. After retiring, the appellant filed with OPM a court order approving his agreement with his former spouse to cancel the former spouse's right to a survivor annuity. The former spouse separately wrote to OPM, requesting that OPM cancel her right to a survivor annuity. The Board agreed with the AJ that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(h)(4) precludes OPM from effectuating the subsequent court order because it constitutes a post-retirement modification of the COAP. The Board found, however, that OPM must permit the former spouse to waive her right to a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), which provides that an individual may decline to accept all or any part of an annuity by waiver signed and filed with OPM. The Board recognized that a waiver granted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d) is revocable but that a revocable waiver right might lead to problems for OPM in accurately calculating the amount of the appellant's retirement annuity since his former spouse could at any time revoke her waiver. The Board therefore held that the former spouse may waive her right to a survivor annuity, under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8345(d), but that such a waiver must be irrevocable.<span class="Italic">"</span>), <span class="Italic">overruled</span>, <span class="Italic">Clark v.

<p class="Body-Text">Testimony and other evidence leading to credibility determinations may be required to determine whether a spouse signed or intended to sign a consent to waive a spousal annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Luten v. OPM</span>, 110 MSPR 667, 2009 MSPB 48 (2009).

OPM</span>, 57 MSPR 458, 464-65 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record contains a document showing the appellant's consent to Mr. Steele's election of a reduced survivor benefit for her.

As noted above, the administrative judge essentially found that OPM should be estopped from denying benefits based on that waiver because of the appellant's lack of information and mistaken impressions concerning the significance of the waiver. However, the Board has rejected the argument that an appellant's freely made choice concerning a survivor annuity is voidable on the basis of his unilateral mistake, finding that such an argument does not show improper action on OPM's part. <span class="Italic">See Carlton v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 225, 229 (1992). In <span class="Italic">Richmond,</span> moreover, the Court held that the government cannot be estopped from denying monetary benefits not otherwise permitted by law even if the claimant was denied them because of his reliance on the mistaken advice of a government official. <span class="Italic">See Richmond,</span> 110 S.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Braza v. OPM</span>, 598 F.3d 1315, 1316-21 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (Judges Dyk and Newman dissenting), an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision, determined that a spouse's waiver of a survivor annuity would not be set aside without a demonstration of fraud, duress, or medical incompetence. Failure to read the waiver form, and failure to be informed of the importance of the waiver, did not suffice to set the waiver aside:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Elpidia L. Braza is the widow of a former government employee who retired under the Civil Service Retirement System ("CSRS"). In connection with his retirement, Mr. Braza completed and signed a standard retirement application form. On his form, Mr. Braza indicated that he elected to receive an annuity payable only during his lifetime, and did not wish to reduce his annuity to provide a survivor annuity for his spouse. Such an election can only be made with the consent of the retiree's spouse. Shortly before his retirement took effect, Mrs. Braza completed and signed the standard spousal consent form, consenting to her husband's survivor annuity election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following her husband's death, Mrs. Braza filed a claim for a survivor annuity as the spouse of a deceased civil service employee. The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") denied Mrs. Braza's claim, finding that she waived her entitlement to such annuity by completing and signing the standard form. Mrs. Braza petitioned for review before the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board"), arguing that the form bearing her signature did not validly waive her right to an annuity. The Board affirmed OPM's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Braza appealed to this court, and argument was heard before a panel of three judges on December 4, 2008. Finding the matter of how to evaluate the validity of annuity waivers under the CSRS to be of exceptional importance, the court decided <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> to resolve the matter <span class="Italic">en banc</span>. For the reasons explained below, the <span class="Italic">en banc</span> court concludes that Mrs. Braza waived her right to the spousal annuity by completing and signing the written waiver form. Such written waiver is valid absent fraud, duress, or mental incompetence, none of which are present here. We therefore affirm the decision of the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Spouse Equity Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195, was enacted to provide spouses of retired civil service employees with a default entitlement to a survivor annuity, and to ensure that spouses receive notice of, and consent to, a retiring employee's election not to provide for a survivor annuity. The 1984 Act reads, in relevant part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]f an employee...dies after having retired under this subchapter and is survived by a widow or widower, the widow or widower is entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent [of the employee's annuity] ...unless the right to a survivor annuity was waived under such section 8339(j)(1)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 2(4) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(b)). Section 8339(j)(1) provides that the retirement annuity of an employee who is married at the time he retires will be automatically reduced during his lifetime to take into account the cost of providing a survivor annuity for the spouse "unless the employee...and the spouse jointly waive the spouse's right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with [OPM] at the time that the employee...retires." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To provide for the "written election filed with [OPM] " jointly waiving the spouse's annuity, OPM has issued a set of standard forms for employees and their spouses to complete and submit in connection with their annuity election. Mr. and Mrs. Braza completed and signed the version of these forms in effect at the time of his retirement, denominated "Revised January 1990."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One such form is Standard Form (SF) 2801, entitled "Application for Immediate Retirement." The section of the form providing for an annuity election states: "If you are married at retirement, the law provides an annuity with full survivor benefits for your spouse unless your spouse consents to your election not to provide maximum survivor benefits." The form provides check boxes next to options for a full annuity, a reduced annuity, and no annuity. Mr. Braza initialed the option providing, "I CHOOSE AN ANNUITY PAYABLE ONLY DURING MY LIFETIME." Next to the option elected by Mr. Braza are instructions to attach an SF 2801-2 showing spousal consent to the election. The form further explains: "If you are married at retirement, you cannot choose this type of annuity without your spouse's consent. No survivor annuity will be paid to your spouse after your death if he or she consents to this election."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The next form is SF 2801-2, entitled "Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election." The top part of the form is completed by the retiring employee. Mr. Braza filled in his name and selected the third of three options presented, which reads: "No regular or insurable interest survivor annuity for my current spouse." Mrs. Braza then signed the middle part of the form, to be completed by the spouse, beneath the statement: "I freely consent to the survivor annuity election described in Part 1. I understand that my consent is final (not revocable)." The form then provides space for notarization. The Brazas' form was notarized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the notary block are three short paragraphs of information, the first of which reads, "General Information: Public Law 98-615 requires that a retiring, married employee whose annuity begins on or after May 7, 1985, must elect to provide a full survivor annuity for a current spouse, unless the current spouse consents to some other election by signing this form."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An additional form called "Attachment to SF 2801-2" deals with health coverage. This form is completed only by the spouse and notary. The form <span id="Page_4259"></span>contains two statements, followed by a signature block. The statements read:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I have freely consented to the survivor annuity election described on the attached SF 2801-2, Spouses Consent to Survivor Election.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">I understand that I will be ineligible to continue coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Program if my spouse dies because I have consented to his/her election to provide no survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Braza completed and signed this attachment as well, and it was also notarized.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The circumstances under which Mrs. Braza signed the waiver forms are undisputed, and based on Mrs. Braza's recollection of the events. Mr. Braza handled all of the family's financial affairs. Mrs. Braza did not know what bills came in, what bank accounts Mr. Braza had, what his earnings were, or what credit cards he possessed. On December 20, 2002, Mr. and Mrs. Braza went to a local bank while they were running errands. Mr. Braza presented his wife with form SF 2801-2 and the attachment and requested her signature before a notary public at the bank. Mrs. Braza had not seen these forms before. Neither the notary nor Mr. Braza explained the form to Mrs. Braza, and she did not ask for any explanation. She did not read the form before signing it. Mrs. Braza explains that she signed the form because she trusted her husband. The administrative judge adjudicating the case for the Board found credible Mrs. Braza's recount of the events and her allegation that she was not aware of her right to a CSRS survivor annuity and did not understand the effect on that right of signing the waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under this court's precedent, the voluntary signing of a government form for the purpose of evidencing agreement with the terms of the form is binding, and the government is entitled to rely on the act of signing absent a showing of fraud, duress, or mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">Collins v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 45 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Braza does not deny on appeal that she consented to her husband's election to provide her no survivor annuity. She contends, however, that her consent is not a valid waiver of her statutory right to an annuity as required by the statute. Mrs. Braza raises two main arguments in support of this contention. First, she argues that the form was insufficient to provide adequate notice of her statutory right and of the effect on that right of signing the form, and therefore is not evidence of a waiver. Second, she argues that the circumstances under which she signed the form are inconsistent with finding a knowing waiver of a known right, and that the waiver is thus invalid under Supreme Court precedent. We address each argument in turn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the adequacy of the notice, we hold that the OPM Spousal Consent to Survivor Election form in use at the time of Mr. Braza's retirement was sufficient to inform a reader of his or her statutory rights as a spouse and was sufficient to inform him or her of the effect on those rights of signing the form. The form clearly states that the law requires an employee to provide a full survivor annuity for a current spouse. The form states that this annuity will be waived only if the spouse so consents. The form states that "signing this form" constitutes consent to the annuity election. Mr. Braza's election of no survivor annuity is clearly marked in the top section of the form. The attachment to the form reiterates the effect of the form in alternate, and also clear, language. The attachment confirms that the spouse freely consented to the election on the form. It states that the spouse will not receive health benefits after the employee dies because the spouse has consented to the employee election to provide no survivor annuity. The words "no survivor annuity" are the last words before the signature line.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the form does not use the words "statutory right," as Mrs. Braza contends it should, it cites the relevant statute by number and accurately refers to the statute as "Public Law." Similarly, although the form uses words like "elect" and "consent" instead of "right" and "waiver," the language of the form nonetheless conveys the meaning of the statute. It does so by stating the mandatory nature of the requirement for an employee to provide a full survivor annuity, that electing no survivor annuity is conditioned on the consent of the spouse, and the legal effect of consenting to that election by signing the form. The statute itself describes a valid joint waiver as "a written <span class="Italic">election</span> filed with [OPM]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Not only is the relevant language of form SF 2801-2 and its attachment clear, but the presentation of that language is sufficiently accessible. The spousal consent form and the attachment are each a single page in length. The sentences explaining the law and the consequences of the election are not buried among numerous provisions or obscured by unrelated information. The effect of signing the form is communicated at least three times in three different ways between the two pages. The form thus provides sufficient notice to alert readers to its consequences upon reasonable review and is explicit enough for the act of signing the form to evidence agreement with the terms of the form. <span class="Italic">See Collins,</span> 45 F.3d at 1573.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mrs. Braza's unawareness of her rights and of the significance of the form were not due to any insufficiency in the form, but rather to her admitted failure to read the form. No form, no matter how carefully drafted, would have educated Mrs. Braza against waiving her annuity if she did not read its contents before signing it. Mrs. Braza's failure to read the form, and the circumstances promoting this failure, give rise to Mrs. Braza's second argument; that her waiver was unknowing and therefore is invalid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject Mrs. Braza's second argument as well. We affirm the controlling law of this circuit, under which a clear express written waiver of annuity benefits is invalid only if it was signed pursuant to fraud, duress, or mental incompetence. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, a CSRS retiree sought to void an election that he made at the time of his retirement not to make a deposit for credit for military service. The form explained the choices available and that the effect of electing not to make the deposit was a reduction in annuity when the retiree became eligible for Social Security benefits. Mr. Collins argued that he misunderstood the consequences of his election, and thus signed the form pursuant to a mistake. We held that he was nonetheless bound by his election absent a showing of mental incompetence, duress, or fraud. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board decision emphasized <span class="Italic">Steele</span> rather than <span class="Italic">Collins</span> in its analysis. In challenging the Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Steele,</span> Mrs. Braza argues that <span class="Italic">Steele</span> was wrongly decided. She argues that the standard set in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Zerbst,</span> 304 U.S. 458 (1938), rather than in <span class="Italic">Richmond,</span> controls whether a waiver of a right is valid. We decline to comment here on whether <span class="Italic">Richmond</span> actually compels the Board's finding in <span class="Italic">Steele.</span> We find, however, that the Board's reliance on <span class="Italic">Steele</span> in denying Mrs. Braza's claim is consistent with this court's precedent in <span class="Italic">Collins</span>, and does not run afoul of the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Zerbst.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Zerbst</span> was a criminal case in which a defendant allegedly waived his right to counsel. The defendant was indicted, tried, convicted, sentenced, and incarcerated in the span of two days. He was not represented by counsel at any point, including on appeal. The Government alleged that the defendant waived his right to counsel, despite no explicit communication of waiver and no trial court finding on the matter. The Supreme Court, noting that courts indulge "every reasonable presumption against waiver of fundamental constitutional rights," ruled that the "determination whether there has been an intelligent waiver of the right to counsel must depend, in each case, upon the particular facts and circumstances surrounding that case." <span class="Italic">Zerbst,</span> 304 U.S. at 464. The Supreme Court went on to impose on the trial court a duty to protect the accused's right to counsel from incompetent waiver. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 465.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While courts have cited <span class="Italic">Zerbst</span> in a variety of other contexts for the proposition that a valid waiver requires intentional relinquishment of a known right, the particular facts and circumstances surrounding Mrs. Braza's case are so different from those in <span class="Italic">Zerbst</span>, that the Court's analysis there has only limited application here. For example, the right waived in this case is not a constitutional right, such as the right to counsel in a criminal case. Completing a standard election form may well not suffice for waiver of the right to counsel in a criminal trial, but the statute here states that it can provide a basis for finding a waiver of the right to a survivor annuity. Finally, the election of a larger lifetime annuity in place of a survivor annuity is not invariably contrary to the spouse's interests. Unlike the waiver of counsel, which is almost always improvident, there are many circumstances under which it is apt to be in the spouse's interest to choose the larger initial annuity rather than a survivor annuity. It is therefore inappropriate to examine an annuity waiver as though it were a waiver of counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That Mrs. Braza neglected to read the waiver form before signing it does not release her from the binding effect of the waiver under controlling law. Mrs. Braza does not allege duress, fraud, or mental incompetence, and the circumstances of her case would not support finding any. Mrs. Braza maintains that her consent was based on her trust in her husband's decision. That she now regrets having trusted her husband's decision is unfortunate, but it does not invalidate the waiver of her survivor annuity entitlement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An assertion that a spouse signature was forged on a form waiving a survivor annuity was not credited in <span class="Italic">Fuell v. OPM,</span> PH-0831-15-0029-I-1 (NP 8/4/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, a current spouse of a retired CSRS employee is entitled to a survivor annuity unless he waived his right to a survivor annuity in writing at the time of his spouse's retirement. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)(1); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. Such a waiver is irrevocable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8339(j)(1). In this case, the issue is whether the appellant's signature on the consent form is genuine. The appellant bears the burden of proof on this issue. <span class="Italic">See Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (the burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity is on the applicant for benefits).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge correctly found, a notary's certificate of acknowledgment, regular on its face, carries a presumption of <span id="Page_4260"></span>genuineness and due execution. <span class="Italic">See Butler v. Encyclopedia Brittanica</span>, 41 F.3d 285 (7th Cir. 1994); 2 Am. Jur. 2d <span class="Italic">Acknowledgments</span> &#x00A7; 66 (2015). However, a notary's certificate is ultimately a form of hearsay evidence that must be weighed against any evidence to the contrary. <span class="Italic">Luten v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 667, &#x00B6; 12 (2009). In this case, the administrative judge considered the appellant's evidence and argument but found it insufficient to show that the notary's certificate was false and the appellant's signature was forged. For the following reasons, we find that the appellant has not presented a sufficient basis for us to disturb the administrative judge's finding on review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleges that his wife forged his signature using a copy of their 1974 marriage license. He argues that nobody's signature remains unchanged for 30 years, and that the signature on the consent form does not match the signature on his marriage license. We find that these arguments are contradictory, and we are not certain whether the appellant is arguing that the similarity or the dissimilarity of the signatures is indicative of forgery. We have reviewed the copies of the signatures that the appellant submitted on petition for review--one from his 1974 marriage license and one from the 2002 consent form--and we find no reason to conclude that the latter was a forgery. The signatures are not identical, but they appear to have been formed in roughly the same manner. It does not appear that the signature on the consent form was traced from the signature on the marriage certificate, as the appellant alleges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleges, for the first time on review, that he was busy moving on April 17, 2002, when he supposedly executed the consent form. In support of his allegation, he has attached a copy of a lease agreement beginning April 15, 2002. However, the Board generally will not consider evidence and argument submitted for the first time on petition for review absent a showing that it was previously unavailable despite the party's due diligence. <span class="Italic">Banks v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 268, 271 (1980); <span class="Italic">Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980). Moreover, the appellant's lease was for an apartment in Baltimore, Maryland--the same city indicated on the notary's certificate. We find it inherently probable that the appellant could have executed this document before a notary in Baltimore around the time that he was moving in the same city.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further argues that he had no reason to waive his survivor annuity rights, in particular because he was separated from his wife at the time. However, there are many reasons, both personal and financial, that an individual in the appellant's situation might have chosen to waive his right to a survivor annuity. We will not speculate as to what the appellant's personal, legal, and financial circumstances might have been on April 17, 2002, but we do not find it inherently improbable that he had some reason for waiving his survivor annuity right notwithstanding the separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that notaries sometimes do favors for friends and family, and he attaches a list of elements for lawful notarization as published by the American Society of Notaries. The appellant, though, has not given us a sufficient basis to find that the notarization in this case was a forgery done as a favor for his wife or that the requirements for a lawful notarization were not met.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant argues that the outcome of the initial decision was unjust in light of his 40 years of marriage. However, the equities of the situation do not empower OPM or the Board to award monetary benefits in the absence of statutory authorization. A claim for payment of money from the public treasury that is contrary to a statutory appropriation is prohibited by the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7, and the government cannot be estopped from denying benefits not otherwise permitted by law. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 424, 434. (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the consent to waive a survivor annuity for a spouse would ordinarily be provided through an OPM SF-2801-2 form, the waiver is effective if that form is provided to OPM in an incomplete form (lacking notarization), OPM then sends a notice to the annuitant to secure the spouse's signature of OPM Form 1431 that meets the requirements of 5 CFR 831.614(c), and it is then properly completed and returned to OPM. <span class="Italic">Hathaway v. OPM</span>, 118 MSPR 678, 684-85 &#x00B6; 17, 2012 MSPB 128 (2012). Once a retirement application is adjudicated based on a consented waiver of a spousal annuity, the chances of avoiding the election are slim, <span class="Italic">Kievenaar v. OPM</span>, 421 F.3d 1359, 1361-65 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kievenaar's husband, Peter H. Kievenaar, was a civilian employee of the Department of the Navy from 1972 through 2002. With his two years of military service, he had a total of 32 years of federal service, entitling him to retire. On February 22, 2002, in anticipation of his retirement on June 30, 2002, he elected a self-only annuity ("self-only annuity") in accordance with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614 by completing an "Application for Immediate Retirement" under the Civil Service Retirement System. This election provides greater income as compared to the income resulting from a standard "survivor annuity" but payable only during the retiring employee's lifetime. Under a survivor annuity, the amount of the employee's monthly payment is reduced by a factor actuarially computed to fund a survivor annuity for the life of the spouse, should the spouse survive the employee...[5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 8339(j)(1), 8341(b)] provide[s] that the employee and spouse may together waive the spouse's right to the survivor annuity by executing the appropriate written form, thereby giving them a larger current income but leaving the spouse without any survivor annuity should he or she survive the annuitant. <span class="Italic">Carpisassi v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 46 F.3d 1094, 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Kievenaar signed the required "Spouse's Consent to Survivor Election," acknowledging that she freely consented to her spouse's annuity election and that she understood that consent was final. Kievenaar also signed, before a notary public, an attachment to the form in which she consented to her husband's election "to provide no survivor annuity." Kievenaar contends that they were not well informed in retirement matters and she deferred to her husband's judgment in this election, assuming that he was making a reasoned decision. The annuity was to begin after her husband's retirement, on July 1, 2002. Tragically, only three weeks later, her husband unexpectedly died of cardiac arrhythmia.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the self-only annuity left Kievenaar with no spousal annuity, she understandably looked for ways to change the election that she and her husband had previously made under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.614. On September 12, 2002, Kievenaar submitted an application to OPM seeking a survivor annuity. OPM denied the survivor annuity, finding that she had freely consented to her husband's decision to select a self-only annuity. Kievenaar appealed OPM's decision to the Board, which held a telephonic hearing before Chief Administrative Judge William Carroll (the "AJ").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kievenaar presented three principal arguments to the AJ. First, she contended that she and her husband had no understanding of retirement regulations and were not properly counseled by his agency regarding the consequences of their selection. The AJ, <span class="Italic">citing Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414 (1990), rejected this argument because the Board may not make monetary payments not authorized by law, regardless of any error committed by the agency. Second, she argued that, under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621, she should have been allowed to change his election within 30 days after the first regular monthly payment. <span class="Italic">Citing Pruden v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 681, 683 (1995), the AJ held that &#x00A7; 831.621 only permits an employee, and not a spouse, to change an election. Third, Kievenaar argued that because her husband died before the date of OPM's final adjudication of his retirement application, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) applied and would deem her husband to have selected a survivor "alternative form of annuity" ("AFA") regardless of any previous election. That regulation states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Except as provided in paragraph (g), an annuitant who dies before the date of final adjudication is deemed to have made an affirmative election under paragraph (a) with a fully reduced annuity to provide a current spouse annuity, regardless of any election completed under &#x00A7; 831.614 [for a self-only annuity], and the lump-sum credit will be paid in accordance with the order of precedence established under 5 U.S.C. 8342(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) (2002). The AJ disagreed and found that, as argued by OPM, &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) is only applicable to employees who retired between June 5, 1986 and November 30, 1990, and would therefore not apply to Kievenaar's husband, who retired on June 30, 2002. The AJ thus affirmed the decision of the OPM.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kievenaar filed a petition for Board review of the AJ's initial decision. The Board members agreed with the AJ regarding Kievenaar's first two arguments: lack of information cannot change the terms of a valid waiver of survivor annuity benefits, and only Kievenaar's husband had the right to change the annuity election under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.621. However, the two Board members could not agree regarding the applicability of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f). Acting Chairman Neil McPhie noted that there was no language in the regulation limiting its application to employees who retired between June 1986 and November 1990. He, thus, considered the regulation applicable to the facts of this case and effective to provide Kievenaar with a spousal annuity. Board Member Susanne Marshall disagreed, concluding that &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) only related to AFAs and required evidence of a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition to be presented to OPM before retirement. Member Marshall reasoned that, because Kievenaar's husband did not select an AFA initially, and was healthy at the time of his retirement, this subsection would not be applicable. With a lack of consensus between the two reviewing Board members, the initial decision of the AJ became the final decision of the Board pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1200.3(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Applicability of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f)</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kievenaar bases her appeal on the applicability of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(f). This section was intended to provide a safety-net for surviving spouses when an employee dies without selecting an annuity, or dies immediately after retiring without having benefited from the higher monthly payouts <span id="Page_4261"></span>furnished by a self-only annuity. See Retirement; Alternative Forms of Annuity, 51 Fed. Reg. 42,987 (proposed Nov. 28, 1986) (to be codified at 5 C.F.R. pt. 831) ("[i]f a retiree dies before making an election, OPM will deem the annuitant to have elected the full survivor benefit for any current spouse plus the alternative form of annuity (and the lump-sum credit)."). Kievenaar argues that because the regulation makes no mention of a date restriction and was promulgated specifically for those individuals who did not affirmatively elect an AFA during their lifetimes, it should be applicable to her husband and entitle her to a survivor annuity. OPM argues that the regulation is applicable only when a retiree elects an AFA, not a self-only annuity. OPM further argues that &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) is to be read in conjunction with other sections relating to AFAs, and that together they require a showing of a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition. Thus, OPM argues, absent proof of such a medical condition for her husband, Kievenaar is not entitled to receive a spousal survivor annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin with a brief history of the statutory framework underlying the regulation in issue. On June 6, 1986, Congress created AFAs to make additional retirement available to retirees. Federal Employee's Retirement System Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-335, &#x00A7; 204, 100 Stat. 514, 532-33 (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a (2000)). OPM was given administrative authority to prescribe regulations under which employees could elect an AFA. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8343a(a) (2000). In implementing this statute, the OPM promulgated a series of regulations, including &#x00A7; 831.2203(f),[1] under "Subpart V--Alternative Forms of Annuities." Retirement; Alternative Form of Annuity, 51 Fed. Reg. 42,987 (1986) (interim rules with request for comments, Nov. 28, 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When &#x00A7; 8343a was originally enacted, AFAs were an option for all federal employees, Federal Employee's Retirement System Act of 1986 &#x00A7; 204, and, as such, &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) conformed to the intent of Congress as expressed in the language of the statute. In 1990, however, &#x00A7; 8343a was amended in a wide-ranging budget bill. The 1990 amendment, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, enacted subsection (f), which suspended the AFA for five years, beginning December 2, 1990, for all federal employees, with exceptions only for those with serious medical conditions in narrow circumstances in which "equity and good conscience" justified the option. In response, OPM promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203(h), which permitted employees to elect an AFA only if they satisfied the requirements of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(2) and (3). Retirement; Credit For Service And Alternative Forms of Annuity, 56 Fed. Reg. 6,549 (1991) (interim rules with request for comments, Feb. 19, 1991). Sections 831.2207(c)(2) and (3), in turn, defined "life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition" and outlined the evidence required to make the necessary showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Section 831.2203(f) has remained substantially unchanged since its adoption. In 1993, language referring to &#x00A7; 831.607 was eliminated and replaced with the present reference to &#x00A7; 831.614. Payment of Survivor Deposits by Actuarial Reduction, 58 Fed. Reg. 52,877, 52,881 (1993) (interim rules with request for comments, Oct. 13, 1993)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8343a was again amended by Congress in 1993. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-66, &#x00A7; 11002, 107 Stat. 312, 409 (1993). The amendment, entitled "Permanent Elimination of the Alternative-Form-of-Annuity Option Except for Individuals with a Critical Medical Condition," essentially incorporated the restriction in subsection (f) into subsection (a) and eliminated subsection (f). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As stated, subsection (a) originally had established broad AFA eligibility by stating that "an employee or Member may elect annuity benefits under this section." The 1993 amendment, however, changed the language to read, "any employee or Member who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may" elect annuity benefits under this section. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The net effect of the 1993 amendment was to permanently narrow the availability of AFAs to a small group of individuals who suffered from a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition. Congress thus eliminated the AFA for all other employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the amendments to the statute, OPM amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.2203 to add subsection (h)(1)(ii), which permits employees with annuities commencing on or after October 1, 1994 to elect an AFA only if they meet the required showing of a critical medical condition as set forth in &#x00A7; 831.2207(c)(2) and (3). Retirement; Alternative Forms Of Annuity, 60 Fed. Reg. 54,585 (1995) (interim rules with request for comments, Oct. 25, 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 831.2203(f), which remained unchanged following the amendments to &#x00A7; 8343a, is not limited to employees with critical medical conditions. The regulation, by its terms, provides an AFA to any employee who dies of any cause--including accidents unrelated to any health condition--before the date of final adjudication of an election previously made. Thus, the regulation would permit results beyond those authorized by Congress in the amended statute. Where regulations and statutes are in conflict, regulations must necessarily yield. <span class="Italic">K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc.,</span> 486 U.S. 281, 294 (1988) (holding a C.F.R. provision invalid because it conflicted with the unequivocal language of the statute); <span class="Italic">Brush v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 982 F.2d 1554, 1560 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (holding a C.F.R. provision invalid because it did not "comport with the clear statutory mandate"). Because &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) conflicts with and is no longer supported by the amendments to &#x00A7; 8343a, it is ineffective. Resort to that regulation to affect an AFA following the effective dates of amendments is foreclosed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Kievenaar's husband completed the annuity paperwork in February 2002. His annuity was to begin on July 1, 2002, and he died suddenly on July 22, 2002. Thus, his annuity commenced at a time when &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) was ineffective. While we are sympathetic to Kievenaar's position, we have no alternative but to conclude that she is not eligible for the AFA she seeks.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the unavailability of &#x00A7; 831.2203(f) during the period relevant to Kievenaar is dispositive of her case, we need not and do not decide the issue of validity of the regulation prior to the effective dates of the amendments to &#x00A7; 8343a.</p>
