<section>
<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-85"><span class="space">a.</span> Waiver or Forgiveness of Delayed Exception; Equitable Tolling</h5>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7122(b):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed under subsection (a) of this section during the 30-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding. An agency shall take the actions required by an arbitrator's final award. The award may include the payment of backpay (as provided in section 5596 of this title).</p>
<p class="noindent">Timeliness of an exception is governed by, 5 CFR 2429.23 (2022), provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, and notwithstanding &#x00A7; 2429.21(b) of this subchapter, the Authority or General Counsel, or their designated representatives, as appropriate, may extend any time limit provided in this subchapter for good cause shown, and shall notify the parties of any such extension. Requests for extensions of time shall be in writing and received by the appropriate official not later than five (5) days before the established time limit for filing, shall state the position of the other parties on the request for extension, and shall be served on the other parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(b)&#x2003;Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, the Authority or General Counsel, or their designated representatives, as appropriate, may waive any expired time limit in this subchapter in extraordinary circumstances. Request for a waiver of time limits shall state the position of the other parties and shall be served on the other parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(c)&#x2003;The time limits established in this subchapter may not be extended or waived in any manner other than that described in this subchapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">(d)&#x2003;Time limits established in 5 U.S.C. 7105(f) [unit determinations], 7117(c)(2) [negotiability determinations] and 7122(b) [exceptions to arbitration awards] may not be extended or waived under this section.</p>
<p class="noindent">The time limit for filing exceptions is statutory. Timeliness of other submissions is regulatory; the regulations can be waived for good cause. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Bragg and AGE Local 1770</span>, 70 FLRA 172, 173 (2017) (allowing a late response to an FLRA case processing order when there was a significant issue to be decided: a plausible jurisdictional defect involving an interlocutory award that decided the grievants' unit status).</p>
<p class="noindent">Through 2015 FLRA determined that there was no leeway for a late exception--no equitable adjustments for what it considered a statutory limitation on Authority jurisdiction. FLRA was not empowered to extend or waive the statutory time limit for exceptions. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 147 and DHEW, SSA, San Francisco</span>, 1 FLRA 115, 115 (1979).</p>
<p class="noindent">Times change. The law changed. The government furloughs of 2014, and reexamination of the law, led FLRA to conclude that equitable tolling could permit filings of exceptions after the 30-day statutory limit. The change occurred in <span class="Italic">VAMC Richmond and AFGE Local 2145</span>, 68 FLRA 231, 232-234 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator served his award on the parties by mail on September 5, 2013. Under &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Statute and pertinent sections of the Authority's Regulations, without equitable modification, the period for filing an exception to the award would have ended on October 15, 2013. Although the Agency did not file its exception until October 18, 2013, the Agency contended that the exception was "timely filed...due to the...shutdown" from October 1 through October 16, 2013. The Union's opposition did not address the exception's timeliness. The Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication ordered the Agency to show cause why its exception should not be dismissed as untimely, and to address whether the Authority should apply equitable tolling to the filing period. The Agency filed a response to the order. Although the Union had an opportunity to reply to the Agency's response, the Union did not do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7122(b) of the Statute states that "[i]f no exception to an arbitrator's award is filed...during the [thirty]-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party, the award shall be final and binding."

<p class="noindent-1">But since <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court has clarified the analysis for determining whether a statutory filing deadline is jurisdictional. Specifically, the Court has set forth a "readily administrable" bright-line rule: If Congress "<span class="Italic">clearly states</span> that a threshold limitation...shall count as jurisdictional," then it will be treated as such.[13] Otherwise, a limitation should be treated as "non-jurisdictional in character."[14] For example, the Court has stated that, ordinarily, "time prescriptions...are not properly typed jurisdictional."[15] Further, a "condition should [not] be ranked as jurisdictional merely because it promotes important congressional objectives."[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">HUD</span>, the Authority concluded that the filing period in &#x00A7; 7122(b) is jurisdictional because the Statute's structure and legislative history "disclose[d] that Congress'[s] intent regarding the arbitration process is to promote its primacy and finality by limited, expeditious review by the Authority."[17] But as the Supreme Court's precedent since <span class="Italic">HUD</span> has emphasized, a limitation is not jurisdictional merely because it furthers important policy objectives.[18] And with regard to the Court's bright-line rule for jurisdictional limitations--which, we note, the dissent ignores entirely--the Statute's text does not contain a clear statement that &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s filing period is jurisdictional.[19] Rather, the thirty-day period in &#x00A7; 7122(b) resembles a "filing deadline[&#8197;],"[20] which the Supreme Court has characterized as a "quintessential claim-processing rule[&#8197;],"[21] rather than a jurisdictional requirement.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In addition, &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s legislative history does not show that the exceptions-filing period is jurisdictional. Although the congressional conference report on the Statute indicates that &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s purpose is to "make clear that the awards of arbitrators, when they become final, are not subject to further review by any other authority or administrative body, including the Comptroller General,"[23] that statement does not clearly indicate that &#x00A7; 7122(b) contains a jurisdictional limitation. And even if the conference report were ambiguous, Congress later amended &#x00A7; 7122(b) to clarify its intent that parties enjoy a full thirty days to file exceptions to arbitration awards.[24] Specifically, Congress changed the starting date for the exceptions-filing period from the date of the award itself to the date on which the arbitrator served the award on the parties, in order to prevent mailing delays from shortening the filing period.[25] That amendment shows that Congress did not intend for parties to lose part of the thirty-day filing period due to circumstances beyond their control. This legislative history supports treating &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s deadline as a non-jurisdictional limit that may be equitably tolled to ensure parties a full thirty days to file exceptions to arbitration awards.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the thirty-day filing period in &#x00A7; 7122(b) is not a jurisdictional limit, and we overrule <span class="Italic">HUD</span> and other Authority precedent to the contrary. Moreover, we find that &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s non-jurisdictional filing period is subject to equitable tolling. In that regard, the dissent's attempt to distinguish the Supreme Court precedent on which we rely is unpersuasive.[26] Specifically, the dissent fails to explain why we should not follow the Supreme Court's repeated instructions that statutory filing deadlines are presumptively claims-processing rules, rather than jurisdictional restrictions.[27]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In finding that HUD should be overruled, we have not overlooked that, under &#x00A7; 2429.23(d) of the Authority's Regulations, the "[t]ime limit[&#8197;] established in...[&#x00A7;] 7122(b) may not be extended or waived."[28] And we acknowledge that the Authority has sometimes conflated <span class="Italic">extending</span> or <span class="Italic">waiving</span> the time limit for filing exceptions with <span class="Italic">equitably tolling</span> the filing period for exceptions.[29] But those are distinct concepts. In that regard, the Authority may extend an unexpired filing period for "good cause"[30] and may waive certain expired time limits in "extraordinary circumstances."[31] But in contrast to an extension, equitable tolling operates without the Authority's advance approval and (as discussed further below) requires a much higher showing than "good cause." And in contrast to a waiver, equitable tolling does not excuse an expired time limit but, rather, pauses the running of a filing period so that a time limit does not expire when it otherwise would. Because of these distinctions, &#x00A7; 2429.23(d)'s prohibition on extending or waiving the time limit for filing arbitration exceptions does not preclude applying equitable tolling to &#x00A7; 7122(b)'s filing period, if tolling is otherwise appropriate.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency contends that equitable tolling is warranted due to the shutdown. Based on case law from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, the Authority has previously examined five factors to determine whether to equitably toll a filing deadline.[32] But the Supreme Court's decisions regarding equitable tolling do not employ those factors. Rather, the Supreme Court recognizes two basic requirements for equitable tolling: (1) that some extraordinary circumstances stood in a party's way to "prevent[&#8197;] timely filing"; and (2) that the party was "pursuing [its] rights diligently."[33] (Although the dissent implies that equitable tolling should apply only in "very specific situations," such as those that the dissent identifies,[34] the Supreme Court's equitable-tolling case law does not support the dissent's implication.) Further, both the Merit Systems Protection Board[35] and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission[36] rely on those two requirements to evaluate requests for equitable tolling. To bring the Authority's equitable-tolling case law into accord with the guidance of the Supreme Court and the practices of other administrative agencies, we will rely on the two requirements above to evaluate the Agency's equitable-tolling request.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As to whether extraordinary circumstances stood in the way of the Agency's timely filing, we note that the Authority suspended normal operations from October 1 through October 16, 2013, due to the shutdown. There is no dispute that, during the same period, the Agency's representative could not perform Agency work and, consequently, could not file an exception with the Authority. Thus, we find that the shutdown was an extraordinary circumstance that prevented the Agency from filing its exception for sixteen days--specifically, from October 1 through October 16.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Concerning the Agency's diligence in pursuing its rights, the Agency's exception was postmarked on October 18, just one day after the President signed into law the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014,[40] which permitted normal federal government operations to resume. The Agency's prompt filing after the end of the shutdown shows diligence and supports applying equitable tolling here.[41] Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the Authority gave the Union an opportunity to reply to the Agency's request for equitable tolling, and the Union did not reply to challenge the request. Considering the Agency's diligent pursuit of its rights, we find that the filing period for the Agency's exception was equitably tolled from October 1 through October 16.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In finding that equitable tolling applies here, we reject the dissent's contrary approach: insisting that the exceptions-filing deadline is a jurisdictional limit that cannot be tolled, while simultaneously tolling it. The dissent attempts to reconcile those two conflicting conclusions based on the purportedly "obvious and simple" theory that the federal government was "frozen in time" during the shutdown. According to the dissent, because "time stopped" in October 2013, there is no need for any further analysis to find that the exception in this case is timely. This theory has no basis in law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As mentioned previously, the Arbitrator served his award on the parties by mail on September 5, 2013. After equitably tolling the exceptions-filing period for the duration of the shutdown, and consistent with the deadline-calculation methods set forth in &#x00A7; 2429.21 of the Authority's Regulations, the Agency had until October 28, 2013, to timely file its exception. And because the Agency's exception was postmarked October 18, 2013, consistent with the foregoing analysis, the exception was timely filed.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator served his award on the parties by e-mail on July 25, 2014. To be timely, any exceptions to the award had to be postmarked by the U.S. Postal Service, filed in person with the Authority, deposited with a commercial delivery service, or filed electronically through use of the Federal Labor Relations Authority's (FLRA's) eFiling system no later than August 25, 2014. Documents filed electronically through use of the <span id="page_1825"></span>FLRA's eFiling system are considered filed on a particular day if they are filed "no later than midnight E.T. on that day."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed its exceptions electronically using the FLRA's eFiling system at 12:06 <span class="small-d">A.M</span>. E.T. on August 26, 2014--six minutes after the deadline had expired. The Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication (CIP) issued an order directing the Union to show cause why its exceptions should not be dismissed as untimely. The Union filed a timely response to the CIP order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusions</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its response to the order to show cause the Union concedes that its filing was untimely, but contends that the circumstances warrant "a waiver of the filing deadline. The Union asserts that its exceptions were "finalized" and "ready to be filed" at 11:55 <span class="small-d">P.M</span>. E.T. on August 25, 2014, but the Union's representative encountered an "unexpected[&#8197;]...error that ended his eFiling session, but for which he would have timely filed the Union's exceptions. According to the Union, the error "kicked the Union['s] representative out of the eFiling system" at 11:55 <span class="small-d">P.M</span>. E.T. The representative was unable to log back into the eFiling system, so he requested a new password. The Union's representative received a new password at 12:01 <span class="small-d">A.M</span>. E.T. on August 26, 2014, and he filed the Union's exceptions at 12:06 <span class="small-d">A.M</span>. E.T. that same day. The Union contends that, because the Union's representative exercised "[d]ue diligence" to timely file the exceptions, the Authority should waive the expired time limit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the Authority's Regulations provide that the time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award, including exceptions filed electronically using the FLRA's eFiling system, may not be extended or waived. In this regard, &#x00A7; 7122(b) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute states that exceptions to an arbitrator's award must be filed "during the [thirty]-day period beginning on the date the award is served on the party," and &#x00A7; 2429.23(d) of the Authority's Regulations provides that the "[t]ime limit[&#8197;] established in...[&#x00A7;] 7122(b) may not be extended or waived." Moreover, neither provision contains any exception for exceptions filed electronically using the FLRA's eFiling system.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dissent would equitably toll the filing period for the Union's exceptions, based on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of VA, Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia</span> (<span class="Italic">VA</span>).[12] We do not agree that equitable tolling is appropriate here. As an initial matter, unlike the excepting party in <span class="Italic">VA</span>--which argued that its exceptions should be considered timely due to a government shutdown--the Union concedes that its exceptions are untimely, and requests a waiver of the expired filing deadline. As the Authority held in VA, equitable tolling and waiver of an expired filing deadline are "distinct concepts." Thus, we do not view the Union's request for <span class="Italic">waiving the expired deadline</span> as being akin to a request to treat the Union's exceptions as timely (by finding that the deadline was <span class="Italic">equitably tolled</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[12]&#x2003;68 FLRA 231, 232-34 (2015) (Member Pizzella dissenting).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, even if we were to apply the test for equitable tolling here, we would find that its requirements are not met. This two-pronged test requires that: (1) some extraordinary circumstance stood in a party's way to prevent timely filing; and (2) the party was pursuing its rights diligently. In <span class="Italic">VA</span>, the Authority adopted this standard in light of the government shutdown of October 2013, which it found to be an "extraordinary circumstance" beyond the control of the agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the "unexpected[&#8197;]...error" that allegedly "kicked the Union representative out of the FLRA's eFiling system"--which the Union has not substantiated with any evidence--is not an "extraordinary circumstance" that warrants application of the narrow doctrine of equitable tolling. A computer error causing a delay of only a few minutes is not an "extraordinary circumstance" as was the sixteen-day government-wide shutdown in <span class="Italic">VA</span>. Nor is it, contrary to what the dissent argues, similar to the facts in <span class="Italic">U.S. DOJ, Federal BOP, Federal Correctional Complex, Coleman, Florida</span> (<span class="Italic">DOJ</span>).[22] In that case, a snowstorm caused a federal-government closure for the entire day on the last day for filing an exception, rendering it physically impossible for the respondent's exception to be hand-delivered to the Authority. Additionally, the filing party's counsel in that case was not registered to file case documents electronically, and the storm occurred on a Monday, preventing that counsel from anticipating the need to bring his files home before the weekend. Much like the government shutdown, that weather-related closure was completely outside of the filing party's control. Here, on the contrary, the circumstances were well within the Union's control: had the Union finalized its exceptions more than five minutes before the midnight filing deadline, any error encountered with the eFiling system would have been inconsequential. (Moreover, we note that <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> was an unfair-labor-practice (ULP) case where the Authority addressed the standards for waiving an expired deadline--which is permitted for filing exceptions in ULP cases, unlike exceptions in arbitration cases--and did not involve equitable tolling. Thus, <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> is distinguishable on that basis as well.)</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, it is unclear whether the alleged difficulty in timely filing in this case was caused by the eFiling system or by the Union's own error. Although the dissent states, "there are no Authority records rebutting [the Union's] sworn statement" that the Union was not responsible for the alleged error, there is also no evidence to confirm the dissent's position that "the Union was not at fault." Contrary to the dissent's approach, we find that the burden for establishing "extraordinary circumstances" lies not with the Authority, but with the party requesting that the Authority grant this relief. As the Union has failed to satisfy this burden, the first prong of the equitable tolling standard is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second prong--that the party was pursuing its rights diligently--is also not satisfied. The dissent opines that "the Union diligently filed its exceptions as soon as possible." However, the Union concedes that it did not finalize its exceptions until five minutes before the midnight filing deadline. While a party "rightfully" may use every minute of the thirty-day period for filing its exceptions, a party also must accept responsibility for the increased potential that a minor, ordinary obstacle could prove fatal to their ability to file a timely exception. This is particularly true where the filing party waits until five minutes before the midnight deadline--after the Authority's close of business (when the filing party otherwise could have asked for CIP's assistance)--on the last day of the filing period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that, even if the equitable-tolling doctrine were properly raised here, it would not apply under these circumstances. Accordingly, we dismiss the Union's exceptions as untimely.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency filed its exceptions electronically using the Authority's eFiling system on January 10, 2019. Because the Agency's exceptions appeared to be untimely, the Authority's Office of Case Intake and Publication (CIP) issued an order to show cause (the order) why the Agency's exceptions should not be dismissed. The Agency filed a timely response to the order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its response to the order (Agency's response), the Agency argued that circumstances warrant equitable tolling of the filing deadline because: (1) the Agency representative was out of the office on the day the award was served and nobody else in her office received it; (2) the Agency representative was on leave for portions of the filing period; (3) assigning the exceptions to another representative would have prejudiced the Agency; and (4) the one-day delay in filing the exceptions caused no prejudice to the Authority or the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The time limit for filing exceptions to an arbitration award is thirty days "after the date of service of the award."[4] The Authority may not extend or waive this time limit.[5] However, the time limit may be equitably tolled if a party demonstrates that: (1) some extraordinary circumstance stood in its way to prevent timely filing; and (2) the party was pursuing its rights diligently.[6]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Arbitrator served the award by email on December 10, 2018. Therefore, any exceptions to the award were required to be filed with the Authority no later than January 9, 2019. The Agency's exceptions were filed using the Authority's eFiling website on January 10--one day late. The Agency argues that extraordinary circumstances prevented it from filing the exceptions until January 10, and that it was pursuing its rights diligently.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Agency argues that its representative was out of the office unexpectedly because of a death in her family on the date that the Arbitrator emailed the award. According to the Agency, the representative did not learn of the award's service until December 12, 2018, the day she returned to the office. The Agency also claims that the representative was then out of the office on previously scheduled "use or lose" annual leave on December 17, 2018 and from December 26, 2018 through January 4, 2019. The Agency asserts that it diligently pursued its rights because when the representative returned to the office on January 7, 2019, she "thereafter prepared and filed" the Agency's exceptions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously held that a representative's absence from the office due to work obligations or leave does not demonstrate "extraordinary circumstances."[13] Here, although the representative was out of the office on the day the award was emailed, she received the award two days later, well in advance of the deadline. And she returned from her "use or lose" leave two days before the exceptions were due. Therefore, the Agency could have timely filed its exceptions but it did <span id="page_1826"></span>not do so.[14] Moreover, while the Agency asserts that the representative "had a good faith belief that she was filing the [e]xceptions on the correct due date," the Authority has held that a party's miscalculation of time limits does not demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.[16]</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[14]&#x2003;In a declaration attached to the Agency's response, the representative states that "Agency officials did not decide to file [e]xceptions until December 20, 2018." However, the Agency's delayed decision cannot reasonably be considered an extraordinary circumstance that prevented the Agency from filing on time. Rather, the Agency "acted at its own peril" by not making its decision earlier in the filing period. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard</span>, 70 FLRA 429, 430 (2018) (<span class="Italic">Portsmouth</span>) (Member DuBester concurring). Regardless, the Agency still had time after December 20 to prepare and file timely exceptions, the representative's leave notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency asserts, without explanation, that assigning a different representative to work on the exceptions would have been prejudicial to the Agency. Consequently, we reject the Agency's argument as a bare assertion.[18]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[18]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., Portsmouth</span>, 70 FLRA at 430.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency claims that the one-day filing delay did not prejudice the Authority or the Union. For support, the Agency cites the lapse in appropriations that shut down the Authority from late December until mid-January. The Agency also contends that, despite the Agency's delay, the Union filed its opposition three days before it was due. These arguments are unavailing. The Authority expressly notified parties, on its website, that no extension of time would be granted for filing exceptions during the time the Authority was shut down. And the Union's ability to file a timely opposition does not relieve the Agency of the burden to demonstrate that some extraordinary circumstance stood in the Agency's way to prevent timely filing. Here, the Agency has not demonstrated that any extraordinary circumstance prevented it from timely filing its exceptions.[23]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;Because we find that the Agency has not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances, we find it unnecessary to address whether the Agency pursued its rights diligently.</p>

The Agency asserts that this case is distinguishable from prior Authority decisions because here, unlike in those decisions, the Agency's mailroom "violat[ed]...its operating procedures" by not postmarking the opposition April 9, 2012. But the Agency provides no basis for finding that its mailroom's alleged failure to follow Agency procedures is a relevant consideration. With regard to the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Local 1770</span>, 64 FLRA at 954-55, that decision is inapposite because it involved a delivery failure by the U.S. Postal Service, not an agency's internal mailroom."); <span class="Italic">Int'l Org. of Masters, Mates and Pilots and Panama Canal Comm'n</span>, 49 FLRA 1370, 1371 (1994) (Department of State "Diplomatic Pouch" mailing was treated as internal mail system).</p>
