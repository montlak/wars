<h3 class="h3" id="sec10-88"><span class="space">B.</span> BUMPING</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 351.701(b) (2022) provides</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Lower subgroup--bumping</span>. A released employee shall be assigned in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section and bump to a position that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Is held by another employee in a lower tenure group or in a lower subgroup within the same tenure group; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is no more than three grades (or appropriate grade intervals or equivalent) below the position from which the employee was released.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee must be qualified for the position sought through assignment rights, 5 CFR 351.701(a):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">General</span>. When a group I or II competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful (Level 2) or equivalent, or higher, is released from a competitive level, an agency shall offer assignment, rather than furlough or separate, in accordance with paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to another competitive position which requires no reduction, or the lease possible reduction, in representative rate. The employee must be qualified for the offered position. The offered position shall be in the same competitive area, last at least 3 months, and have the same type of work schedule (e.g., full-time, part-time, intermittent, or seasonal) as the position from which the employee is released. Upon accepting an offer of assignment, or displacing another employee under this part, an employee retains the same status and tenure in the new position. The promotion potential of the offered position is not a consideration in determining an employee's right of assignment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 351.702 (2022) establishes the qualifications for assignment rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Qualifications for assignment</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Except as provided in &#x00A7; 351.703, an employee is qualified for assignment under &#x00A7; 351.701 if the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Meets the OPM standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum educational requirement, and any selective placement factors established by the agency;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Meets any special qualifying condition which the OPM has approved for the position; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;Has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption. This determination includes recency of experience, when appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;The sex of an employee may not be considered in determining whether an employee is qualified for a position, except for positions which OPM has determined certification of eligibles by sex is justified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;An employee who is released from a competitive level during a leave of absence because of a compensable injury may not be denied an assignment right solely because the employee is not physically qualified for the duties of the position if the physical disqualification resulted from the compensable injury. Such an employee must be afforded appropriate assignment rights subject to recovery as provided by 5 U.S.C. 8151 and part 353 of this chapter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;If an agency determines, on the basis of evidence before it, that a preference eligible employee who has a compensable service-connected disability of 30 percent or more is not able to fulfill the physical requirements of a position to which the employee would otherwise have been assigned under this part, the agency must notify the OPM of this determination. At the same time, the agency must notify the employee of the reasons for the determination and of the right to respond, within 15 days of the notification, to the OPM which will require the agency to demonstrate that the notification was timely sent to the employee's last known address. The OPM shall make a final determination concerning the physical ability of the employee to perform the duties of the position. This determination must be made before the agency may select any other person for the position. When the OPM has completed its review of the proposed disqualification on the basis of physical disability, it must sent its finding to both the agency and the employee. The agency must comply with the findings of the OPM. The functions of the OPM under this paragraph may not be delegated to an agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;An agency may formally designate as a trainee or developmental position a position in a program with all of the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;The program must have been designed to meet the agency's needs and requirements for the development of skilled personnel;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The program must have been formally designated, with its provisions made known to employees and supervisors;</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The bumping right is described by <span class="Italic">Bergquist v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 87 MSPR 605, 607-08 &#x00B6; 5 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who has been reached for release in a properly conducted RIF has certain assignment rights, including a right to "bump" an employee whose position has not been abolished but who is in a lower tenure group or lower subgroup in the same tenure group. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(b). An employee is qualified for assignment to an occupied position under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.701(b) if <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> he has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to perform satisfactorily the duties of the position without undue interruption. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.702; <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Department of <span id="Page_3087"></span>the Army,</span> 84 M.S.P.R. 476, 488-89 (1999). In a RIF appeal, the agency bears the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it properly applied RIF regulations, including proving that it properly afforded the appellant his assignment rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The employee has no right to bump someone in his own tenure group and subgroup. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Warren v. DOD</span>, 87 MSPR 426, 432-33 &#x00B6; 13 (2001) ("The record showed that the appellant and Miller were both in tenure group I and subgroup B. Thus...appellant had no 'bump' assignment right to the position that Miller encumbered."); <span class="Italic">Greathouse v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 534, 537 (1997) (the appellant was in tenure group I, subgroup A; he could not bump because other employees were in the same tenure group and subgroup); <span class="Italic">Hughes v. Comm'n on Civil Rights</span>, 35 MSPR 120, 122 (1987) (appellant could not bump into a position held by another employee in the same tenure group and subgroup). Under <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 21 MSPR 574, 579 (1984), an agency is required to make an assignment involving displacement of an employee only when the employee who qualifies for the assignment has a retention subgroup higher than the employee being displaced. Under <span class="Italic">Coleman</span>, it is not a violation of RIF regulations for the agency to fail to offer the appellant assignment to the position of an employee in the same retention subgroup.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Retention standing is relevant to retreat rights, but not to bumping. The bumping right is based on subgroup superiority. <span class="Italic">Berry v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 20 MSPR 507, 509 (1984). If the appellant and a competing employee occupy the same subgroup, the agency may assign either to a position within the qualifications of both employees, regardless of the employee's standing on the retention register. <span class="Italic">Scott v. NTSB</span>, 21 MSPR 211, 213 (1984). It is the appellant's claim that is evaluated against that of the retained employee. That an individual is separated with assignment rights superior to the appellant's is immaterial if the other individual does not appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Acerno v. DHHS</span>, 815 F.2d 680 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Under 5 CFR 351.705(a)(1) (2022), an agency has the discretion to adopt a procedure permitting a competing employee to displace an employee with lower retention standing in the same subgroup if it cannot make an equally reasonable assignment by displacing an employee in a lower subgroup. There is no distinction in assignment rights between positions with promotion potential and those that have none. <span class="Italic">Gilbert v. FAA</span>, 21 MSPR 108, 112 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sheehan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 494-95 (1995) (disability case involving assignment rights, noting the application of <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span> in RIF appeals). An agency is not required to assign an employee to a position if the assignment would constitute a promotion. <span class="Italic">Green v. DLA</span>, 26 MSPR 649, 653 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McNamara v. Dick</span>, 323 F.2d 276, 282 (D.C. Cir. 1963) ("In a reduction in force, persons in each grade or rating compete with others in that grade; the process does not permit persons in lower grades to compete at a higher level and thus gain a promotion.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assignment rights are satisfied in a RIF through an offer at the highest representative rate within the appellant's entitlement. The employee is not entitled to a position outside the competitive area identical to the one he loses in the RIF. He is entitled to one proper offer and he has no right to a choice of positions. <span class="Italic">Gayheart v. Dept. of Army</span>, 12 MSPR 300, 302 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jorgenson v. USDA</span>, 22 MSPR 207, 209 (1984) ("Appellant had no right to select among available positions."); <span class="Italic">Etter v.

Dept. of Army</span>, 4 MSPR 419, 421, 4 MSPB 472 (1980) (requirement that an employee be offered the best available position requires that the offered position involve no reduction, or the least possible reduction, in the representative rate). <span class="Italic">Endsley v. Dept. of Army</span>, 55 MSPR 46, 49 (1992), elaborated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A basic principle of law applicable to reductions in force is that an employee's assignment right is determined by a specific representative rate, not to any particular position. An employee simply has no right to choose the position he or she wants at that representative rate. In other words, an employee is entitled to only one proper offer and has no right to a choice of positions. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701; <span class="Italic">Jorgenson v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 22 MSPR 207, 209 (1984); <span class="Italic">Edlin v. National Aeronautics and Space Administration</span>, 18 MSPR 654, 659 (1984); <span class="Italic">Etter v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 14 MSPR 367, 369 (1983); <span class="Italic">Gayheart v. Department of the Army</span>, 12 MSPR 300, 302 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the agency acted in bad faith when it assigned her to a particular WG-5 position. We do not reject the possibility that an appellant might, under other circumstances, be able to establish that an agency's offer was made in bad faith, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Sarich v. Department of the Interior</span>, 12 MSPR 144, 148 (1982); <span class="Italic">Head v. Department of the Army</span>, 4 MSPR 240, 243 (1980), such as where she can show that the agency has made an offer that it knew or should have known she would not or could not accept, thereby allowing it to circumvent the regulations and effectuate her removal. We find, however, that the appellant's claims that she would have earned overtime pay if she had been assigned to a different WG-5 position, and that she may, in the future, suffer adversely, should subsequent RIFs occur, far too speculative to establish that her placement was made in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holland v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 269, 274 &#x00B6; 12 (1999) ("If the agency had discretionary leeway to reach more than one proper outcome in determining appellant Richardson's assignments rights, the Board would lack authority to retroactively decide her RIF assignment rights.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of analysis of bumping rights is <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 476, 488-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-29 (1999), also exploring the relation between assessment of qualifications for determination of a competitive level and an assignment right:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also alleged that the agency violated his assignment rights because it failed to assign him to one of the GS-0802-11 Civil Engineering Technician positions that survived the RIF. The agency admitted that the incumbents of these positions were within tenure group I subgroup B and that they had lower retention standing than the appellant. The appellant was a group I competitive service employee with a current annual performance rating of record of minimally successful or higher and was released from his competitive level. Thus, because the GS-0802-11 positions required no reduction in the appellant's representative rate, and they were held by other employees in a lower subgroup within the appellant's same tenure group, the appellant was entitled to bump to one of these positions if he was qualified for the position. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.701(a), (b). An employee is qualified for assignment to an occupied position under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 251.701 if: (1) The employee meets the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) standards and requirements for the position, including any minimum education requirements, and any selective placement factors established by the agency; (2) the employee is physically qualified, with reasonable accommodation where appropriate, to perform the duties of the position; (3) the employee meets any special qualifying condition which OPM has approved for the position; and (4) the employee has the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption, taking into account the recency of the experience, when appropriate. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a). The agency did not assign the appellant to either of the technician positions that survived the RIF because it concluded that the appellant did not possess the specialized experience necessary to qualify for the positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant raises the issue of his assignment rights, the burden is on the agency to prove that it properly followed the RIF regulations in effecting the appellant's assignment. <span class="Italic">Lewellen v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 25 MSPR 525, 526 (1985). In determining whether the agency afforded the appellant his proper assignment rights, the Board must conduct a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review to determine whether the agency has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant did not have "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4); <span class="Italic">see Chambers v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 77 MSPR 337, 342 (1998) ("The determination of an employee's qualification for assignment under section 351.702(a) is within the agency's discretion, subject to review by the Board under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard."); <span class="Italic">Buckler v. FRTIB,</span> 73 MSPR 476, 492-93 (1997) (as to agency qualification determinations: "[t]he clear language of the regulation does not require the Board to afford the agency's determination deference and, even assuming that it did, such deference would be inconsistent with the statutory preponderance of the evidence of review that the Board is obliged to apply in RIF appeals"). The RIF regulations define "undue interruption" as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a degree of interruption that would prevent the completion of required work by the employee 90 days after the employee has been placed in a different position under this part. The 90-day standard should be considered within the allowable limits of time and quality, taking into account the pressures of priorities, deadlines, and other demands. However, a work program would generally not be unduly interrupted even if an employee needed more than 90 days after the reduction in force to perform the optimum quality or quantity of work. The 90-day standard may be extended if placement is made under this part to a low priority program or to a vacant position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.203. For the purposes of a RIF, the Board has interpreted the phrase "without undue interruption" to mean without any loss to productivity beyond that normally expected in the orientation of any new, but fully qualified employee. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 77 MSPR 271, 276 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to establish his qualifications for the encumbered technician positions, the appellant submitted a copy of an SF 171 that listed his prior work experience and his educational background. According to this form, the appellant was awarded an associate's degree in Civil Engineering Technology in 1974, and he had completed 29 semester hours towards a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering. Aside from the 10 years of experience the appellant had as a GS-11 Civil Engineering Technician/Cost Engineer, the appellant's work experience included the following: (1) 7 years as a GS-8 Civil Engineering Technician/Hydrology and Hydraulic Technician, (2) more than 2 years as a GS-5 Civil Engineering Technician in a structural engineering division, (3) more than I year as a GS-5 Engineering Draftsman, (4) approximately 6 months as a GS-5 Civil Engineering Technician responsible for inspections to ensure that projects complied with approved permits, (5) approximately 9 months as an Engineer Technician/Technical Writer, (6) approximately 21 months <span id="Page_3088"></span>as a Field Engineer, and (7) approximately 21 months as a draftsman for the U.S. Navy. The record also contains various documents that described the training the appellant received over the years. These documents showed that the appellant attended training courses in contracting, cost engineering, water surface profiling, and work safety, as well as other courses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that it is unclear whether the agency had the benefit of the appellant's SF 171 at the time it determined whether he was qualified for Ford's position. <span class="Italic">See Gregg v. Department of the Navy,</span> 71 MSPR 127, 133 (1996) (during a RIF, an agency may set a specific, and uniformly enforced cutoff date for the submission of updated qualification statements, and once it establishes such a date, the agency acts properly in considering only that personnel information it receives as of this date). However, because the appellant garnered the prior work experience relevant to Ford's position while he was working for the agency in the Charleston District, even if the agency did not have the benefit of the appellant's SF-171 prior to the RIF, we find that it is reasonable to impute constructive knowledge of this experience to the agency in this case.[3] The agency did not demonstrate that, in assessing the appellant's qualifications for positions to which he could have been assigned, it considered the experience the appellant may have garnered from other positions to which he had been assigned. <span class="Italic">Cf. Anderson v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 16, 19-20 (1997) (where the agency's evidence demonstrated that it considered the appellant's prior experience in all of the positions to which the appellant was assigned for periods of 90 days or more, the agency's evidence supported its conclusion that the appellant's experience did not entitle him to positions involving substantially different knowledge, skills and abilities than those reflected in his employment record).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant's Official Personnel Folder (OPF), which is maintained by the agency, should have included documents that listed his prior federal service. Pursuant to 5 CFR &#x00A7; 293.304, the head of each agency is required to maintain an OPF that contains long-term records affecting the employee's status and service as required by OPM's instructions and as designated in the Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping. According to this guide, the appellant's OPF should have included forms documenting his prior service with the agency and other federal agencies including a standard form (SF) 144, Statement of Prior Federal Service, and SF 50's, Notifications of Personnel Actions. The Guide to Personnel Recordkeeping, Tables 3-B, 3-F.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The first position for which the appellant claimed he was qualified was the technician position encumbered by Gloria Wallace. The job description for this position stated that the incumbent "[s]erves as a Project Manager for Engineering Services, including in-house and [Architect/Engineer] design for Civil Works, Military Projects, SRP, and work for others." The incumbent was also "responsible for managing and coordinating the planning and design of facilities of substantial complexity and variety, possibly in a number of locations, or under control of a number of different activity managers." The agency determined that the appellant did not qualify for this position because he did not possess the specialized experience required to perform as a Project Manager in the areas of design for civil works, military projects and work for others; material examination and analysis to ensure adequacy and completeness of technical contributions, benefits and costs, conformance with policy, compatibility with needs and planning, and editorial correctness, clarity, arrangement, etc.; contract administration and supervision; and work with specialty areas such as real estate, geology, hydrology, structural, etc., to resolve conflicts, discrepancies, and variances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted evidence that would suggest that he had either practical experience or training in at least some of the areas in which the agency found him unqualified for this position. For example, the appellant had work experience in the specialty areas of hydrology and structural engineering, as a Cost Engineer he was required to have a practical knowledge of the principles of engineering design and construction methods, and he had attended some training concerning contracting principles. We are not convinced that the appellant's general knowledge of engineering design and construction methods would allow him to manage and coordinate the planning and design of facilities of substantial complexity and variety with no more interruption than would be expected of a new, but fully qualified, employee. Therefore, with respect to the Civil Engineering Technician position encumbered by Gloria Wallace, we find that the agency established by a preponderance of the evidence that the appellant did not have "the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed that he was qualified for the Civil Engineering Technician position encumbered by Abbigail Ford. In describing the reason that the appellant was not assigned to this position, Ramona Shook, the civilian personnel representative for the Charleston District, stated that it was "apparent that [the appellant] was in a specialized estimating position which was not expansive enough to fully qualify for the positions of Wallace and Ford without undue interruption." The agency's reliance on the differences in the various GS-0802-11 job descriptions may have been sufficient to justify placing the various positions in different competitive levels for the purposes of the RIF. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.403(a)(1).[4] However, for the purposes of determining an individual's assignment rights, the agency must look beyond the individual's position description and assess the individual's capacity, adaptability, and special skills. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a)(4). Thus, even if the agency properly placed the appellant's position in a different competitive level than Ford's position, the appellant was entitled to bump into Ford's position if he could satisfactorily perform the duties of the position without undue interruption. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;This subsection provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Each agency shall establish competitive levels consisting of all positions in a competitive area which are in the same grade (or occupational level) and classification series, and which are similar enough in duties, qualification requirements, pay schedules, and working conditions so that an agency may reassign the incumbent of one position to any of the other positions in the level without undue interruption.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.403(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ford's job description generally provided that the incumbent was responsible for collecting and assembling hydrographic survey data for the purpose of designing and laying out new channels and realigning authorized channels in conjunction with new work and maintenance dredging. According to the agency, the appellant did not qualify for this position because he did not possess the required specialized experience to supervise the assembly of field notes and fathometer charts for clarity and accuracy, to reduce soundings to compensate for changes in tides, and to supervise performance of all computations necessary for accomplishment of vertical and horizontal controls involving adjustments to field work to finalize surveys including state plain coordinates, triangulation and geodetic positions. Shook stated that Ford's position required a working knowledge of hydrographic survey techniques and specialized equipment, as well as the ability to plot readings and to use readings to determine proper dredging depth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's work history, however, indicated that the appellant had extensive experience with hydrology and dredging. For example, in describing the work he performed for 7 years as a GS-8 Civil Engineering Technician/Hydrology and Hydraulic Technician, the appellant stated that he conducted "Hydrology and Hydraulic Studies and Flood Plain Management investigations to collect field surveys (economic and hydrologic)." As a GS-5 Engineering Draftsman, the appellant stated that he helped tabulate data for dredging and erosion control reports and "did computations to obtain quantities for beach nourishment and dredging operations." As a GS-5 Civil Engineering Technician he "[a]ssisted in collection of data for profiles, cross sections, and topographic layouts of water bodies." The appellant also stated that he used surveying equipment and plotted topographical data at various times throughout his career. Thus, it appears that the appellant performed tasks that demonstrated that he had the capacity, adaptability, and special skills needed to satisfactorily perform the duties of Ford's position without undue interruption. Although we note that much of the appellant's relevant experience with respect to Ford's position occurred well before the RIF, the agency offered no evidence to show that it was appropriate to consider the recency of the appellant's experience<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.702(a) ("This determination includes recency of experience, when appropriate."). Therefore, the agency did not establish that the appellant was unqualified for the Civil Engineering Technician position encumbered by Ford. Because the appellant was entitled to bump into Ford's Civil Engineering Technician position, we find that the agency did not prove that it afforded the appellant his proper assignment rights when it demoted him to the position of Emergency Management Specialist, GS-0301-09. <span class="Italic">See Flores v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 75 MSPR 546, 551 (1997) (where the appellant offered evidence that was contrary to the agency's wholly conclusory evidence regarding the appellant's alleged lack of qualifications for a specific position for which the appellant alleged he was qualified, the Board found that the agency failed to meet its burden of proving that it provided the appellant with the appropriate assignment rights under the RIF regulations).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we ORDER the agency to cancel the appellant's demotion, and to restore the appellant to the position of Civil Engineering Technician, GS-0802-11, effective August 4, 1998. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The agency must complete this action no later than 20 days after the date of this decision....</p>
