<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-255"><span class="space">a.</span> MSPB Appeal</h5>
<p class="noindent">Before judicial review of its decision in 1986, FLRA concluded that it was a breach of the DFR and a violation of &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) and (8) of the Statute for the union to provide counsel only to members in MSPB hearings. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 121 and Dept. of Treasury, BATF</span>, 16 FLRA 717, 733 (1984). Statements in union promotional literature that attorneys would be supplied by the union in MSPB RIF appeals only to union members violated &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1). There was, however, no violation of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1). No one actually received or was denied representation under the policy as announced. <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 229 and DHHS, Office of Sec'y, Hq.</span>, 22 FLRA 214, 216-17 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">The D.C. Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 721 F.2d 1402, 1405-07 (D.C. Cir. 1983), disallowing a broad union policy of providing attorneys only for union members in all aspects of union representation, was earlier noted. The D.C. Circuit addressed the narrow MSPB DFR issue in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA</span>, 800 F.2d 1165, 1166-73 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Judge Swygert dissenting). The court's decision favored the union:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Treasury Employees Union petitions for review of a decision and order of the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Authority cross-applies for enforcement of its order. The Authority held that the union committed an unfair labor practice by refusing to provide attorneys to represent employees who were not members of the union on the same basis as it provided attorneys to members. The attorney representation sought related to a statutory procedure to challenge a removal action and not to a grievance or other procedure growing out of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The question before us is whether the distinction between procedures that arise out of the collective bargaining agreement and those that do not is dispositive or irrelevant under the pertinent provision of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. The union contends that it is dispositive because the statute enacts the private-sector duty of fair representation, a duty that is limited to those matters as to which the union is the exclusive representative of the employees. Since the NTEU was not the exclusive representative as to the statutory appeal involved here, the duty of fair representation did not attach, and, the union contends, it was free to provide representation to members that it denied to non-members. The Authority, on the other hand, argues that the statute enforces a duty of nondiscrimination broader than that of private-sector fair representation, a duty that extends to all matters related to employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts being undisputed, we have before us a single, clearly-defined issue of statutory construction. We think the statute does not admit of the Authority's interpretation and therefore reverse.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NTEU is the exclusive representative of all non-professional employees of the regional offices of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Department of Treasury. In August, 1979, BATF gave notice of its intention to institute an adverse action against Carter Wright, a BATF inspector in Denver, Colorado. The action would, if successful, result in Wright's discharge. Wright, who was not an NTEU member, telephoned Jeanette Green, president of the NTEU chapter representing his bargaining unit, and asked whether non-members were eligible to obtain an NTEU attorney. He did not tell Green what kind of a case was involved. She replied that it was NTEU's "policy generally not to furnish legal counsel to non-members." Green suggested that Wright call an NTEU staff attorney in Austin, Texas, for more information, but Wright instead telephoned NTEU National Vice-President Robert Tobias in Washington, D.C. They discussed the details of Wright's case, and Tobias said he would consult the union's national president. Wright called back a few days later and Tobias said the president had decided it "wouldn't be advisable" for the union to provide an attorney. He and the president thought Wright's case not a good one. Tobias said they handled cases for union members automatically but that non-members with poor cases did not necessarily receive representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Several weeks later the national president of NTEU sent a memorandum to all local chapter presidents stating that NTEU would continue its policy of refusing to supply attorneys to non-members. This policy applied across the board, to procedures related to the collective bargaining agreement as well as to those not so related. This court, as will be seen, <span id="page_1523"></span>has held that the discrimination between members and non-members with respect to procedures of the former type violates the statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">BATF proceeded against Wright and ordered him removed.&#x2003;Wright hired private counsel, pursued the statutory appeals procedure created by the Civil Service Reform Act, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512, 7513, and 7701 (1982), and ultimately prevailed when the Merit Systems Protection Board overturned the agency's removal decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">BATF filed an unfair labor practice charge against NTEU and its Denver chapter.&#x2003;FLRA's General Counsel then issued a complaint alleging that the union violated 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) (1982), a provision of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, by following a policy of discrimination between union members and non-members in the provision of attorney representation. The violation of section 7114(a)(1) meant, it was charged, that the union had committed unfair labor practices in violation of section 7116(b)(1) and (8) of the statute. The union was also charged with a separate unfair labor practice under section 7116(b)(1) for violating section 7102.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;That section provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Each employee shall have the right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right. Except as otherwise provided under this chapter, such right includes the right--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(1)&#x2003;to act for a labor organization in the capacity of a representative and the right, in that capacity, to present the views of the labor organization to heads of agencies and other officials of the executive branch of the Government, the Congress, or other appropriate authorities, and</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(2)&#x2003;to engage in collective bargaining with respect to conditions of employment through representatives chosen by employees under this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7102 (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Administrative Law Judge found that both the Denver chapter and the NTEU had committed the unfair labor practices charged.&#x2003;The ALJ assumed without deciding that the NTEU had no duty to represent any employee before the MSPB but held that, if the NTEU provided representation to union members, it must provide equal representation to non-members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority held that the Denver chapter had not separately violated the statute but adopted the ALJ's other findings, conclusions, and recommendations. J.A. at 103. The NTEU petitioned this court for review and the FLRA cross-applied for enforcement of its order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The scope of the NTEU's duty depends upon the meaning of the second sentence of section 7114(a)(1) of the statute. That section provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A labor organization which has been accorded exclusive recognition is the exclusive representative of the employees in the unit it represents and is entitled to act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit. An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) (1982).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Each party contends that its position is compelled by the plain language of the second sentence: the union, that the statute embodies only the private-sector duty of fair representation; the Authority, that the statute states a flat duty of nondiscrimination in all matters related to employment. We, on the other hand, find nothing particularly plain or compelling about the text, standing alone.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The statute requires the union to act evenhandedly with respect to the "interests" of employees. Adopting the ALJ's analysis, the FLRA found that Wright had an "interest," within the meaning of section 7114(a)(1)'s second sentence, in pursuing his appeal under the Civil Service Reform Act and so must be furnished counsel by the union for that purpose if the union furnishes counsel for the same purpose to union members. The difficulty with this analysis is that the meaning of "interests" is not given by the statute and is not self-evident. Unless the word is taken to mean all things that employees might like to have--a meaning that neither party attributes to the word--"interests" requires further definition. While deference is owed the Authority's statutory construction, we think the circumstances of this case--the structure of the statute, and, more particularly, the history against which section 7114(a)(1) was written--establish Congress' intent to enact for the public sector the duty of fair representation that had been implied under the private sector statute and therefore preclude the Authority's interpretation. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843 n.9, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 2782 n.9, 81 L. Ed.2d 694 (1984) ("If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The structure of section 7114(a)(1) supports the union's position--that the "interests" protected are only those created by the collective bargaining agreement and as to which the union is the exclusive representative. Thus, the first sentence establishes the union as the "exclusive representative" and states what the union is entitled to do in that capacity: "act for, and negotiate collective bargaining agreements covering, all employees in the unit." The second sentence of a discrete provision such as this might reasonably be expected to relate to the same subject as the first. A natural, though not necessarily conclusive, inference, therefore, is that the duty of <span class="Italic">representing</span> all employees relates to the union's role as exclusive <span class="Italic">representative.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">This inference is reinforced by the way the statute deals with representation in procedures of various sorts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7114(a)(5) provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The rights of an exclusive representative under the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to preclude an employee from--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(A)&#x2003;being represented by an attorney or other representative, of the employee's own choosing in any grievance or appeal action; or</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(B)&#x2003;exercising grievance or appellate rights established by law, rule, or regulation;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">except in the case of grievance or appeal procedures negotiated under this chapter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(5) (1982). The statute itself thus distinguishes between the employees' procedural and representational rights by drawing the line the union urges here, the line between matters arising out of a collective bargaining agreement and other matters. Section 7114(a)(5) does not address the precise question before us but it employs a distinction that is familiar from private sector cases and thus suggests that section 7114(a)(1) may similarly be drawn from private sector case law with which Congress certainly was familiar.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These observations bear upon a line of argument the FLRA apparently found persuasive.&#x2003;The ALJ, whose rulings were affirmed and whose findings and conclusions were adopted by the Authority, reasoned that the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute imposes a broader duty of fair representation upon unions than courts have implied in the private sector under the National Labor Relations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The doctrine of fair representation developed in the private sector is applicable under the Statute; but with an important and significant difference: &#x00A7; 14(a)(1) specifically provides that "An exclusive representative is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit it represents without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership".... The first sentence of &#x00A7; 9(a) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 159(a), is substantially similar to the first sentence of &#x00A7; 14(a)(1) of the Statute; but the language of the second sentence of &#x00A7; 14(a)(1)...is wholly absent in &#x00A7; 9(a) of the NLRA.... Consequently, under the Statute the statutory command of &#x00A7; 14(a)(1), <span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> a specific non-discrimination provision, must be enforced, not merely the concept of fair representation developed in the private sector as flowing from the right of exclusive representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is the only reasoning offered and it is unpersuasive in light of the history of, and the rationale for, the duty of fair representation. The ALJ, and hence the Authority, reason that the private-sector duty of fair representation cannot have been intended because Congress added to this statute a sentence about unions' duties that is not found in the NLRA. The quick answer is that the duty of fair representation was imposed upon the NLRA by courts reasoning from the NLRA's equivalent to the first sentence of section 7114(a)(1). Subsequently, Congress wrote the Federal Service statute and added a second sentence that capsulates the duty the courts had created for the private sector. The inference to be drawn from Congress' use of the language of the judicial rule of fair representation is not that Congress wished to avoid that rule. To the contrary, the inference can hardly be avoided that Congress wished to enact the rule.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The duty of fair representation was first formulated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Steele v. Louisville &#x0026; Nashville R.R.,</span> 323 U.S. 192, 65 S. Ct. 226, 89 L. Ed. 173 (1944). The Court found the duty to be inferred from the union's status as exclusive representative of the employees in the bargaining unit. Thus, the Court said, "Congress has seen fit to clothe the bargaining representative with powers comparable to those possessed by a legislative body both to create and restrict the rights of those whom it represents, but it has also imposed on the representative a corresponding duty." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 202, 65 S. Ct. at 232 (citation omitted). The Court stated it was "the aim of Congress to impose on the bargaining representative of a craft or class of employees the duty to exercise fairly the power conferred upon it in behalf of all those for whom it acts, without hostile discrimination against them." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 202-03, 65 S. Ct. at 231-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">So long as a labor union assumes to act as the statutory <span id="page_1524"></span>representative of a craft, it cannot rightly refuse to perform the duty, which is inseparable from the power of representation conferred upon it, to represent the entire membership of the craft. While the statute does not deny to such a bargaining labor organization the right to determine eligibility to its membership, it does require the union, in collective bargaining and in making contracts with the carrier, to represent non-union or minority union members of the craft without hostile discrimination, fairly, impartially, and in good faith.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 204, 65 S. Ct. at 233.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It will be observed that the Court, in the case creating the duty of fair representation, repeatedly rooted that duty in the powers conferred upon the union by statute, the powers belonging to the union as exclusive representative.[3] The duty was thus co-extensive with the power; the duty is certainly not narrower than the power, and this formulation indicates that it is also not broader.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;Of course, a <span class="Italic">minority</span> union has never been held to act under a duty of fair representation. A minority union cannot be recognized as the exclusive bargaining representative without violating the NLRA. <span class="Italic">See International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB,</span> 366 U.S. 731, 81 S. Ct. 1603, 6 L. Ed.2d 762 (1961). This provides additional support for the view that the duty arises from, and its contours are defined by, a union's status as exclusive representative.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This view of the duty as arising from the power and hence coterminous with it is expressed again and again in the case law:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Because "[t]he collective bargaining system as encouraged by Congress and administered by the NLRB of necessity subordinates the interests of an individual employee to the collective interests of all employees in a bargaining unit," <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes,</span> 386 U.S. 171, 182 [87 S. Ct. 903, 912, 17 L. Ed.2d 842] (1967), the controlling statutes have long been interpreted as imposing upon the bargaining agent a responsibility equal in scope to its authority, "the responsibility of fair representation." <span class="Italic">Humphrey v. Moore,</span> [375 U.S. 335] at 342 [84 S. Ct. 363, 368, 11 L. Ed.2d 370 (1964)].... Since <span class="Italic">Steele v. Louisville &#x0026; N.R. Co.,</span> 323 U.S. 192 [65 S. Ct. 226, 89 L. Ed. 173] (1944),...the duty of fair representation has served as a "bulwark to prevent arbitrary union conduct against individuals stripped of traditional forms of redress by the provisions of federal labor law." <span class="Italic">Vaca v. Sipes, supra,</span> 386 U.S. at 182, 87 S. Ct. at 912.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America v. NLRB,</span> 587 F.2d 1176, 1181 (D.C. Cir. 1978); <span class="Italic">1199 DC, National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees v. National Union of Hospital and Health Care Employees,</span> 533 F.2d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1976); <span class="Italic">Truck Drivers and Helpers, Local Union 568 v. NLRB,</span> 379 F.2d 137, 141 &#x0026; n.2 (D.C. Cir. 1967); <span class="Italic">see generally</span> H. Wellington, <span class="Italic">Labor and the Legal Process</span> 129-84 (1968). For a recent statement and application of the duty of fair representation, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Kolinske v. Lubbers,</span> 712 F.2d 471, 481-82 (D.C. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If this were a private sector case, it would seem clear that the union has not violated its duty of fair representation because the rationale that gives rise to that duty does not apply here. In the case before us the union's authority as exclusive representative did not strip Wright of redress as an individual. To the contrary, Wright actively pursued his statutory appeal rights and won. He did not do that by the union's suffrage but as a matter of right. Not only was that appeal procedure open to him but the union was forbidden by section 7114(a)(5) from attempting to control it.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU's position thus runs along the line established by the private-sector case law and suggested by the structure of the relevant statutory provisions. The Authority's position adopts a new line that is not to be found in the case law antedating the statute or in the statute's structure. Counsel for the FLRA was asked at oral argument whether, on the Authority's reasoning, a union that provided probate advice to its members would thereby be obligated to provide the same advice to non-members. Counsel replied that the union would not have that duty, the distinction being that the provision of probate services does not relate directly to the members' or non-members' employment. Of course, the statute does not even imply that distinction, nor does the pre-existing case law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The ambiguity that will often exist in determining whether a service is or is not directly related to the employment relationship may be a reason to be wary of the Authority's proffered test. It is easier to determine whether the service provided grows out of the collective bargaining relationship. There is, moreover, a clear and articulated policy reason for confining the scope of the union's duty to the scope of its exclusive power: the individual, having been deprived by statute of the right to protect himself must receive in return fair representation by the union. Rights are shifted from the individual to the union and a corresponding duty is imposed upon the union. No such policy supports the additional line drawn by the Authority. The FLRA's position depends not upon the reciprocal relationship of the union's rights and duties but upon a demand for equality of services when the employment relationship is involved. Yet the distinction between services that are employment-related and those that are not seems arbitrary. All services provided by the union are employment-related in the sense that they are provided to employees only. When, as here, the individual retains the right to protect himself in the employment relationship, it is by no means obvious why the union's provision of an attorney to assist in a statutory appeal action is more valuable than the union's provision of an attorney to draft a will. Both are services employees will value, both would cost the individual money, so that it is not apparent why it is discrimination to provide one service to union members only but not discrimination to provide the other in that restricted fashion.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, we cannot accept as reasonable the Authority's claim that, in including the second sentence in section 7114(a)(1), Congress intended to impose a duty broader than that implied in the private sector. The Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Steele</span> and subsequent cases drew from the first sentence of section 9(a) of the NLRA an implication of a duty that is substantially expressed in the second sentence of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(1) (1982), the federal sector provision. The logical, and we think (in light of the history and the rationale for the duty of fair representation) conclusive, inference is that when Congress came to write section 7114(a)(1) it included a first sentence very like the first sentence of section 9(a) and then added a second sentence which summarized the duty the Court had found implicit in the first sentence. In short, Congress adopted for government employee unions the private sector duty of fair representation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Two additional factors persuade us that this is the correct inference.&#x2003;First, if Congress were changing rather than adopting a well-known body of case law, one would expect mention of that intention somewhere in the legislative history. The Authority has referred us to, and we are aware of, nothing of that sort. Second, if the union's duty had been broadened beyond the scope of its right of exclusive representation, one would expect the range of the new duty to be delineated, or at least suggested, probably by some indication in the statute or its legislative history of what the term "interests" means. It is conceded that the word does not cover everything an employee might like to have, which would mean that the union may not differentiate between members and non-members in any way whatever. But if that is not the case, the statute gives no direction of any sort, unless it adopts the private sector equation of the scope of the union's right and its duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This leaves only the Authority's argument that our decision in <span class="Italic">NTEU v. FLRA,</span> 721 F.2d 1402 (D.C. Cir. 1983), is "dispositive" of this case. The FLRA contends that we affirmed its decision that "discrimination based on union membership in <span class="Italic">any</span> representational activity relating to working conditions which an exclusive representative undertakes to provide unit employees is violative of the Statute.... At no point did this court in its decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3732416628952559148&#x0026;q=">721 F.2d 1402</a> intimate that it was reaching its decision only in connection with discrimination in grievance arbitration or other contractually created proceedings." It is instructive to compare that representation by counsel for the Authority with the case counsel is discussing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This court stated the practice under review in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3732416628952559148&#x0026;q=">721 F.2d 1402</a> as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Under a policy adopted and implemented by the Union, only <span class="Italic">Union members are furnished assistance of counsel,</span> in addition to representation by local chapter officials and Union stewards, with respect to grievances or other matters affecting unit employees <span class="Italic">in the context of collective bargaining. Non-members, </span>however, are limited to representation by chapter officials and stewards, and <span class="Italic">are expressly denied the assistance of counsel in matters pertaining to collective bargaining.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3732416628952559148&#x0026;q=">721 F.2d at 1403</a> (emphasis added and omitted). These discrepant policies framed <span class="Italic">the issue the court thought it was deciding.</span> The court stated that the duty of fair representation "applies whenever a union is representing bargaining unit employees either in contract negotiations or in enforcement of the resulting collective bargaining agreement." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1406. This court thus stated the duty of fair representation as the NTEU states it here, not as the Authority states it, as extending to all matters relating to employment.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To put a cap on it, the court stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]he Union is incorrect in suggesting that the challenged policy merely reflects an internal Union benefit that is not subject to the duty of fair representation. <span class="Italic">Attorney representation here pertains directly to enforcement of the fruits of collective bargaining. Therefore, as exclusive bargaining agent, the Union may not provide such a benefit exclusively for Union members.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1406-07 (emphasis added). It is difficult to know what could have prompted counsel to say that the case stands for the proposition that a union may not differentiate between members and non-members as <span id="page_1525"></span>to <span class="Italic">any</span> representational function and that at no point did the opinion intimate that the decision rested on the fact that the representation related to contractually created proceedings. We would have thought that no one could read the case in that fashion. This court's opinion in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3732416628952559148&#x0026;q=">721 F.2d 1402</a> clearly proceeds on a rationale that supports the position here of the NTEU, not that of the FLRA.[6] So clear is this that, if we had before us only the precedent of that case, and nothing more, we would have difficulty holding for the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Authority states that its construction of the statute is "fully consistent with private sector precedent" and cites <span class="Italic">Del Casal v. Eastern Airlines,</span> 634 F.2d 295 (5th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 454 U.S. 892, 102 S. Ct. 386, 70 L. Ed.2d 206 (1981), and <span class="Italic">Bowman v. Tennessee Valley Authority,</span> 744 F.2d 1207 (6th Cir. 1984), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> __U.S. __, 105 S. Ct. 1843, 85 L. Ed.2d 142 (1985). Brief for the Federal Labor Relations Authority at 15 n.10. Neither case supports the Authority's position here. <span class="Italic">Del Casal</span> involved the union's refusal to represent an employee in a grievance procedure governed by the collective bargaining agreement on the ground that he was not a union member. That was held a breach of the duty of fair representation. <span class="Italic">Bowman</span> made a similar holding where the union had negotiated a collective bargaining agreement giving members preferential transfer rights. The court linked the duty of fair representation to the right of exclusive representation. Since both cases involved discrimination against non-members as to matters within the union's role as exclusive representative, neither provides any support for the Authority's position here. If these cases are "fully consistent" with the FLRA's position, that can be so only in the sense that they are not explicitly inconsistent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 v. FLRA</span>, 812 F.2d 1326, 1328 (10th Cir. 1987), determining that there was no ULP when a union advertised that its representation for MSPB appeals was limited to union members:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Underlying the duty of fair representation is the notion that a union with an exclusive power cannot use that power coercively or contrary to the interest of an employee who has no representative other than the union.&#x2003;In this context, "fair representation" means that when a union uses a power which it alone can wield, it must do so for the benefit of all employees within its bargaining unit. Hence, when a union bargains for a grievance procedure in which it participates as the sole representative of all employees, the duty requires that the union's representation cannot be dependent upon union membership. If, on the other hand, an employee has the right to [choose] a representative other than the union, so that the union does not have an exclusive power that can be used contrary to the interests of the employee, there is no basis for requiring the union to furnish the services. In the latter instance, the employee's interests are protected by the availability of, and the right to choose, the representative services of another party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case before us, then, the latter scenario prevails. By statute, the employee is entitled to choose a representative on appeal, and the union has no power to preclude that right or to insist upon appearing for the employee if the employee elects to pursue a statutory appeal procedure. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(5). Hence, the fundamental reason for applying the doctrine of fair representation does not exist.</p>
<p class="noindent">If the union intercedes in a case involving a statutory appeal that might not be grievable under the contract, the union then assumes responsibility to avoid a breach of the duty of fair representation for employees it undertook to protect. <span class="Italic">SEIU Local 556 and Paige</span>, 17 FLRA 862, 878 (1985) (ALJ Decision). It was reaffirmed that, although a union has no statutory duty to represent employees in MSPB proceedings, if it elects to do so it must do so without discrimination and without regard to union membership. <span class="Italic">NFFE and Thompson</span>, 24 FLRA 320, 323 (1986) (citing but not explaining its reference to <span class="Italic">NTEU v.

In a decision applying the NLRA (involving Postal Service employees), it was noted that if an individual takes a case to the MSPB and loses on the merits, then sues the union for a breach of the duty of fair representation, the Board decision may collaterally estop the plaintiff (employee) from contending that the union breached a provision of a collective bargaining agreement that arguably would have precluded his discharge. <span class="Italic">See Gibson v. USPS</span>, 380 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir. 2004) (issue of breach of the labor agreement was the same in both actions) [Refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-18-044.html#sec10-45">Fair Representation Suit; Related Judicial Claim</a>."].</p>
