<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-93"><span class="space">q.</span> Problem With or Delayed Receipt of Domestic, Certified, or International Mail, or Commercial Delivery; Address Change</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A rebuttable presumption arises that a letter reached an addressee if the letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid. The presumption arises from direct evidence in the form of a document or testimony. An agency may demonstrate that a decision, with appeal rights, was received by the appellant, triggering the time limit for an appeal through a presumption of receipt of a letter that is properly sent. The appellant may attempt to rebut the presumption through her own sworn, credible, evidence of nonreceipt of the decision notice. The Board then considers other evidence of record to determine whether the appellant submitted sufficient evidence to overcome the agency's presumption of delivery and receipt. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Foust v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 80 MSPR 477, 480 &#x00B6; 6 (1998); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McGuire v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 247, 249 &#x00B6; 8 (1999) (appellant's unsworn statement was sufficient to establish the nonreceipt of the acknowledgment order, resulting in the untimely submission of the refiled appeal, when "the record reflects that the appellant has otherwise timely pursued every other avenue of appeal of the removal action, which tends to corroborate his assertion that he did not respond to the AJ's acknowledgment order because he did not receive it."). The Board's regulations do not require that explanations regarding the timeliness of an appeal be in any particular form. <span class="Italic">Perkins v. USPS</span>, 94 MSPR 425, 429 &#x00B6; 11 (2003). If the agency has information concerning receipt of mail by the appellant, when receipt is material to the timeliness of the appeal, the agency should provide that information to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Board case law may apply a presumption that mail was delivered within 5 days of mailing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Butler v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 112, 2013 MSPB 1 (2013), <span class="Italic">post</span>. [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-086.html#sec4-87">Delivery of Mail, Other Documents</a>," for presumptions and proof; refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-163.html#sec5-162">Proof of Mailing; Postmark; Mailbox Rule</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2012 the Board revised its regulations to impose on the potential appellant a duty to keep the agency informed of his address or changes to it after the issuance of a proposal. Although individuals who have only received a proposal might not be aware of the regulation (or the Board), 5 CFR 1201.22 (2022) provides, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Time of filing</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example A</span>: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example B</span>: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3"><span class="Italic">Example C</span>: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 regulation was applied to dismiss as untimely an appeal based on receipt of an EEO final agency decision when the appellant failed to timely check his post office box, <span class="Italic">Little v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">When, as here, an appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency, a subsequent Board appeal must be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency's FAD. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b). Previously, both the Board and its reviewing court held that the time period under a prior version of this regulation began to run from the date of the appellant's actual receipt of the FAD, even in situations in which the appellant's receipt was delayed by his own negligence. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 &#x0026; n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Cody v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). However, the Board issued a new regulation, effective November 13, 2012, providing that an appellant may be deemed to have constructively received a FAD under certain circumstances. 77 Fed. Reg. 62,350, 62,364, 62,371 (Oct. 12, 2012) (codified at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), 1201.154); 77 Fed. Reg. 33,663, 33,673, 33,679 (June 7, 2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is undisputed that the FAD was delivered to the appellant's post office box on January 13, 2016. The appellant contends that his appeal was timely filed because he did not actually receive the FAD until he checked his mail on January 16, 2016. According to the unsworn statement of the appellant, he checks his mail twice weekly and had checked it on January 12 and 16, 2016. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We find such arguments unavailing.[2] Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(3), the appellant constructively received the FAD on January 13, 2016, the date it was delivered to his post office box. Thus, under the Board's regulations, the appellant was required to file his appeal on or before February 12, 2016, 30 days after his receipt of the FAD. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1). Accordingly, the appellant's February 13, 2016 appeal was untimely filed by 1 day. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l) (stating that the date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant was expecting the agency FAD and is presumed to understand procedural deadlines for appeals. He was, therefore, under a heightened obligation to monitor his incoming mail. <span class="Italic">See generally Rocha v. Merit Systems Protection Board &#x0026; Department of State</span>, 688 F.3d 1307 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (finding that, although the appellant claimed that he did not receive the administrative judge's initial decision, the record showed that the decision was sent to the email address the appellant provided to the Board when he filed his appeal; the court noted that, as a registered e-filer, the appellant consented to accept all documents issued by the Board in electronic form, and he was required by regulation to monitor his case online to insure that he received all case-related documents).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an appellant fails to timely submit his appeal, it will be dismissed as untimely filed absent a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Marcantel v. Department of Energy</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 330, &#x00B6; 10 (2014). To determine if an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unfavorable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his claim. <span class="Italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table). Beyond his assertion that he did not receive the FAD until January 16, 2016, because he did not check his post office box every day, the appellant has not offered any other evidence or argument regarding any additional circumstances that affected his ability to timely file his appeal. Thus, we find that he has not <span id="Page_1000"></span>established good cause for his untimely filing. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as untimely filed without good cause for the delay.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the regulatory modification, as to changes in address leading to belated receipt of decision notices requiring appeals within Board regulatory deadlines, the Board revised an earlier approach requiring the appellant to keep the agency advised of address changes, <span class="Italic">Bradshaw v. VA</span>, 113 MSPR 650, 654-56 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-14, 2010 MSPB 97 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's regulations require that an appellant generally must file his appeal no later than 30 days after the effective date of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date he received the agency's decision, whichever is later. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The administrative judge found that the appellant's alleged delay in receiving a copy of the removal decision did not excuse the appellant's failure to file a timely appeal of his removal because the agency had sent the decision to the appellant's last known address and the appellant had failed to notify the agency of any change in his mailing address. In support of that finding, the administrative judge relied on the Board's decisions in <span class="Italic">Schorr v. Department of the Navy,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 8 (1998); <span class="Italic">Cunningham v. Department of Transportation,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 674, 677 (1987); and <span class="Italic">Mathews v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 34 M.S.P.R. 645, 646 (1987). However, in <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army,</span> 68 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the court found that the appellant's negligent failure to inform his agency of a change in address could not be a basis for deeming him to have constructively received the agency's decision at an earlier date for purposes of the time limit for filing an appeal of that decision under the Board's regulations. The court stated that the Board could not dismiss an appeal as untimely "when it has been filed in compliance with the literal requirements of the regulation" and found that the Board's regulation "contains no requirement other than that tied to the employee's receipt of the agency decision." 68 F.3d at 1359. The court emphasized that "[n]egligence is not at issue, there being no due diligence obligation in the regulation," but suggested that the result might be different if the appellant had intentionally avoided receiving the decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>;<span class="Italic"> accord Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 75 F.3d 639, 647 &#x0026; n.9 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (given the language of the Board's regulation, it was immaterial whether the appellant negligently delayed in picking up her certified mail). Although <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> and <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> concerned the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154, regarding the time limit for filing an appeal raising a discrimination claim, and this case may be governed by the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b), the relevant language in these two regulations has been, at all times relevant to this appeal, essentially identical with regard to computing the time limit for filing from the date of receipt of the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6; 9 (2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On remand, the administrative judge must analyze the timeliness issue consistent with the literal requirements of the Board's regulations and the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> and <span class="Italic">Hamilton.</span> <span class="Italic">See Horton,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 332, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-12; <span class="Italic">Cody v.

The precedent cited in the initial decision is inapplicable. <span class="Italic">Cunningham</span> and <span class="Italic">Mathews</span> were issued in 1987 and thus did not concern the subsequent amendment of the Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) in 1997 to add that an appeal would be timely if filed within 30 days of receipt of the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 62 Fed.

The matter at issue in <span class="Italic">Schorr</span> was an alleged involuntary resignation. 79 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 6-8. In such a circumstance, the agency does not issue a "decision" on the appealable matter, and thus, the language in the Board's revised timeliness regulation, permitting a timely appeal within 30 days after the date of receipt of the "agency's decision," does not apply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) (as amended after Nov. 6, 1997). Moreover, Mr. Schorr resigned in June 1997, several months before the Board amended 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22 in November 1997. 79 M.S.P.R. 594, &#x00B6; 2; <span class="Italic">see</span> 62 Fed. Reg. at 59991. Nevertheless, we are aware of at least one instance in which the Board has relied on the discussion in <span class="Italic">Schorr</span> in addressing the timeliness of an appeal from a matter in which an agency issued a decision after the 1997 amendments to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). <span class="Italic">See Leslie v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 361, 'VII 2, 8, 11 (1999). In that matter, however, it appears that neither party raised an issue regarding the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> or <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, and the Board's decision did not address those cases or the 1997 amendment to the language in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has previously followed the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> and <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> without expressly overruling its prior precedent to the extent that it was inconsistent with these decisions. <span class="Italic">See Williams v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under decisions before <span class="Italic">Bradshaw,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> as to problems with receipt of notice of appeal rights, the employee was under a general duty to keep his agency advised of changes in his address.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that Mr. Peeples, despite knowing of the removal action pending against him, moved to a new address and failed to inform the Agency of his new address. Consequently, the Agency mailed the notice of removal to Mr. Peeples' old address (i.e., the address of record) and Mr. Peeples did not receive this notice. The AJ found that it was Mr. Peeples's responsibility to inform the Agency of any address change and that he failed to do so. The AJ also found that the delay was not a circumstance beyond Mr. Peeples's control and that he failed to act diligently or prudently. Accordingly, the AJ determined that Mr. Peeples did not establish the existence of good cause to warrant a waiver of the time limit and dismissed the appeal as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Saddler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1358-59 (Fed. Cir. 1995); determined that in a mixed case appeal the appellant had no obligation to notify the agency of a change of address and could not be charged with the delay entailed in securing the agency EEO decision triggering the time limit for the Board appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an initial decision, an administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal as untimely filed. Although the AJ noted that Saddler filed the appeal within the regulatory time limit of twenty days from his receipt of the decision, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)(1), the AJ held that the appeal was untimely "because of [Saddler's] undisputed negligence in failing to advise the agency of his several changes of address after he was removed and while his EEO complaint was being processed." Had Saddler not been negligent, the AJ found that Saddler "undoubtedly would have received the [final agency decision] in late June 1993." Because Saddler had not shown good cause for the delay in filing, which was, in the AJ's view, more than twelve months, the AJ dismissed the appeal as untimely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(c) (1994) ("If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown."). The initial decision became final when the board denied Saddler's petition for review on February 21, 1995.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Saddler met the requirements of the regulation by filing his appeal within twenty days after he received the final decision. That being the case, there was no basis for the AJ to consider whether there was good cause for any delay. The language of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;If the appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;An appeal [to the board] must be filed within 20 days after the appellant <span class="Italic">receives</span> the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;If the agency has not resolved the matter or issued a final decision on the formal complaint within 120 days, the appellant may appeal the matter directly to the Board at any time after the expiration of 120 calendar days [emphasis added].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) (1994). This language is very clear. An employee must file an appeal to the board within twenty days of <span class="Italic">receipt</span> of the agency's decision. Saddler met that date and the board must abide by its own regulation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1001"></span>Moreover, the government's argument that Saddler received constructive notice of the agency's final decision in June 1993 is not persuasive. We agree that an appellant may be considered to have had constructive notice of a decision under appropriate circumstances. For example, in <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 1343 (Fed. Cir. 1983), we held that service of the board's final decision upon petitioner's designated union representative was sufficient to provide notice to the petitioner and start the running of the thirty-day time limit for filing an appeal specified in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1). The board has also found constructive notice of an agency order when a relative received the order at the address left by the employee for correspondence. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 735 F.2d 537, 541 (Fed. Cir.) (finding that employee constructively received notice of proposed removal that was sent to the mailing address provided by the employee and received by his mother)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[N]o representative or relative of Saddler received the final agency decision. The letters containing the final agency decision in this case were simply returned as undeliverable. Although it is true that the decision was not received because of Saddler's own negligence, we do not believe there is any basis upon which he can be held to have constructively received it....&#8197;As long as he did not intentionally avoid receiving the decision, of which there is no evidence in the record, no receipt occurred with which Saddler can reasonably be charged. Common sense would seem to obligate an employee to inform the agency of his current address, especially if he is serious about his discrimination claims. Nonetheless, we do not believe that the board can dismiss an appeal as untimely when it has been filed in compliance with the literal requirements of the regulation. <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Conners Steel Co.</span>, 673 F.2d 1240, 1242 (11th Cir. 1982) (holding that, with respect to notice in Title VII cases, "[p]laintiff should be required to assume some minimum responsibility himself for an orderly and expeditious resolution of his dispute"). The regulation contains no requirement other than that tied to the employee's receipt of the agency decision. Negligence is not at issue, there being no due diligence obligation in the regulation. Accordingly, we conclude that the board erred in determining that Saddler received constructive notice of the agency's discrimination determination in June 1993.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Saddler</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Foley v. DHHS</span>, 84 MSPR 402, 408-09 &#x00B6; 12 (1999), involving certified mail that was not immediately picked up from the post office despite notice from the post office of the waiting mail. The Board noted the division among courts concerning what will be determined to be the date of receipt. The issue, however, was not resolved because the agency's notice was defective. It failed to alert the appellant, who received a copy of the agency EEO final decision triggering the Board appeal right, that the appellant, rather than the attorney, could file an MSPB appeal. As to constructive receipt of the mail, <span class="Italic">Foley</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argued below and on review that the appellant failed to show good cause for his filing delay because his attorney was negligent in failing to promptly retrieve his mail from the post office. The agency contended that: The agency sent its final decision to the appellant's attorney via certified mail; the appellants attorney was notified by the Postal Service on December 2 and 8, 1998, that a certified letter was available to be picked up; because he failed to pick it up, it was returned to the agency on December 18; and, after the agency remailed it to the appellant's attorney, he received it on January 5, 1999. In support of this argument, the agency cited <span class="Italic">Watts-Means v. Prince George's Family Crisis Center,</span> 7 F.3d 40 (4th Cir. 1993). There, the court held that the 90-day time limit for filing a civil action on a discrimination claim began to run when the Postal Service first delivered notice to the plaintiff that she could pick up the EEOC's right-to-sue letter, not when the plaintiff later picked up the letter <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 42.[7] <span class="Italic">Watts-Mason</span> is not applicable because it did not address the time limit involved here, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b); nor did it involve the Board's standard for determining good cause for an untimely filing.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;It appears that there is a difference of opinion among the circuits on this issue. <span class="Italic">Compare,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g., Sousa v. National Labor Relations Board,</span> 817 F.2d 10, 10-11 (2d Cir. 1987) (the time period began to run when the plaintiff actually picked up his mail at the post office, although the letter was received at his post-office box 5 days earlier) <span class="Italic">with Harvey v. City of New Bern</span> <span class="Italic">Police Department,</span> 813 F.2d 652, 654 (4th Cir. 1987) (regarding whether the time limit is triggered by actual receipt of the right-to-sue letter, the court applied a "flexible rule which requires a case-by-case examination to determine if an equitable tolling of the filing period is appropriate") <span class="Italic">and St. Louis v. Alverno College,</span> 744 F.2d 1314, 1316 (7th Cir. 1984) (where the plaintiff failed to inform EEOC that he had moved, he was deemed to have received the right-to-sue letter when it was delivered to the address he provided to EEOC).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Our reviewing court, in a case involving 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.154(b), reached a conclusion different from <span class="Italic">Watts-Means</span> on a similar issue. In <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army,</span> 68 F.3d 1357, 1357-58 (Fed.

More than a year later, he received the final decision when the agency sent him a copy in response to his telephone inquiry about the status of his case. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1358. The court held that, although Saddler's failure to receive the decision when it was originally sent was due to his own negligence, he cannot be deemed to have constructively received it, in the absence of evidence that he intentionally avoided receiving it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1359-60. <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> addressed only the issue of when the appellant received the agency's final decision, under section 1201.154(b), which is not in question here; it did not address the issue of good cause, which is in question. Therefore, it is not directly applicable.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Saddler</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Butler v. VA</span>, 119 MSPR 112, 114-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 9-10, 2013 MSPB 1 (2013), resolving to be timely filed a Board appeal when the agency EEO final decision was delivered to what was arguably the right address but received and later forwarded to the appellant, who filed with the Board with 30 days of actual receipt of the FAD and when the agency could not invoke a presumption of mailing time because it did not prove when the FAD was actually mailed or submitted to the appellant by United Parcel Service:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The timeliness of the appeal in this case is governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b) (Jan. 1, 2012), which provided that, when an "appellant has filed a timely formal complaint of discrimination with the agency," the "appeal must be filed within 30 days after the appellant receives the agency resolution or final decision on the discrimination issue." Both the Board and its reviewing court have held that this regulation generally requires that the Board go by the date of actual receipt, even in situations in which the appellant's receipt was delayed by his or her negligence. <span class="Italic">See Hamilton v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646-47 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1358-59 (Fed.

First, receipt may be imputed to the appellant when the agency decision was received by a relative at the address designated by the employee for correspondence. <span class="Italic">Saddler</span>, 68 F.3d at 1359. Second, receipt may be imputed to the appellant if he intentionally avoided receiving the decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Although there is no indication in the record that the appellant intentionally avoided receiving the agency's FAD, there is a question, discussed below, whether it was received by a relative at the address left by the appellant for receiving correspondence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the principle has usually been applied to appeals governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22 (Jan. 1, 2012) rather than to appeals governed by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154 (Jan. 1, 2012), the Board has recognized a presumption that documents placed in the mail are received in 5 days. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cabarloc v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 695, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">Williamson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 502, &#x00B6; 7 (2007); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.4(l) (Jan. 1, 2012) (providing that, when a document is mailed but the postmark is not legible, it is presumed to have been mailed 5 days prior to receipt). As discussed below, we conclude that the "actual receipt" rule of section 1201.154 applies in this case, and that, even if the 5-day presumption doctrine were otherwise applicable, it does not apply in this case because the agency failed to establish that the FAD was mailed to the appellant on the date it was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has not categorically ruled out the use of the presumption of receipt in 5 days in cases governed by section 1201.154. Rather, the court stated in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span> that it rejected the judge's "double-barrelled presumption: first, that a decision is mailed on the date it was signed and, second, that it was received by the employee within 5 days," where the judge had neglected to inform the appellant of the presumption and of the dates on which the judge intended to rely in applying the presumption. <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, 75 F.3d at 647.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Hamilton</span>, the judge did not advise the appellant that she would rely on the presumption of receipt in 5 days; this presumption was mentioned for the first time in the initial decision. More importantly, there is no evidence in the record that the FAD was in fact mailed to the appellant on November 23, 2011, as the FAD was not accompanied by a certificate of service, which would have certified that a named individual mailed the document to the appellant's address on that date. Instead, the Director of the agency's Office of Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication (OEDCA), the same official who signed the FAD, issued a "Transmittal of Final Agency Decision or Order," which contained the same date as the FAD. Although use of the term "transmittal" implies that the document was transmitted to the appellant on the specified date, this Transmittal does not supply the specifics of who did the transmitting and how the document was transmitted. The Board should not simply assume that these specific actions occurred in the absence of evidence that they did indeed occur.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;That it cannot be presumed that a document was mailed on the same day that it was issued is illustrated in the record of this case. The Order of Judgment and Dismissal in the 2337 complaint issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's <span id="Page_1002"></span>(EEOC's) Chicago District Office was dated October 13, 2011, but the certificate of service for that Order indicates that it was not mailed to the parties until November 7, 2011, almost 4 weeks later. We also note that certificates of service are often signed by someone other than the official who issued the primary document. For example, the Order of Judgment and Dismissal in the 2337 complaint was signed by an EEOC administrative judge, whereas the certificate of service for that Order was signed by a Clerk. Although it is possible that the Director of the OEDCA personally mailed the FAD and the accompanying Transmittal to the parties, there is no basis for assuming that she did so.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute, and the record shows, that the appellant received the final agency decision dated September 22, 2006, for the first time on November 4, 2006. Thus, his appeal filed on November 29, 2006, meets the literal time requirement of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a) because it was filed 25 days after the date he received the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See Cody v.

On July 7, 2010, the appellant filed an appeal with the Board asserting that prior to his absences he was granted a leave of absence, that he supplemented the medical information supporting his absence in October 2009, and that he should not have been charged with AWOL....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After considering the parties' responses to the timeliness orders, the administrative judge found good cause to waive the time limit for filing an appeal. The administrative judge found that the agency failed to submit evidence showing the date on which it provided the appellant with a copy of the decision letter. She noted that the agency's Labor Relations Specialist, Natalie K. Stevenson, indicated that the decision letter sent by certified mail was returned to the agency but that the copies of the letter sent by first class mail were not returned. The administrative judge further noted that the appellant began an inpatient treatment program on April 28, 2010, at a Department of Veterans Affairs facility and that the agency was aware of the appellant's address at the facility as it sent him correspondence from March until June 2010, when the appellant was released. The administrative judge also noted that the appellant stated that his union president advised him to file an appeal with the Board, that <span id="Page_1003"></span>the appellant was released from the hospital on June 18, 2010, and that he filed his Board appeal on July 7, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts in its petition for review that the administrative judge erred in waiving the time limit for filing a Board appeal "based on her determination that the Agency failed to submit any evidence to show the date it provided a copy of the decision letter to the appellant" or that it "ever advised [the appellant] of his right to file an appeal with the Board and the filing time limit." The agency asserts that "[e]ssentially, the Administrative Judge shifted the burden to establish timeliness to the Agency." We agree. The administrative judge erred in finding good cause to waive the filing deadline solely on the basis that evidence of when the appellant received a copy of the removal decision or was advised of his appeal rights is absent from the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long recognized that, while there are strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases, there is a need for finality in personnel actions. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision letter effecting the appellant's removal was dated December 4, 2009, and the effective date of his removal was December 18, 2009. The decision letter provided appropriate notice of the appellant's right to appeal his removal to the Board. Accordingly, based on the effective date of the removal, the appellant was required to file his Board appeal on or before January 19, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a sworn declaration submitted with the agency's response to the administrative judge's timeliness order, Ms. Stevenson stated that she was "personally involved" in the issuance of the notice of proposed removal and the subsequent decision letter to the appellant. She further stated that, at that time, the appellant's most recent PS 50, which was processed on November 21, 2009, showed that his address of record was on Brady Court in Arlington, Texas, and that the notice of proposed removal and the decision letter were sent to that address. Ms. Stevenson explained that the decision letter was sent via First Class Mail with Delivery Confirmation and by Certified Mail. She further explained that the letter sent by First Class Mail with Delivery Confirmation was not returned to the agency and thus was deemed delivered by the agency but that the letter sent by Certified Mail, which required a signature for delivery, was unclaimed after attempts at delivery on December 16, 2009, and January 16, 2010, and thereafter returned to the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence that a letter was sealed, properly addressed, and deposited in the U.S. Mail with postage prepaid gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that the letter reached the addressee in due course of the mails. <span class="Italic">See Stracquatanio v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the administrative judge's explicit order to the appellant to provide his response on the issue of timeliness in the form of an affidavit, sworn statement, or declaration under penalty of perjury, the appellant failed to follow her directions. The appellant also failed to follow the administrative judge's instruction that, with respect to the timeliness issue, he should "be as specific as possible by giving all of the details." In an unsworn declaration, the appellant generally described the time leading up to his inpatient treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and stated that he learned of his removal in March 2010 after reviewing agency PS 50s sent to him in the mail, that sometime after April 1, 2010, he spoke to his union representative who advised him to file a Board appeal, that he immediately thereafter filed his appeal, and that he was released from the hospital on June 18, 2010. However, the appellant did not explicitly claim that he never received the removal letter or that the letter was mailed to the wrong address, although the administrative judge clearly understood that to be the appellant's argument. Further, while the appellant asserted that he "move[d] around alot [sic]" and that he "made sure [he] changed [his] mailing address in the system," he failed to provide sufficient detail to support his general assertions, such as explaining when, prior to the time the decision letter was mailed by the agency, he moved from his address of record on Brady Court and when he provided the agency with his updated address such that it allegedly failed to mail the decision letter to the correct address. Moreover, as noted above, the appellant failed to provide any of this information in a sworn declaration as explicitly directed by the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Hunt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 381, 382-83 (1989) (an administrative judge may require an affidavit or sworn statement to support an untimely filed appeal where a party's explanation for an untimely filing provides insufficient evidence upon which to base a waiver determination).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the instant appeal distinguishable from our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Dunbar v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 8 (2010), in which we recognized that "under the plain language of the Board's regulations, the date that an appellant actually receives the agency's decision letter is the relevant date for determining the filing deadline--not the date that it was delivered to his address of record." In <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, the Board further recognized that the governing regulation does not require an appellant to exercise diligence in receiving the agency's decision. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> After the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as untimely filed based on Mr. Dunbar's failure to exercise diligence in collecting his mail, the Board in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span> vacated the initial decision and remanded the appeal for an evidentiary hearing on the timeliness issue. <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, not only did the appellant fail to provide a sworn statement on the issue, but, unlike the appellant in <span class="Italic">Dunbar</span>, he failed to state when he received the decision letter, explicitly assert that he never received it, or explain the exact circumstances surrounding his alleged nonreceipt, such as when he moved from his address on Brady Court, allegedly preventing his receipt of the removal decision. <span class="Italic">See Dunbar</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6; 3. Thus, apart from the question of whether the appellant exercised diligence in receiving the agency's decision, he failed to sufficiently explain the timeline or circumstances surrounding his alleged nonreceipt, particularly in light of the agency's sworn declaration that the letter was appropriately placed in the mail, addressed to the address of record for the appellant at the time, and not returned to the agency as undeliverable. Accordingly, while we are sympathetic to the appellant's circumstances as a veteran suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the appellant's vague, unsupported, and unsworn allegation that the decision letter was sent to the wrong address without further explanation fails to rebut the presumption of delivery and receipt or even raise a genuine factual dispute on the issue of timeliness. <span class="Italic">See Dunbar,</span> 114 M.S.P.R. 499, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9; <span class="Italic">Foust</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even assuming, <span class="Italic">arguendo</span>, that the appellant could rebut the presumption of delivery and receipt of the decision letter, the appellant failed in his unsworn declaration to explain when between April and June 2010 he learned of his right to appeal to the Board or to demonstrate that he acted diligently after he learned of his right. An appellant who was not provided a required notice of appeal rights does not have to show that he exercised due diligence in attempting to discover his appeal rights; the question is whether he was diligent in filing an appeal after he learned he could do so. <span class="Italic">Gingrich v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 67 M.S.P.R. 583, 588 (1995). It is established that "[t]he critical element...is that the employee acted promptly and within the allowable time limits once he was aware of the basis of his claim." <span class="Italic">Yuni v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 385 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Gordy v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant asserted that he filed his appeal "immediately" after learning of his right to do so from his union representative, he failed to provide any context or timeline for this assertion, e.g., when after his April 28, 2010 admission to inpatient treatment he spoke to his union representative and exactly or even approximately how long thereafter he filed his Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Cranston v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 290, &#x00B6; 14 (2007) (the appellant acted diligently in filing his appeal when he first learned he could appeal the agency's denial of restoration on April 18, 2006, and he filed his Board appeal on May 2, 2006);<span class="Italic"> Gingrich</span>, 67 M.S.P.R. at 587-88 (the appellant acted diligently when he filed his appeal on July 22, 1994, after asserting that he learned he might be able to challenge his retirement shortly after June 24, 1994, following an article in the <span class="Italic">Federal Times</span>). Here, if the appellant spoke to his union representative any time before June 7, 2010, his appeal remains untimely. Moreover, while the administrative judge seemed to place some importance on the fact that the appellant was released from the inpatient program on June 18, 2010, and then filed his appeal within 30 days, on July 7, 2010, the appellant stated in his response to the timeliness order that he, with the assistance of his treatment team, made various submissions related to his grievance and EEO complaint while attending the inpatient program, indicating that he was able to file his Board appeal while still participating in the program and that June 18, 2010, should not be the point after which the appellant must prove that he acted diligently in filing his appeal. Further, as noted above, even the appellant's vague assertions on this issue are unsworn.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, because the appellant failed to meet his burden to <span id="Page_1004"></span>demonstrate good cause for waiving the filing deadline, we VACATE the initial decision and DISMISS the appeal as untimely filed without a showing of good cause.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Board's finding that Tatum's appeal was untimely was not erroneous, we must remand for the Board to analyze whether good cause existed for Tatum's delay in filing his appeal. The burden is on the appellant to establish good cause by showing that the delay was excusable and that he exercised due diligence. <span class="Italic">Zamot v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 332 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2003). "[P]olicy considerations counsel against dismissals for untimely filing and militate for providing employees with a hearing on the merits of their appeals,...and that broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience should be applied in good cause determinations." <span class="Italic">Walls v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 29 F.3d 1578, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have found good cause for untimely filing where the agency has failed to provide proper notice of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Toyama v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 481 F.3d 1361, 1366-67 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (notice failed to inform petitioner that she could appeal either to the MSPB or file an action in district court); <span class="Italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583 (notice failed to specify whether the time limit was in calendar or working days); <span class="Italic">Shiflett v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 669, 674 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (no notice of appeal rights). It appears that the December 2009 notice of decision fails to adequately inform Tatum of his appeal rights as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.21. The letter states that Tatum may file an appeal "within 30 calendar days from the effective date of this decision." As discussed previously, this is incorrect: Tatum could also timely file within 30 days of the receipt of his removal decision and appeal rights, even if this was more than 30 days from the decision's effective date. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b)(1). Furthermore, section 1201.21(a) requires notice of "the requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.22(c)." That latter section states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). The December 2009 notice does not contain this language, and we have held that good cause for delay existed where, among other things, this language was omitted. <span class="Italic">See Ladrido v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 248 Fed. Appx. 184, 186-87 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (nonprecedential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that Tatum had not established good cause, the Board did not address the defective notice. A remand is therefore required. On remand, additional factors the Board should consider include, but are not limited to, Tatum's PTSD treatment, his <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status, the possibility that Tatum never actually read his removal notice, and whether the agency was prejudiced by the delay. <span class="Italic">See Erickson v. Pardus</span>, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) ("A document filed <span class="Italic">pro se</span> is to be liberally construed...." (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Unclear from <span class="Italic">Tatum</span> is whether the MSPB AJ issued a show cause order informing Mr. Tatum of his right to provide information justifying waiver of the appellate time limit.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appeal was timely when the appeal period was clocked from the date the appellant actually received a decision notice, following his return from vacation, rather than from arrival of the notice at his place of residence. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 105 MSPR 322, 334-37 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-11, 2007 MSPB 86 (2007), observed that the appellant made no effort to avoid service of the decision letter and that the appellant let the agency know of his vacation plans:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the appellant's unrebutted assertions and evidence, we find that the appellant did not personally receive the decision notice until July 5, 2006, 30 days before the date on which the appellant filed his appeal. The issue before us, therefore, is whether the 30-day filing period began when the notice was delivered to the appellant's residence, or whether it began when the appellant actually received it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of her finding that the appellant constructively received the notice when it was delivered to his residence, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. 157, 171 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 537 (Fed. Cir. 1984). In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, the Board found that an employee had constructively received a notice on the date it was delivered to his address of record, even though he testified that he had not received the notice personally until 4 days later. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It then concluded that the 7-day deadline stated in that notice should be determined based on the earlier date. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The notice at issue in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, however, was not a notice of a decision or action from which the employee would have had a right to appeal, but a notice proposing to take such an action and providing the employee with an opportunity to present an oral reply. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> The deadline for scheduling the presentation of an oral reply to a proposal notice is not covered by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b), the regulatory provision at issue here. Furthermore, the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the right to present an oral reply include no language comparable to the language of section 1201.22(b), i.e., no language indicating that the "date of receipt" of the notice determines the deadline for scheduling an oral reply. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.404.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that the Board recently addressed a similar issue involving language essentially identical to that in section 1201.22(b). In <span class="Italic">Cody v. Department of the Navy</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 161 (2006), it considered the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(a), which provides that, when an appeal raises a discrimination claim, and when the appellant elects to appeal directly to the Board instead of filing a complaint of discrimination with the employing agency, the appeal may be filed "no later than...30 days after the date of receipt of the agency's decision on the appealable action." The Board found in that case that, given "the plain language of" that provision, the 30-day period for filing the appeal began with the employee's actual receipt of the agency's decision notice, and not with the date on which she received an attempted delivery notice. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 13. It also found that the issue of whether the appellant was negligent in failing to pick up her mail promptly after receiving the attempted delivery notice was immaterial to the issue of whether the appeal was timely. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The decision notice in this case, unlike that in <span class="Italic">Cody</span>, was delivered to the appellant's residence well before the date on which the appellant actually received it. Moreover, in a case involving another essentially identical provision regarding appeal-filing deadlines, our reviewing court stated that "an appellant may be considered to have had constructive notice of a decision under appropriate circumstances." <span class="Italic">Saddler v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 F.3d 1357, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (addressing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.154(b)). In connection with this statement, however, the court referred to decisions finding constructive receipt when the notice was delivered to the employee's designated representative or to a relative at the employee's address of record. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In contrast, the appellant in the present case has stated without contradiction that the notice was delivered to a rooming house where he was staying temporarily, that he "has no relationship" with the person who signed the receipt for the notice, that he authorized no one to accept mail deliveries on his behalf, and that he did not even provide the rooming house address to the agency as a mailing address.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Saddler</span> indicates that an employee may be charged with constructive receipt of a notice he intentionally avoided receiving. <span class="Italic">See Saddler</span>, 68 F.3d at 1359; <span class="Italic">see also Cody</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 161, &#x00B6; 13. The record in this case does not suggest that the appellant made any attempt to avoid receiving the decision notice on a timely basis. On the contrary, it shows that the appellant referred, in a letter he sent the deciding official on June 6, 2006, to his "scheduled vacation from 8 June through 3 July 2006"; that he asked that his absence during this time "be charged to annual leave"; and that he specifically asked, immediately following this reference, that a copy of the agency's decision on the suspension proposal be sent to an e-mail address he provided in that response....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the unique circumstances described above, the appellant cannot reasonably be charged with receipt of the notice prior to July 5, 2006, the date on which he actually received that notice. For this reason, and because he filed his appeal on the thirtieth day after July 5, we find that the appeal was timely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appeal period should have been extended when the agency unsuccessfully attempted to mail a removal notice to the employee and the agency could have, but did not, contact an attorney representing the appellant in a collateral personnel dispute. <span class="Italic">Cresson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 27 MSPR 665, 668 (1985); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Montgomery v. USPS</span>, 77 MSPR 401, 404 (1998) (considering the receipt of decision notice by "agent" who signed for certified mail while the appellant was hospitalized). When there was no neglect by counsel, a delay of a few days in filing an appeal was excused. A delay in the mails was responsible for materials being transmitted too slowly from the appellant through his union to the union's counsel; once the materials were received, the union's counsel acted promptly to file the appeal. <span class="Italic">Rice v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1115).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Allowances for delayed receipt of adverse action decisions also extend to delayed receipt of OPM reconsideration decisions, <span class="Italic">Woodyard-Hamilton v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 150, 152-56 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appeal from an OPM reconsideration decision that does not set an effective date must be filed within 25 days of the date of the issuance of the decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). The time limit for filing an appeal may be waived only upon a showing of good cause for the delay in filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1201.12, 1201.22(c). To establish good cause for an untimely appeal, a party must show that he exercised diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1005"></span>The considerations set forth by the court in <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, however, are relevant to a determination regarding good cause, as are those that it mentioned in its discussion of the concept in <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>. In <span class="Italic">Anderson</span>, it was plainly not impossible for the appellant to have complied with the filing deadline, but the difficulties created by his hospitalization and his inability to contact his representative definitely affected his ability to adhere to that deadline; the court therefore stressed that the appellant and his representative had acted diligently by promptly preparing an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 999 F.2d at 534. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Loui</span>, the court emphasized that with respect to the timeliness of Board appeals the critical element is that the employee act promptly once he becomes aware of the basis of his claim; it observed that due diligence on an employee's part once the employee learns of his appeal rights is the controlling factor. <span class="Italic">See</span> 25 F.3d at 1013-1014 (citations omitted). Moreover, as noted above, the court stated that section 752.404(f) allowed an employee to take "full advantage" of the appeal time allowed under section 1201.22(b) once the employee became aware of the basis of the agency's decision and his right to appeal that decision<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 1013. It held that the agency thus had not only violated section 752.404(f) but had "deprived" the employee of a significant part of his appeal time under section 1201.22(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The delayed delivery of the reconsideration decision constituted a circumstance beyond the control of the appellant that affected her ability to comply with the time limit and is a reasonable excuse for her delay. Further, as noted above, it appears that the appellant filed an appeal within a reasonable amount of time after receiving the decision, and this factor is controlling in analyzing the timeliness issue here. Therefore, given the minimal nature of the delay and the lack of any showing of prejudice to the agency, we find that the reasonableness of the appellant's excuse and her showing of due diligence establish good cause for her untimely filing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under<span class="Italic"> Vicente v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 380, 383 (1994), following <span class="Italic">Woodyard-Hamilton</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations in effect during the period for filing the appellant's petition for appeal required that an appeal from an OPM reconsideration decision that does not set forth an effective date, as is the case in this appeal, must be filed within 25 days of the date of issuance of the decision. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b).[*] To establish good cause for an untimely appeal, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Alonzo v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 MSPR 180, 184 (1980). We find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimeliness of her petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Effective June 17, 1994, the Board amended 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.22(b) to provide, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that an appeal from a final or reconsideration decision that does not set forth an effective date must be filed within 35 days of the date of the issuance of the decision. 59 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In our recent decision in <span class="Italic">Woodyard-Hamilton v. OPM</span>, 64 MSPR 150, 154-56 (1994), we found that good cause existed for the appellant's petition for appeal filed 2 days beyond the deadline when the appellant showed that her untimeliness was due to the delayed delivery of OPM's reconsideration decision. In that case, we relied on the fact that, because of the delayed delivery of OPM's reconsideration decision, the appellant was deprived of more than half of the 25-day regulatory filing period. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154-55. Further, because 25 days "presumptively constituted a reasonable amount of time to comply with appeal requirements," the appellant acted diligently by taking only 13 days from the date she received the reconsideration decision to file her appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 155. We specifically held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">To fault the appellant for taking slightly more than half of [the regulatory filing period] to file an appeal after she received OPM's reconsideration decision is to ask the appellant to have acted with more than reasonable prudence and diligence; it verges on a requirement that the appellant show that timely filing of her appeal was impossible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We do not require such a showing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant did not receive the reconsideration decision until January 31, 1994. By that time, the entire filing period had elapsed and timely filing was impossible. The appellant acted diligently to file her appeal within only 21 days after her receipt of the reconsideration decision. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant has shown good cause for the untimeliness of her petition for appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Woodyard-Hamilton</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Sanders v.

<p class="Body-Text">Substantial delay--157 days--was excused for an appellant residing in the Philippines. The Board essentially took administrative notice of significant mailing delays between that country and the United States. <span class="Italic">Lacorte v.
