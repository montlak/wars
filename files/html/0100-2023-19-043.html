<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Under 29 USC 633a:</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Nondiscrimination on Account of Age</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">(a)Federal agencies affected</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">All personnel actions affecting employees or applicants for employment who are at least 40 years of age (except personnel actions with regard to aliens employed outside the limits of the United States) in military departments as defined in section 102 of title 5, in executive agencies as defined in section 105 of title 5 (including employees and applicants for employment who are paid from nonappropriated funds), in the United States Postal Service and the Postal Regulatory Commission, in those units in the government of the District of Columbia having positions in the competitive service, and in those units of the judicial branch of the Federal Government having positions in the competitive service, in the Smithsonian Institution, and in the Government Publishing Office, the Government Accountability Office, and the Library of Congress shall be made free from any discrimination based on age.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Pridgen v. OMB</span>, 2022 MSPB 31, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 20-22 (2022), explaining the burdens of proof in a mixed case involving an affirmative defense of age discrimination, determined that "while an appellant who proves motivating factor and nothing more may be entitled to injunctive or other ‘forward-looking relief,' to obtain the full measure of relief available under the statute, including <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> relief, compensatory damages, or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision, he ‘must show that age discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome'":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie</span>, 140 S. Ct. 1168 (2020), the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted...29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a, which prohibits Federal sector age discrimination. As the Court explained, "the Federal Government [is held to] a stricter standard than private employers or state and local governments. That is what the statutory language dictates, and if Congress had wanted to impose the same standard on all employers, it could have easily done so." <span class="Italic">Babb</span>, 140 S. Ct. at 1176.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Considering this sweeping statutory language, the Court held that a plaintiff may prove a claim of age discrimination by showing that age discrimination "play[ed] any part in the way a decision [was] made." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1173-74. In other words, the statute does not require proof that an employment decision would have turned out differently if age had not been taken into account. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. A finding that prohibited discrimination played "any part" in the contested action is the same as a finding of "motivating factor." <span class="Italic">See Wingate v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 7 (2012) (finding that a Federal employee may prove a violation of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) by establishing that age was "a factor" in a personnel action, even though it was not a "but-for" causation).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;An important distinction between the motivating factor <span id="Page_3381"></span>and "but-for" standards is that an appellant in a motivating factor regime need not fully rebut the agency's proffered motives as pretext. By contrast, under the "but-for" standard, the burden of persuasion always remains with the appellant. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gloetzner v. Lynch</span>, 225 F. Supp. 3d 1329, 1346 (N.D. Fla. 2016) ("The burden of persuasion always remains on the plaintiff in an [Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)] case to proffer evidence sufficient to permit a reasonable fact finder to conclude that the discriminatory animus was the "but-for" cause of the adverse employment action."). Therefore, certain courts have considered the "but-for" standard to be more "onerous," often when they compare Federal and state law claims. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Wojcik v. Costco Wholesale Corporation</span>, No. 3:13-CV-2314-D, 2015 WL 1511093 (N.D. Tex. 2015) (granting summary judgment on the plaintiff's ADEA claim but denying for state law claim as motivating factor standard was "more lenient"); <span class="Italic">Bauers-Toy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In adjudicating the appellant's claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), the administrative judge applied <span class="Italic">Bowman v.

However, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) recently noted, the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> applied 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), the ADEA provision applicable to private sector employees. <span class="Italic">Alotta v. Department of Transportation,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 0120093865, 2011 WL 2515244 (June 17, 2011). Whereas 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1) prohibits discrimination "because of" age, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), the ADEA provision applicable to employees in the federal sector, requires that personnel actions in federal employment "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 623(a)(1), 633a(a). Based on the differing statutory language, the EEOC found that Congress intended for different standards to apply to private sector employees and employees of the federal government under the ADEA. <span class="Italic">Alotta,</span> 2011 WL 2515244 (citing <span class="Italic">Fuller v. Gates,</span> 2010 WL 774965 (E.D. Tex. March 1, 2010)). The EEOC further found that, based on plain meaning, the "free from any" language in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) must be construed as being broader than the "because of language in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), and that the "mixed motive analysis" that is not available to private sector employees under <span class="Italic">Gross</span> continues to apply in age discrimination claims against the federal government. <span class="Italic">Alotta,</span> 2011 WL 2515244. Applying the broader language of 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), the EEOC found that the appellant could not prevail on his age discrimination claim "[i]n the absence of any clear evidence that age was a factor" in the challenged agency decision. <span class="Italic">Alotta,</span> 2011 WL 2515244. The Board must defer to the EEOC concerning issues of substantive discrimination law. <span class="Italic">E.g., Spahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 16 (2003).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reached the same result regarding the proper inquiry in age discrimination claims against the federal government.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bailey v. USPS</span>, DC-0752-16-0463-I-1, n.2 (NP 5/25/2022), offered more recent, though nonprecedential, guidance on age discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[2]&#x2003;The Age Discrimination in Employment Act states that "personnel actions...shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a). Similarly, title VII requires that such actions "shall be made free from any discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2000e-16(a). In <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 48-50, the Board adopted the analytical framework of <span class="Italic">Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle</span>, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), for analyzing claims arising under title VII. The Board in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> held that it first inquires whether the appellant has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. Such a showing is sufficient to establish that the agency violated title VII. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant meets her burden, the Board then inquires whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the agency makes that showing, its title VII violation will not require reversal of the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After <span class="Italic">Savage</span> was decided, the Supreme Court interpreted the language in 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a) in <span class="Italic">Babb v. Wilkie</span>, 589 U.S. __, 140 S. Ct. 1168 (2020).

Ct. at 1173-74, 1177-78. However, a plaintiff "must show that age discrimination was a but-for cause of the employment outcome" to obtain "reinstatement, backpay,...or other forms of relief related to the end result of an employment decision." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1177-78. Thus, under both <span class="Italic">Savage</span> and <span class="Italic">Babb</span>, some relief is available if <span id="Page_3382"></span>the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the challenged personnel action, but full relief is available only if the prohibited consideration was a but-for cause of the action. Although <span class="Italic">Savage</span> and <span class="Italic">Babb</span> appear to diverge on the question of which party has the burden to prove or disprove but-for causation, we need not decide at this time whether the analytical framework applied in <span class="Italic">Savage</span> must be revised in light of <span class="Italic">Babb</span>. Because the appellant has not yet proven her initial burden that a prohibited factor played any part in the agency's decision, we do not reach the question of whether race and sex discrimination or EEO reprisal was a but-for cause of that decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In age discrimination cases, the Board generally considers complaints as falling within disparate treatment rather than disparate impact analysis because the challenge is most often to the employer's motive for taking a discrete, particular employment-based action, rather than to broad policies or practices having equal application to all employees. <span class="Italic">Decker v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After the hearing in this appeal, the Supreme Court issued a decision clarifying the burden of proof applicable to adjudicating age-discrimination claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA). In <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. at 2352, the Supreme Court held that a plaintiff claiming age discrimination under the ADEA must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that age was the "but-for" cause of the challenged adverse action. Even if the plaintiff produces some evidence that age was one motivating factor in the decision, the burden of persuasion does not shift to the employer to show that it would have taken the action regardless of age. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. While the Supreme Court in Gross interpreted the text of the ADEA as it applies to a private sector employee, <span class="Italic">see</span> 129 S. Ct. at 2350, a federal sector plaintiff must make the same showing as a private sector plaintiff to establish a violation of the ADEA, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Baqir v.

Cir. 1982).[2] Accordingly, the holding in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> applies to claims of federal sector plaintiffs under the ADEA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The ADEA, which as originally enacted did not apply to the federal government, prohibits private employers from taking certain personnel actions "because of an individual's age. 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 623(a)(1), (2). The ADEA was later amended to provide that all personnel actions in the federal government affecting individuals who are at least 40 years old "shall be made free from any discrimination based on age." 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a). Despite the difference in language between the private sector and federal sector provisions, Congress did not intend a difference in substantive protections. <span class="Italic">Cuddy</span>, 694 F.2d at 856.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ erred in failing to apply the standard announced in Gross solely because it was issued following the completion of the hearing in the instant appeal. With respect to retroactivity, the Board has relied on the standard articulated by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harper v. Virginia Department of Taxation</span> for determining retroactivity in civil cases:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When this Court applies a rule of federal law to the parties before it, that rule is the controlling interpretation of federal law and must be given full retroactive effect in all cases still open on direct review and as to all events, regardless of whether such events predate or postdate our announcement of the rule.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">509 U.S. 86, 97 (1993); <span class="Italic">see Porter v. Department of Defense</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 461, &#x00B6; 12 (2005). The Board has also relied on the Supreme Court's further explanation of retroactivity provided in <span class="Italic">Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen (1) the Court decides a case and applies the (new) legal rule of that case to the parties before it, then (2) it and other courts must treat that same (new) legal rule as "retroactive," applying it, for example, to all pending cases, whether or not those cases involve predecision events.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">514 U.S. 749, 752 (1995); <span class="Italic">see Smart v.

Moreover, we note that the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Gross</span> did not announce a new legal standard for ADEA cases. Rather, the Court examined the text of the ADEA, explained the intent of Congress, and removed lingering confusion regarding the mixed-motive doctrine by clarifying that an ADEA plaintiff must prove that age was the "but-for" cause of the challenged adverse employment action. <span class="Italic">See Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. at 2349-52. For this reason, and given the standards announced by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Harper</span> and<span class="Italic"> Reynoldsville Casket Co.</span>, the AJ should have applied Gross to the appellant's claim of age discrimination as it was pending at the time the Gross decision was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, declining to apply <span class="Italic">Gross</span>, the AJ found that the appellant failed to establish that his age was the determinative factor in the agency's decision to remove him for unsatisfactory performance. <span class="Italic">See Decker v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 40 M.S.P.R. 119, 132 (1989). We conclude that the appellant also did not meet the standard announced in Gross. The testimony of the appellant's supervisors, which the AJ found credible, supports the AJ's finding that the appellant's removal was based on his performance deficiencies, rather than on his age. The appellant therefore has not established by preponderant evidence that his age was the but-for cause of his removal. <span class="Italic">See Gross</span>, 129 S. Ct. at 2352. Accordingly, the appellant's affirmative defense of age discrimination fails under the standard announced in <span class="Italic">Gross</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin Caterers Corp.</span>, 116 S. Ct. 1307, 1310 (1996), helped to focus the ADEA analysis by suggesting that unlawful discrimination can occur among two relatively older employees (e.g., one individual 58 years old and the other 48), and that an inference of discrimination cannot be drawn from the replacement of one worker with another worker insignificantly younger (e.g., a 40-year-old employee replaced by a 30-year-old).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Harris (age 56) and Wise (age 65) are in the protected group and were removed from their positions, the first and second elements have been established.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The appellants' proof that their age was the determinative factor for their inclusion in the reduction in force rests upon a showing that one of the 10 employees performing the appellants' work was 34 years old and one other employee was 52 years old, 4 years younger than appellant Harris. No evidence was offered <span id="Page_3383"></span>as to the ages of the other eight employees.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency asserts that it proceeded with the actions, despite the unexpected changes in its funding because there was still a shortage of "some" solar funds that justified the actions. The agency also asserts that it went forward with the actions because of administrative problems that it had experienced in the past in attempting to modify or cancel other reduction-in-force actions. We find that the agency's assertions regarding its reasons for the reduction-in-force actions satisfy the agency's burden of articulating a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellants contend that the agency's discriminatory motive is evidenced by: (1) The agency's failure to offer a rational reason for the reduction in force that would permit any conclusion other than a conclusion that it was based on age discrimination; (2) the agency's awareness of the ages of those employees it identified for reduction-in-force actions, as evidenced by its discussions with appellant Wise regarding his eligibility for retirement; and (3) the fact that appellants Wise and Harris were found unqualified for assignment to positions held by younger employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the first assertion, we have found above that the agency has articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its reduction-in-force actions. With respect to the second assertion, we find that federal agencies are authorized to survey employees eligible for and interested in retirement to reduce its ceiling through attrition and minimize the impact of a reduction in force<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 8336(d); Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) Chapter 351 (Interim), Subchapter 1-3 (urging planning and alternative actions to abate the adverse impact of a reduction in force); FPM Chapter 351, Appendix E (concerning agencies' authority to request approval by the Office of Personnel Management of early retirement in a reduction-in-force situation). Thus, there can be no inference of discriminatory intent based on the agency's awareness of its employees' ages as that awareness is evidenced by the agency's discussions with appellant Wise regarding his options and retirement eligibility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor have the appellants established that the agency's determinations regarding their assignment rights were made for reasons personal to them because of their age. The appellants' assignment rights were determined pursuant to an objectively designed evaluation system, and there is no basis for finding that such determinations were motivated by discrimination on the basis of age. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mastie v. Great Lakes Steel Corporation,</span> 424 F. Supp. 1299 (E.D. Mich. 1976) (no discrimination where the evaluation system had built-in checks that showed no age skew on overall ranking, even though the two employees terminated were among the oldest workers).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellants have not asserted that there is a disparity of older employees among the incumbents of the twelve positions identified for abolishment or among those who were not subsequently placed in positions, and they have submitted no evidence showing such a disparity. A list, provided by the agency in response to the appellants' interrogatories, reflects that, of the nineteen employees currently in the Building Equipment Division, five are under 40 years old, nine are between 40 and 50 years old, and the remaining five are between 50 and 60. Thus, after the reduction in force, the division where the appellants were formerly assigned had more employees over 40 years of age than under 40 years of age. We also reiterate that, although an agency witness testified that the work of the appellants was being done by ten other employees in the division, only two of these employees were specifically identified. Finally, Samuel Kramer, the chairman of the NBS Reduction-in-force Assignment Panel, testified that he was unaware of the ages of the appellants and those in positions with lower retention standing. We have been shown neither documentary nor oral evidence for discrediting this testimony. Thus, on the entire record appellants Wise and Harris have failed to establish that their ages were determinative factors for the agency's reduction-in-force actions with regard to them.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Borowski v. USDA</span>, 40 MSPR 372, 375-76 (1989), followed the analysis in <span class="Italic">Waksman</span> and added that argument by an agency representative concerning the basis for an action is not a substitute for evidence of the reasons for the action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its final argument dated December 17, 1987, the agency argued that during its placement efforts for matching employees affected by the RIF with identified vacancies within the agency, it considered the employees' "qualification[s], suitability and other information (such as geographic availability, health restrictions and other job prospects).' Specifically, the agency argues that, prior to the RIF, the appellant had previously applied for the position in Athens, Georgia, and that he was not identified as a "top candidate" on the list of best qualified candidates from which the selecting official would have made the selection. The agency further argues that during a telephone conversation which the appellant had with the selecting official for the Athens, Georgia, position, the appellant indicated the dilemma he would face if offered the position, since assignment to the position would require him to leave his elderly parents in the Minneapolis, Minnesota, area. The agency also argues that the statement made in its November 25, 1987, response to the appellant's discovery requests (that RIF regulations were used to fill vacant positions during the RIF) was "inadvertent error."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the agency's arguments, if substantiated, may have satisfied its burden of showing a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, arguments alone do not constitute evidence. <span class="Italic">See Enos v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 7 MSPB 554, 8 MSPR 59, 63 (1981) (statements made by an agency's representative in a letter arguing the agency's case on appeal before the administrative judge do not constitute evidence of the truth of those statements). We find that the record is insufficient to resolve the allegation of age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is therefore necessary to provide the parties with an opportunity to further develop the record concerning the appellant's claim of age discrimination, both with respect to the agency's failure to offer the appellant the Property Management Specialist position in Athens, Georgia, and with respect to the appellant's broad claim that the RIF itself was tainted by age discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rockwell v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 39 MSPR 217, 224 (1988), suggested that agency officials charged with discrimination in a RIF ought to at least know the appellant's age and that favored employees ought to be comparably situated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addressing the appellant's complaint of age discrimination, the administrative judge merely stated that the appellant had failed to present evidence or argument in support of her allegation. The appellant introduced into evidence three RIF notices, which she contended showed age discrimination because all of the people involved were in the protected age group as shown by their birthdates on the attached SF-50 forms. The employees involved were administrative officers whose positions were abolished in a RIF separate from the appellant's. This evidence fails to establish the appellant's allegation of age discrimination in her RIF. Furthermore, the appellant offered no other evidence that her age was a factor in the agency's decision to transfer the library collection and also failed to establish that the NEFC officials involved in the RIF which affected her position were aware of her age. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Elliott v. Group Medical &#x0026; Surgical Service,</span> 714 F.2d 556, 567 (5th Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 467 U.S. 1215, 104 S. Ct. 2658, 81 L.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 256, 262-64 (1994), affirmed the AJ's finding of discrimination and reprisal as to a demotion without the necessity for more than a logical finding of intent to discriminate based on circumstantial evidence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the administrative judge did not have the benefit of <span class="Italic">Carter v. Small Business Administration</span>, 61 MSPR 656, 666 (1994), <span class="Italic">cited with approval in Creer v. United States Postal Service</span>, 62 MSPR 656, 662 (1994), we use <span class="Italic">Carter</span> to address the issue of the appellant's ongoing burden of proof in a discrimination case. When the employee makes his showing that the agency's stated reason for the action is merely a pretext for prohibited discrimination, "it is not enough...to <span class="Italic">dis</span>believe the employer; the factfinder must [also] <span class="Italic">believe</span> the [employee's] explanation of intentional discrimination." <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666, citing <span class="Italic">St. Mary's Honor Center v. Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. 2742, 2754, 125 L. Ed.2d 407 (1993). As the Court further noted: <span class="Italic">"[T]</span> <span class="Italic">here must be a</span> <span class="Italic">finding of discrimination." Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 668, citing <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2794 n.4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proffered a nondiscriminatory reason for its action (the demotion): that the appellant was impacted by the ongoing Postal Service restructuring. The administrative judge found, however, that in being denied the appointment to the EAS 24 level--a denial which led to his demotion--the appellant presented "compelling evidence" that he was a victim of disparate treatment by Oliver Stevenson (Stevenson), who was "motivated primarily by age bias and an opportunity for retaliation." Moreover, the administrative judge found that the evidence presented by the appellant in support of his allegations of discrimination and reprisal, as the true grounding for the agency's action, was "unrebutted."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the age discrimination claim, the administrative judge then made a series of findings which enabled him to conclude that "the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision." <span class="Italic">See Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2747. He found that the appellant was the only incumbent Tour Superintendent, DA, Boston GMF, who was demoted by a RIF action; <span id="Page_3384"></span>that he was "by far the oldest" of the Tour Superintendents; and that the suggestion of supervisor Stevenson to the appellant that he retire "speaks volumes about the agency's motive in offering the appellant only a lower level position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge thus made findings, pursuant to <span class="Italic">Stern v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 46 MSPR 328, 338 (1990), fully supporting his ruling that "the appellant has met his burden of presenting evidence of the agency's subjective intent to discriminate against him on the basis of his age." Such findings are consonant with <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2749 n.4 ("<span class="Italic">there must be a finding of discrimination").</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that, without the benefit of <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, the administrative judge may have expressed himself inartfully when he stated: "In the absence of an articulated, legitimate reason for making this specific offer to the appellant, I find that the agency has failed to meet its burden of coming forward with a nondiscriminatory reason for its action. I therefore find that the appellant has met his burden of proving age discrimination." Nevertheless, review of the administrative judge's entire analysis of the issue shows that he did not accept the employee's proffered reason, i.e., age discrimination, as correct merely because he found the employer's reason unpersuasive. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Carter</span>, 61 MSPR at 666, citing <span class="Italic">Hicks</span>, 113 S. Ct. at 2756. He did not merely disbelieve the employer; as set forth above, he made extensive and specific findings as to why the employee's proffered explanation--that of intentional discrimination--was correct. We therefore deny the agency's petition as to the administrative judge's ruling on the discrimination claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As to the reprisal claim, the administrative judge made findings which enabled him to conclude that the appellant met his burden of showing that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant "credibly testified" that Stevenson told him that the only job he would be offered at GMF was LSM Supervisor, at the EAS-16 pay level; that the appellant also testified that Stevenson told him that if he did not accept that position, he would be subject to reassignment to Maine, New Hampshire, or Vermont; and that if he refused one of those reassignments, he would be fired. The administrative judge credited the appellant's testimony that he took the supervisor's suggestion that he retire as a threat.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also credited the appellant's testimony that he had an EEO complaint pending based on a letter of warning issued to him by Stevenson in 1992, and that Stevenson had actively resisted resolution of that complaint, despite efforts by another manager to resolve the complaint by recommending cancellation of the letter of warning. We note that the agency did not present supervisor Stevenson in rebuttal, even though he was an approved witness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency confined itself to challenging the administrative judge's ruling on retaliation by asserting it in a heading to be erroneously decided, but did not adduce any argument on that issue. We find no error in the administrative judge's ruling for the appellant on his retaliation claim, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Allen v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce</span>, 58 MSPR 568, 571 (1993), particularly in light of the strong evidence of record, as noted by the administrative judge and alluded to above, of a history of retaliatory actions taken against the appellant by the agency.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination in a RIF, demonstrating that one group appears to have been favored as to retention, was rebutted by a showing that the appellant was removed as a result of the RIF through proper procedures and for legitimate management considerations. <span class="Italic">Edwards v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 11, 14 (1982). In a constructive adverse action appeal, a general statement by a management official that an agency needs younger scientists was not enough to prove that, through the threat of reassignment by RIF, the resignation of an older scientist was involuntary. The statement itself was not the type that would coerce resignation, <span class="Italic">Haynes v. USDA</span>, 27 MSPR 537, 539-41 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant contended that age discrimination was evidenced by a statement made in 1979 by the SEA Director concerning the dearth of young scientists in the agency and by the fact that several employees retired under "early-out" procedures in 1979.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant stated in his petition for appeal that during a January 26, 1979 speech to all Athens-area employees, the SEA Director indicated that he was concerned about the dearth of young scientists, then stated that, "[t]he most productive years of a scientist's life are between the ages of 25 and 35 years. The average age of SEA scientists is 47 years. This is terrible." On its face, this statement could be viewed as evidencing bias against older scientists. However, E.L. Kendrick, the Administrator of SEA's Southern Region, stated in a January 15, 1980 memo that the purpose of the SEA Director's visit was to discuss budget conditions, and his statement was made in that context. Kendrick stated that due to lack of funds and strict imposition of personnel ceilings, SEA was becoming an agency of "middle-aged to retiring" personnel. He stated that budgetary restrictions were hindering the hiring of young personnel--a viable element of the agency's existence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, reflects Congress's view that achieving a reasonable age balance in the employment structure could be a legitimate, non-discriminatory consideration. As the House Committee on Education and Labor stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The committee further recognizes that in some industries...a disproportionately high number of older workers are found in the work force.... In some cases, this has resulted from a decline in total employment in such an industry, coupled with the exercise of seniority rights. The committee does not intend that the legislation be administered in such a way as to worsen a situation as this, or to prevent an employer from achieving a reasonable age balance in his employment structure.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant contended that the SEA Director's statement constituted coercion contributing to the "early-out" retirement decisions of "innumerable" SEA scientists in 1979, appellant has presented no evidence to support that contention. Moreover, in view of Kendrick's undisputed statement concerning the context of the SEA Director's statement, we do not find that appellant could have reasonably perceived the statement as being intended to coerce his retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellant stated that three agency employees retired under "early-out" procedures in 1979, we find nothing discriminatory about that fact. According to appellant, one of those employees, Harold Zorning, was an architect in the agency's Clemson, South Carolina office, and the other two, Drs. Neufeld and Childs, were the very officials who appellant accused of attempting to coerce his retirement. There was no evidence that any appropriate authority found any of the three retirements to be coerced. Nor was there even any evidence that the three employees in question believed that the agency had coerced their retirements. Appellant, himself, suggested that Dr. Childs' retirement may have been motivated by factors other than age-motivated coercion: Appellant stated that Dr. Childs retired after a lengthy Inspector General investigation, which was prompted by a letter of complaint against Dr. Childs that appellant was accused of authoring.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The chain of events leading to appellant's removal was precipitated by the agency's decision to cut the funds for his research program. Appellant has offered no evidence that the cutting of his funds or any of the agency's subsequent actions in the chain of events was motivated by his age. Although appellant stated that Dr. Neufeld informed four other scientists that their research was being discontinued, appellant did not state the ages of those scientists; in any event, appellant stated that all four scientists were apparently continuing their same lines of research at the agency, notwithstanding Dr. Neufeld's statement. Thus, there is no evidence of a pattern of agency action to cut the funds of older scientists.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant, himself, suggested that the cutting of his funds may have been motivated by factors other than age: Appellant contended in his petition for appeal that the agency cut his funds "<span class="Italic">solely</span> to favor the scientist engaged in photosynthesis research" (emphasis added). In his petition for review to EEOC, appellant alleged for the first time that his research funds were shifted to favor a woman scientist."</p>

In addition, to the extent that the proposing official's alleged comments constitute circumstantial or indirect evidence of age discrimination, they would be insufficient to show that the appellant's removal was based on discrimination in light of the serious and undisputed charges underlying his removal. <span class="Italic">See Mahaffey v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1993, the Supreme Court decided an age discrimination case, <span class="Italic">Hazen Paper Co. v. Higgins</span>, 113 S. Ct. 1701 (1993), that sought to sharpen analysis of the legitimacy of an employer's personnel action challenged as discriminatory. The question was whether dismissal allegedly to avoid the vesting of pension benefits constituted age discrimination. In the context of that discussion, the Supreme Court suggested that the reason offered by the employer for its action may be improper, but it will not be an insufficient defense unless the reason smacks of the same type of discrimination that the employee claims motivated the adverse personnel action. The Court's holding was in the context of ADEA, not a broader pronouncement under Title VII:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A] decision by the company to fire an older employee solely because he has nine-plus years of service and therefore is "close to vesting" would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age. The prohibited stereotype ("Older employees are likely to be __") would not have figured in this decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue. The decision would not be the result of an inaccurate and denigrating generalization about age, but would rather represent an accurate judgment about the employee-that he indeed is "close to vesting."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We do not mean to suggest that an employer lawfully could fire an employee in order to prevent his pension benefits from vesting. Such conduct is actionable under Sec. 510 of ERISA, as the Court of Appeals rightly found in affirming judgment for respondent under that statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon</span>, 498 U.S. 133, 142-143, 111 S. Ct. 478, 484-485, 112 L. Ed.2d 474 (1990). But it would not, without more, violate the ADEA. That law requires the employer to ignore an employee's age (absent a statutory exemption or defense); it does not specify further characteristics that an employer must also ignore. Although some language in our prior decisions might be read to mean that an employer violates the ADEA whenever its reason for firing an employee is improper <span class="Italic">in any respect</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973) (creating proof framework applicable to ADEA) (employer must have "legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason" for action against employee), this reading is obviously incorrect. For example, it cannot be true that an employer who fires an older black worker because the worker is black thereby violates the ADEA. The employee's race is an improper reason, but it is improper under Title VII, not the ADEA.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time of the proposed removal, respondent was a 57 year old circuit pilot in the air reserve technician program. The position description for the position to which he was assigned required that he attain Flight Examiner status. In October, 1979, the respondent failed a "check ride" which was required for qualification as a Flight Examiner and on January 16, 1980, the agency issued a notice of proposed removal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 623 of Title 29 of the United States Code states that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It shall be unlawful for an employer--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's age;</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The respondent has contended, and the presiding official found, that from April, 1979, when the respondent was rated as fully qualified, until the October check ride, he requested and was denied the opportunity for adequate training to maintain and upgrade his proficiency and that after the October check ride he was removed from all training activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official determined that the respondent received less flying time than other employees. This, the presiding official determined, was disparate treatment which established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination according to the analysis established in <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green,</span> 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's petition for review presented arguments that the presiding official erred in the application of the Act, in finding disparate treatment under an analysis of the Act, and in failing to apply properly the facts. Specifically, the agency argued that the presiding official improperly compared respondent to all fliers at the installation. Rather, the agency alleged that a comparison should have been made only to these pilots holding the same position as that of the respondent which would reveal that similar amounts of flying time were allowed for all in his position. The agency also contended that the respondent's removal was for "good cause," i.e., his failure on the October 24, 1979 flight check test. Work quality is a legitimate consideration and removal of an employee for such "good cause" is warranted regardless of age.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's arguments in its petition for review miss the thrust of the presiding official's initial decision in the areas discussed below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A mere comparison of raw flying hours may be misleading. Our record does not disclose the nature of the flight time allowed to other instructors or whether other instructors were regularly denied flying time they had requested and felt they needed to perform adequately and to maintain their skills. The record establishes that from April, 1979 through October 24, 1979, the respondent was systematically denied requested flying time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency does not deny respondent's allegation that almost half of his flying time during this period was attributable to one long flight during which the respondent was not able to practice the skills in which he was deficient. The record also establishes that no other instructor was in respondent's position of having failed a flight check test. According to the evidence, Air Force regulation 60-1 requires that in case of such failure the agency must embark on a program of intensive flight training so as to give the employee every opportunity to pass the test upon reexamination. However, the respondent was not allowed to schedule <span class="Italic">any</span> flight time after his failure of October 24, 1979. A comparison of respondent's flying hours with all other flight instructors would do nothing to alter the findings of the presiding official regarding disparate treatment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas,</span> the criteria to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case vary according to the factual situation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 802, n.13. It is established that the respondent was within the protected age group; that he was discharged; and that he was limited in a way which adversely affected his status as an employee. The presiding official concluded, based upon the uncontroverted statements regarding the respondent's age made by Colonel Basnett, that the respondent was limited and finally discharged because of his age, thus establishing a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of age discrimination. After a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing is established, the burden of going forward with the evidence shifts to the agency to demonstrate reasonable factors other than age for the respondent's discharge. <span class="Italic">Marshall v.</span> <span class="Italic">Westinghouse Electric Corporation,</span> 576 F.2d 588, 590 (5th Cir. 1978). The "good cause" alleged in the agency's petition for review means little when viewed in light of the background for the test upon which such "good cause" is based. Anyone can fail any test without thorough and proper preparation. Respondent was denied the opportunity for such preparation, despite repeated requests. Upon his submission of requests for flying time, he was ignored, and when he placed his own name on the flight schedule it was removed. Such actions were beyond his control. The presiding official heard and saw all the evidence and concluded that no reasonable factor other than age for the discharge was proved by the agency. He therefore found that the respondent was the victim of discrimination under the Act. We cannot say that the presiding official's conclusion was erroneous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That job requirements, e.g., medical standards, are established by regulations does not prevent an appellant from raising or an AJ from determining an affirmative defense of age discrimination, <span class="Italic">Boulineau v. Dept. of Army</span>, 57 MSPR 244, 248-49 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the appellant correctly argues that the administrative judge erred in not adjudicating his allegation of age discrimination. The record reflects that during a September 11, 1990, prehearing conference, the administrative judge paraphrased the <span id="Page_3386"></span>appellant's allegation as a claim that the testing for coronary artery disease discriminated against older employees because they were less likely to pass the screening. The administrative judge stated that she would not entertain the allegation because the appellant was attempting to attack the agency's decision to implement its testing program pursuant to AR 40-501, a decision that had previously been determined by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, Southern Division, to be unreviewable in the absence of a claimed contravention of a constitutional right, which the appellant had not alleged<span class="Italic">. Professional Helicopter Pilots Association v. Carlucci</span>, 731 F. Supp. 440, 448 (M.D. Ala. 1990) (<span class="Italic">PHPA</span>). To reach its conclusions concerning AR 40-501, <span class="Italic">PHPA</span> relied upon <span class="Italic">Mindes v. Seaman</span>, 453 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1971), the leading case on the reviewability of military matters, despite the fact that <span class="Italic">PHPA</span> involved civilian employees working as contractors for the military agency<span class="Italic">. PHPA,</span> 731 F. Supp. at 441-44.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the conclusions of the district court on this issue.[7] As a matter of policy, the Board finds that the appellant's claim of age discrimination is subject to appellate review. The circuit court cases applying the <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> test have involved only military personnel or matters of military concern<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Christoffersen v. Washington State Air National Guard</span>, 855 F.2d 1437, 1440 (9th Cir. 1988), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 490 U.S. 1098 (1989); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of the Navy</span>, 787 F.2d 552, 558 n.8 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Thus, for purposes of Board adjudications, we find that <span class="Italic">Mindes</span> applies only to military employees and matters which are inherently of a military nature, not to civilian employees of military agencies. This issue was specifically addressed by the Ninth Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. Webb.</span>, 839 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir. 1988), and that court held that a Title VII claim brought by a civilian employee of a military department was justiciable<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1359-60<span class="Italic">. See also Doviak v. Department of the Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01860381 (May 21, 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, rather than those of the district courts, are binding upon the Board<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under statutory authority, the Board may review claims of age discrimination in connection with removal actions. 5 USC 7512, 7701(a). In addition, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 specifically covers civilian employees in military departments. 29 USC 633a. Finally, agency actions are generally presumed to be subject to appellate review. <span class="Italic">See Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 108 S. Ct. 818, 821 (1988). As we have determined that the appellant's age discrimination claim is not subject to the military exception to appellate review, the administrative judge erred in finding that this claim was not within the jurisdiction of the Board.</p>
