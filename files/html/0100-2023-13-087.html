<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-87"><span class="space">c.</span> Effect of Receipt of OWCP Benefit</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Duncan v. SSA</span>, 99 MSPR 512, 513-16 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 5-12 (2005), found no bar to an enforced leave claim, despite receipt of OWCP benefits, if the employer initiates the employee's leave status; the employee is entitled to salary during the period of the enforced leave, with a setoff for OWCP benefits received:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has periodically received Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) benefits due to an on-the-job injury she sustained in 1997 (carpal tunnel syndrome). The appellant was initially approved for OWCP benefits in 2002 and received benefits whenever she was unable to perform her duties. The appellant had pre-signed a number of CA-7 forms so that the agency could file them for her when she could not report for duty or when she had a doctor's appointment. On November 17, 2003, the agency submitted one of the appellant's pre-signed CA-7 forms to OWCP and requested that the appellant be placed on OWCP's rolls. On that same day, and while the appellant was performing her assigned duties, the appellant was advised that the agency could no longer accommodate her and that she could no longer report for duty. The appellant was placed in a leave without pay (LWOP) status beginning on November 19, 2003, pending the receipt of OWCP benefits, and sent home from work. The appellant subsequently received OWCP benefits retroactive to November 19, 2003.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant was receiving benefits equivalent to her salary and, thus, she had not been suspended without pay. Therefore, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of Board jurisdiction. The AJ found further that, absent an appealable action, the appellant's claim of disability discrimination is insufficient to bring her appeal within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant reasserts that she should be accommodated at work and that the agency suspended her when it placed her on OWCP's rolls. She asserts that she was successfully performing her duties when the agency determined that, based on medical documentation that her condition had been determined to be permanent, it could no longer accommodate her. She asserts that, because she has received nothing from OWCP stating that she cannot return to work, the agency's action barring her from returning to work is a constructive suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's placement on enforced leave for more than fourteen days, pending the agency's inquiry into her physical ability to perform, is a disciplinary-type action within the Board's jurisdiction<span class="Italic">. Pittman v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 832 F.2d 598, 599-600<span class="Italic"></span> (Fed. Cir. 1987). Further, the availability of work within an employee's medical restrictions, while relevant to the merits of a decision to suspend the employee pending an inquiry into her physical inability to perform, is irrelevant to the jurisdictional issue; rather, the dispositive question on jurisdiction is whether the employee voluntarily placed herself on leave or the agency placed her on leave contrary to her wishes<span class="Italic">. Rivas v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 121, 127-28 (1994), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 383 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant was at work performing her assigned duties when the agency advised her that it had placed her on LWOP. The agency then sent her home and refused to allow her to return to work. Although the agency notified the appellant that it had submitted a CA-7 form to OWCP to obtain benefits for her, it does not change the fact that she was still placed in a non-pay status while waiting for the OWCP benefits to start. Further, even though the record indicates that the appellant had pre-signed several CA-7 forms so that the agency could request OWCP benefits on those occasions when she could not report to work due to her work-related medical condition, the agency's decision to request that the appellant be placed on OWCP's rolls while she was working was without the consent of the appellant. Because there are no exceptions to the above stated law on constructive suspension, the appellant's allegation that she was constructively suspended is non-frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the AJ found that the appellant was not constructively suspended because she has not suffered any loss in pay since she is receiving benefits equivalent to her "full" salary. Thus, the AJ impliedly found that the appellant's receipt of OWCP benefits essentially mooted her constructive suspension claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ's conclusion is incorrect, however. Receipt of OWCP benefits does not moot a constructive suspension claim. <span class="Italic">Schultz v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 123 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9 (2001). As explained in <span class="Italic">Brownlow v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 349 &#x00B6; 9 (2000), and <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 601 &#x00B6; 9 (1999), an appellant who has been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action is entitled to back pay with an offset for any OWCP payments received during the relevant period. Thus, in this instance, the appellant's receipt of OWCP benefits would not preclude her from receiving back pay with an offset for the OWCP payments during the relevant period. Therefore, the appellant's receipt of OWCP payments does not prevent our finding that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that the agency constructively suspended her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who makes a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">Young v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 187 &#x00B6; 22 (1999). A nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction is an allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the appellant's allegations that the agency put her in a non-pay status, barred her from the workplace, and processed a request for her to be placed on OWCP's rolls against her wishes, constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation that she was constructively suspended. Therefore, the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Okleson v. USPS</span>, 90 MSPR 415, 423 n.3 (2001), an OWCP award does not bind the Board as to the appellant's claim that he could have worked if his disabling condition was accommodated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">New v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 1998), the Federal Circuit stated that OWCP decisions do not bind the Board only when the Board or the employing agency acts within its own statutory sphere of authority. With respect to the appellant's involuntary retirement and constructive suspension claims, the determinative question is whether the agency met its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> to accommodate the appellant's compensable, and non-compensable, physical and mental limitations<span class="Italic">. See Rule v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 85 M.S.P.R. 388 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2000). Such a determination is within the Board's statutory sphere of authority<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1) ("Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--(A) has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and (B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by--...(iii) section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791),...the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section."). Thus, the fact that OWCP found the agency's rehabilitation job offer suitable with respect to the appellant's compensable knee injury does not bind the Board with respect to the appellant's involuntary retirement and constructive suspension claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, an OWCP claim was no bar to a constructive suspension claim in <span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 242, 244-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long held that jurisdiction over an appeal from an alleged constructive suspension does not depend on whether the employee was ready, willing, and able to work. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Gallegos v. Department of the Air Force</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 70 M.S.P.R. 483, 485 (1996); <span class="Italic">Vargo v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 49 M.S.P.R. 284, 286-87 (1991) (whether the appellant was ready, willing, and able to work in a constructive suspension appeal is a back pay/compliance issue, not a jurisdictional requirement); <span class="Italic">Passmore v. Department of Transportation</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 65, 69-70 (1986). Instead, the "key question" in appeals such as this is whether the agency or the employee initiated the leave. <span class="Italic">Gallegos</span>, 70 M.S.P.R. at 485; <span class="Italic">see Alston v. Social Security Administration</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 252 &#x00B6; 11 (2003) (the "dispositive question" in determining whether a suspension took place is who initiated the absence), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 95 Fed. Appx. 314 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 24, 2004); <span class="Italic">Rivas v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 121, 127-28 (1994) (the dispositive question on jurisdiction is whether the employee voluntarily placed himself on leave or the agency placed him on leave contrary to his wishes), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds</span>, 72 M.S.P.R. 383 (1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, therefore, the AJ's finding that the Board lacked jurisdiction over this appeal, because the appellant was only allegedly ready, willing, and able to work for less than fourteen days of his absence, is contrary to the Board's case law set forth above. In addition, the AJ's statement that the appellant's claim for OWCP compensation was inconsistent with his claim of an enforced suspension for the same period of time, <span id="Page_2061"></span>and therefore should not be counted toward the alleged constructive suspension period, does not comport with Board precedent. The Board has held that an OWCP determination that there is no compensable injury does not prevent an appellant from asserting that he was constructively suspended due to the agency's failure to return him to duty after an injury or illness. <span class="Italic">See Hahn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 139 &#x00B6; 8 n.1 (2000); <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 84 M.S.P.R. 374 &#x00B6; 10 n.5 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier decisions appeared to suggest that an employee's claim concerning enforced leave was essentially mooted for lack of an available remedy if he is granted OWCP benefits for the period of the leave. <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, 31 MSPR 604, 606 (1986). The Board applied <span class="Italic">Williams</span> in <span class="Italic">Schultz v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 159, 163-64 (1998):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 680, 692 (1996), we held that if an employee who initiated his own absence from work requests to return to work within certain medical restrictions, and if the agency is bound by agency policy, regulation, or contractual provision to offer available light-duty work to such an employee, the employee's continued absence constitutes a constructive suspension appealable to the Board if the agency fails to offer the employee any available light-duty work. This principle applies by analogy to the present case. As noted above, the appellant's absence after November 7, 1990, was voluntary. He requested to return to work within certain restrictions, and as of February 24, 1992, the agency was bound by statute--specifically, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC &#x00A7; 791--to accommodate his hand condition and to allow him to return. Accordingly, we hold that the appellant's absence became a constructive suspension on February 24, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally upon finding that an employee was constructively suspended, the Board will order the employee "restored" as of the date the suspension began, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Rivas</span>, 61 MSPR at 131, but that approach is not appropriate here. The appellant informed the AJ that he has received "both medical benefits and wage replacement compensation" from the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) "for the entire period of absence." The agency then submitted corroborating evidence showing that the appellant received such OWCP benefits covering the period November 6, 1990, through April 29, 1996. The OWCP award covers the entire period of the constructive suspension, i.e., February 24, 1992, the date the agency should have allowed the appellant to return to work, through November 23, 1992, the day before the appellant was retroactively reinstated when the AJ issued his decision on the merits reversing the appellant's removal. The fact that the appellant has received OWCP wage replacement benefits for the entire period of his constructive suspension means that there is no further remedy available under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7512. <span class="Italic">See Williams v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 31 MSPR 604, 606 (1986) (receipt of OWCP benefits for a period of enforced leave moots a constructive suspension claim).</p>
