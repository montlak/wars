<h4 class="h4" id="sec1-177"><span class="space">9.</span> National Guard Technicians</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The civil service does not include positions in the armed services. <span class="Italic">Sterling v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-3443-13-1830-I-1 (NP 1/14/2014). But some civilian positions have military aspects, notably civilian technicians of the National Guard. The fortunes of appeals by National Guard Technicians wax and wane. Through the end of 2016, technicians had no adverse action appeal rights to the Board, although they had appeals from the denial of restoration rights. Then, through Section 512 of the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act, signed by the President in late December of 2016, technicians received some appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 32 USC 709(f):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of law and under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;a person employed under subsection (a) who is a military technician (dual status) and otherwise subject to the requirements of subsection (b) who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;is separated from the National Guard or ceases to hold the military grade specified by the Secretary concerned for that position shall be promptly separated from military technician (dual status) employment by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;fails to meet the military security standards established by the Secretary concerned for a member of a reserve component under his jurisdiction may be separated from employment as a military technician (dual status) and concurrently discharged from the National Guard by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a technician may, at any time, be separated from his technician employment for cause by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in force, removal, or an adverse action involving discharge from technician employment, suspension, furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation shall be accomplished by the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a right of appeal which may exist with respect to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned when the appeal concerns activity occurring while the member is in a military pay status, or concerns fitness for duty in the reserve components;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;with respect to an appeal concerning any activity not covered by paragraph (4), the provisions of sections 7511, 7512, and 7513 of title 5, and section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 [1] (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16) shall apply; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(6)&#x2003;a technician shall be notified in writing of the termination of his employment as a technician and, unless the technician is serving under a temporary appointment, is serving in a trial or probationary period, or has voluntarily ceased to be a member of the National Guard when such membership is a condition of employment, such notification shall be given at least 30 days before the termination date of such employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2022, OPM amended its regulations to establish for adverse action coverage, 5 CFR 752.401(f) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(17)&#x2003;An action taken against a technician in the National Guard concerning any activity under 32 U.S.C. 709(f)(4), except as provided by 32 U.S.C. 709(f)(5).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In its notice of proposed rulemaking, OPM explained, 87 Fed. Reg. 200, 205 (Jan. 4, 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 752.401 Coverage This section discusses adverse actions and employees covered under this subpart. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017 added MSPB appeal rights for National Guard military technicians for certain adverse actions taken against them when they are not in a military pay status or when the issue does not involve fitness for duty in the reserve component. In &#x00A7; 752.401(b), OPM proposes to add an exclusion for an action taken against a technician in the National Guard as provided in section 709(f)(4) of title 32, United States Code. In &#x00A7; 752.401(d), OPM proposes to remove from the list of employees excluded from coverage of this subpart "a technician in the National Guard described in section 8337(h)(1) of title 5, United States Code, who is employed under section 709(a) of title 32, United States Code."

<p class="Body-Text">As to performance actions, the OPM rulemaking notice stated, 87 Fed. Reg. 200, 201 (Jan. 4. 2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 432.102 identifies actions and employees covered by this part. The proposed rule at &#x00A7; 432.102 updates coverage to align with the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2017, Public Law 114-328 (Dec. 23, 2016). Specifically, section 512(a)(1)(C) of the 2017 NDAA provides appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. 7511, 7512, and 7513 to dual status National Guard technicians for certain adverse actions. Section 512(c) repealed 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(5), which excluded National Guard technicians from the definition of "employee."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The repeal of 5 U.S.C. 7511(b)(5) and the coverage of National Guard technicians under 5 U.S.C. 7511, 7512, and 7513 required that OPM review 5 U.S.C. 4303. Section 4303(e) provides that any employee who is a preference eligible, in the competitive service, or in the excepted service and covered by subchapter II of chapter 75, and who has been reduced in grade or removed under this section is entitled to appeal the action to the MSPB under section 7701.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, MSPB appeal rights must be extended to National Guard technicians who are defined in section 4303(e). OPM proposes to revise paragraphs (b) and (f) of &#x00A7; 432.102 to reflect that certain performance-based actions against dual status National Guard technicians are no longer excluded. Specifically, OPM proposes to add as an exclusion an action against a technician in the National Guard concerning any activity under section 709(f)(4) of title 32, United States Code, except as provided by section 709(f)(5) of title 32, United States Code. In addition, the proposed rule removes the exclusion at &#x00A7; 432.102(f)(12): "A technician in the National Guard described in 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)(1), employed under section 709(b) of title 32."...addition, the proposed rule removes the exclusion at &#x00A7; 432.102(f)(12): "A technician in the National Guard described in 5 U.S.C. 8337(h)(1), employed under section 709(b) of title 32."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Leonard Dyer petitions for review of a decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board ("Board") affirming the West Virginia adjutant general's termination of Mr. Dyer from his position as a dual-status military technician with the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 ("NGTA") established authority for dual-status positions like Mr. Dyer's. Under 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, the NGTA requires dual-status technicians to maintain military membership with the National Guard. Mr. Dyer met this requirement by maintaining membership with the West Virginia Air National Guard ("WVANG") until 2018, when Mr. Dyer was separated from the WVANG. The WV adjutant general terminated his dual-status position because he no longer met the military membership requirement of his employment. Mr. Dyer appealed the termination to the Board, arguing that he was not provided the due process he is entitled to under Title 5.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A threshold issue in this petition for review is whether the Board had jurisdiction to review Mr. Dyer's termination from his dual-status position as a result of his separation from the WVANG. The Board determined that the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act ("NDAA"), which amended the NGTA in part, provided it jurisdiction. We disagree. We hold that according to 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the termination of a dual-status employee to the extent the termination was required under the statute because the employee had been separated from the National Guard. We therefore vacate the Board's decision and remand with instructions to dismiss Mr. Dyer's appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We do not reach the merits of Mr. Dyer's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dyer enlisted in the WVANG in December 1979 and continued his service for thirty-seven years, ultimately reaching the rank of master sergeant. In 1990, the WV adjutant general--the highest-ranking member of the WV National Guard--appointed Mr. Dyer in his civilian capacity to a "dual status" position as a military technician supporting the state's 130th Airlift Wing Maintenance Group. The dual-status nature of Mr. Dyer's appointment reflects that his position was part civilian, as a federal employee of the U.S. Air Force, and part military, as a member of the state National Guard. As a requirement to maintain his "dual status" position, Mr. Dyer was required to continue his membership with the WVANG. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(b), (f)(1)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In June 2017, the WVANG's Selective Retention Review Board recommended Mr. Dyer's separation from the WV National Guard. Based on this recommendation, the WV adjutant general notified Mr. Dyer that he would be separated from the WVANG at the close of the year, i.e., December 31, 2017. The notice provided Mr. Dyer an opportunity to request reconsideration, which he did. On reconsideration, the adjutant general declined to overturn the separation decision but extended Mr. Dyer's term of service for an additional six months, until June 30, 2018.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 28, 2017, just after sending Mr. Dyer notice that he would be separated from the WVANG, the adjutant general sent a second notice notifying Mr. Dyer that upon his separation from the WVANG, his position as a dual-status technician would be terminated because he would no longer fulfill the &#x00A7; 709(b) requirement of National Guard membership.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 29, 2018, just before the expiration of his term with the WVANG, Mr. Dyer filed an age discrimination complaint with the National Guard's Equal Employment Opportunity ("EEO") office challenging his commander's recommendation to separate him from his military position with the WV National Guard. On November 19, 2018, the EEO office dismissed Mr. Dyer's claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December 2018, Mr. Dyer filed the underlying appeal with the Board. Mr. Dyer argued that he was not provided the procedural protections of Title 5 when he was terminated from his dual-status position. The parties agree that the Board does not have the authority to review the WV adjutant general's decision to separate Mr. Dyer from the WVANG.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The government argued that Mr. Dyer was not a covered employee under Title 5 because he was terminated for failure to maintain his military status and that according to &#x00A7; 709, this was a condition of employment over which the Board has no authority to review. The administrative judge ("AJ"), however, determined that the NDAA provided Mr. Dyer coverage under Title 5. The AJ therefore determined that it had jurisdiction over Mr. Dyer's appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ next considered the merits of Mr. Dyer's appeal. The AJ determined that Mr. Dyer was provided due process consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold issue, the government argues that the Board did not have jurisdiction over Mr. Dyer's appeal. For the below-described reasons, we agree.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 formally established dual-status technicians as they exist today. Pub. L. No. 90-486, 82 Stat. 755 (codified in relevant part at 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709). Prior to the NGTA, Congress had authorized National Guard technicians, formerly called "caretakers and clerks," to provide support to the National Guard military organization. These technicians were state employees paid with federal funds, and most were members of the National Guard. Congress passed the NGTA with the purpose of converting technicians to federal employees in order to provide them with a uniform system of federal salaries and benefits, and to clarify their status as covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 90-1823, at 1 (1968), <span class="Italic">as reprinted in</span> 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3318, 3319.

<p class="Block-Quote1">According to &#x00A7; 709, "dual-status" technicians occupy a unique space between federal/state organizations and civilian/military status. Dual-status technicians work in a variety of roles with National Guards but are designated employees of the U.S. Army or Air Force. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(a). Even though dual-status technicians are federal employees, authority over dual-status technicians, including all hiring and firing decisions, remains with the National Guard at the state level. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(d), (f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be employed as a dual-status technician, among other requirements, the civilian must be a military member of the National Guard. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(b)(2).

<p class="Block-Quote1">As provided by the NGTA, under &#x00A7; 709(f)(4), all rights of appeal were previously limited to the state adjutant general for terminations resulting from separations under &#x00A7; 709(f)(1)(A) due to failure to maintain National Guard membership. Section 709(f)(4) of Title 32 stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of law...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a right of appeal which may exist with respect to paragraph (1)...shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned;....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, according to the NGTA, &#x00A7; 709 previously excluded dual-status technicians from certain protections of Title 5. Relevant here, the statute provided that &#x00A7; 7511 of Title 5 did not apply to a person employed as a dual-status technician. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(g). Section 7511 defines "employee" for the purpose of Title 5 to specify which persons are entitled to its protections and may appeal to the Board. Consistent with the NGTA, &#x00A7; 7511 expressly excluded dual-status technicians from the definition of an "employee" covered by Title 5. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(5) (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In December 2016, Congress passed the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act to "clarify" that dual-status technicians, "under certain conditions, may appeal adverse employment actions to the Merit Systems Protection Board and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission." <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 114-840, at 1016-17, 2016 WL 7042751 (2016). The NDAA amended portions of the NGTA and one portion of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2017 NDAA, Pub. L. No. 114-328, &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 512, 513, 130 Stat. 2000, 2112-13 (2016) (codified at 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As amended, &#x00A7; 709 maintains the requirements that dual-status technicians must be members of the National Guard, &#x00A7; 709(b)(2), and that the adjutant general must "promptly separate[ ]" from dual-status employment a technician who is separated from the National Guard, &#x00A7; 709(f)(1). The NDAA, however, added a clause to &#x00A7; 709(f)(4) limiting the prohibition on appeal rights. Section 709(f)(4) now states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(f)&#x2003;Notwithstanding any other provision of law...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a right of appeal which may exist with respect to paragraph (1)...shall not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction concerned <span class="Italic">when the appeal concerns activity occurring while the member is in a military pay status, or concerns fitness for duty in the reserve components</span>....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_292"></span>32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(4) (2016) (emphasis added reflecting added language).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The NDAA also amended sections related to Title 5 to allow dual-status employees to be covered in some circumstances. The NDAA added paragraph (5) to &#x00A7; 709(f), providing that certain provisions of Title 5--including &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511, 7512, and 7513--"shall apply" to "an appeal concerning any activity not covered by paragraph (4)." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(5) (2016). Section 709(g) was also amended to provide that dual-status technicians remain excluded from &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511 and 7512, among other sections of Title 5, "[e]xcept as provided in subsection (f)." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 709(g). And, consistent with this change, the NDAA amended Title 5 to eliminate the categorical exclusion of dual-status technicians from the definition of "employee" subject to Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b) (2016).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government argues that the NGTA precludes Board review of the WV adjutant general's decision to terminate Mr. Dyer from his dual-status position in this case. According to the government, the NGTA required the adjutant general to "promptly separate[ ]" Mr. Dyer from his dual-status position once he had been separated from the WVANG. Appellee's Br. 22 (citing 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(1)(A) (emphasis removed)). The government acknowledges that the NDAA afforded dual-status technicians Board review rights in some cases but asserts that the changes do not confer review rights in this case. The government argues that here the statute precludes a right to appeal beyond the state adjutant general because Mr. Dyer's separation "concern[ed] fitness for duty in the reserve components." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 22-23 (citing 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(4)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the government that the Board does not have jurisdiction to review the adjutant general's separation of Mr. Dyer from his dual-status position in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, we agree that, in passing the NDAA, Congress intended for dual-status technicians to be able to invoke review rights under Title 5 in some actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(4)-(5). Before the NDAA, the express language of the NGTA precluded a right of appeal for a variety of adverse actions taken by the adjutant general with respect to dual-status employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f) (2015). And the NGTA expressly excluded dual-status employees from certain Title 5 protections, including the ability to appeal adverse employment actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(f), (g) (2015).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the NDAA, however, the statute has been clarified to allow civilian dual-status technicians to appeal some adverse employment actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 114-840, at 1016-17. Indeed, rather than broadly excluding Title 5 as before, the statute now takes the opposite approach. Dual-status technicians may now be considered "employees" under Title 5, thereby providing a right of appeal, except as limited by &#x00A7; 709(f). Specifically, &#x00A7; 709(f) excludes a dual-status technician from Title 5's definition of "employee" and thus precludes a right of appeal when the employment action (1) "concerns activity occurring while the member is in a military pay status" or (2) "concerns fitness for duty in the reserve components." 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(4) (2017). As amended, the statute provides that "fitness for duty in the reserve components" means "military-unique service requirements that attend to military service generally." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(j)(2) (2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there appears to be no dispute that Mr. Dyer was not in military pay status when he was terminated from dual-status employment. The WV adjutant general explained that Mr. Dyer was terminated from his dual-status position because, once separated from the WVANG, he no longer met a requirement of his employment. Appx. 25 (citing &#x00A7; 709(a)). The relevant question therefore becomes: Did Mr. Dyer's termination from dual-status employment as a result of separation from the National Guard "concern[ ] fitness for duty in the reserve components"? We conclude that it did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Looking first to the language of the statute, it is clear that membership in the National Guard is a fundamental military-specific requirement attendant to a dual-status employee's military service. As previously described, &#x00A7; 709(b) provides that a person employed as a dual-status technician must meet several requirements, including being "a member of the National Guard." &#x00A7; 709(b)(2) (2017).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">National Guard membership is central to the military function of a "dual-status" technician. Beyond mere membership, the provision requires a dual-status technician to hold a particular military grade, and, while performing duties as a dual-status technician, to "wear the uniform appropriate for the member's grade and component of the armed forces." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(b)(3)-(4). Notably, if a dual-status technician is not a member of the National Guard, he cannot fulfill these additional requirements prescribed by statute.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We do not mean to suggest the only "military-specific requirements" are those prescribed by statute. Rather, looking to the language of the statute, we find that ability to meet at least those "military-specific requirements" included in the statute must "concern[ ] fitness for duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our interpretation is further confirmed by the remainder of the statute. Section 709 instructs that the adjutant general must "promptly separate[ ]" from dual-status employment any technician who has been separated from the National Guard. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 709(f)(1)(A) (2017). The statute does not provide the adjutant general any discretion with respect to termination of a dual-status employee that has been separated from the National Guard. Nor does the statute take into account the reason for separation. Even the parties agree that the Board does not have jurisdiction to review Mr. Dyer's separation from the WVANG.[4] Thus, accepting that a separation has occurred, termination from dual-status employment is required.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Though Mr. Dyer cannot seek review of his military separation from the Board, Mr. Dyer was not without any opportunity for review of that decision. Mr. Dyer was provided the opportunity to respond to the initial retirement recommendation, and the opportunity to request reconsideration of the subsequent separation decision. Notably, this review came from within the National Guard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, with respect to notice required for termination under &#x00A7; 709(f), the statute contemplates exactly this case. Paragraph 6 of subsection (f) describes a circumstance in which a decision to separate a technician from the National Guard will result in termination of his dual-status employment. 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709(f)(6) (2017). The statute provides that in such circumstances, the employee shall be given at least 30 days written notice of his termination of employment. The statute does not provide an opportunity to respond or to request reconsideration.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The procedural rights provided by &#x00A7; 709(f) are inconsistent with those provided by &#x00A7; 7513 of Title 5, which further requires an opportunity to respond or appear at a hearing. Having expressed that there are circumstances when the protections of &#x00A7; 7513 would apply to a dual-status employee, but declining to apply such protections to terminations under &#x00A7; 709(f)(1), the statute suggests that Congress did not intend for the protections of Title 5 to apply to terminations under &#x00A7; 709(f)(1). The most consistent reading of the statute therefore precludes Board review when the adverse employment action was required by &#x00A7; 709(f)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Dyer's limited argument to the contrary is not persuasive. To the extent that Mr. Dyer argues the Board has jurisdiction, he relies on the AJ's conclusion that the Board may review his appeal as a failure to maintain a condition of employment. As support, both the AJ and Mr. Dyer cite <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court considered the removal of an employee "for cause" because he had failed to maintain a security clearance that was a condition of his employment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 520. The Court concluded that even though the Board could not review the underlying decision to deny security clearance, the Board had jurisdiction to review his removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 530-31. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, however, is inapposite here. As an initial matter, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not consider &#x00A7; 709 at all. Furthermore, unlike in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, Mr. Dyer's termination was not "for cause." Instead, Mr. Dyer's termination was compelled by statute due his failure to meet a requirement of employment provided for by statute. Thus, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not change our interpretation of &#x00A7; 709 in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Dyer's termination from dual-status employment under &#x00A7; 709(f)(1) as a result of his separation from the National Guard "concern[ed] fitness for duty." We therefore conclude that Mr. Dyer's termination falls within an exception precluding a right of appeal to the Board under &#x00A7; 709(f)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the above-described reasons we hold that according to 32 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 709, the Board does not have jurisdiction over the termination of a dual-status employee to the extent the termination was required under the statute because the employee had been separated from the National Guard. We therefore vacate the Board's decision and remand to the Board with instructions to dismiss Mr. Dyer's appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Guard technicians are in a hybrid position which combines both military and civilian aspects. During the week, guard technicians are like other federal service employees, in that they have access to the EEOC grievance system. However, their positions are dependant on maintaining commensurate positions in the reserve forces. They wear uniforms, address each other by military rank, and perform military training one weekend a month and fifteen days a year. On the other hand, they are under the general schedule of pay rather than under military rank allotments and entitlements.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Coverage of National Guard technicians under the Reform Act was addressed in <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Everett</span>, 28 MSPR 348, 353 (1985), involving an employee removed from his civilian technician position for statements he made about his superior. Board jurisdiction depended on the nature of the appellant's civilian appointment. The Board explained that the National Guard Technician Act, 32 USC 709, makes technicians federal employees rather than employees of their state governments. The Act requires simultaneous service as National Guard members and provides for the termination of a technician who is separated from the Guard, for failure to meet military security standards or for cause. The statute provided that any right of appeal should not extend beyond the state adjutant general. The Board concluded that Congress wanted to extend to Guardsmen certain uniform pay and retirement benefits, yet Congress intended to assure continued state control over the employment of Guard members and technicians. The Board concluded that the Guard was not a covered agency within the relevant sections of the Reform Act, a result consistent with administrative and court decisions determining that the labor relations provisions of that Act do not apply to National Guard technicians. As a consequence, the Special Counsel could not seek discipline of National Guard technicians for prohibited personnel practices since the prohibited personnel practice remedies were part of the Reform Act and subject to the jurisdictional limitations of that statute. Another consequence of the independence of the National Guard from MSPB remedial authority is that the Board cannot enforce an IRA remedy against the Guard, even though it technically has jurisdiction to consider the Guardsman's appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McVay v. Arkansas Nat'l Guard</span>, 80 MSPR 120, 124-25 (1998) [discussed in Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-20-096.html#sec13-93">Status of Particular Agencies and Employees</a>"] .</p>

<p class="Body-Text">In 1991 the Board decided that its jurisdiction included restoration right appeals by National Guard technicians. <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182 (1991), <span class="Italic">reversing</span> <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 45 MSPR 173, 177 (1990), involved a dispute over an employee's restoration rights following a tour of duty with the Air Force. <span class="Italic">Kostan</span>, 50 MSPR at 183-87, explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review to the full Board, the National Guard Bureau, intervening under 5 CFR 1201.34(c), supported the Arizona National Guard's position that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review a restoration claim brought <span id="Page_294"></span>by a National Guard technician. Relying on its decision in <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Massachusetts Nat'l Guard</span>, 42 MSPR 251 (1989), the Board affirmed the initial decision, finding that the appellant had no right of appeal under 5 CFR 353.401 because he did not hold a position in a Federal agency. <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 45 MSPR 173 (1990). On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the intervenor reversed its position, arguing that the Board does have jurisdiction over restoration claims brought by National Guard technicians. The court remanded the case to the Board to consider the intervenor's arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The National Guard Technicians Act of 1968 granted National Guard technicians, previously considered state employees, Federal employee status: "A technician...is an employee of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and an employee of the United States." 32 USC 709(d). Even though the Departments of the Army and Air Force are clearly Federal agencies within the meaning of the restoration statute and regulations, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> that technicians are Federal employees who hold positions in state organizations, and that they are therefore not entitled under 5 CFR 353.401(a) to file a restoration appeal with the Board....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board concluded that, notwithstanding the fact that technicians are Federal employees by virtue of 32 USC 709, they hold positions in the state National Guards, which are state organizations not included within the definition of agency contained in 5 CFR 353.102 and that they therefore have no right of appeal under 5 CFR 353.401(a)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the instant case was appealed to the Federal Circuit, the intervenor brought to the attention of the court an uncodified provision of the National Guard Technicians Act that was not considered in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Except as provided in this Act and in the amendments made by this Act</span>, and notwithstanding any law, rule, regulation, or decision to the contrary, the positions of persons employed under section 709 of title 32, United States Code, existing on the day before the effective date of this Act, and the persons holding those positions on that day, shall, on and after that effective date, be considered to be positions in and employees of the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force, as the case may be, and employees of the United States <span class="Italic">to the same extent as other positions in and employees of the Department of the Army or the Department of the Air Force</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pub.&#x2003;L. No. 90-486, sec. 3(b), 82 Stat. 755, 757 (1968). (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the primary concerns promoting the enactment of the 1968 Act were the lack of a uniform and adequate retirement and fringe benefit program, and the question of the technicians' legal status under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the language employed in section 3(b) establishes conclusively that technicians are not to be considered as Federal employees for these purposes only. Despite the fact that they work for state organizations under the authority of a state official, technicians must be considered as civilian employees of the Departments of the Army or Air Force who possess all the rights held by other Army and Air Force employees, save those rights specifically denied them in the National Guard Technicians Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act specifies only four situations in which technicians have lesser rights than other Army and Air Force employees: (1) separation from civilian employment in instances involving loss of a required military Guard membership or a military grade specified for the position; (2) separation from civilian employment as a result of failure to meet military security standards; (3) separation for cause by the adjutant general; and (4) reduction in force or adverse action involving discharge, suspension, furlough without pay, or reduction in rank or compensation. 32 USC 709(e). In each of these instances, a technician's right of appeal does not extend beyond the adjutant general of the jurisdiction involved. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Restoration claims under 38 USC 2021-2026 do not fall within any of the above exceptions. Accordingly, we conclude that a technician must be considered as a civilian employee...and thus an "employee of an agency in the executive branch" who has the same right as other civilian employees of the Army and Air Force to appeal a failure to restore or improper restoration under 5 CFR 353.401(a). The Board's contrary holding in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> is hereby overruled.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Board reinforced its holding in <span class="Italic">Gordon</span> by reference to its enforcement authority, which is limited to orders directed to Federal agencies and employees. Noting that a state National Guard is a state organization, and that the adjutant general--the only person authorized by law to employ a technician--is a state official, the Board found it incongruous for the Board to have jurisdiction to adjudicate the appellant's entitlement to restoration, but no authority to ensure compliance with the adjudication.... This concern remains troubling, but we find it an inadequate basis for deciding the jurisdictional issue, which is the only issue before the Board at this time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kostan</span> was applied, and some remedial ramifications were elucidated regarding restoration rights, in <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Connecticut Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 120, 123-24 (1991) ("deemed no longer effect" in <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a separate case also remanded to the Board by the Federal Circuit, we have overruled <span class="Italic">Gordon</span>, holding that a National Guard technician must be considered as a civilian employee of the Department of the Army or Air Force, and thus an "employee of an agency in the executive branch" who has the same right as other civilian employees of the Army and Air Force to appeal a failure to restore or improper restoration under 5 CFR 353.401(a). <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 50 MSPR 182, 186-87 (1991). Accordingly, we reverse our prior decision dismissing the appellant's restoration claim for lack of jurisdiction. We therefore turn to the agency's contentions of error with respect to the merits of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Military membership in the National Guard was a condition of the appellant's employment as a civilian technician. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 USC 709(b). When such a technician is separated from the National Guard or ceases to hold the military grade specified for his position, the adjutant general of the jurisdiction involved must "promptly separate [the individual] from his technician employment." 32 USC 709(e)(1). Before such separation can be effected, however, the individual must be given at least 30 days' written notice. 32 USC 709(e)(6).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the appellant had lost his military membership in the National Guard, the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant was not entitled to an indefinite restoration to his technician position. He was, however, entitled to be restored for at least the 30-day statutory notice period....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The back pay issue in this case is virtually identical to that faced by the Court of Claims in <span class="Italic">Polos v. United States</span>, 621 F.2d 385, 223 Ct. Cl. 547 (1980). The plaintiff in that case also sought restoration to his technician position and back pay after he was discharged from his military position in the Air National Guard for physical disability. There, as here, the state National Guard unit delayed in providing the written notice of separation required by 32 USC 709(e)(6). Rejecting the agency's argument that the plaintiff's back pay should be limited to 30 days, the court held that the 30-day period after which Poulos could be separated did not begin to run until the date of the formal, written notice of separation, even though Polos might have been on actual notice prior to that date.... The court therefore approved an award of back pay from the date Polos sought restoration, until 30 days following the written notice of separation, a period of 80 days....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The parties in this case were in agreement that the appellant's back pay should commence on July 23, 1988, the earliest date he was eligible for restoration. Following the precedent in <span class="Italic">Polos</span>, the administrative judge properly calculated that the appellant's back pay should continue through August 16, 1989, 30 days after the agency's written notice of separation of July 17, 1989. Although the period of back pay is considerably longer here than in <span class="Italic">Polos</span>, this is solely a result of the agency's delay of almost a year in providing the appellant proper notice of separation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before 1991, the Board disclaimed jurisdiction over appeals by members of the Guard involving restoration in the Guard following active military service, reasoning that Guard technicians were not considered covered employees. <span class="Italic">Kostan v. Arizona Nat'l Guard</span>, 45 MSPR 173, 177 (1990), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Kostan v.
