<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-58"><span class="space">c.</span> WPEA: Exercise of, Testimony or Assistance in, Appeal, Complaint, or Grievance</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The correlation is subtle between a prohibited personnel practice involving a violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(9) and a remedy (including damages) through an Individual right of action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the IRA provisions of the Reform Act, amended by the WPEA, 5 USC 1221 states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) or section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;This section may not be construed to prohibit any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment from seeking corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board before seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, if such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 2302(b)(9) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(9)&#x2003;take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003; with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8); or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003; other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph (8);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii);....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The result is that if the IRA appeal involves the appellant's own <span id="Page_3744"></span>appeal, complaint, or grievance, to be actionable as an IRA, that appeal, complaint, or grievance must disclose a traditional whistleblowing matter described at 5 US 2302(b)(8), <span class="Italic">Johnson v. MSPB</span>, ___Fed. Appx.___ (Fed. Cir. 2022 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[A]n IRA appellant must non-frivolously allege that she has made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). Section 1221(e)(1) does not refer to &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii). Therefore, if an IRA appeal is based on &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(ii)--i.e., it is based on an appellant making a disclosure by "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation...<span class="Italic">other than</span> with regard to remedying a violation of" &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)--then the Board does not have jurisdiction. In relevant part, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) prohibits an agency from taking or failing to take a personnel action with respect to an employee or applicant for employment for making a disclosure of "(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation[;] or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Johnson's grievance was about how Ms. Freeman's allegedly threatening behavior was a "perceived...abuse of authority." Her grievance did not seek to remedy a situation where an agency took or failed to take a personnel action against an individual for disclosure of "(i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation[;] or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Here, Ms. Johnson filed a grievance "other than with regard to remedying a violation of" &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Prior to the enactment of the WPEA, the Board lacked jurisdiction over an allegation, such as the one in the instant case, of retaliation for representing a coworker in a grievance proceeding. <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1992);<span class="Italic"> see also Rubendall v.

However, the WPEA expanded the Board's jurisdiction in IRA appeals to include claims that a personnel action was proposed or taken as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). Specifically, section 101(b)(1)(A) of the WPEA amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) to provide that an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) or 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), or (D). <span class="Italic">See Hooker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9 (2014) (discussing the scope of the WPEA amendments to Title 5). The amended section 2302(b)(9)(B), referenced in the amendments to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) discussed above, provides that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]ny employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action shall not, with respect to such authority, take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any right referred to in subparagraph (A)(i) or (ii).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9. Subparagraph (A) of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), in turn, prohibits the taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, "any personnel action against any employee or applicant for employment because of--(A) the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--(i) with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph [(b)] (8); or (ii) other than with regard to remedying a violation of paragraph [(b)] (8)." <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, as correctly found by the administrative judge, under the WPEA the Board now has jurisdiction over claims of retaliation for lawfully assisting a coworker in a grievance proceeding.[3] The holding that the Board lacks jurisdiction over such claims in cases such as <span class="Italic">Rubendall</span>, 101 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 9, and <span class="Italic">Wooten</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. at 146, is superseded by the statutory change. In this appeal, the appellant alleged that he represented an agency employee during an informal grievance meeting on March 6, 2013. Such an activity clearly falls within the protective umbrella of the WPEA. Thus, the appellant has nonfrivolously alleged that he engaged in a protected activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Although 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a) limits Board appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A) to individuals who exercised appeal, complaint, or grievance rights under (i), with regard to remedying a violation of section 2302(b)(8), there is no such jurisdictional restriction for individuals filing a Board appeal pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), such as the appellant in this matter.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the administrative judge did not identify which subsection of section 2302(b)(9) she applied in analyzing the appellant's claim that agency officials retaliated against her due to her submission of a witness affidavit in connection with a colleague's EEO complaint. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B), protected activity includes "testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise" of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)-(B); <span class="Italic">Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 10 (2015).

Unlike section 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), the Board's IRA jurisdiction over protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(B) need not concern remedying a violation of whistleblower reprisal under section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">Alarid</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 12 n.5. The Board also has held that an appellant's act of assisting another employee in the EEO process constitutes protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">Marable v. Department of the Army</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. 622, 629-30 (1992) (finding that the appellant's actions "supporting an EEO complaint filed by an applicant for a position with the agency" constituted protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(B)), <span class="Italic">superseded on other grounds by Carney v.

Consequently, we conclude that the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that her act of submitting an affidavit in support of his coworker's EEO complaint constituted protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A grievance asserting that discriminatory practices affected another is not lawful assistance of another under 5 USC 2302(b)(9)(B), <span class="Italic">McCray v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2023 MSPB 10, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 24-25 (2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 2, the appellant alleged the agency retaliated against him for making disclosures and filing EEO complaints in which he raised allegations that the agency discriminated against employees generally, and one of his subordinates in particular, because of their race. We found no basis to conclude that the appellant's disclosures or complaints were protected activities under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) because there was no indication in the record that the appellant's subordinate, who purportedly was denied a promotion based on his race, or any of the other employees allegedly discriminated against based on race, filed any appeal, complaint, or grievance. <span class="Italic">Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant did not allege that he was lawfully assisting his coworker in the exercise of the coworker's grievance right; rather the appellant alleged that <span class="Italic">he</span> had exercised the grievance right in May 2018, in which he raised concerns about disability discrimination against his coworker. Because the appellant has not alleged that his coworker filed an appeal, complaint, or grievance in which the appellant assisted, he has not alleged that he engaged in a protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">See Edwards</span>, 2022 MSPB 9, &#x00B6; 28; <span class="Italic">Alarid</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6; 12 n.5 (explaining that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i) differs from section 2302(b)(9)(B) in part because the former bars reprisal for an appellant's personal exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right). Similarly, the appellant's July 26, 2018 grievance, in which he challenged his supervisor's alleged initial denial of the appellant's request to provide input regarding his accomplishments into the agency's automated <span id="Page_3745"></span>performance system and a TOA for his 2018 performance, is not protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). The appellant has not alleged that he was testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual other than himself in connection with that grievance. We therefore find that the appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation regarding this statutory provision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the WPEA is not retroactive, coverage depends on the date of the resultant reprisal, <span class="Italic">Musselman v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-1221-14-0499-W-3 (NP 6/17/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial appeal, the appellant alleged that he reported an employee's sexual harassment complaint to his Program Manager on April 5, 2011, and he prepared a memo in relation to an EEO complaint filed by another individual on October 24, 2011. The administrative judge found that those activities, (c) and (e), were not protected because they occurred prior to the enactment of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 (WPEA), Pub. L. No. 112-19, 126 Stat. 1465. On review, the appellant seems to argue otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to the WPEA, which became effective on December 27, 2012, Congress expanded the grounds on which an appellant may file an IRA appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See Hooker v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9 (2014); WPEA &#x00A7; 101(b)(1)(A). Prior to the enactment of the WPEA, an appellant only could file an IRA appeal with the Board based on allegations of whistleblower reprisal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See Wooten v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 143, 146 (1992), <span class="Italic">superseded by statute as stated in Carney v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 446, &#x00B6; 5 (2014). Following the WPEA's enactment, an appellant also may file an IRA appeal with the Board concerning alleged reprisal based on certain other classes of protected activity as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A)(i), (B), (C), and (D). 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(a); <span class="Italic">Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 9. However, the Board has declined to give retroactive effect to the new IRA appeal rights provided under the WPEA for alleged violations of section 2302(b)(9)(A), (B), or (C). <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge determined that (c) and (e) were not protected because both occurred prior to the enactment of the WPEA. In doing so, the administrative judge erred. The date of the purported retaliation is dispositive, not the date of the protected activity. <span class="Italic">See Hooker</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 629, &#x00B6; 15 (explaining that the Board would not apply the WPEA retroactively for violations of section 2302(b)(9)(B) because doing so would increase a party's liability for past conduct). Because the purported retaliation, the removal of "acting" duties and the denial of a temporary promotion, occurred in 2013, after the enactment of the WPEA, both are covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1221(a), 2302(b)(9)(B). We, therefore, vacate the administrative judge's findings to the contrary. Nevertheless, based on our analysis below, we find that the appellant's claim still fails.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The protection of &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) extends to reprisal for "any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Musselman v.

Instead, he argued that he was facilitating the term employees' request to discuss the end of their terms under the agency's Open Door policy statement. That policy statement indicates that the doors to the Command Sergeant Major's and Brigadier General's offices are open "to air any issues, grievances, or to offer suggestions that have not been adequately addressed through the Chain of Command." The administrative judge found that the Open Door policy was not a "law, rule, or regulation" granting employees any "appeal, complaint, or grievance right" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Testimony to a VA administrative investigation board ("AIB") did not qualify for protected status under &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), <span class="Italic">Graves v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge correctly found that the investigation at issue in this case did not constitute the exercise by C.K. of an "appeal, complaint, or grievance right." Instead, C.K. was the subject of an agency-initiated investigation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 2302(b)(9)(B) clearly applies to testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting any individual in the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation, and the specific mention of these types of activities implies the exclusion of others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of the administrative judge's finding, we note that, even before the enactment of the WPEA, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9) made it a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant for employment "because of the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">Linder</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7. Reprisal in violation of section 2302(b)(9) was viewed as "'reprisal based on exercising a right to complain.'" <span class="Italic">Serrao</span>, 95 F.3d at 1575 (quoting <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 690 (Fed. Cir. 1992)). The Board had held that claims of a prohibited personnel practice, such as reprisal under section 2302(b)(9), did not serve as an independent basis for a finding of Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Linder</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7. In interpreting the pre-WPEA version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), the Board held that a claim of reprisal for exercising a right to complain in certain administrative proceedings, such as Board appellate proceedings, the equal employment opportunity complaint process, grievance proceedings, and unfair labor practice proceedings, was not a basis for a finding of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the appellant does not contend that the content of his testimony during the AIB investigation qualifies as a disclosure of either "a violation of any law, rule, or regulation," "gross mismanagement," or an abuse of authority under section 2303(b)(8). Thus, we have no occasion to consider whether the Board has jurisdiction when disclosures allegedly protected under section 2303(b)(8) are made solely in the course of an agency-initiated investigation and never presented outside that context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch v.

Department of the Treasury</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32 (2000), the appellant alleged that the agency retaliated against her for submitting a CA-1 Notice of Traumatic Injury. The Board found that an employee who files a CA-1 is exercising his or her right to file a "claim" for "payment of compensation" under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 508. The Board determined that, in adjudicating a FECA claim, the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) decides whether the claimant has provided sufficient evidence of a nexus between the injury and her course of employment and, if so, the amount and kind of compensation to be awarded. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that the OWCP is not empowered to grant relief for any underlying personnel practices that may have led to the injury. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Comparing the nature and scope of a FECA claim with, for example, an appeal to the Board, a complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a grievance, or an unfair labor practice complaint, the Board concluded in <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span> that the submission of a FECA claim for compensation for a work-related injury did not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against an employer for the perceived violation of an employee's rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, the Board found that the filing of a CA-1 is not the "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right" within the terms of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. at 508-09.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPEA amended various provisions of the WPA, including 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9). Pub. L. No. 112-199, &#x00A7; 101(b)(2)(B), 126 Stat. 1465, 1465-66. As set forth above, the new statutory language provides that it is a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee or applicant because of "the exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by any law, rule, or regulation--(i) with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]; or (ii) other than with regard to remedying a violation of [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(A). Nothing in the WPEA, however, altered the Board's previous analysis in <span class="Italic">Von Kelsch</span> concerning the meaning of the terms "appeal, complaint, or grievance" in the statutory language. <span class="Italic">Linder</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 10. Thus, we agree with the administrative judge that the investigation by the AIB did not constitute the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right by C.K. because it did not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against the agency for a perceived violation of employment rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11 (filing a motion to dismiss an indictment does not constitute an initial step toward taking legal action against an employer for a perceived violation of employment rights); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, the term "administrative investigation" means "a systematic process for determining facts and documenting evidence about matters of significant interest to the VA." VA Directive 0700, &#x00A7; 1.a (Mar. 25, 2002). Such investigations "are conducted to collect and analyze evidence to determine what actually happened and why it happened, so that individual and systemic deficiencies can be identified and effectively corrected." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The VA's policy provides that "significant incidents occurring and issues arising within VA facilities or staff offices, or as a result of VA activities, shall be reported and investigated as necessary to meet the informational and decision-making needs of the VA." VA Directive 0700, &#x00A7; 2.a(1). "VA employees are required to cooperate with administrative investigations in accordance with 38 [C.F.R.] &#x00A7; 0.735-12(b) and other applicable authorities." VA Directive 0700, &#x00A7; 2.b(4). Under 38 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 0.735-12(b), titled "Furnishing testimony," employees "will furnish information and testify freely and honestly in cases respecting employment and disciplinary matters." There is no indication in the record or in VA Directive 0700 suggesting that an administrative investigation constitutes an initial step by an employee toward taking legal action against the agency for a perceived violation of employment rights or that the AIB is empowered to grant relief for any personnel action related to the investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3746"></span>Despite the appellant's contentions that the purpose of the WPA is to strengthen, improve, and protect the rights of Federal employees, prevent reprisal, and help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government, and that remedial statutes should be interpreted broadly, the statutory language at issue in this case is clear as to the types of protected activities that fall under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). The appellant has not identified any clearly expressed legislative intent indicating that testifying for or otherwise lawfully assisting an individual during an agency investigation constitutes protected activity under section 2302(b)(9)(B). The Board "does not have the authority to determine the most efficient and effective means to prevent agency retaliation"; rather, "it has only as much authority as Congress chooses to give it." <span class="Italic">King v.

By contrast, in adverse action appeals or constructive adverse action appeals, unlike IRA appeals, an appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing if he makes nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Downs v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 139, &#x00B6; 18 n.5 (2008); <span class="Italic">see Garcia</span>, 437 F.3d at 1324-25, 1344. As set forth above, the administrative judge correctly found in this appeal that the appellant did not make nonfrivolous allegations that he made protected disclosures or otherwise engaged in protected activity. Thus, the administrative judge correctly held that the appellant was not entitled to a hearing in this IRA appeal and dismissed this case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Similarly, under <span class="Italic">Soto v. VA</span>, 2022 MSPB 6, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regarding the April 16, 2014 reply to the proposed admonishment of another bargaining-unit member, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant's activity was not protected, because there is no law, rule, or regulation granting a right to reply to a proposed admonishment. Thus, in making that reply, the appellant did not assist another employee in an appeal, complaint, or grievance right granted by law, rule, or regulation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B); <span class="Italic">see Graves</span>, 123 M.S.P.R. 434, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 14 (finding that the appellant's testimony before an agency investigative board in support of a coworker was not protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B) because the investigation did not constitute the exercise of an appeal, complaint, or grievance right). On review, the appellant argues that the administrative judge should have considered that a proposed admonishment may be grieved under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. However, assuming the appellant is correct that there was a law, rule, or regulation granting the employee the right to grieve her proposed admonishment under the collective bargaining agreement, the record does not show that the appellant in fact assisted her in exercising that right.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Not every objection, gripe, or protest about a workplace matter constitutes the sort of complaint lodged in a formal adjudicatory process that is protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B). <span class="Italic">See Owen v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 621, 624, 627-28 (1994) (finding that, although the appellant referred to his report to the Occupational Safety &#x0026; Health Administration about his exposure to fumes as a "complaint," it was merely an informal "complaint" as the term is used to denote gripes or objections, rather than a complaint lodged in a formal adjudicative process, and thus it was not covered by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B)); <span class="Italic">see also Von Kelsch v. Department of Labor</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 503, 505-06, 508 (1993) (concluding that filing a claim for compensation under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act was not the "exercise of any appeal, complaint, or grievance right" within the meaning of section 2302(b)(9)(B)), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Thomas v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 224, 236 n.9 (1998), <span class="Italic">overruled by Ganski v. Department of the Interior</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 32 (2000). The appellant's objection to HRM's RFI response was part of the union's effort to obtain information regarding the PIPs of two bargaining-unit members, not a complaint lodged in a formal adjudicatory process. Conversely, the administrative judge correctly found protected the appellant's grievance, which he filed on the same date as the memorandum and which concerned the same subject matter. Thus, the administrative judge properly determined that the appellant failed to establish that his May 23, 2014 memorandum separately constituted protected activity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The significance of the statutory changes through the WPEA was noted in <span class="Italic">Agnew v. USPS</span>, NY-0353-14-0337-I-1 (NP 12/22/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To prove his affirmative defense of retaliation for engaging in union activity, the appellant was required to show that: (1) he engaged in protected activity; (2) the accused official knew of the activity; (3) the adverse action under review could have been retaliation under the circumstances; and (4) there was a genuine nexus between the alleged retaliation and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Warren v. Department of the Army</span>, 804 F.2d 654, 656-58 (Fed. Cir. 1986).[8] ...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The statutory changes of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012 significantly narrowed the scope of cases to which the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard applies. <span class="Italic">See Alarid v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 600, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 &#x0026; n.7 (2015). However, because the appellant's employer was the U.S. Postal Service, the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard still applies in this case for purposes of the appellant's allegation of retaliation for engaging in union activity. <span class="Italic">See Mack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 48 M.S.P.R. 617, 621-22 (1991) (finding that U.S. Postal Service employees are subject to the <span class="Italic">Warren</span> standard for retaliation affirmative defenses, rather than the contributing factor standard, because the U.S. Postal Service is not an "agency" as defined under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(C), and its employees may not seek corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">While assistance under the statute is protected, "Attempting to intimidate a witness into providing a false statement is not protected conduct under the WPA.
