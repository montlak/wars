<h5 class="h5" id="sec1-71"><span class="space">b.</span> In an Executive Agency</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">5 USC 7511 provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;For the purpose of this subchapter--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(ii)&#x2003;who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less;...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For the excepted service, the concept of service within an "executive agency" for at least one year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions includes the current agency as well as predecessor agencies, <span class="Italic">Greene v. DIA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/GREENE_JOSEPH_F_DC_315H_03_0578_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_249417.pdf">100 MSPR 447</a>, 449-51 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-12 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who meets the definition of an "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) generally has standing to challenge his removal from the federal service by filing an appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d). The definition of "employee" includes "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...in an Executive agency...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(i).[2] It is undisputed that the appellant did not complete a full year of continuous service with the DIA following his transfer from ONI. Moreover, as the administrative judge correctly found, the ONI, which is part of the Department of the Navy, is not the same agency as the DIA. <span class="Italic">See Pervez v. Department of the Navy</span>, 193 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding that the Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy are not the same agency). Thus, Board has jurisdiction over this appeal only if "an Executive agency" may refer to more than one agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Ordinarily, the definition of "employee" excludes individuals occupying positions within an intelligence component of an agency. However, this exclusion does not apply to individuals meeting the definition of "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the plain language of the statute, "an Executive agency," clearly indicates a single agency. However, it is well established that legislative terms that are singular in form may apply to multiple subjects or objects. <span class="Italic">See</span> 2A Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47:34 (6th ed. 2000) ("It is most often ruled that a term introduced by 'a' or 'an' applies to multiple subjects or objects unless there is reason to find that singular application was intended or is reasonably understood."). Because the language of the statute is ambiguous, it will be necessary to consider legislative history and other extrinsic evidence of congressional intent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that legislative history strongly supports the view that service in multiple agencies may be combined to satisfy the definition of "employee" set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). In its original form, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided that an individual was entitled to appeal his separation if he was "a preference eligible in an Executive agency in the excepted service, [or] a preference eligible in the United States Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission, who ha[d] completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) (1978). In this context, it is clear that the term "an Executive agency" refers only to the type of position occupied by the preference-eligible individual at the time of his separation. Nothing in the language of the original statute requires that the year of current continuous service be performed in a single agency. Thus, in <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 466 (1981), we held that the appellant's previous service with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) should count towards completion of the year of current continuous service required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), provided that his service in HUD was in a position the same as, or similar to, the Postal Service position from which he was separated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 470-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) was changed to its current form as a result of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, &#x00A7; 2, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. (104 Stat.) 461. The stated purpose of this legislation was "to extend to certain employees in the excepted service who are not preference eligibles the same administrative notice and appeal procedures currently provided employees in the competitive service and preference eligible employees in the excepted service." H.R. Rep. 101-328, at 1 (1990), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 695. Thus, the intent of Congress was solely to broaden the appeal rights of non-preference eligibles in the excepted service, not to eliminate appeal rights for any other class of employee. To enact legislation excluding employees such as the appellant would have put an end to appeal rights that for decades had been recognized without any limitation regarding the number of agencies in which the required year of service was performed. <span id="Page_95"></span><span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.201(a)(3) (1971) (providing adverse action appeal rights to "[a]ny preference eligible employee who has completed 1 year of current continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service"); Federal Personnel Manual Supplement 752-1, S2-3a(3) (1972) (providing that "[c]urrent continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service" could consist of "employment in more than one position <span class="Italic">in the same line of work</span> without a break of a workday" (emphasis in the original)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations providing further support for the proposition that service in multiple agencies may be combined to meet the required 1 year of current continuous service. In particular, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(3) provides that adverse action appeal rights apply to "[a]n employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible in an executive agency..., the U.S. Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission and who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." This regulation in no way suggests that the employee's 1 year of current continuous service must be performed entirely in the agency from which the employee is separated. We further note that Congress has expressly delegated to the OPM the authority to promulgate regulations on this subject. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514. Consequently, such regulations "are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">See Stearn v. Department of the Navy</span>, 280 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984)). Far from being "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute," the regulations prescribed by OPM on this subject are consistent with the absence of any congressional intent to eliminate appeal rights that had previously been granted to preference eligible employees in the excepted service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we reject the argument that granting appeal rights to an employee who had not worked a full year with his current agency would be "an absurd result." In <span class="Italic">McCormick v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 307 F.3d 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2002), our reviewing court considered the case of an individual who served 8 years in the Department of Health and Human Services, transferred to a competitive service position in the Department of the Air Force, and was terminated 6 months later. Although the appellant was serving a probationary period at the time of her separation, the court found that she qualified as an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), because she had completed 1 year of current continuous service under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less. <span class="Italic">McCormick</span>, 307 F.3d at 1342-43. As the appellant had served only 6 months with the Air Force, it follows that her full year of current continuous service included service in multiple agencies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons stated above, we find that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) provides appeal rights to a preference-eligible employee in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions, regardless of whether the entire year of service was performed in the same agency from which the employee was separated. Accordingly, the appellant in the instant case is entitled to appeal his separation if the position he held in ONI prior to his transfer to DIA was the same as, or similar to, the position from which he was separated. The appellant has made a non-frivolous allegation that these positions were similar. While the agency has submitted documentary evidence to the contrary, this issue must be resolved at a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Greene,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Carrow v. MSPB</span>, 564 F.3d 1359, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (following remand to the Board, <span class="Italic">Carrow v. MSPB</span>, 626 F.3d 1348 (Fed. Cir. 2010), affirming the Board's conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction over the appeal):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the administrative judge's alternative holding that the Board would lack jurisdiction even if Mr. Carrow's appointment were analyzed under Title 5. Mr. Carrow concedes that if we were to uphold the administrative judge's determination that he was temporarily employed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7405(a)(1), he could qualify as a Title 5 "employee" only under section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). That provision requires Mr. Carrow to establish that he had completed at least two years of "current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." The administrative judge interpreted the term "an Executive agency" to require that the two years of continuous service be within the same agency. Mr. Carrow did not qualify for the right to challenge his dismissal under the administrative judge's interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) because his prior service with the Army could not be tacked on to his four months of current service with the DVA. Thus, the alternative ground for dismissing Mr. Carrow's appeal turns on whether the administrative judge properly construed the term "an Executive agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") is entrusted with administering the statutory provisions governing the rights of federal employees to appeal adverse agency actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514 (granting OPM the authority to "prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of" subchapter II of chapter 75 of title 5); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(c), 7513(a). Accordingly, we are obligated to give controlling effect to OPM's interpretation of the term "an Executive agency" if that interpretation is reasonable and not contrary to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress. <span class="Italic">See Entergy Corp. v. Riverkeeper, Inc.,</span> No. 07-588, slip op. 7 (U.S. Apr. 1, 2009) (agency's interpretation of statutory term "governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute--not necessarily the only possible interpretation nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the courts"); <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</span> 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Acting pursuant to its delegated authority under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514, OPM has promulgated implementing regulations that provide Board appeal rights to any individual "in the excepted service who is a nonpreference eligible in an Executive agency as defined at Section 105 of title, 5, United States Code, and who has completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(5) (2007). In the notice of proposed rulemaking for those regulations, OPM stated that "the statute allows employees credit for service from more than one agency...." 58 Fed. Reg. 13,191, 13,193 (Mar. 10, 1993). That understanding of the two-year service requirement is consistent with the text of the regulation, which requires the "current continuous service" to be performed "in the same or similar positions," but does not require that the positions be within the same agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) governs because it constitutes a reasonable resolution of an issue on which Congress has not clearly spoken. The context of the statutory term "an Executive agency" does not suggest any reason to depart from the default rule of statutory construction that words importing the singular include the plural meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> 1 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 2A Singer, <span class="Italic">Statutes and Statutory Construction</span> &#x00A7; 47:34 (6th ed. 2000) ("It is most often ruled that a term introduced by 'a' or 'an' applies to multiple subjects or objects unless there is reason to find that singular application was intended or is reasonably understood."). The legislative history of section 7511 likewise suggests that the right to challenge employment actions was not intended to turn on the employee's tenure within a particular agency. Nonpreference eligible employees were extended civil service protections in 1990, following the enactment of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, &#x00A7; 2, 104 Stat. 461. The stated purpose of that legislation was to provide "certain employees in the excepted service who are not preference eligibles the same administrative notice and appeal procedures currently provided employees in the competitive service and preference eligible employees in the excepted service." H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, at 1 (1990), as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 695. Under the pre-existing civil service framework, a preference eligible employee was entitled to appeal his separation if he was employed "in an Executive agency in the excepted service, and...[had] completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) (1990). The language of the original statute, which parallels that of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(5), did not require a preference eligible employee to perform the entirety of his most recent year of service in a single agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 468 (1981); <span class="Italic">see also Lamb v. United States,</span> 90 F. Supp. 369, 373 (Ct. Cl. 1950). Thus, neither the text nor the legislative history of section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) evinces any congressional intention to preclude an employee from satisfying the continuity-of-service requirement by tacking on prior service in a different agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other cases, the Board has agreed with the position taken by Mr. Carrow that a nonpreference eligible in the excepted service may satisfy the two-year service requirement of section 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii) by combining periods of service with different agencies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dade v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 101 M.S.P.R. 43, 47-48 (2005); <span class="Italic">Greene v. Def. Intelligence Agency,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 447, 450-51 (2005). In its brief in this case, the Board adheres to that position and does not defend the contrary position taken by the administrative judge. Based on OPM's regulations, we adopt that position and hold that Mr. Carrow was entitled to compute his two-year service period by adding periods of service in different Executive Branch agencies.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carrow</span> did not overrule, distinguish, or mention the nonprecedential <span class="Italic">Illich</span> decision from the Federal Circuit, <span class="Italic">post.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Amend v. MSPB</span>, 221 Fed. Appx. 983, 983-85 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP), a nonprecedential decision issued before the precedential decision of the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Carrow,</span> noted some divergence from <span class="Italic">Greene v. DIA,</span> 100 MSPR 447 (2005), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and <span class="Italic">Illich</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">From 1996 until March 1, 2003, Amend was employed as an Immigration Inspector with the Immigration and Naturalization Service ("INS"), which was part of the Department of Justice ("DOJ"). Pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, the INS was abolished effective March 1, 2003, and its functions transferred to the Department of <span id="Page_96"></span>Homeland Security ("DHS"). Amend continued his employment as an Immigration Inspector with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a subdivision of DHS. On August 22, 2004, Amend was appointed to the excepted service as an Inspector for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF"), a subdivision of DOJ. On July 15, 2005, Amend was terminated from federal service. He appealed his termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jurisdiction of the Board is granted under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a) (2006), which provides that "[a]n employee...may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." Removal from employment is an appealable action where the individual is as an "employee" at the time of removal by the agency. <span class="Italic">Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 197 F.3d 1144, 1147 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The term "employee" is defined by statute under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) to include "a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...in an Executive agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without ruling on the merits of Amend's petition, an Administrative Judge ("AJ") ordered the parties to submit arguments and evidence on whether the Board had jurisdiction over the appeal. Although the AJ found that Amend was "preference eligible," the AJ held that Amend was not an "employee" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) because he had not been employed by "an Executive agency" for "1 year of current continuous service" before he was terminated. The AJ interpreted &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) to require the "1 year of current continuous service" to "take place in a single agency." Because Amend had only worked for DOJ as an ATF Inspector for eleven months before he was terminated, the AJ concluded that "the appellant did not have 1 year of current continuous service in the Department of Justice when he was terminated." Therefore, the AJ dismissed Amend's petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Amend appealed the AJ's dismissal to the full Board. The Board affirmed the AJ's decision on different grounds. The Board noted that the AJ's decision was issued before the Board decided <span class="Italic">Greene v. Defense Intelligence Agency,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 12 (2005), which held that &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) does not require that the continuous year of service be completed within a single agency. Thus, the Board held that to satisfy the 1 year requirement Amend's prior service at DHS may be "tacked" onto his service at DOJ. Nonetheless, the Board held that the Immigration Inspector and the ATF Inspector (officially titled "Industry Operations Investigator") positions are not "the same or similar" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). The Board reasoned that the two positions held different grades and classification series, the ATF position required top secret clearance, the ATF position required substantial additional training, and the positions required different knowledge and skills. Accordingly, the Board affirmed the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although on appeal the Board does not address whether service in more than one agency satisfies the one year requirement, DOJ as Intervenor does dispute the Board's interpretation. We recognize that the Board's interpretation that a petitioner need not complete the "1 year of current continuous service" within a single agency is an open question. <span class="Italic">Compare Illich v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 104 Fed. Appx. 171, 173 (Fed. Cir. 2004), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Greene,</span> 100 M.S.P.R. at 451. However, we decline to reach that issue because we agree with the Board that Immigration Inspector and ATF Inspector are not "similar positions" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Greene,</span> <span class="Italic">Illich v. MSPB</span>, 104 Fed. Appx. 171, 172-74 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP), in analysis seemingly overruled by the precedential decision in <span class="Italic">Carrow,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> determined to be distinct, for purposes of calculating the year-long trial period of an excepted service preference eligible employee, employment in two military branches:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual who meets the statutory definition of "employee" is entitled to appeal his or her removal to the Board. The relevant provision states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For the purposes of this subchapter-</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;"employee" means--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;in an Executive agency; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;in the United States Postal Service or Postal Rate Commission[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511 (2000) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal hinges on the proper interpretation of "an Executive agency." The Board has jurisdiction only if "an Executive agency" may refer to more than one agency, because Mr. Illich did not complete a year of service in the Air Force and because the DLA and Air Force are not the same Executive agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pervez v. Dep't of Navy,</span> 193 F.3d 1371, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (holding that the Department of the Army and the Department of the Navy are not the same agency). Statutory construction begins and ends with the language of the statute itself, which governs unless there is clearly expressed legislative intent to the contrary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Consumer Prod. Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc.,</span> 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S. Ct. 2051, 64 L. Ed.2d 766 (1980).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory provision uses the indefinite article "an," the form of "a" when used preceding a word with an initial vowel sound. When used as the indefinite article, "a" is "used as a function word before singular nouns when the referent is unspecified &#x003C;a man overboard&#x003E; and before number collectives and some numbers &#x003C;a dozen&#x003E;." <span class="Italic">Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary</span> 1 (1990). Accordingly, the statutory language clearly refers to a singular Executive agency, even though that Executive agency is unspecified. <span class="Italic">See Transamerica Ins. Co. v. South,</span> 125 F.3d 392, 399 (7th Cir. 1997) (construing the phrase "an insured" in an insurance policy exclusion to apply to "one insured"). Indeed, section 7511(a)(1)(B) recites "positions" to refer to multiple positions, which further supports that the recitation of "an Executive agency" means only one Executive agency. Because the words of the statute are clear, this court need not refer to the legislative history.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Illich counters this statutory construction with an analogy. He argues that one would expect that a convict sentenced to serve one year in <span class="Italic">a</span> prison would have to serve all of the single year in a single prison. That is, if the convict were transferred from one prison to another, the time that the convict would have served in all prisons combined would only sum to one year. Mr. Illich's hypothetical, however, has no bearing on the specific statutory construction that this court faces. The statutory language only has meaning with reference to the statute, and Mr. Illich does not point to anything in the statute that would support a reading of "an Executive agency" to mean "at least one Executive agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Illich also directs this court's attention to Acting Board Chairman McPhie's separate opinion. That separate opinion relies heavily on <span class="Italic">Shobe,</span> which remanded the case for further determination whether the positions held in the two agencies were the same or similar. <span class="Italic">Shobe v. United States Postal Serv.,</span> 5 MSPB 468, 5 M.S.P.R. 466, 471-72 (1981) (remanding the case because "the record is insufficient to establish whether the HUD position was the same as or similar to the position from which the appellant was removed by the Postal Service"). To begin with, <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> did not explicitly construe "an Executive agency" as set forth in section 7511(a)(1)(B). Without discussing the issue, <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> merely assumed that two agencies would satisfy the requirement that the service be "in an Executive agency." Because <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> did not squarely address the operative language in this case, that case did not bind the Board. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Brecht v. Abrahamson,</span> 507 U.S. 619, 631, 113 S. Ct. 1710, 123 L. Ed.2d 353 (1993) (reaffirming the longstanding rule that if a prior decision does not "squarely address [an] issue," a court remains "free to address the issue on the merits" in a subsequent case).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Bander v. United States,</span> 141 Ct. Cl. 373, 158 F. Supp. 564 (1958), undercuts whatever persuasive value that the silence in <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> may have. Although not addressing the statute in its current form, this court's predecessor in <span class="Italic">Bander</span> explained that the service must have been both in the same agency and without any intervening interval to count towards the minimum time requirements. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 567. Indeed, the court determined that "[t]here is certainly no indication that Congress intended to give the procedural rights of section 14 to veterans who had not proved their abilities to the employing agency either in the job for which they were hired or in the same type of work <span class="Italic">in the same agency."</span> <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). When Congress enacted the statute in its current form, it intended the language of section 7511(a)(1)(B) to have the same meaning as the statute that the court construed in <span class="Italic">Bander.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 48, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2770.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, subchapter II, an individual who meets the definition of "employee" at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1) generally has the right to challenge his removal from the federal service by filing an appeal with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(1), 7513(d).

<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B). Notably, for a preference eligible in the excepted service, the absence or completion of a probationary or trial period is not determinative of "employee" status. Rather, the dispositive issue is whether the appellant satisfied the 1-year current continuous service requirement at the time of his separation. <span class="Italic">See Zambito v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 550, &#x00B6; 9 (2005). We must therefore determine whether the appellant's prior employment as a Postal Service Clerk may be tacked on to his service with the agency to meet that requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_97"></span>We find our decision in <span class="Italic">Greene v. Defense Intelligence Agency</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 447 (2005), to be instructive in this matter. In <span class="Italic">Greene</span>, we held that the term "an Executive agency," as used in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), may refer to more than one agency, and that service in multiple agencies may be combined in order to satisfy the 1-year current continuous service requirement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-12.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The language of the statute itself is ambiguous, since the word "or" has both an inclusive sense ("A or B [or both] ") and an exclusive sense ("A or B [but not both] "). <span class="Italic">See Shaw v.

Kirk, <span class="Italic">Legal Drafting: The Ambiguity of "And" and "Or,"</span> 2 Tex. Tech L.Rev. 235, 237-38 (1971)). Thus, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) could be read either to permit or to disallow a combination of service in both the Postal Service and an Executive agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its original form, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided that an individual was entitled to appeal his separation if he was "a preference eligible in an Executive agency in the excepted service, [or] a preference eligible in the United States Postal Service or the Postal Rate Commission, who ha[d] completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) (1978); <span class="Italic">see Greene</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 8. In this context, the references to "an Executive agency" and to the Postal Service pertain only to the type of position occupied by the preference eligible individual at the time of his separation. <span class="Italic">Greene</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 8. Nothing in the language of the original statute requires that the 1 year of current continuous service be performed entirely in an Executive agency or entirely in the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Thus, in <span class="Italic">Shobe v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 466 (1981), the Board held that the appellant's previous service with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) should count toward completion of the year of current continuous service required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), provided that his service in HUD was in a position the same as, or similar to, the Postal Service position from which he was separated. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 470-71.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 1990, the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B) was changed to its current form as a result of the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. No. 101-376, &#x00A7; 2, 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. (104 Stat.) 461. The stated purpose of this legislation was "to extend to certain employees in the excepted service who are not preference eligibles the same administrative notice and appeal procedures currently provided employees in the competitive service and preference eligible employees in the excepted service." H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, at 1 (1990), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 695. The bill that became the Civil Service Due Process Amendments excluded Postal Service employees who are not preference eligible; however, that exclusion was designed to "preserve[ ] the <span class="Italic">status quo</span>," not to limit existing appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1, 5. Thus, the intent of Congress was solely to broaden the appeal rights for certain non-preference eligibles in the excepted service, not to eliminate appeal rights for any other class of employee. <span class="Italic">See Greene</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further note that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has promulgated regulations that allow for service in an Executive agency or agencies and the U.S. Postal Service to be combined to meet the required 1 year of current continuous service. In particular, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(c)(3) provides that adverse action appeal rights apply to "[a]n employee in the excepted service who is a preference eligible in an executive agency...the U.S. Postal Service, or the Postal Rate Commission and who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions." Like the previous version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), this regulation does not preclude an individual from acquiring appeal rights through a combination of service in an Executive agency or agencies and the U.S. Postal Service. We further note that Congress has expressly delegated to OPM the authority to promulgate regulations on this subject. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514. Consequently, such regulations "are given controlling weight unless they are arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute." <span class="Italic">Stearn v. Department of the Navy</span>, 280 F.3d 1376, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837, 844 (1984)). Far from being "arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute," the regulations prescribed by OPM on this subject are consistent with the absence of any congressional intent to eliminate appeal rights that had previously been granted to preference eligible employees in the excepted service. <span class="Italic">See Greene</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 447, &#x00B6; 10. In sum, we conclude <span class="Italic">Shobe</span> remains good law, and that service in an Executive agency may be combined with service in the Postal Service for purposes of meeting the 1-year current continuous service criterion of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But Postal Service employment did not augment a nonpreference eligible's executive agency's appointment that was terminated short of a year, <span class="Italic">Banks v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[U]nder 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii), the appellant must have completed 2 years of current continuous service in the same or similar positions in an Executive agency under other than a temporary appointment limited to 2 years or less. Any service the appellant may have had with the U.S. Postal Service, even if it were current and continuous and even if it were in the same or similar position, cannot be considered toward the 2-year requirement because the U.S. Postal Service is neither an Executive department, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 101, nor a Government corporation, &#x00A7; 102, nor an independent establishment, &#x00A7; 104, and therefore it is not an Executive agency. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105; <span class="Italic">Nigg v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Banks v. MSPB</span>, 854 Fed. Appx. 1360, 1362-63 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), affirmed the Board's result--that Postal Service employment did not provide continuous service on later employment in an executive department:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's jurisdiction is limited and extends only to actions "appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). As relevant here, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d) permits an "employee" to appeal certain adverse actions to the Board, including involuntary resignations that are deemed constructive removals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cruz</span>, 934 F.2d at 1244. For the purpose of &#x00A7; 7513(d), however, the term "employee" is defined--in relevant part--as "an individual in the excepted service (other than a preference eligible)" who is either "not serving a probationary or trial period," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i), or "has completed 2 years of current continuous service...in an Executive agency," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). An individual may qualify as an "employee" under either &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(i) or (ii). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Van Wersch v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 197 F.3d 1144, 1151 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Banks was still serving her one-year probationary period with the VA when she resigned, her only claim to the status of an "employee" turns on whether her three years with the Postal Service qualify as "current continuous service...in an Executive agency" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). In this regard, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 105 provides that "[f]or the purpose of [Title 5], 'Executive agency' means an Executive department, a Government corporation, and an independent establishment." The Postal Service is not an "Executive department" or a "Government corporation" as defined in relevant part under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 101 and 103. Instead the Postal Service is an "independent establishment of the executive branch of the Government of the United States." 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201; <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Serv. v. Flamingo Indus. (USA) Ltd</span>., 540 U.S. 736, 746 (2004) ("Congress, however, declined to create the Postal Service as a Government corporation, opting instead for an independent establishment.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 201, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 104 provides that the Postal Service is not an "independent establishment"--and therefore not an "Executive agency"--for the purpose of Title 5. Section 104 states that "[f]or the purpose of this title, 'independent establishment' means...an establishment in the executive branch (<span class="Italic">other than the United States Postal Service</span>...)." (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the designation of the Postal Service as an "independent establishment" in &#x00A7; 201 and the parenthetical exclusion of the Postal Service as an "independent establishment" in &#x00A7; 104 were enacted by Congress in the Postal Reorganization Act ("PRA"). <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 91-375 &#x00A7; 2, 84 Stat. 719, 720 (1970); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 6(c)(2), 84 Stat. at 775. In the PRA, Congress sought to recast "the operation of the [P]ostal [S]ervice in 'a business-like way,'" i.e., "to make the delivery of the mail a self-supporting enterprise." <span class="Italic">Standard Oil Div., Am. Oil Co. v. Starks</span>, 528 F.2d 201, 202 (7th Cir. 1975). In addition to insulating the Postal Service "from the political arena," the PRA furthered this goal by broadly exempting the Postal Service from federal laws "dealing with the public or [f]ederal contracts, property, works, officers, employees, budgets or funds," subject to certain enumerated exceptions. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 410(a)); <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., Beneficial Fin. Co. of N.Y. v. Dallas</span>, 571 F.2d 125, 128 (2d Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history of the PRA makes clear that civil service provisions governing personnel at other federal agencies would not apply wholesale to employees of the reorganized Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 91-912, at 5-7 (1970) ("Senate Report") ("Employees who have competitive status under the Civil Service Act of 1883 shall automatically achieve career tenure under the postal career system, but thereafter the provisions of title 5...shall not apply to officers and employees of the Postal Service."). In keeping with this goal, the PRA as amended omits the provisions governing adverse-action appeals to the Board from the listing of Title 5 provisions that remain applicable to the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">See</span> 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 410(b)(1). This omission accords with, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, 39 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1005(a)(1)(A), which makes the adverse-action provisions applicable only to the extent that they are consistent with collective-bargaining agreements that the Postal Service may make with its employees. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (referring to "the provisions of chapter 75 of title 5"); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Senate Report at 5-7 (recommending the "enactment" of collective bargaining agreements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The exclusion of the Postal Service as an "independent establishment" in <span id="Page_98"></span>&#x00A7; 104 is consistent with the statutory framework of the PRA that makes Title 5 applicable to the Postal Service only in piecemeal fashion. Relying in part on &#x00A7; 104's exclusion, we have held that preference eligible Postal Service employees may not seek attorneys' fees under the fee-shifting provision of the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(ii). <span class="Italic">See Erickson v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 759 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, we held that the Back Pay Act does not apply to the Postal Service "by its own terms...because the Postal Service is not an 'executive agency,' the term...used to define the scope of the [Back Pay] Act's coverage." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We reasoned that although &#x00A7; 105 defines an "executive agency" as encompassing independent establishments, that term "is further defined to mean 'an establishment in the executive branch (other than the United States Postal Service...).'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1348 (quoting 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 104). We therefore concluded that "[t]he Postal Service is...not an 'executive agency' within the meaning of title 5 in general and the Back Pay Act in particular." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no reason to depart from our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Erickson</span>, which held that the provisions of &#x00A7; 104 displace, for the purpose of Title 5, the general characterization of the Postal Service as an "independent establishment" set forth in &#x00A7; 201. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also, e.g., RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank</span>, 132 S. Ct. 2065, 2070-71 (2012). Accordingly, the Postal Service does not fall into any of the categories that define an "Executive agency" under Title 5, which renders Banks's service as a Mail Handler not "service...in an Executive agency" under &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(C)(ii). As a consequence, Banks does not qualify as an "employee" with a right to appeal adverse actions to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Van Wersh</span>, 197 F.3d at 1151.</p>
