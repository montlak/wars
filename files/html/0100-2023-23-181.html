<p class="Body-Text">The settlement process was discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-002.html#sec16-3">Settlement Procedures; Elements of Settlements.</a>" The Board enforces settlements when they are accepted into the record by AJs in the course of appeals. Under 5 CFR 1201.41(c)(2) (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the parties agree to settle their dispute, the settlement agreement is the final and binding resolution of the appeal, and the judge will dismiss the appeal with prejudice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(i)&#x2003;If the parties offer the agreement for inclusion in the record, and if the judge approves the agreement, it will be made a part of the record, and the Board will retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(ii)&#x2003;If the agreement is not entered into the record, the Board will not retain jurisdiction to ensure compliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2012, the Board revised its regulations to make clear that its enforcement process under 5 CFR 1201.182-.183 (2022) applies to enforcement of both Board final decisions in adjudicated cases and to Board orders accepting settlements into the record for purposes of enforcement. The process for enforcing a Board-accepted settlement or a Board merits decision is now the same. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-130.html#sec16-128">Enforcement of MSPB Decision</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Richardson v. EPA</span>, 5 MSPR 248, 250-51, 5 MSPB 289 (1981), stated of the process used by the Board to enforce settlements:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case raises the threshold question of whether the Board has the authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement which has been entered into the record. Neither the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 nor the Board's regulations specifically address the issue of settlement agreements and the Board's authority to enforce them. The Reform Act, however, does provide the Board with the authority to enforce compliance with a final decision. 5 U.S.C. 1205(a)(2). In the Board's opinion, the resolution of an appeal on the basis of a settlement agreement constitutes a final decision issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction and, as a result, the Board has authority to enforce the settlement agreement. To interpret the Reform Act in another way would conflict with public policy favoring settlement agreements in civil actions which serve to avoid unnecessary litigation and to encourage fair and speedy resolution of issues<span class="Italic">. Miller v. Republic Nat's Life Ins. Co.,</span> 559 F.2d 426 (6th Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Nice v. Chesapeake and Ohio Ry. Co.,</span> 305 F. Supp. 1167 (W.D. Mich. 1969).[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Even though the Reform Act is silent as to the enforcement of settlement agreements, we note analogous situations to our own in case law and the Administrative Procedures Act. It is well established that courts retain the inherent authority to enforce settlement agreements entered into by parties to disputes pending before them<span class="Italic">. Lee v. Hunt</span>, 631 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1980); <span class="Italic">Sarabia v. Toledo Police Patrolman's Ass'n</span>, 601 F.2d 914 (6th Cir. 1979); <span class="Italic">Aro Corp. v. Allied Witan Co.,</span> 531 F.2d 1368, 1371 (6th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span> 429 U.S. 862 (1976). Under the Administrative Procedures Act, agencies are instructed to give all parties an opportunity for "offers of settlement." 5 U.S.C. 556(c)(1). Furthermore, employees presiding at hearings are authorized to "hold conferences for the settlement or simplification of the issues by consent of the parties." 5 U.S.C. 556(c)(6). While the Act is not directly applicable to this Board's procedures, this model procedural statute indicates a congressional policy favoring settlements before administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board will enforce a settlement agreement, however, the settlement itself must be made a part of the record. In admitting such an agreement into the record, the presiding official must be satisfied, as he was in this case, that the agreement is lawful on its face and that it was reached freely by the parties. The parties, of course, do not have to submit a settlement agreement to the presiding official for approval. But in those instances the agreement will not become part of the record and it will not be enforceable by the Board when the initial decision becomes final<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass'n v. County of Fairfax</span>, 571 F.2d 1299 (4th Cir. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the presiding official erred in holding that the Board lost jurisdiction of the matter while concurrently entering the settlement agreement into the record. If the settlement agreement had not been made a part of the record and the appellant had withdrawn his appeal, the Board would indeed have lost jurisdiction. But once the parties' agreement was accepted into the record, the Board retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement in the same way that the Board retains jurisdiction to enforce any final decision. Therefore, under the Board's regulations, appellant's petition for enforcement of the Board's final decision in this case should have been filed with the field office which rendered the initial decision. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.113; &#x00A7; 1201.181.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to prevail, the appellant bears the ultimate burden of showing material noncompliance by the agency with the terms of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Id.; Torres v. Department of Homeland Security,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). A party may establish a breach of an agreement "by proving that the other party failed to comply with a provision of the contract in a way that was material, regardless of the party's motive." <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Where, as here, the facts are undisputed, the determination of whether there has been material noncompliance with the terms of the agreement necessarily reduces to a question of law. <span class="Italic">Lutz,</span> 485 F.3d at 1381.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract, and, as such, it will be enforced in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 7 (2009); <span class="Italic">see Lutz,</span> 485 F.3d at 1381. In construing the terms of a settlement agreement, the words of the agreement are of paramount importance. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army,</span> 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Galatis v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10 (2008). The Board has no authority to unilaterally modify the terms of the parties' settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">Galatis,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10, or to read a nonexistent term into an agreement that is unambiguous, <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 467, &#x00B6; 6 (2002). The Board will consider parol evidence only if the agreement is ambiguous. <span class="Italic">Galatis,</span> 109 M.S.P.R. 651, &#x00B6; 10; <span class="Italic">Haefele v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 11 (2008). The terms of an agreement are ambiguous as a result of differing interpretations as to the meanings or intent given to those terms by the parties only when the respective interpretations are both reasonable. <span class="Italic">See Alexander v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 94 M.S.P.R. 237, &#x00B6; 7 (2003). When an agreement's words and meaning are unambiguous, its terms are not subject to variation. <span class="Italic">Slattery v. Department of Justice,</span> 590 F.3d 1345, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2010).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record in the same manner as any final Board decision or order. <span class="Italic">Lary v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 493 F.3d 1355, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2007); <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 7. If an appellant alleges noncompliance with a settlement agreement, the agency must produce relevant material evidence of its compliance with the agreement, or show that there was good cause for noncompliance. <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 659, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">see Haefele,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 630, &#x00B6; 7.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The long and short of it is that a settlement agreement is enforceable once the parties submit the settlement agreement to the AJ, who enters it into the record. The Board retains jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement accepted into the record in the same way that it retains jurisdiction to enforce any final decision. <span class="Italic">Greaves v. USPS</span>, 55 MSPR 337, 340 (1992); <span class="Italic">Moore v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 237, 240 (1988) (same as <span class="Italic">Greaves</span>). Matters relating to the enforcement of settlements are initially to be raised before the regional office that accepted the agreement into the record. <span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR <span id="Page_5036"></span>447, 448 (1996). The Board holds unto itself "broad authority to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement entered into the record." <span class="Italic">McCrory v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 91 MSPR 56, 59 &#x00B6; 6 (2002) (reciting the rule); <span class="Italic">Tippetts v. USPS</span>, 82 MSPR 497, 501 &#x00B6; 7 (1999). The Board does not have the authority to enforce or invalidate a settlement agreement reached in another forum. <span class="Italic">Rebish v. Dept. of Interior</span>, SF-0752-13-0362-I-1 (NP 1/23/2014) (citing <span class="Italic">Lee v. USPS</span>, 111 MSPR 551, 554 &#x00B6; 4 n.2 (2009)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An issue of interpretation of the terms of a settlement agreement is properly addressed through a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Hayes v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 74 MSPR 613, 615 (1997); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Anthony v. DOJ</span>, 76 MSPR 45, 52 (1997) (remanding to the region a new compliance issue raised in a PFR involving a compliance case). The Board's enforcement authority is invoked to compel compliance with terms that are clear and to secure entitlements that depend on interpretation of terms and determinations whether a party breached those terms. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ernest v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 346, 351-52 (1996). Enforcement is at the initiative of the party seeking it. If the settlement agreement does not require the agency to report compliance to the Board--and that settlement has not yet surfaced in a reported Board case--the agency does not violate the agreement if it does not inform the Board of its efforts to meet the terms of the agreement. Under the Board's regulations, however, it has been suggested that, as to settlements accepted by the Board and resulting in dismissals of appeals, the agency should advise the appellant when the agency believes it has complied with a settlement that has been filed and accepted by the Board. The appellant is supposed to, "monitor the agency's progress towards compliance." 5 CFR 1201.181(b) (2022). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colonel v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 285, 289-90 (1988) (settlement enforcement proceeding: "[t]he Board's regulations provide that the parties are expected to cooperate fully with each other to assure compliance with a Board final decision, and do not contemplate that an agency submit proof to the Board of compliance with a Board final decision until a petition for enforcement has been filed"). Decisions discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-23-138.html#sec16-136">Time for Initiating Enforcement</a>," suggest that the Board does not, in fact, require agencies to notify appellants when they have fully complied with settlements. Some settlements may contain conditions that cannot be fulfilled for years into the future. If a question arises about one of those conditions, the parties should wait until there is a concrete controversy before invoking the Board's compliance jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. DOJ</span>, 43 MSPR 137, 142 (1990).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant believes the agency is not in compliance with the terms of a settlement agreement, he should file a petition for enforcement with the region; he should not complain of noncompliance in a PFR. <span class="Italic">Dorzd v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 77 MSPR 387, 389 (1989); <span class="Italic">Sherwood v. DOJ</span>, 46 MSPR 462, 464 n.1 (1990). The Board entertains allegations that a settlement agreement is invalid in a PFR. In an enforcement proceeding, the appellant may not question the underlying validity of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. VA</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998). <span class="Italic">Harris</span> was noted and followed in <span class="Italic">Adams v. Smithsonian Institution</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 98-3364):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a threshold matter, this court has previously recognized that, under the Board's precedent, allegations that a settlement agreement is invalid will only be considered in a timely petition for review, not upon a later petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1463, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Wells v.

<p class="Body-Text">The procedure is the same if the appellant files an enforcement petition, the petition is settled, and the appellant believes that the agency has not complied with the latest settlement. <span class="Italic">Holtgrewe v. FDIC</span>, 51 MSPR 371, 374 (1991). Jurisdiction does not vest if the complaint is that the agency intends to breach the terms of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cannon v. USPS</span>, 64 MSPR 344, 348 (1994). [Refer to counsel fee awards based on proceedings to enforce settlements in Chapter 15, "<a href="0100-2023-22-019.html#sec15-20">Enforcement Proceeding</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current regulations, the AJ may, if the agency (or the appellant) is in compliance, issue a decision that may be challenged through a PFR. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(4) (2022). If the agency (or appellant) is noncompliant, the AJ issues a decision and the agency (or appellant) must then file with the Board's Clerk a statement supported by evidence showing that it has complied or it must file a petition for review challenging the AJ's decision. 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(6) (2022). Under earlier regulations calling for compliance recommendations rather than decisions from AJs, if the agency asserted to the Board that it complied with the recommendation, the Board would dismiss the enforcement petition if the appellant did not exercise his regulatory right under 5 CFR 1201.183(a)(4) (2022) to respond to the agency submission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rivera v. USPS</span>, 107 MSPR 542, 546 &#x00B6; 6, 2007 MSPB 312 (2007) (noting boilerplate in Board orders that if the appellant does not "respond to the agency's evidence of compliance within 20 days, the Board may assume you are satisfied and <span class="Italic">dismiss</span> your petition for enforcement"; applying that language to one of several issues in a dispute over enforcement of a settlement); <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 74 (1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If a PFR raises compliance issues not raised for the first time with the region, the appeal is returned to the region for adjudication of those issues<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Wells v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 379, 381 (1996) (resolving one compliance issue and returning the case to the region for a new compliance issue that surfaced during the enforcement proceedings before the Board); <span class="Italic">Harris v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 222, 225 (1993) (if appellant raises a new compliance issue in a PFR based on "new evidence," the Board will remand the matter to the region for adjudication as an enforcement petition); <span class="Italic">Beard v. DOD</span>, 59 MSPR 29, 30 (1993) ("Because the appellant is raising additional matters relating to enforcement of the settlement agreement, and because a factual record must be developed on these issues and findings of fact made, it would be more appropriate for the petition to be [remanded]."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Burke v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 234, 235-36 (1987) ("Although entitled a petition for review, the appellant's pleading is in substance a petition for enforcement of the agreement.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board may resolve a compliance issue raised in a PFR, as in <span class="Italic">Wolf v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-1221-15-0389-W-1 (NP 9/24/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A pleading that alleges that the other party breached a settlement agreement, but does not contend that the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appeal pursuant to the agreement, is in substance a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Lopez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 461, 463 (1996). Because the record is sufficiently developed to enable us to adjudicate the petition, we need not remand it to the Board's field office. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Distinguishable are arguments raised for the first time in a PFR concerning an enforcement petition that led to a regional decision and then to the PFR. Then the rule is the same that applies to any PFR: unless there is good cause shown, arguments not raised with the AJ are not considered with the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 79 MSPR 206, 210 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (refusing to consider an argument advanced for first time in the PFR from an enforcement initial decision that a settlement was invalid because of coercion); <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 69 MSPR 627, 631-32 (1996) ("There is no indication...the appellants raised this 'clean-records' claim below.... The Board will not consider an argument raised for the first time in a [PFR]....

<p class="Body-Text">For the Board to accept and enforce the settlement, the settlement should have resulted from an MSPB appeal, not, for example, from proceedings following the filing of an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">Hirtle v. VA</span>, 38 MSPR 640, 645 (1988); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Pulcini v. SSA</span>, 83 MSPR 685, 693 &#x00B6; 16 (1999) (Board lacked jurisdiction to enforce an oral settlement arising out of employee's whistleblowing complaint to OSC; appellant did not demonstrate that the Board had jurisdiction over the agreement, that it was documented, and that it otherwise met the Board's criteria for enforcement). MSPB lacks authority to enforce EEO settlement agreements in cases not within the Board's jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Carr v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3042). According to <span class="Italic">MacMakin v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 294, 299 (1987), the Board have does not jurisdiction to enforce a settlement agreement entered during judicial review of a final Board decision. According to the Board's view, enforcement of a settlement entered into during appellate judicial proceedings would be within the "inherent authority" of the court receiving the settlement. [Refer to Chapter 13, "<a href="0100-2023-09-123.html#sec2-121">Settlement</a>" for compliance.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board receives so many petitions complaining about settlements that one might assume there existed a well-developed body of law with remedies for various types of commonly breached agreements. Not so. Most settlement disputes are dismissed either because the appellant seeks to establish a breach when there was no written commitment by the agency that was breached or, because by the time the dispute reaches the Board, the agency has done what it was supposed to do and the dispute is moot. When a breach is found, the appellant may elect to rescind the agreement and return to the appeal from the adverse action. If the appellant is unclear what remedy he wants through enforcement proceedings, the Board makes its best judgment as to the appellant's intentions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bergman v. DOJ</span>, 56 MSPR 42, 44 n.1 (1992) (Board concluded that appellant desired enforcement rather than rescission; "since the agency is currently in compliance with the agreement, we do not reach the issue of whether the agency's gap in compliance warrants the relief of rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of the appellant's restoration appeal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement allegations should be specific. An unsupported assertion that the agency may have breached the agreement will be deemed no more than speculation insufficient to warrant Board consideration. <span class="Italic">Moran v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR <span id="Page_5037"></span>547, 551 (1990). The burdens of proof in the settlement enforcement process were described in <span class="Italic">Urena v. USPS,</span> SF-0353-09-0650-C-1 (NP 7/12/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to enforce a settlement agreement which has been entered into the record in the same manner as any final Board decision or order. <span class="Italic">Young v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 609, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). A settlement agreement is a contract, and the Board will therefore adjudicate a petition to enforce a settlement agreement in accordance with contract law. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988)). Where an appellant files a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement, the agency must produce relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance with the agreement. <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 9 (2009). The appellant, however, bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that there was a breach of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 11, &#x00B6; 6<span class="Italic"></span> (2010); <span class="Italic">Vaughan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 541, 546 (1998). Further, the appellant must show not only that the agency acted in a manner that is inconsistent with a term of the settlement agreement, but that there was material noncompliance with a settlement term. <span class="Italic">Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Caston v.

<p class="Body-Text">The party seeking action on a settlement, either enforcement or rescission, must be without material fault. If both parties are in breach, the Board may disclaim interest in ordering a remedy, <span class="Italic">Hammond v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 46 MSPR 313, 319 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Generally, where one party breaches a settlement agreement, the nonbreaching party has the option of enforcing the terms of the settlement or rescinding the settlement and going forward with the original claim<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">McClain,</span> 40 MSPR at 70. Here, the appellant has not asked for either remedy. However, in this case, even if the appellant asked for enforcement or rescission, we find that we would not allow either remedy. Because there was a mutual breach of the settlement agreement, and because the agency acted in good faith to correct its breach, we find that there is no additional relief that the Board can grant to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Miller,</span> 41 MSPR at 392. <span class="Italic">Cf. Westinghouse Electric Corporation v. Garrett Corporation,</span> 601 F.2d 155 (4th Cir. 1979) (in proper circumstances a court may refuse to allow recovery by either party to an agreement because of their mutual fault or mutual breach of contract), <span class="Italic">cited in United</span> <span class="Italic">States v. Hamilton Enterprises,</span> 711 F.2d 1038, 1048 (Fed. Cir. 1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's failure to abide by an agreement may prevent him from enforcing it. If an agency complied and the appellant failed to comply with settlement provisions concerning reinstatement to a particular position, and then the appellant is reinstated to a different position and fired, the appellant's remedy is a new appeal rather than an enforcement petition to secure compliance with the settlement agreement he breached. <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 526, 529 (1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Enforcement allegations should be specific. An unsupported assertion that the agency may have breached the agreement will be deemed no more than speculation insufficient to warrant Board consideration. <span class="Italic">Moran v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 547, 551 (1990).</p>
