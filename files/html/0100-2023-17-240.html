<p class="noindent">Management's right to assign work includes the right to assign overtime and to determine when it will be performed. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station and AFGE Local 2635</span>, 58 FLRA 571 (2003). Contract equalization or other distribution provisions, enforced in arbitration, lead to exceptions based on management rights objections, reviewed, depending on when in FLRA's history, under an abrogation or <span id="page_2129"></span>excessive interference standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Austin and NTEU Chap. 72</span>, 65 FLRA 474 (2011).</p>
<p class="noindent">Speaking generally, contracts can impose conditions on overtime distribution, and those conditions, interpreted by arbitrators, will be enforced by FLRA when the resulting awards conform to principles of law governing negotiability. FLRA sustained an arbitration award enforcing contractual distribution of overtime, <span class="Italic">NTEU and Customs Serv.</span>, 18 FLRA 780, 781 (1985):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Statute encompass[es] management's discretion to establish the qualifications necessary to perform the duties generally assigned to the customs inspector position and to determine whether an employee meets those qualifications.... However, the Authority has expressly held that when two or more employees are equally qualified and capable of performing the work, the selection of any one of those employees to perform the work would be consistent with management's exercise of its discretion.... In these circumstances the procedure by which employees previously judged by management to be equally qualified will be selected to perform the work is negotiable...and when negotiated by the parties is enforceable by grievance and arbitration.... In terms of this case, the Authority finds that the Arbitrator has simply enforced the established procedures of the parties' supplemental agreement providing for the selection of a particular customs inspector to perform the customs inspection work management has determined will be performed on overtime and providing for separate assignment procedures for overtime in excess of eight hours....</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, FCC Lompoc and AFGE Local 3048</span>, 70 FLRA 596, 596-98 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), set aside an award based on a contract article--deemed to excessively interfere with management's right to assign work--requiring employees to be assigned overtime work rather than avoid overtime expense through assignment of the work to nonunit employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency assigns correctional officers to cook-supervisor posts on various shifts. For years, when officers were unavailable to work their scheduled shifts, the Agency had assigned other bargaining-unit employees to fill those shifts on an overtime basis. In January 2016, the Agency began, for economic reasons, to either leave those shifts vacant or assign them to nonunit employees. In response, the Union filed grievances alleging that the Agency violated Articles 18, 27, and 36 of the parties' agreement by failing to assign vacant shifts to the grievants on an overtime basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Article 18 of the agreement provides, as relevant here, that "when [the Agency] determines that it is necessary to pay overtime for positions/assignments normally filled by bargaining[ ]unit employees, qualified employees in the bargaining unit will receive first consideration for these overtime assignments, which will be distributed and rotated equitably among bargaining[ ]unit employees." Article 27 requires, in pertinent part, that the Agency reduce hazards to its employees "to the lowest possible level, without relinquishing its rights under...[&#x00A7;] 7106" of the Statute. In addition, Article 36 provides, as relevant here, that the parties "endorse the philosophy that people are the most valuable resource of the [Agency]." And the Arbitrator found that, in Article 36, the parties pledged to "make every reasonable consideration to fulfill the mission of the [Agency]...in a manner that fosters good communication among all staff[,] emphasizing concern and sensitivity in working relationships."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties consolidated the grievances and submitted them to arbitration.&#x2003;As relevant here, the stipulated issues at arbitration were whether, since January 2016, the Agency violated: (1) Article 27 of the parties' agreement by vacating cook-supervisor shifts; and (2) Article 18 of the agreement "and/or the established past practice...with respect to overtime procedures and the assignment of work."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated Articles 18 and 36 by leaving cook-supervisor shifts vacant or assigning them to nonunit employees "for the sole purpose of avoiding paying [the grievants] overtime." The Arbitrator further found that the Agency violated Article 27 because its actions "failed to lower the inherent hazards of the correctional environment for [the grievants]." Additionally, the Arbitrator rejected the Agency's argument that sustaining the Union's grievance would be contrary to the Agency's rights, under &#x00A7; 7106 of the Statute, to assign work and to determine the Agency's budget and internal-security practices. As remedies, the Arbitrator directed the Agency to stop vacating shifts for "economic reasons" and reinstate the procedure that the Agency had used to fill vacated shifts before January 2016. In addition, the Arbitrator found the Agency liable under the Back Pay Act to pay the grievants for lost overtime opportunities.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Analysis and Conclusion: The award violates management's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award violates its management right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute because the award precludes the Agency from: (1) assigning nonunit employees to cook-supervisor shifts or leaving the shifts vacant, and (2) determining when to assign overtime. The right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) includes the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom, or what positions, the duties will be assigned.[13] The right to assign work also includes the right <span class="Italic">not</span> to assign work.[14] In addition, management's right to assign work includes the right to assign overtime and determine when employees will perform overtime.[15]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Authority recently revised the analysis that it will apply when reviewing management-rights exceptions to arbitration awards.[16] Under the revised analysis articulated in <span class="Italic">DOJ</span>, the first question that must be answered is whether the arbitrator has found a violation of a contract provision.[17] If the answer to that question is yes, then the second question is whether the arbitrator's remedy reasonably and proportionally relates to that contract violation.[18] If the answer to either of those questions is no, then we must vacate the award. But, if the answer to the second question is yes, then the final question is whether the arbitrator's interpretation of the contract provision excessively interferes with a management right under &#x00A7; 7106(a).[19] If the answer to that question is yes, then the arbitrator's award is contrary to law and we must vacate the award.[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the answer to the first question is yes because the Arbitrator found that the Agency violated contract provisions including Article 18, which outlines procedures for assigning correctional officers to overtime work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second question, the Arbitrator ordered the Agency to: stop vacating shifts for the purpose of avoiding paying the grievants overtime; reinstate the established procedure used to fill vacated shifts; and pay the grievants for lost overtime opportunities. The awarded remedy, which requires the Agency to follow previously established procedures and Article 18 when assigning overtime work, reasonably and proportionally relates to the contractual violation. Therefore, the answer to the second question is yes.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we consider whether the Arbitrator's remedy or his interpretation of Article 18 excessively interferes with a management right under &#x00A7; 7106. The Authority has found that arbitration awards that require agencies to use overtime to avoid vacating shifts excessively interfered with management's right to assign work.[23] In addition, the Authority has found that arbitration awards excessively interfered with management's right to assign work where the awards precluded the Agency from vacating shifts: except in "emergency situations or for other good cause,"[24] or for "administrative convenience and without good reason."[25] The awarded remedy here requires the Agency to assign vacant cook-supervisor shifts to the grievants on an overtime basis and precludes the Agency from--for economic reasons--either assigning those shifts to nonunit employees or leaving the shifts vacant.[26] Therefore, we find that the remedy excessively interferes with the Agency's right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B).[27] As such, the answer to the final question in the <span class="Italic">DOJ</span> framework is yes, and we vacate the award. Consequently, we do not need to address the Agency's remaining arguments.</p>

<p class="noindent">Earlier decisions sustained awards applying equalization provisions, or not, depending on the approach of FLRA prevailing at the time of the decision.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VAMC Coatesville and NAGE Local R3-35</span>, 55 FLRA 138, 140-42 (1999), considered overtime equalization entitlement in the context of an arbitration award:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's framework for resolving exceptions to arbitration awards alleging that the award violates management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute is set forth in <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Washington, D.C.</span> <span class="Italic">and National Treasury Employees Union, Chapter 201,</span> 53 FLRA 146, 151-54 (1997) (<span class="Italic">BEP</span>). Upon finding that the award affects a management right under section 7106(a), the Authority applies a two-prong test. Under Prong I of this framework, the Authority examines whether the award provides a remedy for a violation of either applicable law, within the meaning of section 7106(a)(2) of the Statute, or a contract provision that was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 153. If the award provides such a remedy, the Authority will find that the award satisfies Prong I of the framework and will then address Prong II. Under Prong II, the Authority considers whether the arbitrator's remedy reflects a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the law or contractual provision at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 154. If the arbitrator's remedy reflects such a reconstruction, the Authority will find that the award satisfies Prong II. An award that fails to satisfy either Prong I or Prong II will be set aside or remanded to the parties, as appropriate<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Defense, Defense Logistics</span> <span class="Italic">Agency, Defense Distribution Depot, Norfolk, Virginia</span> <span class="Italic">and International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Local Lodge 97, </span>54 FLRA 180, 185 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has held that the right of an agency to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau</span> <span class="Italic">of Prisons, United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth,</span> <span class="Italic">Kansas and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees, Local 919, </span>53 FLRA 165, 168-69 (1997) <span class="Italic">(Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth). </span>The Authority has also held that an award requiring an agency to adhere to objective criteria in assigning overtime affects management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) and assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and</span> <span class="Italic">Trademark Office and Patent</span> <span class="Italic">Office Professional Association, </span>37 FLRA 1204, 1214 (1990). Here, the award requires the Agency to follow the overtime callback roster procedure established under Article 15, Section 1 of the agreement. Based on Authority precedent, the portion of the award ordering the Agency to utilize the overtime callback roster procedure affects management's rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether an award satisfies Prong I of <span class="Italic">BEP, </span>the Authority determines whether the provision of the agreement being enforced by the Arbitrator was negotiated pursuant to section 7106(b) of the Statute. In the instant case, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, Article 15, Section 1 of the agreement requires the Agency to use the overtime callback roster procedure when off-duty employees are needed to work. The Arbitrator's interpretation of this provision and his finding that the Agency violated it, demonstrate that the Arbitrator was enforcing a provision in the parties' agreement within the meaning of <span class="Italic">BEP</span> Prong 1<span class="Italic">. See BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 153.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we must now determine whether the provision was negotiated pursuant to a subsection of 7106(b). We construe Article 15, Section 1 of the agreement as an enforceable procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. As an initial matter, it is undisputed that the parties and the Arbitrator considered Article 15, Section 1 to constitute a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, we note that the procedure is substantively similar to the procedure set forth in <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees, Local 1853 and U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Attorney's Office, Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn, N.Y., </span>29 FLRA 94, 98-101 (1987) <span class="Italic">(U.S. Attorney's</span> <span class="Italic">Office). </span>Provision 3 in <span class="Italic">U.S. Attorney's Office, </span>which the Authority found to constitute a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute, concerned the assignment of overtime to volunteers, who were qualified to perform the work, as determined by the Agency. The provision also provided for the equitable rotation of the overtime among the qualified volunteers. The provision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Attorney's Office </span>is similar to the provision in this case because both concern overtime assignments, both provide for the assignment of the overtime to volunteers, and both provide that the Agency determines which employees are qualified to perform the duties. The provision in <span class="Italic">U.S. Attorney's Office</span> provides for the equitable rotation of the overtime, while Article 15, Section 1 in this case uses a roster.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also found provisions that establish a roster of qualified employees for overtime assignments to constitute a procedure.&#x2003;Provision 1 in<span class="Italic"> National Association of Government Employees</span>, <span class="Italic">Local R14-52</span> <span class="Italic">and U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Army</span> <span class="Italic">Depot, Texarkana, Texas, </span>44 FLRA 738, 739-42 (1992) established a roster of qualified employees, based on seniority, for overtime assignments. The Authority found that Provision 1 established a procedure for the rotational assignment of overtime that was negotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, in establishing the overtime callback rosters under Article 15, Section 1 of the agreement, there is no contention that the Agency does not determine which employees are eligible and qualified to be on each of the rosters. There is also no question that the Agency was able to determine the qualifications needed to perform the work in this case. Thus, we find that Article 15, Section 1 constitutes a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. Prong I of the <span class="Italic">BEP</span> framework has been established.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Next, we turn to Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>analysis. Under Prong II the remedy awarded must reflect a reconstruction of what management would have done if management had not violated the agreement provision on a section 7106(b) matter. <span class="Italic">See BEP, </span>53 FLRA at 154. Here, the Arbitrator ordered that the grievant be paid for all of the missed overtime opportunities, whether the work was performed by supervisors or other employees not on the MAS roster. At issue in the reconstruction is whether the Agency was free to assign some or all of the work to supervisors, or whether all of the work had to be assigned to the grievant on callback overtime.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Attempts to confine work assignments to the bargaining unit are contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(13). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO, Local 2317 and U.S. Marine Corps, Marine</span> <span class="Italic">Corps Logistics Base, Nonappropriated Fund Instrumentality, Albany, Georgia, </span>29 FLRA 1587, 1593 (1987), <span class="Italic">dismissed as to other matters, </span>No. 88-8006 (11th Cir. Aug. 30, 1990). The principle that management may not be precluded from assigning work normally performed by unit employees to supervisors is well established in Authority case law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Southwestern Power Administration and International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 1002, </span>22 FLRA 475, 476-77 (1986); <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, International Council of U.S. Marshals Service Locals and Department of Justice, U.S. Marshals Service</span>, 11 FLRA 672, 674-76 (1983) (Proposals 2 and 3); <span class="Italic">American Federation of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, AFL-CIO, National Joint</span> <span class="Italic">Council of Food Inspection Locals and Department Of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture, Food Safety and Quality Service, Washington, D.C., </span>9 FLRA 663, 663-64 (1982) (Proposal 1). Therefore, management has the right to assign this work to supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the award requires the Agency to assign all such work to the grievant on an overtime callback basis, and precludes the assignment of the work to supervisors, it is inconsistent with section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. The Agency made clear in its Exceptions that it did, and would continue to, exercise its right to assign overtime work to supervisors. In this regard, the Arbitrator's reconstruction of what the Agency would have done fails, and must be set aside.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to other unit employees outside the MAS, according to the Arbitrator, the Agency was not free to assign the MAA work to them on an overtime or compensatory time basis because the parties had negotiated a <span id="page_2131"></span>procedure for the assignment of overtime to unit employees within MAS. We find that, had the Agency followed the overtime callback roster procedure set forth in Article 15, it would not have assigned the work to other unit employees outside the MAS, and that the Arbitrator's award enforced the agreement provision as if the Agency had observed the agreement provision. As noted above, the parties stipulated that the grievant would have worked the callback overtime. Accordingly, we conclude that the award, as it applies to work performed by other unit employees outside the MAS, satisfies Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>test.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that the Agency assigned work on an overtime basis, including compensatory time, to unit employees other than those on the overtime callback roster, the Agency failed to follow the procedure established under the parties' agreement. Therefore, under Prong II of the <span class="Italic">BEP </span>test, we find that the award fails the test as it applies to supervisors, but satisfies the test as it applies to other unit employees outside the MAS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, based on the discussion above, we will set aside the award to the extent that it prohibits the assignment of work to supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The Award Is Not Consistent with the Back Pay Act as it Pertains to Supervisors</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the Back Pay Act, an award of backpay is authorized only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action; and (2) the personnel action has resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services and</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union, </span>54 FLRA 1210, 1219 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the determination regarding the award's compliance with management's rights, the award of backpay to the grievant for lost overtime for the occasions when other unit employees outside the MAS performed the MAA work does not violate the Back Pay Act. In those circumstances, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to follow Article 15, Section 1 of the parties' agreement. An agency's violation of a collective bargaining agreement is an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action for which backpay may be awarded under the Back Pay Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">However, the award of backpay to the grievant for lost overtime for the occasions when the MAA work was assigned to supervisors is not authorized under the Back Pay Act. As determined above, the Agency had the right to assign work to supervisors, and it committed no unjustified or unwarranted personnel action when it assigned work to supervisors. Accordingly, we set aside the award to the extent it provides the grievant backpay for occasions when supervisors performed the MAA work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;The Award Is Consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) on Scheduling Work to Avoid Payment of Overtime</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's reliance on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) is misplaced. That provision implements 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A), which requires that an agency must schedule employees' tours of duty not less than 7 days in advance, except when the head of an agency determines that the Agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased. This case involves the assignment of overtime, not the scheduling of tours of duty<span class="Italic">. Cf. United States Department of Agriculture, Animal</span> <span class="Italic">and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection</span> <span class="Italic">and Quarantine Program, Seattle, Washington and</span> <span class="Italic">National Association of Agriculture Employees,</span> 51 FLRA 975 (1996) (agency terminated Sunday overtime shift because of lack of work). The Agency has not demonstrated that the Arbitrator's award enforcing the negotiated overtime assignment provision conflicts with section 610.121(a) and provides no basis for finding the award deficient under section 7122(a) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service and American Federation of Government</span> <span class="Italic">Employees,</span> <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Immigration</span> <span class="Italic">and</span> <span class="Italic">Naturalization Service Council, </span>42 FLRA 222, 228-30 (1991). Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An arbitrator may honor a stipulation concerning a grievant's qualifications for overtime. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 57 FLRA 538, 541 (2001). "[W]hen management has determined that two or more employees are equally qualified to undertake an assignment, a proposal or provision prescribing how management will select from among those employees constitutes a procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)." <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA OHA, Falls Church, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-092.html">60 FLRA 461</a>, 467 (2004); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DHS C&#x0026;BP Laredo and NTEU Chap. 149</span>, 70 FLRA 216, 218 (2017) ("In this case, by directing the Agency to consider employees' prior work experiences in determining their qualifications for overtime pools, the Arbitrator required only that the Agency abide by <span class="Italic">its own previous determinations</span> that the employees were qualified to perform work in the units where the Agency previously assigned them. Consistent with Authority precedent, we find that this remedy enforces an overtime-assignment procedure under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2)." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Puget Sound</span>, 62 FLRA at 6.).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the requisite causal connection is established, as through a violation of a contract overtime distribution or equalization provision, then the arbitrator may legitimately award overtime compensation for overtime that should have been but that was not worked, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Bremerton MTC, </span><a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v62/62-002.html">62 FLRA 4</a>, 7-8 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In contending that the backpay remedy is deficient, the Agency concedes that "this kind of application of the Back Pay Act by [a]rbitrators has been approved in earlier FLRA decisions[.]" Exceptions at 8-9. Nevertheless, the Agency requests that the Authority take a "fresh look" at the Back Pay Act and rule that the Act does not authorize payment for overtime that was not actually worked because such payment is inconsistent with overtime regulations. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 9. In addition, the Agency argues that this is not the usual backpay case because the remedy of backpay is "[n]ot required" and is "[u]nnecessary to make the employee whole[.]" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 9-10. The Agency also notes that the Authority has held that there is nothing in the Back Pay Act that requires a monetary remedy for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 9 n.10 (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916</span>, 57 FLRA 715 (2002)). Finally, the Agency suggests that the violation of Article 8 is not an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action because Article 8 does not mandate payment to employees for hours they did not work. For the reasons that follow, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is correct in conceding that its arguments have been rejected by the Authority.&#x2003;For example, in <span class="Italic">FEMTC</span>, 39 FLRA 3, 9 (1991), the Authority explicitly rejected "the [a]gency's contention that the award is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5542(a) and 5544(a) by ordering backpay for overtime not worked." The Authority explained that it had previously "found awards of overtime compensation to be warranted in cases where employees did not actually perform overtime work." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>(citations omitted). The Authority emphasized that</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[i]n each of those cases, the fact that employees did not actually work overtime did not render a remedy of overtime compensation unlawful. Rather, the employees would have worked overtime had the agency not engaged in improper conduct and, therefore, they suffered the loss of pay because of that conduct. Where it is established that employees are entitled to overtime under collective bargaining agreements and do not receive that overtime because of a violation of the agreement by the agency, those employees can be found to be entitled to compensation for the lost overtime.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In view of the repeated reaffirmation that the Back Pay Act permits compensation to remedy the loss of overtime pay resulting from an unwarranted denial of the opportunity to work, we decline the Agency's invitation to take a "fresh look" at the Back Pay Act. In addition, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916,</span> and the proposition that there is nothing in the Back Pay Act that requires a monetary remedy for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency is correct that in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916, </span>the Authority did generally note that "[t]here is nothing in the Back Pay Act that requires a monetary award for every unjustified or unwarranted personnel action." 57 FLRA at 717 n.7. However, what the Agency overlooks is that the Authority ruled that the arbitrator's denial of backpay was not contrary to the Act because the arbitrator "found that the [u]nion failed to offer any proof that the grievant 'actually suffered a monetary loss.'" <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 717. Consequently, the Act's requirement of a causal connection was not satisfied, and there could be no award of backpay under the Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority also noted in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 </span>that the union's exception touched upon the arbitrator's chosen remedy for a contract violation and that the Authority's consistent practice is to grant arbitrators great latitude in fashioning remedies. With the Agency conceding that the Back Pay Act allows the remedy of backpay, the Agency's argument is nothing more than disagreement with the Arbitrator's choice of remedy and an attempt to have make-up overtime substituted for the Arbitrator's chosen remedy of backpay. Such disagreement provides no basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2132"></span>Moreover, in our view, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chapter 98</span>, 60 FLRA 448 (2004) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting), likewise offers no support to the Agency. As in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916, </span>the arbitrator in<span class="Italic"> NTEU Chapter 98</span> determined that the agency violated the collective bargaining agreement when it denied certain employees the opportunity to work overtime, but also determined that the union failed to sustain its burden that backpay was the appropriate remedy. In concluding that the arbitrator's denial of backpay was not deficient, the majority emphasized, as it had in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916, </span>that because the arbitrator did not find that the violation of the collective bargaining agreement had resulted in a loss of pay, the denial of backpay was not contrary to the Back Pay Act.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;The Authority also discussed the meaning of decisions in which the Federal Circuit had determined that arbitrators are authorized to deny backpay when they mitigate disciplinary actions, but find fault on the part of the employee. The majority concluded, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">In the present case, involving an alleged lost opportunity to work overtime rather than a disciplinary action, it is unclear whether or how the Federal Circuit's reasoning would apply. Nevertheless, as set forth above, the [a]rbitrator in th[is] case now before us found that the [un]ion failed to sustain its burden of establishing that backpay was a required remedy. Thus, we leave for another day, in a case where the issue is presented and addressed, the question whether the Authority should reconsider its precedent on this point.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">60 FLRA at 451 (discussing<span class="Italic"> AFGE Local 2718 v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 768 F.2d 348 (Fed. Cir. 1985) and <span class="Italic">Ollett v. Dep't of the Air Force, </span>253 F.3d 692 (Fed. Cir. 2001)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">What the Agency overlooks in relying on <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 </span>is that the expression of the view that arbitrators are not required to automatically award backpay has involved cases in which arbitrators failed or refused to award backpay and unions filed exceptions contending that an award of backpay was mandated under the Back Pay Act. None of the cases involved the circumstances of this case: an award of backpay by the Arbitrator who made all of the requisite findings under the Back Pay with the Agency contending in exceptions that backpay was not required. In addition, rejection of the Agency's position is consistent with Authority precedent quoting the Back Pay Act as entitling an employee, on correction of the personnel action, to receive, for the period during which the personnel action was in effect, "an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials, as applicable which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred...." <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Naval Air Depot, Cherry Point, N.C., </span>61 FLRA 38, 40 (2005) (quoting &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Agency's argument that the violation of Article 8 does not constitute an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act because it does not mandate payment to employees for hours they did not work provides no basis for finding the award deficient. As the Authority has repeatedly held, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement constitutes an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action under the Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NLRB, Washington, D.C., </span>61 FLRA at 162 (Member Armendariz dissenting on other grounds).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the requisite causal connection is not established, the arbitrator may not award backpay--even if a contract equalization provision is violated, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2338 and VA Pershing VAMC</span>, 71 FLRA 343, 344 (2019) (recon. den. <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v71/71-137.html">71 FLRA 723</a> (2020) (Member Abbott concurring)) ("The Arbitrator did not award backpay because he found that the Union did not present evidence showing which employees were available to work overtime and would have accepted the overtime work if it had been made available to them. That is, the Union failed to provide evidence of "specific injury" to any "specific employee." The Union did not challenge this finding. Therefore, consistent with the BPA and Authority precedent, and deferring to the Arbitrator's factual findings, we find that the Union fails to show that the award is contrary to the BPA."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1286 and DOJ, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, FCI Ashland</span>, 51 FLRA 1618, 1618, 1621-22 (1996) (award dividing overtime among those who might have been adversely affected was set aside because it violated the Back Pay Act), <span class="Italic">supra</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, St. Louis and NTEU Chapter 14</span>, 67 FLRA 101, 105-06 (2012), explained the necessary nexus between an award of back pay and management's violation of an overtime distribution scheme:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the remedy is contrary to the Back Pay Act.&#x2003;In particular, the Agency contends that the Arbitrator failed to make findings that specify which employees are entitled to backpay.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of backpay is authorized under the Back Pay Act only when an arbitrator finds that: (1) the aggrieved employee was affected by an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action and (2) the personnel action resulted in the withdrawal or the reduction of an employee's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, U.S. CBP, Laredo, Tex. </span>66 FLRA 567, 568 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Customs</span>); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Tinker Air Force Base, Okla. City, Okla.</span>, 63 FLRA 59, 61 (2008) (<span class="Italic">Tinker</span>). In determining whether a backpay award is deficient, the Authority examines whether there is a causal connection between the unwarranted action and the loss of pay, allowances or differentials. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 63 FLRA 646, 648 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the first requirement, a violation of the parties' agreement constitutes an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action. <span class="Italic">Tinker, </span>63 FLRA at 61. The Arbitrator found that the Agency violated the parties' agreements in two instances--first, when it failed to contact the Union to provide how it would equitably distribute overtime and second, when it enforced overtime limits precluding senior employees from obtaining as many overtime hours as they would have received without the limits. Thus, we find that the first requirement of the Back Pay Act is satisfied. <span class="Italic">Tinker, </span>63 FLRA at 61.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second requirement, even if employees did not actually work overtime, the Authority has found that such employees may receive backpay under the Back Pay Act if a contract violation resulted in their failure to work overtime. <span class="Italic">Customs</span>, 66 FLRA at 568. If an arbitrator makes such a finding, then the Authority will not find an award deficient under the second Back Pay Act requirement, unless the agency demonstrates that the award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Further, if an award sufficiently identifies the specific circumstances under which employees are entitled to backpay, there is no additional requirement that the Arbitrator identify specific employees entitled to the remedy. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.</span>, 55 FLRA 553, 560 (1999).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that senior employees failed to work overtime because the Agency violated the parties' agreements. As we have denied the Agency's nonfact exception regarding this factual finding, we defer to it. We also defer to the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency's actions caused senior employees to suffer "reduced earnings," as the Agency does not challenge this finding as a nonfact. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Transp., FAA</span>, 63 FLRA 502, 504 (2009) (<span class="Italic">FAA</span>). Therefore, because the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that these employees are entitled to backpay, we find that the award satisfies the Back Pay Act's second requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also claims that the Arbitrator failed to make the required causal connection between the Agency's actions and loss of employee pay because he did not "determine which of the grievants would have received the overtime assignment, or that all of them would have been assigned overtime, had the [A]gency complied with the agreement[s]." This contention concerns compliance and implementation matters and does not implicate the requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">FAA</span>, 63 FLRA at 504.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Beckley </span>is misplaced<span class="Italic">. </span>In <span class="Italic">Beckley</span>, the Authority set aside the arbitrator's award because he awarded backpay despite finding that "there [was] no certain way to know which employees would have received the [overtime] payments." 64 FLRA at 776. Here, unlike <span class="Italic">Beckley</span>, the Arbitrator identified the category of employees entitled to backpay--namely, employees who "were not allowed as many overtime hours as they would have received had the limits not been specified," that is, employees "who have been deprived of overtime due to the imposition of the overtime limits." Accordingly, we deny the Agency's Back-Pay-Act exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Under an arrangements clause, an award properly enforced an overtime equalization provision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 45 FLRA 489, 492-94 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Agency has not established that the award is deficient as contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. When an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute, we will, as appropriate, examine the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine: (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights; and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 37 FLRA 309, 313-14 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">If it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute. Accordingly, we will not find that such an award is contrary to law and we will deny the exception. If the arbitrator's interpretation does result in an abrogation of management's rights under section 7106(a), the award will be found deficient as contrary to law. However, because the contractual provision may be susceptible to a different and sustainable interpretation by a different arbitrator, the provision itself will not be affected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator's award is contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute. Rather, the Arbitrator has enforced a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement that constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign overtime work. The Arbitrator <span id="page_2133"></span>found that Article 5 of the Local Supplement to the parties' Master Labor Agreement, which generally provides that overtime will be distributed as fairly and equitably as possible among employees, controlled the allocation and distribution of overtime among employees. Applying the provisions of Article 5 to the grievances before him, the Arbitrator determined that the grievants were wrongfully denied overtime to which they were entitled under the contract. Consequently, we find that the Arbitrator merely enforced an arrangement negotiated by the parties when he directed the Agency to pay the employees for the lost overtime opportunity. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service and American Federation of Government Employees, National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council</span>, 42 FLRA 222, 230-31 (1991) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that Article 5 of the Local Supplement, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate the Agency's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, the Authority held that an award "abrogates" a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right<span class="Italic">. Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314. The Arbitrator's award does not preclude the Agency from exercising its rights under section 7106 of the Statute. Rather, the award only requires the Agency to comply with Article 5 of the Local Supplement, which provides that overtime will be distributed as fairly and equitably as possible among employees. The Arbitrator's award would not prevent management from determining when overtime assignments are required, deciding how many employees are needed to work overtime, and assigning overtime work to unit employees, as long as such assignments comply with the requirements of the parties' agreement. Accordingly, we conclude that Article 5, as interpreted and applied by the Arbitrator, does not abrogate the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute<span class="Italic">. See INS</span>, 42 FLRA at 231.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find no merit in the Agency's contention that the Arbitrator's award is deficient on the basis that it interferes with management's rights under section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">INS</span> decision, relied on in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 987</span>, was subsequently abandoned by FLRA to the extent that <span class="Italic">INS</span> enforced the overtime provision as an appropriate arrangement. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Pac. Region</span>, 47 FLRA 1038, 1045 (1993) (relying upon <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv. and NTEU</span>, 37 FLRA 309 (1990) [discussed earlier of this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-17-057.html#sec9-57">Management Rights; Procedures and Arrangements; In Accordance With Applicable Laws</a>"]). But in <span class="Italic">Pac. Region</span> FLRA also pointed out that the provision in <span class="Italic">INS</span> would have been properly enforced as a procedure implementing management's right to assign work. In the absence of an enforceable negotiated procedure, management's right to assign work was infringed by an award equalizing the distribution of overtime without regard to functional divisions of employees who were to perform the work. <span class="Italic">See SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-036.html">60 FLRA 150</a>, 152 (2004). <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 215 and SSA OHA, Falls Church</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-092.html">60 FLRA 461</a>, 465 (2004), overturned an award that enforced an overtime distribution agreement that FLRA decided involved a burden on management that outweighed the benefit derived by employees.</p>
<p class="noindent">Management sets the qualifications required for employees performing overtime work. An arbitrator may not infringe the right of management to assign work. One of the components of the right to assign work is the right to determine the qualifications necessary to perform the work assigned. An award will be set aside that grants overtime to an individual deemed by the agency to be unqualified to perform overtime work. The discretion in an overtime case appears to be limited to enforcement of a procedure permitting employees previously judged by management as equally qualified to be selected to perform certain work. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 23 FLRA 369, 370-71 (1986). Past practice does not appear to justify an arbitrator's finding that management failed properly to determine the employees who are qualified to undertake overtime work. <span class="Italic">SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals and NTEU Chap. 224</span>, 31 FLRA 1172, 1176-77 (1988). An award will be set aside if an arbitrator determines that an employee is qualified for the overtime but not selected for it because of management's incorrect assessment of his qualifications. Although the arbitrator may enforce a contract procedure mandating that overtime be assigned to employees previously judged by management to be equally qualified, an arbitrator may not infringe on the right of management to determine the qualifications needed to perform the work. <span class="Italic">Naval Ordnance Station and IAM Lodge 830</span>, 23 FLRA 671, 672-73 (1986).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA does not sustain awards of back pay based on overtime equalization clauses if the basis of the award is the arbitrator's agreement with union's position that the grievants were as well or better suited for the work assigned by management to employees that management considered better qualified for the assignments. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Engraving &#x0026; Printing and IAM, Franklin Lodge 2135</span>, 32 FLRA 531, 537-38 (1988). The arbitrator may, however, interpret and apply a contract clause that provides discretion to management to assess qualifications among individuals when seniority would ordinarily control overtime assignment, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Dover AFB and AFGE Local 1709</span>, 55 FLRA 935, 939 (1999):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Approved holiday and overtime work will be distributed in accordance with seniority as far as the work permits.&#x2003;When insufficient numbers of volunteers are available to perform holiday and overtime work within a section, volunteers from other sections with the same title and pay grade may be used on a seniority basis. If volunteers are not available who are fully competent and qualified to perform the needed duties, assignment will be on a reverse seniority basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The seniority provision supported the arbitrator's award, 55 FLRA at 936-39:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The grievant is an electrician assigned to the Agency's 436th Air Lift Wing. The Union filed a grievance claiming the Agency violated the overtime provision of the parties' agreement when it failed to offer the grievant overtime before offering the work to a less senior employee. The Agency responded that the overtime provision permitted management to select an employee based upon the qualifications needed for a particular job. In the absence of a resolution, the parties proceeded to arbitration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">During the arbitration proceedings, the Agency conceded it did not follow the seniority list. The Agency maintained, however, that the nature of the work to be performed allowed it to assign the individual perceived best qualified and able to complete the work most expeditiously and effectively. The Agency selected the less senior employee because he was part of a three-person, dedicated team assembled the day before to address an on-going problem with a particular aircraft. The Union, on the other hand, claimed the grievant possessed the same specific specialized skills and knowledge as the less senior employee; had worked the same problem previously; and if asked, would have worked overtime in this situation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency had followed the Article 27 overtime procedure on previous occasions.&#x2003;The Arbitrator found that a year earlier, the parties had considered the issue of seniority in assigning overtime through a grievance that was settled by issuing certain guidelines. Those guidelines provided that "worker qualification within a specialty" would be used to define who would be considered "competent and qualified" under Article 27. The Arbitrator additionally noted that during the arbitration proceedings in this case, the Agency neither claimed that the grievant was unqualified to perform the work, nor made any other reference regarding the grievant's qualifications for the overtime assignment, and concluded that the grievant was as equally qualified to do the overtime work as the individual selected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that, if management retains the right to determine the qualifications for assignment of certain work and whether individual employees possess such qualifications, then the procedures by which one of the qualified employees is assigned such work is negotiable under section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See American Federation Of</span> <span class="Italic">Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3172 and</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social</span> <span class="Italic">Security Administration, Sacramento, California</span>, 49 FLRA 845, 848 (1994). More specifically, "an agency can be required to select a candidate for a position on the basis of seniority where management is able to determine the source from which it will select and the qualifications needed for the position<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local</span> <span class="Italic">3295 and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Thrift Supervision, </span>47 FLRA 884, 906 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision in this case addresses overtime assignments among qualified, volunteer employees. The Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 27, Section 1, establishes an order of assignment from a pool of qualified, volunteer employees. Although the Agency argues that the Arbitrator's construction of the provision deprives management of the discretion to determine the qualifications needed to perform work, nothing in the provision or the Union's explanation supports such a view.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision, as interpreted by the Arbitrator, provides the Agency the right to determine the requisite qualifications necessary to perform overtime work, but requires the Agency to use the negotiated procedure (here, based on seniority), when employees are needed to work. Such a provision is clearly in keeping with Authority precedent under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). Here, the Arbitrator expressly found that the grievant and the employee selected to perform the disputed overtime were "equally qualified." Therefore, the Arbitrator's interpretation of Article 27, Section 1, and his finding that the Agency violated it, demonstrate that the Arbitrator was enforcing a provision in the parties' agreement that constitutes a procedure within the meaning of section 7106(b)(2) of the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime equalization awards predating 1993 were routinely sustained as appropriate arrangements. An award sustaining an overtime equalization provision, applied to require back pay in arbitration, and applied when management assigned supervisors to perform work that otherwise would have been performed by unit employees, passed muster, <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 174 and Dept. of Treasury, Customs Serv., Region IV</span>, 45 FLRA 1051, 1058-60 (1992):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's assertion, we find that the analysis set forth <span id="page_2134"></span>in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> [37 FLRA 309 (1990)] is appropriate to resolve the Agency's exceptions. We further find that the Agency has not established that the award is deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we reexamined our approach to cases in which an agency contends that an arbitrator's award enforcing a provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is contrary to management's rights under section 7106 of the Statute. We held that when an agency makes such a contention we will examine, as appropriate, the provision enforced by the arbitrator to determine: (1) if it constitutes an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's rights; and (2) if, as interpreted by the arbitrator, it abrogates the exercise of a management right. We explained that if it is evident that the provision constitutes an arrangement and, as interpreted by the arbitrator, does not abrogate management's rights, the provision is within the range of matters that can be bargained under the Statute. Accordingly, we held that we will not find that such an award is contrary to law and we will deny exceptions that contest that the award is inconsistent with management's rights. We also held that if the arbitrator's interpretation does result in an abrogation of management's rights under section 7106(a), the award will be found deficient as contrary to law, but the contractual provision, susceptible to a different and sustainable interpretation by a different arbitrator, will not be affected.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The contractual provisions enforced by the Arbitrator relate to the assignment of overtime work and, specifically, to the equitable assignment of overtime among bargaining unit employees. Clearly, these provisions constitute an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management's right to assign work on an overtime basis.... In our view, the Arbitrator merely enforced an arrangement that permits bargaining unit employees to perform overtime work in order to preserve their level of compensation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We further find that the provisions of the parties' agreements enforced by the Arbitrator do not abrogate the Agency's right to assign work or employees or to determine the personnel by which Agency operations are conducted. In <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we held that an award abrogates a management right when the award "precludes an agency from exercising" that right. <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 314. The Arbitrator's award in this case does not preclude the Agency from exercising its rights. First, we find that although the Agency's ability to assign any employee it chooses to perform work at St. Petersburg in the Port Director's absence is somewhat circumscribed, the Arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement provisions does not abrogate the exercise of the right to assign employees under section 7106(a)(2)(A). Rather, the award only requires the Agency to comply with the provisions of the agreements that provide for the assignment of inspectional overtime work to Tampa bargaining unit employees when the St. Petersburg Port Director is unavailable. Significantly, the award leaves unimpaired the Agency's right to assign a supervisor to replace the St. Petersburg Port Director when, as stated by the Arbitrator, "<span class="Italic">bona fide</span> supervisory tasks" must be performed. In addition, it is undisputed that the Agency retains the right to determine whether bargaining unit employees are qualified to perform inspectional work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, we find that the Arbitrator's enforcement of the agreement provisions does not abrogate the exercise of management's rights under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute. In this regard, the Agency retains the right to assign work on an overtime basis. In addition, and for the same reasons expressed above in connection with the right to assign employees, the Agency's ability to determine the personnel by which its operations are conducted is not precluded, even though the exercise of that right may be limited to some extent. Thus, the Agency retains the right to determine whether supervisory tasks must be performed on an overtime basis and, therefore, whether to assign a supervisor to perform overtime in the Port Director's absence. Moreover, the Agency retains the right to determine whether the personnel to which it has assigned overtime work are qualified to perform such work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find that the Agency's reliance on Authority decisions to support its view that the award is inconsistent with or abrogates the exercise of management's rights is misplaced. To the extent the Agency cites decisions addressing the negotiability of various proposals and provisions, we stated in <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span> that the test employed for determining the negotiability of matters proposed to be bargained under section 7117 of the Statute is different from that used in determining whether the enforcement of a negotiated agreement abrogates the exercise of a management right. To the extent the Agency relies on Authority decisions in arbitration cases that predate <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, we note that the test set forth therein was designed to apply to that case and to all future cases involving exceptions to awards that are claimed to conflict with the exercise of a management right.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was set aside, for lack of a supporting contract provision that compensated unit members for overtime lost, when work ordinarily assigned to unit employees was assigned to a supervisor, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, Leavenworth and AFGE Local 919</span>, 53 FLRA 165, 169-71 (1997):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The right of an agency to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute includes the authority to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned. <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 3392 and U.S. Government Printing Office, Public Documents Distribution Center, Pueblo, Colorado</span>, 52 FLRA 141, 143 (1996). In applying that standard, the Authority has stated that proposals to confine work assignments to the bargaining unit are contrary to section 7106(a)(2)(B). <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2317 and U.S. Marine Corps, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Nonappropriated Instrumentality, Albany, Georgia</span>, 29 FLRA 1587, 1593 (1987), <span class="Italic">dismissed as to other</span> <span class="Italic">matters</span>, No. 88-8006 (11th Cir. Aug. 30, 1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As interpreted by the Arbitrator, the provisions in this case mean that "bargaining unit work shall be done by bargaining unit employees" and that "[m]anagement...may not assign ordinary work [to supervisors] when bargaining unit employees are available." By restricting the assignment of work to the bargaining unit, the provisions affect to whom and when ordinary work will be assigned and depart from the principle that management may not be precluded from assigning ordinary work to positions outside the bargaining unit. Consequently, on the basis of the precedent cited above, we conclude that the provisions affect management's right to assign work under section 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although the provisions affect the exercise of a management right, the award enforcing them will not be found deficient under section 7106(a) of the Statute if the provisions: (1) constitute an arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute, and (2) do not abrogate the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">Customs Service</span>, 37 FLRA at 313-14.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In order to constitute an arrangement, a provision must seek to mitigate adverse effects "flowing from the exercise of a protected management right." <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">IRS</span>, <span class="Italic">Chief Counsel</span>). In this case, it is neither argued nor apparent that management's assignment of work to supervisors, in and of itself, adversely affected unit employees. The sole adverse effect that the Union identifies to support its claim that the provisions constitute an arrangement is the "den[ial] [of]...the 'opportunity for overtime' provided for in the collective bargaining agreement." Under these circumstances, <span class="Italic">IRS, Chief Counsel</span> and its progeny compel a conclusion that the provisions are not arrangements within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Council of Prison Locals, Local 3974 and U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Federal Correctional Institution, McKean, Pennsylvania</span>, 48 FLRA 225, 230-31 (1993) (holding that proposal to prevent management from filling job vacancies with nonunit candidates when qualified unit employees were available was not an arrangement). Accordingly, we conclude that the award is deficient and set it aside as contrary to section 7106(a) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Computer and Telecommunications Area Master Station and AFGE Local 2635</span>, 58 FLRA 571 (2003) (setting aside award, for lack of enforceable arrangement, granting overtime pay to unit members who claimed they, rather than military guards, should have been selected to cover vacant shifts).</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewed in <span class="Italic">VAMC, Palo Alto and AFGE Local 2110</span>, 36 FLRA 98, 106 (1990), was an award determining that the agency violated its contract by requiring the grievants to work outside the normally scheduled hours without paying overtime. The grievances arose when the agency changed work schedules, from Monday through Friday, to Tuesday through Saturday, eliminating weekend overtime work by converting it to work performed during normal working hours. Concluding that the grievants were disparately treated in comparison to other employees, an award directed the parties to negotiate a monetary settlement covering lost overtime. The award was not contrary to a Claims Court decision; it did not contravene the Back Pay Act or the late FPM, and, as to the most important issue raised by the agency, the award was consistent with 5 USC 6101 and its implementing regulations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's central argument rests on 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b) which, in relevant part provides as follows: (1) &#x00A7; 610.121(b)(1) provides that the head of an agency is obligated to schedule the work of employees and their regularly scheduled administrative workweeks in order to accomplish the agency's mission and to correspond with the employees' actual work requirements; and (2) &#x00A7; 610.121(b)(2) requires an agency head to reschedule an employee's regularly scheduled workweek when the agency head knows in advance of the administrative workweek that the specific days and/or hours of a day actually required of the employee in that administrative workweek will differ from the days and/or hours required in the current administrative workweek.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 754-756, section 610.121(b) must be interpreted in a manner consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a). Those provisions permit an <span id="page_2135"></span>agency head to make changes in an employee's established workweek only when it is determined by the agency that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has not claimed, or otherwise demonstrated, that it changed the work schedules of motor vehicle operators in order to prevent serious handicapping of the Agency's functions or to prevent substantially increased costs. The Agency states only that transporting patients on recreational outings furthers its mission and that budgetary limitations preclude regularly scheduled overtime. Moreover, the Agency has not shown in what manner the award violates the legal and regulatory requirements governing changes in work schedules.... We find nothing in the award which would prevent the Agency from changing work schedules, as long as such changes were made in accordance with law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator may determine that management unfairly apportioned overtime, direct a remedy, and leave to compliance the matter of identification of the employees who will receive compensation, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons and AFGE Local 3979</span>, 55 FLRA 28, 29 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's finding that the Agency violated Article 18, Section (n) of the collective bargaining agreement satisfies the requirement of an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action, and the Agency does not dispute it. Instead, the Agency disputes whether the Arbitrator made sufficient findings that the Agency's overtime assignment practice had resulted in a loss of overtime pay to any individual employee to allow him to award backpay and remand to the parties to determine the recipients and the amount. We conclude that the Arbitrator made the necessary findings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator expressly found that the Agency's violation of the agreement constituted an unjustified and unwarranted personnel action that had deprived employees of the ability to work specific overtime assignments and that backpay was justified for those employees wrongly denied the opportunity to work overtime. We find that consistent with the Act, the Arbitrator sufficiently identified the specific circumstances under which employees were entitled to backpay. There is no additional requirement for him to have identified specific employees. <span class="Italic">See Federal Employees Metal Trades</span> <span class="Italic">Council, Local 831 and U.S. Department of the Navy,</span> <span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard, Long Beach, California,</span> 39 FLRA 1456, 1459 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</span>) (when an arbitrator has found the specific circumstances giving rise to an entitlement to backpay, there is no requirement in the Act or its implementing regulations for the arbitrator to identify the specific employees entitled to backpay as a result of the unwarranted action); <span class="Italic">Department of the Treasury, U.S. Customs Service and National Treasury Employees Union</span>, 13 FLRA 386, 387 (1983) (arbitrator made the necessary findings for an award of backpay because he determined that when overtime had been assigned in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, unit employees were available to perform such work; there is no requirement under the Act to identify any specific employees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The terms of the award further assure its consistency with the Act.&#x2003;Pursuant to the award, no employee will receive backpay unless the employee would have worked an overtime assignment but for the Agency's distribution system. The Agency's complaint about the difficulty in identifying these employees does not implicate the requirements of the Act, but rather implicates a matter of compliance and implementation. The Arbitrator's direction to the parties in this case is no different than the Authority's own direction to the parties in <span class="Italic">Long</span> <span class="Italic">Beach Naval Shipyard. See </span>39 FLRA at 1460. Accordingly, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Surface Warfare Ctr. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 55 FLRA 596, 599-600 (1999) (sustaining award of overtime when equalization provisions of agreement were violated; management retained right to determine skills required of employees receiving overtime assignments); <span class="Italic">DLA, Red River Army Depot and NAGE Local R-14-52</span>, 55 FLRA 523, 527 (1999) (awarding back pay for employees who should have received equitable distribution of overtime under an overtime roster).</p>
<p class="noindent">Overtime entitlement was left to compliance when an award determined that the agency improperly reassigned employees, depriving them of overtime, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA,</span> 63 FLRA 502, 503-04 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that contract provisions, which require management to first solicit volunteers among qualified employees prior to selecting any employee for reassignment, constitute enforceable procedures negotiated pursuant to &#x00A7; 7106(b)(2). <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Navy, Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion &#x0026; Repair, Gulf Coast, Pascagoula, Miss.,</span> 62 FLRA 328, 330 (2007). Such provisions are enforceable if the agency retains the right to determine employee qualifications, and the provisions are applied to qualified employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Article 46 specifically provides for the determination of qualifications by the Agency, and the Agency does not argue, and the Arbitrator did not find, that employees who should have been solicited were not qualified. Consequently, the Arbitrator properly concluded that the Agency was obligated to follow Article 46 and that the Agency's violation of Article 46 constituted an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action within the meaning of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv., El Paso, Tex.,</span> 55 FLRA 553, 559 (1999). We note that, in numerous cases, the Authority has upheld awards of backpay in which the arbitrator found that the exercise of a management right violated the parties' collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 559-60.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Agency's argument that there cannot be an award of backpay in the absence of a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy. Under the language of the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, a <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span> remedy is unnecessary. In this regard, &#x00A7; 5596(b)(1)(A)(i) specifically provides that an employee "is entitled, on correction of the personnel action, to receive...an amount equal to all or any part of the pay, allowances, or differentials...which the employee normally would have earned or received during the period if the personnel action had not occurred[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we reject the Agency's argument that there was no loss of overtime pay as the result of the violation of Article 46. This argument disputes the Arbitrator's underlying findings of fact. In this regard, the Union expressly argued to the Arbitrator that the Agency's failure to first solicit volunteers for reassignment "had a direct impact on employees since in many cases it meant a loss of overtime pay[.]" The Arbitrator found "the Union's essentially unrebutted evidence and contentions to be persuasive with regard to the appropriate remedy for the Agency's violations." He agreed with the Union that an award of backpay "is appropriate to all employees who lost overtime compensation because of the Agency's failure to solicit volunteers." He concluded, as argued by the Union, that the lost overtime compensation was "directly tied to the Agency's failure to abide by the terms of the [collective bargaining agreement], which constitutes an unwarranted personnel action [under] the Back Pay Act."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the absence of a determination that a factual finding is deficient as based on a nonfact, the Authority defers to an arbitrator's factual findings in resolving whether the award is contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Office of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals, Falls Church, Va.,</span> 55 FLRA 349, 353 (1999). Here, the Agency makes no nonfact assertions. As the Arbitrator's factual findings support his legal conclusion that the Agency's violation of Article 46 resulted in a loss of overtime pay for employees who were improperly reassigned, the award of backpay satisfies the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. Moreover, the Agency objects that there is no causal connection because the availability of overtime is uncertain. Exception at 6 ("[T]here [i]s no assurance that overtime would have been available to them as they had worked before being reassigned."). However, the Agency's argument is a matter of compliance and implementation and does not implicate the legal requirements of the Back Pay Act. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Veterans Affairs Med. Ctr., Ann Arbor, Mich,</span> 56 FLRA 216, 224 (2000); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Sheridan, Or.,</span> 55 FLRA 28, 29 (1998). In addition, in calculating the amount of such backpay, the Authority has specifically endorsed the use of past history of overtime as an acceptable basis of determining what employees would have earned, but for the unwarranted action. <span class="Italic">United States Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., Honolulu Dist. Office, Honolulu, Haw.,</span> 43 FLRA 608, 619 (1991). Consequently, the Agency's allegations of uncertainty provide no basis for finding the award of backpay deficient.</p>

However, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency violated any applicable law, rule, regulation, or provision of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement. In fact, the Arbitrator does not mention or quote any law other than the BPA itself, nor any rule, regulation, or collective-bargaining agreement provision. As such, the award does not include a finding that the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action as required by the BPA."), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau of Prisons, DOJ, FCC Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 65 FLRA 1040, 1043-46 (2011) (sustaining award of overtime lost as result of unfair reassignment while grievant was under investigation for possible misconduct).</p>
