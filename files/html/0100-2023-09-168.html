<p class="Body-Text">A preappeal settlement may resolve the adverse action proposal through resignation, retirement, demotion, suspension, or reassignment. Normally the Board enforces only those settlements that result from a Board appeal and that are entered into the record for purposes of enforcement, a topic much discussed in <a href="0100-2023-23-001.html#sec16-1">Chapter 16</a>. The preappeal settlement is not the product of Board litigation. If the party is to challenge an action arrived at through the combination of an agreed adverse action and waiver of appeal rights, the agreement can be only indirectly challenged by an appeal of the action arrived at through settlement, e.g., resignation. The agency offers the settlement and waiver of appeal rights as a bar to the appeal. The appellant may respond by contending that the agreement is invalid because it was coerced; it was the product of fraud; it was entered into during a period of mental incompetence; or it was the product of some other factor that would otherwise invalidate the agreement. As but one of many examples, in <span class="Italic">Moran v. VA</span>, 43 MSPR 547, 552-53 (1990), the appellant challenged a preappeal settlement in an appeal from the resignation entered into as a result of a settlement that also waived appeal rights. The agency maintained that the resignation was voluntary. Moran offered, but the Board rejected, various challenges to the settlement: the assertion that the agency breached the agreement was unsupported; there was no evidence of agency bad faith, coercion, or misrepresentation, or of incapacity of appellant's counsel; the record did not support the appellant's claimed incompetence; and the agreement was not the product of duress through threats of possible criminal prosecution--there was no indication that the agency ever threatened the appellant concerning possible criminal prosecution after the U.S. Attorney informed the agency it would not proceed against the appellant. [Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-058.html#sec16-58">Unfiled Settlement Agreement; Preappeal Settlement</a>," discusses challenges to unfiled settlements that are offered as bars to appeals; <a href="0100-2023-13-001.html#sec6-1">Chapter 6</a> discusses appeals from constructive adverse actions, e.g., resignations and retirements challenged as coerced or the product of misleading information or other questionable circumstances.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bahrke v. USPS</span>, 98 MSPR 513, 518-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2005), evaluated the defense of invalidity to an LCA that was not filed with the Board but that was invoked to remove the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that where, as here, an LCA was not reached during the course of a Board appeal, its validity may still be considered to determine its effect on the personnel action before the Board. <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 81, 84 (1998). An LCA is a settlement agreement, which is a contract. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). A party challenging the validity of a settlement agreement bears a heavy burden of showing a basis for invalidation. <span class="Italic">Bynum v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 662, 665 (1998). Nevertheless, a party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake<span class="Italic">. Wade v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 580, 583 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish that a settlement agreement was fraudulent as a result of coercion or duress, a party must prove that he involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no alternative, and that such circumstances were the result of the other party's coercive acts<span class="Italic">. Candelaria v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. 412, 413 (1986). The fact that an appellant must choose between two unpleasant alternatives, such as signing the LCA or facing immediate removal, does not render his choice involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Soler-Minardo v. Department of Defense</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 100 &#x00B6; 5 (2002), <span class="Italic">review dismissed</span>, 53 Fed. Appx. 545 (Fed. Cir. 2002); <span class="Italic">McCall v.

On the other hand, the settlement agreement would be considered involuntary if the appellant demonstrated that the agency knew or believed that its August 15, 2003 proposed removal action could not be substantiated, or that an arguable basis for the proposed removal did not exist. <span class="Italic">See Schultz v.

<p class="Body-Text">The law on waiver of an appeal right was summarized in <span class="Italic">Roberson v. VA</span>, 32 MSPR 173, 175-76 (1987), involving a remand ordered because an AJ did not provide a hearing on the meaning of a settlement agreement and the state of mind of the appellant who entered into the agreement to waive an appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451, 456 (1985), the Board held that a discharged employee may agree with his employer, in exchange for reinstatement under certain specific conditions, to waive his right of appeal to the Board. However, the terms of the waiver must be comprehensive, freely made, and fair, and there must be no evidence that the execution of the waiver was in any way the result of duress or bad faith on the part of the agency....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Ferby v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 451 (1985)<span class="Italic">,</span> the question of whether the agency acted in bad faith in negotiating an LCA is relevant to the enforceability of the appellant's waiver of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 64 MSPR 365, 374 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed.

Dept. of Transp.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3062), explained that the court will not disregard an LCA waiving an MSPB appeal right if the agency has some reasonable basis for threatening or proposing the action leading to the LCA. If the agency has a basis for threatening the action, the employee has the choice of appealing the action imposed or accepting the LCA and waiving further appeal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Merriweather contends that his removal for violation of an April 29, 1993 last chance agreement was improper because it was based on an earlier, coerced agreement dated August 31, 1992. He says that the administrative judge (AJ) correctly found that the Federal Aviation Administration (agency) knew or should have known that the threatened removal could not be sustained because the action was based solely on his status as an alcoholic, an impermissible ground for removal under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC &#x00A7; 794 (1988). Accordingly, says Merriweather, the August agreement was void and the subsequent June 4, 1993 removal, which arose from the earlier agreement, was void as well. Thus, he argues that the board should have accepted the AJ's findings that the agency coerced him into the August last chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But the board was free to reject those findings in favor of its own, so long as it articulated a sound reason for its evaluation of the evidence. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Veterans Admin.</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1330-31 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Here, the board rejected the AJ's conclusion that the agency knew or should <span id="Page_1140"></span>have known the proposed removal could not be sustained, citing record evidence suggesting that Merriweather had been drinking heavily on workdays for several weeks before he admitted himself for treatment. Moreover, the board found that Merriweather knew he could appeal the initial removal action to the board to challenge the merits of the removal, but chose instead to sign the August agreement waiving his appeal rights. Finally, the board determined that Merriweather had failed to prove that the agency acted in bad faith by coercing him into treatment that it knew would not address his needs. Indeed, the agency seems to have taken great pains to accommodate Merriweather short of removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are persuaded that substantial evidence supports the board's determination that Merriweather voluntarily entered into the August agreement, that he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal agency action based on violation of the agreement, and that the agreement was not the product of bad faith or duress. Having waived his right to challenge the removal action, Merriweather's appeal was properly dismissed. <span class="Italic">See Stewart v. USPS</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">McCall v. USPS</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 666-69 (Fed. Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Silva v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 268, 272 (1993), noted as to the bad faith standard employed in analysis of a party's actions under an LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Bad faith has been defined as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The opposite of "good faith," generally implying or involving actual or constructive fraud, or a design to mislead or deceive another, or a neglect or refusal to fulfill some duty or some contractual obligation, not prompted by an honest mistake as to one's rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister motive. Term "bad faith" is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; it is different from the negative idea of negligence in that it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or ill will.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency based its perjury charge on a statement by the appellant that the agency had reason to believe was false. Not only did the appellant contradict his earlier statement by his testimony, but attendance records from the EAP program show that the appellant did not attend the twice weekly meetings. As discussed above, the administrative judge did not sustain the perjury charge because she found that the statement was not material, a question of law for the administrative judge to decide<span class="Italic">. See U.S. v. Raineri</span>, 670 F.2d 702, 718 (7th Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 459 U.S. 1035 (1982). We find that an agency error in this regard does not rise to the level of bringing a charge in bad faith.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, contrary to the appellant's argument below and in his response to the petition for review, the fact that the agency removed the appellant on the date that the prior initial decision became final and never reinstated him does not establish bad faith<span class="Italic">. See Drummond v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 MSPR 289, 291-92 (1991). The agency took the latest removal action, at least in part, for a reason that the administrative judge found legitimate, the appellant's failure to attend the EAP meetings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Boland v. VA</span>, CH-0752-11-0537-I-1 (NP 3/4/2014), considered and rejected an allegation that an LCA was implemented, leading to the appellant's removal, in bad faith based on a retaliatory complaint by a coworker as to whom the appellant reported a work-related problem:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the nurse only forwarded the appellant's emails to agency management in reprisal for his report about her, and that the nurse's action started the chain of events that led to the agency's review of these emails and his removal, the appellant has failed to allege facts that could show that the agency acted in bad faith in effectuating the last-chance agreement based on the inappropriate emails that came to light during that process. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 21 M.S.P.R. 348, 351 (1984) ("Appellant's final legal argument, that the action must be reversed because the agency's decision to investigate was discriminatory, is without merit. The agency's reasons for conducting the investigation which led to appellant's removal are outside the scope of this proceeding."); <span class="Italic">see also Carr v. Social Security Administration</span>, 185 F.3d 1318, 1324-26 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (finding that the Board was not required to account for the petitioner's allegations regarding the alleged retaliatory motive of the persons whose complaints initiated an inquiry that brought the petitioner's misconduct to light, when the decision makers themselves were not improperly motivated; to hold otherwise would improperly allow the employee to use the Whistleblower Protection Act as a shield to protect her own misconduct). For instance, there is no allegation, or evidence in the record suggesting, that the nurse had any influence over or role in the administrator's decision-making, <span class="Italic">see Carr</span>, 185 F.3d at 1325-26, or that the agency conducted a deficient investigation into the appellant's conduct, <span class="Italic">cf., e.g., Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 313, 335 (1998) ("If an agency fails to investigate a charge sufficiently before bringing an action, such a failure might indicate an improper motive."), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that the appellant has implicitly argued that the nurse did not find the emails inappropriate because she did not bring the emails to management's attention until months after she received them, we conclude that the appellant has failed to nonfrivolously allege the existence of a genuine issue of material fact either that he was in compliance with the agreement or that the agency acted in bad faith. Whether the nurse or any other recipient subjectively or genuinely believed the emails were inappropriate is immaterial in this case. The content of the appellant's emails has not been challenged, and it cannot be credibly argued that the emails were an appropriate use of government equipment. At most, the appellant has attempted to make a case that such emails had been generally tolerated in his facility. Again, because the appellant was subject to the terms of his last-chance agreement, the appellant's allegations regarding what infractions might have been tolerated in other circumstances are insufficient to constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a basis for disregarding the waiver of his appeal rights in his last-chance agreement. <span class="Italic">See Buchanan</span>, 247 F.3d at 1339; <span class="Italic">Gibson</span>, 160 F.3d at 726-27.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that <span class="Italic">Posey v. Department of Defense</span>, 180 F. App'x 931 (Fed. Cir. 2006), supports his argument that the administrative judge should have conducted a hearing in this appeal. Although <span class="Italic">Posey</span> is not binding on the Board because the court issued it as a nonprecedential decision, we have considered the appellant's arguments and the persuasive value of the reasoning in that decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mills v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6; 8 (2013). In <span class="Italic">Posey</span>, the court held that the Board erred in ruling that, by entering into a last-chance agreement, the appellant waived the right to argue that his supervisors retaliated against him while he was subject to the agreement. 180 F. App'x at 935. The court remanded the case to the Board to consider that claim and determine whether the appellant was entitled to a hearing on his retaliation allegation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In contrast to <span class="Italic">Posey</span>, we do <span class="Italic">not</span> hold in this appeal that the appellant waived his right to argue retaliation during the period of his last-chance agreement. We have considered the appellant's allegations under the assumption that a retaliation allegation <span class="Italic">could</span> be a basis for invalidating a waiver of appeal rights in a last-chance agreement. Before the appellant is entitled to a hearing, however, he must make a <span class="Italic">nonfrivolous</span> allegation of such retaliation, <span class="Italic">see Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573, and we conclude that the appellant failed to satisfy that burden in this case. There is nothing in <span class="Italic">Posey</span> that compels a different conclusion, and our holding in this case is entirely consistent with precedential decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholding the dismissal of similar appeals without a hearing if, as here, an appellant has failed to make a nonfrivolous allegation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Buchanan</span>, 247 F.3d at 1338, 1340; <span class="Italic">Briscoe</span>, 55 F.3d at 1573; <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 668-69.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Harvey v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-14-0660-I-1 (NP 7/24/2015) ("The appellant has not shown that management exceeded its discretion in finding that he was AWOL for the half-hour absence exceeding his leave balance. He also has not convinced us that receiving S.Y.'s permission to leave the workplace relieved him of his responsibility to know his leave balance and act in accordance with agency and facility rules, regulations, and policies, especially given S.Y.'s earlier express warnings. The appellant was AWOL, thus breaching the LCA.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a claim that an LCA was the product of coercion, <span class="Italic">Koczan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 42 MSPR 160, 165 (1989), commented:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's decision to execute a settlement agreement is presumed to be voluntary....&#8197;The mere fact that the appellant was faced with an unpleasant choice does not negate the presumption....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The October 11 Agreement specifically advised the appellant that she could appeal her removal if she chose not to sign the Agreement. She also attested that the waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily after consultation with her union representative. The only evidence of coercion the appellant offered was her handwritten notation on the October 4 memorandum conveying the settlement agreement: "signed under protest...." That alone is clearly insufficient to raise an inference of coercion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bravman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 26 MSPR 169, 171-72 (1985) (retirement voluntary despite handwritten notation "Involuntary Retirement" on SF-52); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Lang v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 35 MSPR 314 (1987) (no mutual mistake where provisions crossed out of draft agreement but no objection made at time of execution).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found no duress in the choice between discharge and acceptance of an LCA, <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP No. 03-3012):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams argues that he "didn't want to sign a Last Chance Agreement at first, but word from Acting PM Cassel, I was out the door if I didn't sign." The administrative judge correctly stated that the unpleasant alternative of removal that Mr. Williams faced does not render his acceptance of the agreement involuntary, nor does it amount to coercion or duress. <span class="Italic">See McCall v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 839 F.2d 664, 667 (Fed. Cir. 1988). The choice between removal and signing the agreement is inherent in any last chance agreement. Although the results of Mr. Williams's violation of the last chance agreement are severe, he freely entered into the agreement and is bound by the results caused by his failure to comply <span id="Page_1141"></span>with its terms. We therefore uphold the Board's determination that Mr. Williams did not sign the last chance agreement involuntarily.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams does not argue that the agency knew that it could not have sustained a removal action based on the underlying charges. Accordingly, we agree with the Board that Mr. Williams failed to show that the agency acted in bad faith in obtaining his assent to the agreement, which has been recognized as a legal basis for challenging a removal action based on a last chance agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 162, 164 n.1 (1988), the agreement negotiated after the appellant received a proposal to remove him for AWOL provided:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In consideration for not being removed from Federal employment...voluntarily and willingly agree to the following conditions: (a) If not removed...I agree the removal action will be held in abeyance for a period of one year...(b) I understand and agree that the removal action will be effected if and when any other offense or performance problem of any kind occurs during the [one year] period...(c) I agree that if a removal action is effected for any offense, I waive any and all rights to grieve, appeal, complain, or litigate both a management charge of my commission of a further offense during the abeyance period and the delayed removal action itself.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Three months before the end of the one-year period, the appellant was charged with an hour of AWOL and failure to request leave. Gonzales appealed the ensuing removal, the agency sought dismissal on the basis of the agreement, and the Board agreed with the agency that the appeal could not be heard, concluding that a choice between unpleasant choices does not invalidate a last chance agreement, 38 MSPR at 165:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board specifically stated that its holding in <span class="Italic">Ferby</span> was limited to the particular facts and circumstances of the two appeals before it and noted that its decision did not address the question of whether a last chance settlement agreement, based upon a less than fully effected removal action, may constitute agency abuse of discretion or otherwise violate fundamental fairness or public policy....&#8197;Such a factual situation is presented in the instant case....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gonzales</span> gave effect to the agreement, 38 MSPR at 165-67:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first note...the appellant was represented when he negotiated the agreement. Second, the appellant signed a separate letter indicating that he accepted the agreement. Third...there was no evidence in the record that the execution of the agreement was in any way the result of duress or bad faith negotiation on the agency's part. We also note that the appellant did not present any evidence of duress or bad faith with his petition for review. Moreover, the fact that the appellant was faced with an unpleasant choice does not of itself negate the presumed voluntariness of his decision to execute the agreement[3] ....&#8197;[A]ppellant knowingly and intentionally waived his appeal rights when he executed the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;[T]he appellant argues that he signed the agreement because he had a family to support and his only concern was to keep his job....&#8197;We again note that the appellant was represented when he executed the last chance agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the agreement is not fair because it does not specifically delineate what constitutes an offense triggering the reinstatement of the removal action and because it was invoked totally at the discretion of his supervisor. He also argues that the agency's action in removing him for only a few hours of AWOL constitutes an abuse of discretion and is unduly harsh.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency proposed the first removal action based on charges of AWOL and leaving the job site without permission. The parties then executed the last chance agreement, which states that the removal action would be effected "<span class="Italic">if and when any other offense or performance problem of any kind occurs during</span>" the one-year period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency subsequently reinstated the removal action under the terms of the agreement based on a charge of AWOL and failure to request leave.[4] We find that the appellant's subsequent misconduct was the type of prohibited behavior contemplated by the parties in negotiating the agreement and was properly considered by the agency to violate the agreement. The term of the agreement stating that the appellant would be removed for any other offense is unambiguous. The appellant agreed to the terms of the agreement, which functioned exactly as it was intended to function, as a "last chance" agreement....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant does not deny the agency's charges that he was AWOL and failed to request leave...but argues that the agency could have excused his absence and granted him approved leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we reject the appellant's argument that removal is an abuse of the agency's discretion or too harsh a penalty for the charged AWOL of one hour. The subsequent misconduct was merely the event which triggered reinstatement of the suspended removal action, which the agency had already found warranted based on his previous misconduct. In addition, the agreement by its very language supports the finding that the appellant waived his right to appeal to the Board, not only the original removal action, but also the subsequent disciplinary action taken against him by the agency during the agreed-upon one-year probationary period. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not shown that the agency's invoking the agreement was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of its discretion.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant also argues that there is no provision in the agreement precluding the agency from adhering to the due process rights provided by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513. As we have found, however, under the very terms of the agreement, the appellant waived his right to appeal the agency's action to the Board, including Board review of any alleged violation of &#x00A7; 7513.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 1994 the Board reemphasized that before an LCA negotiated after a proposal and before an appealable decision would bar an appeal filed after an alleged breach of the agreement and imposition of an adverse action decision, an AJ should examine whether the agreement is invalid because it is unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 137, 139-41 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Briscoe v. VA</span>, 55 F.3d 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1995), <span class="Italic">post</span>, incorporated law pertaining to the effect of unfiled settlement agreements that are relied upon to bar appeals (discussed in Chapter 16, "<a href="0100-2023-23-039.html#sec16-40">Threat of Unwarranted Action; Duress</a>," and "<a href="0100-2023-23-058.html#sec16-58">Unfiled Settlement Agreement; Preappeal Settlement</a>"):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a threshold jurisdictional issue in this case, which the administrative judge did not reach. The Board held in <span class="Italic">Schultze v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 57 MSPR 250, 255 (1993), that it lacked the authority to set aside a settlement agreement that had not been incorporated into the record of a Board appeal for purposes of enforcement. Subsequent to the issuance of the initial decision in this case, however, the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Schultze</span> on that point. The Board held that a party may challenge the validity of a settlement agreement resulting in the withdrawal of a Board appeal, even when that agreement is not entered into the Board's record for purposes of enforcement, if the party believes that the agreement is unlawful, was involuntary, or was the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Wade v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 61 MSPR 580, 582 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The issue now presented is whether the validity of the agreement may be challenged where the LCA was not reached <span class="Italic">during</span> the course of a Board appeal, but it is brought before the Board to give legal effect to its terms in connection with a later-filed Board appeal. We find in the affirmative. The considerations set forth in <span class="Italic">Wade</span> apply with equal force where the agreement at issue was reached prior to, and perhaps in lieu of, proceeding to a Board appeal. We stressed in <span class="Italic">Wade</span> that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The essence of a settlement agreement is that it must be a voluntary action. An agreement that is reached by virtue of fraud or mutual mistake is, by definition, involuntary. Similarly, we do not countenance an agreement that is unlawful on its face or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Wade</span>, 61 MSPR at 583. We find that, once the matter proceeds to the level of a Board appeal where the Board is asked to give legal effect to the terms of the agreement, the obligation arises to assure "the validity and integrity of the appellate process." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant alleged below, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that she had been mentally incapable of voluntarily entering into the LCA because of the effects of her medical condition of Major Depression. In response, the agency denied that the appellant had suffered from diminished mental capacity at the time she entered into the LCA. The administrative judge resolved this issue of voluntariness on the documentary record alone, concluding that "the appellant ha[d]failed <span class="Italic">to establish</span> that she lacked the mental capacity to enter into the [LCA]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the administrative judge erred in stating that the appellant was required to "establish" her mental incapacity without receiving a hearing. Rather, in order to receive a jurisdictional hearing, the appellant had only to set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of fact which, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case that the Board had jurisdiction over her appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, the Board held that, in determining whether an appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction entitling him or her to a hearing, an administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary submissions, but that, to the extent that the agency's evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicting assertions of the parties, and the agency's evidence may not be dispositive<span class="Italic">. Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant asserted that she had suffered from Major Depression since 1990, and that her condition tendered her unable to "make a voluntary or informed decision to relinquish any appeal rights [by entering into the LCA]." She also submitted medical documentation of her condition. In response, the agency asserted that the appellant's <span id="Page_1142"></span>medical documentation did not cover April 1992, which is the time at issue. The agency also submitted a copy of the LCA, as well as affidavits from agency officials Paul D. Ising and Mary G. Park, and asserted that "documents in the agency response and the affidavit of Mary Park support that a voluntary and informed decision was made by appellant on April 1, 1992, in signing the agreement."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge stated that a hearing was not necessary in the appeal because "the record evidence...[was]sufficient to resolve the issues of fact relating to the Board's jurisdiction in this matter." Again, this statement was erroneous. Where there is indeed a disputed "issue of fact" that would resolve the issue of jurisdiction, a hearing is required. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon</span>, 60 MSPR at 330. Inasmuch as the appellant failed, however, to make a nonfrivolous allegation below which, if true, would tend to show that she lacked the mental capacity to enter into the LCA in April 1992, we find that the administrative judge's adjudicatory errors described herein did not prejudice the appellant's substantive rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation below warranting a jurisdictional hearing. Thus, the administrative judge did not err by dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

A waiver may eliminate the employee's right to appeal any aspect of the underlying removal, including both the factual basis and the legal validity of the proposed removal action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 926 F.2d at 1148 n.*. The agreement "predicates the reimposition of removal and concomitant waiver of appeal rights on breach of one or more of the...stipulations the agreement contains." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1148. It is the board's responsibility to determine whether these preconditions for enforcement of an agreement have been met<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. If the conditions are met and the agreement is enforceable, then the board is without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCall</span>, 839 F.2d at 668-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"[C]ases may arise where the MSPB should hold an evidentiary hearing on jurisdiction. For example it would be appropriate for the MSPB to honor a request for hearing where a petitioner's allegations raise non-frivolous issues of fact relating to jurisdiction which cannot be resolved simply on submissions of documentary evidence." <span class="Italic">Manning v. MSPB</span>, 742 F.2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus, to be entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, Briscoe bears the burden of presenting nonfrivolous allegations that the board has jurisdiction over her appeal, <span class="Italic">see Burgess v. MSPB</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1985); otherwise there is no right to a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By claiming that she lacked capacity to enter into the agreement and by claiming that she had not breached an enforceable term of the agreement, Briscoe alleged facts which, if proven, would give the board jurisdiction over her appeal. An allegation standing alone, however, is not sufficient. Although an appellant need not prove her entire case before she is entitled to a hearing, the board may request sufficient evidence to determine if, in the first instance, there is any support for what otherwise might be bald allegations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Briscoe claims she was mentally ill when she signed the agreement, but none of the documents submitted to the board support her. The only evidence she submitted covering the time frame during which she entered into the agreement was a doctor's opinion which stated that she was doing well. She now argues that this one opinion should not be dispositive of whether she had capacity to enter into the agreement. We agree that the single opinion does not necessarily resolve whether Briscoe had capacity to enter into the agreement, but the point which she does not grasp is that neither this nor any other document she submitted, supports the allegation that she lacked capacity to enter into the agreement in 1992. Thus, there is just no evidence to support her and, as a result, the board correctly concluded that her allegation was frivolous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, Briscoe maintains that she was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing because she raised the issue of compliance with the agreement. Her compliance arguments, however, are centered on provisions of the agreement which were not the basis for the board's decision....&#8197;She dealt with the violation of the leave balance provision cursorily, merely stating that "Petitioner questions the agency's allegation of noncompliance with the LCA." As with the incapacity issue, there was only an unsupported, conclusory allegation.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The board's conclusion about Briscoe's allegation that she lacked the mental capacity to subscribe to the agreement disposes of her belated argument that the agreement, and the agency's enforcement of it, violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Pub. L. No. 93-112, 87 Stat. 357 (codified as amended at 29 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 701-7976 (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993)). There was no occasion to consider accommodating a handicapping condition as required by the Rehabilitation Act. But even if there had been, she still had access to the EEOC....&#8197;Likewise, bare allegations of intimidation, coercion, and the like, in violation of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in various sections of 5 USC (1988 &#x0026; Supp. V 1993)), do not suffice to raise those issues here--especially where the allegations are belied by the active participation of Briscoe's union representative during the last chance agreement negotiations and the representative's signature on the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Briscoe argues that she was unable to properly support her allegations because the board would not allow discovery of agency practices and documents. The interrogatories which accompanied her discovery motion, however, were not directed at the threshold issues of capacity and compliance, but focused on the removal action underlying the last chance agreement. Only by pure chance might such discovery have revealed any information relevant to the jurisdictional question. She also argues that because the board did not compel discovery she "was unable to take a deposition of [her]doctor, or to call [her doctor] as a witness at a hearing to testify as a treating physician regarding her mental state in April, 1992." We do not see how the board's refusal to order discovery resulted in Briscoe's inability to provide documentation for her allegations. A discovery order is not needed for a representative to investigate his own client's case. No reason appears why Briscoe could not support her allegations from statements or affidavits from her doctors or from any other sources she might have sought out without the necessity of compelled discovery.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Ramos contends in his reply brief that he was forced to sign the Agreement, and only signed under protest. But the AJ found that Ramos willingly and voluntarily entered into the Agreement, and this finding is supported by substantial evidence. Ramos was represented by a union official while discussing the terms of the Agreement, and he acknowledged that he "underst[ood]this Agreement without reservation, duress, or coercion on the part of anyone." Ramos may have faced an unpleasant choice between signing the Agreement and contesting his August 22, 2005 proposed removal, but that does not render his choice coerced. <span class="Italic">Cf. Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("[W]here an employee is faced merely with the unpleasant alternatives of resigning or being subject to removal for cause, such limited choices do not make the resulting resignation an involuntary act.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vasquez v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 128, 132 (1994) (recognizing the Board's ability to consider whether coercion led to an LCA struck outside the course of a Board appeal, but dismissing the appeal as untimely and declining to accept representational errors as a basis for waiving that defect).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit summarized the decisions and rejected a challenge to an LCA, <span class="Italic">Camp v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 2013 NP No. 2013-3008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is settled law that a federal employee can waive the right to appeal removal in a last-chance agreement. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 160 F.3d 722, 725 (Fed. Cir. 1998). If the employee is later removed under the terms of the last-chance agreement, the Board will lack jurisdiction to review the merits of the removal. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 727. There is an exception to this rule, however. Ms. Camp can establish that her waiver of appeal is unenforceable and that the Board therefore has jurisdiction to hear her <span id="Page_1143"></span>appeal if she can show one of the following: (1) that she complied with the terms of the Last Chance Agreement; (2) that the VA breached the Agreement; or (3) that she did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the Agreement. <span class="Italic">Buchanan v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 247 F.3d 1333, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Camp has not alleged that she complied with the Last Chance Agreement or that the VA has breached the Agreement. Therefore, the only remaining question is whether Ms. Camp knowingly and voluntarily entered into the Agreement. The administrative judge found that Ms. Camp had not shown that her decision to sign the Agreement was involuntary or coerced.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described by Ms. Camp, the circumstances surrounding her decision to sign the Agreement are as follows. She claims she wanted to choose the demotion instead of signing the Agreement, but because her union representative failed to act before the deadline for selecting the demotion, she was left with no choice but to sign the Agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Unfortunately for Ms. Camp, any potential failings by her union representative leading up to her decision to sign the Agreement are not within the scope of our review on appeal. We are limited to reviewing whether, when Ms. Camp ultimately entered into the Agreement, she did so knowingly and voluntarily. Based on the record before us, we must conclude that she did.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Camp's Agreement with the VA explicitly states that she "has read and considered each of the provisions of this agreement and that she <span class="Italic">voluntarily enters into the agreement with full knowledge of the consequences</span>." This and similar provisions in the Agreement indicate that Ms. Camp did indeed sign the Agreement knowingly and voluntarily.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Of course, once the deadline for selecting a demotion had passed, Ms. Camp may have subjectively felt that she had no reasonable choice but to enter into the Agreement. However, it is not accurate to say that she had "no choice." She had two options. She could in fact sign the Agreement and return to her job in the call center to work for a year under the strict terms of the Agreement. Or she could refuse to sign the Agreement, in which case she would face immediate removal but would also have the ability to appeal her removal to the Board. Both options may have been unattractive to Ms. Camp. But as this court has previously explained, "the fact that an employee is faced with an unpleasant situation or that his choice is limited to two unattractive options does not make the employee's decision any less voluntary." <span class="Italic">Staats v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 99 F.3d 1120, 1124 (Fed. Cir. 1996); <span class="Italic">see also Rodriguez v. Dep't of State</span>, 450 Fed. Appx. 965, 967-68 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (affirming the Board's dismissal of a federal employee's appeal in circumstances similar to those of Ms. Camp). Therefore, the fact that Ms. Camp faced an unpleasant choice--the prospect of immediate removal or returning to her previous job under the strict terms of the Agreement--does not mean her decision to accept the Agreement was involuntary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, Ms. Camp has failed to show that her decision to sign the Last Chance Agreement was involuntary or coerced. Therefore, we must affirm the administrative judge's conclusions that Ms. Camp's waiver of appeal in the Agreement is enforceable and that the Board lacked jurisdiction to hear her appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The jurisdictional analysis of adverse action flowing from an LCA was again reviewed in <span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 619-20 (1996). Kimble believed the LCA was coerced because the agency could not reasonably have initiated the action leading to the LCA:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Where an employee raises a nonfrivolous factual issue that he complied with a last chance settlement agreement, the Board must resolve that issue before addressing the scope and applicability of a waiver of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Stewart v. US Postal Service</span>, 926 F.2d 1146, 1148 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Here, however, the appellant did not dispute below the agency's allegation that he breached the agreement by his conduct between December 20, 1994, and January 5, 1995, when he began drinking, did not report for duty, and was involved in an off-duty fight with other agency employees. Thus, the threshold issue in this appeal is whether his waiver of his appeal rights deprives the Board of jurisdiction over the January 18 removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The waiver was a term of the settlement agreement and the validity of that agreement therefore is at issue. The Board will consider the validity of a settlement reached before an agency action was appealed to it to determine the scope of any waiver of appeal rights. <span class="Italic">Vasquez v. US Postal Service</span>, 65 MSPR 128, 130-31 (1994). An appellant may challenge a settlement agreement if he believes that it was unlawful, involuntary, or the result of fraud or mutual mistake. <span class="Italic">Short v. US Postal Service</span>, 66 MSPR 214, 219 (1995). To establish that a settlement agreement was fraudulent as the result of coercion or duress, he must prove that he involuntarily accepted the other party's terms, that circumstances permitted no alternative, and that such circumstances were the result of the other party's coercive acts. <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 66 MSPR 691, 697, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 64 F.3d 677 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant argued that the settlement agreement was coercive because the agency knew or should have known that the first removal action resolved by the agreement would not be sustained. Insofar as this assertion is grounded on the claim that he is a disabled employee by virtue of his alcoholism, we find that any such argument is unavailing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Merriweather v. Department of Transportation</span>, 64 MSPR 365 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 56 F.3d 83 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table), the appellant entered into a last chance settlement agreement before filing an appeal with the Board regarding his proposed removal based on a charge of alcohol dependency. The agreement provided that he would be removed for failure to abide by its terms and that he waived his appeal rights to the Board. Subsequently, the agency removed him for breach of the agreement. On appeal of that action, the administrative judge issued an initial decision finding that the settlement agreement was invalid as the result of coercion because the agency should have known that the proposed removal could not be sustained, as it was based on the appellant's status as an alcoholic. The Board reversed the initial decision, though, finding that the appellant knowingly waived his right to appeal to the Board, that the agreement was not coerced, and that the record did not show that the agency knew or should have known that the removal action was based on a reason that could not be substantiated. Thus, the Board held that it lacked jurisdiction and could not address the discrimination issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Likewise, in this appeal, the appellant has not shown that the reason for his first proposed removal, the misconduct in 1993 that led to the last chance settlement agreement, could not be substantiated or that the agency did not have reasonable grounds for threatening to take an adverse action simply because of his asserted alcoholism. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merriweather</span>, 64 MSPR at 370-71. We therefore conclude that the appeal was properly dismissed on this basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sumrall v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 85 MSPR 597, 606-07 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 16-18 (2000), remanded an appeal to an AJ for further consideration of the appellant's contention that mental incapacity served to invalidate an LCA that waived appeal rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An appellant may show that the Board has jurisdiction over an action taken pursuant to a LCSA in which the appellant waived his right to appeal the action to the Board by showing that the settlement agreement was invalid. <span class="Italic">See Krzewinski v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 72 MSPR 353, 360-61 (1996). When an appellant alleges involuntariness based on emotional distress as grounds for voiding a settlement agreement, the Board will consider: whether the appellant was represented below; whether he has demonstrated that he was emotionally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement; and whether he has otherwise shown that he was unable to fully understand the nature of the settlement agreement or to assist his representative in the appeal. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 361.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant alleged that, although he was represented at the time, he could not contact his representative before he signed the LCSA. We note that the LCSA provided a space for the signature of the appellant's representative, but this space was blank. The appellant also alleged that he signed the LCSA at the insistence of his father, a manager employed by the agency. The appellant also alleged that he was emotionally impaired at the time of the settlement agreement due to alcoholism and clinical depression. There were several documents in the record before the administrative judge that provided evidentiary support for the appellant's allegation that he suffered from these illnesses. For example, documents contained in the agency's response file included a memorandum signed by the agency's substance abuse officer noting that the appellant participated in a substance abuse reorientation and treatment program in October, 1997. The file also contained a memorandum from Dr. Gerard indicating that the appellant was incapacitated for duty for particular dates in November, 1998, due to a sleeping disorder caused by anxiety and depression. Dr. Gerard also noted that the appellant was in the process of overcoming alcoholism and denial.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant's evidence of involuntariness based on mental incapacity and duress constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation of facts challenging the validity of the LCSA which, if proven, would establish that the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal<span class="Italic">. See Krzewinski</span>, 72 MSPR at 361-62. Thus, the administrative judge erred in dismissing the appellant's appeal without providing him a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Burns</span>, 67 MSPR at 288. Yet, in finding that the appellant is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, we recognize that the appellant failed to respond to the administrative judge's acknowledgment order and to her order granting the agency's motion to compel discovery. Therefore, on remand, the administrative judge may require the appellant to show cause why the evidence and argument he submitted following the dismissal of his appeal should not be disregarded on remand, and the administrative judge may also determine whether sanctions are necessary to serve the ends of justice. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">Roth v. Department of Transportation</span>, 54 MSPR 172, 175-77 (1992) (a sanction for a single failure to obey a discovery order should allow the extreme result of dismissal in Board <span id="Page_1144"></span>appeals only if the appellant's defiance of a discovery order is willful), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 988 F.2d 130 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Monzo v. Department of Transportation</span>, 17 MSPR 344, 345 (1983) (sanctions were not appropriate where illness prevented the deciding official from appearing at the hearing, and the agency representative was unaware of that fact until shortly before the hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Clede v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 72 MSPR 279, 284-86 (1996), the Board considers medical evidence (or the lack of it) and anecdotal or circumstantial evidence when an appellant seeks to avoid a waiver of appeal rights in a settlement through claimed mental incompetence:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant bore the burden of showing Board jurisdiction over the appeal by demonstrating that he lacked capacity to agree to the appeal-rights waiver, and it is sometimes appropriate for the Board to hold an evidentiary hearing in such a case. <span class="Italic">See Briscoe v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 55 F.3d 1571, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1995). In order to show that he was entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, however, the appellant needed to do more below than make bare assertions of incapacity; he had to present sufficient evidence supporting such assertions for the Board to conclude that a jurisdictional hearing was necessary. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the appellant failed to do so and that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction based on the appeal-rights waiver.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, in response to the agency's motion to dismiss, the appellant presented several documents addressing his mental condition. The only ones specifically addressing that condition at the time of the execution of the agreement, however, were his own personal statement and Dr. Simpson's December 11, 1995 note. Other than Dr. Simpson's note, then, he presented no documentary evidence corroborating his bare assertions of incapacity. Dr. Simpson's note, however, simply states that the appellant's decision-making ability was impaired on November 7, 1995, without offering any basis for this conclusion or describing the extent and nature of the impairment....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's own statements and those of the mental health professionals who treated him thus belie the bare assertions of the appellant and Dr. Simpson that he lacked capacity to agree to the appeal-rights waiver on November 7, 1995. In addition, the appellant was represented below; his representative (Mr. McKibbin) was quite active in proceedings before the agency on his proposed removal and subsequent settlement negotiations, and Mr. McKibbin signed the resulting agreement after discussing it with him. Such representation is quite significant in analyzing the validity of the appeal-rights waiver, as is the fact that the record does not show that either the appellant or Mr. McKibbin ever told the agency that he was mentally incapable of entering into a settlement agreement during their negotiations. <span class="Italic">See Merriweather</span>, 64 MSPR at 373; <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 50 MSPR at 678.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence of record also fails to show that the appellant could not fully understand the nature of the agreement. The agreement itself specified that the appellant "clearly" knew and understood that he had waived Board appeal rights from his removal by the terms of the agreement and that the agreement was not the product of duress, coercion, intimidation, or harassment. It also stated that each of the undersigned parties (which included the appellant and Mr. McKibbin) had signed the agreement after having had the opportunity to read it and raise questions about its meaning prior to signing. The appellant's own written statement and hearing testimony also indicate that he was well aware of the nature of the agreement and of the competing considerations (his desire to keep his job as opposed to the value of resigning with a clean record) involved in the decision regarding whether or not he should sign it. As noted above, moreover, the documentary medical evidence does not specifically show that the appellant could not fully understand the nature of the agreement. The record on this issue therefore weighs strongly against invalidating the appeal-rights waiver. <span class="Italic">See Merriweather</span>, 64 MSPR at 373-74; <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 50 MSPR at 678-79.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The uncontradicted evidence of record simply does not furnish a nonfrivolous showing of jurisdiction entitling the appellant to a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 60 MSPR 325, 329 (1994) (the Board may consider all undisputed record evidence in determining entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing). The paucity of evidence corroborating his assertions of incapacity on November 7, 1995; the fact that Mr. McKibbin actively represented him in the negotiations leading up to the execution of the agreement; and the evidence that Mr. McKibbin and the appellant fully understood the nature of the agreement--these factors all compel our conclusion that the appellant may not avoid enforcement of the agreement's appeal-rights waiver on grounds of emotional distress. <span class="Italic">See Merriweather</span>, 64 MSPR at 372-74; <span class="Italic">Wallace</span>, 50 MSPR at 678-79.</p>
