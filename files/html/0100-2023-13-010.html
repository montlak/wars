<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-11"><span class="space">2.</span> Promotion, Pay Increase</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The burden of proof in an appeal asserting an improper cancelation of a promotion, closely intertwined with an allegation concerning an improper reduction in pay, was explained in <span class="Italic">Deida v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 110 MSPR 408, 410-15 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2009 MSPB 8 (2009), determining that it is the agency's burden to demonstrate the propriety of the cancelation if the appellant makes nonfrivolous allegations that he was promoted and accepted the promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Firefighter (HAZMAT Technician), GS-0081-07, Step 08, at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Gulfport, Mississippi. On March 14, 2007, the agency issued vacancy announcement number DON0081-OS for several positions under GS, YL, and YN pay plans at various grades and locations. The appellant applied for and was selected for the position of Fire Protection Inspector, GS-0081-08, with a duty location at the U.S. Naval Station in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (GTMO).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the GS pay system, the appellant's selection for the position was considered a promotion, and was subject to the two-step increase method for setting pay upon promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 531.214. Following this method, upon the appellant's reassignment to GTMO on November 16, 2007, the agency promoted the appellant to the Fire Protection Inspector position as a GS-08, Step 7, and increased his basic pay from $39,146 to $42,183. The agency documented this action on a Standard Form (SF) 50, Notice of Personnel Action. The appellant then began working in his new position at GTMO under the GS pay system.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, prior to the appellant's reassignment, on November 11, 2007, the agency converted GTMO to the National Security Personnel System (NSPS).[*] On February 19, 2008, the agency discovered that some of its commands that had been converted to NSPS still had encumbered GS positions. The agency determined that the position to which the appellant had been recruited was covered by NSPS, and that, although his appointment would have been a promotion under the GS pay system, his new position and the position that he previously occupied were both assigned to the same broader pay band in NSPS. Therefore, the agency determined that the appellant had not been entitled to a promotion when he was converted to the NSPS pay system. On June 12, 2008, the agency prepared a SF-50, which cancelled his promotion to the GS-08 position, and a second SF-50, which reassigned him, effective November 16, 2007, from his former position of Firefighter (HAZMAT Technician), GS-0081-07, in Gulfport, Mississippi, to the GTMO position of Fire Protection Inspector, YL-0081-02, with a basic pay rate of $41,104. As a result, the agency determined that the appellant's basic pay previously had been set too high by the amount of $1,079 per year.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub.L. No. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1621 (2003) authorized the creation of NSPS, which was established to provide a flexible and contemporary civilian personnel system within the Department of the Defense. One major feature of NSPS is that it has replaced the artificial limitations and restrictions of the traditional federal pay and classification system of multiple grade levels with a broader pay banding structure, which allows the agency to be able to move employees more freely between positions without being bound by narrowly described work definitions. <span class="Italic">See National Security Personnel System</span>, 73 Fed. Reg. 56,344 (Sept. 26, 2008). The NSPS is codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9901 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> Further, the implementing regulation for the system is set forth at 5 C.F.R. Part 9901.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal alleging that the agency improperly cancelled his promotion and reduced his pay. He specifically asserted that the agency's action constituted harmful error, and was not in accordance with the law. He requested a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge (AJ) informed the appellant that the Board might not have jurisdiction over the appeal, and ordered the parties to file evidence and argument on the issue. The appellant responded that he had accepted and received a promotion to the GS-08 Fire Protection Inspector position from an authorized official, that he had performed in this higher grade from November 2007 until June 2008, and that he had experienced a loss of pay. The agency responded by filing a motion to dismiss, which argued that its action had been a correction of an administrative error in setting the appellant's pay at a rate that was contrary to law and regulation. Specifically, the agency contended that the appellant's appointment to the Fire Protection Inspector position, including the setting of his pay, was required to be processed under the applicable regulations as a voluntary reassignment and not as a promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the written record, the AJ dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. She found that, although it was undisputed that the promotion action had taken place, the appellant had failed to meet his burden of showing that the agency was not "merely correcting an error" when it cancelled the promotion. The AJ specifically found that the appellant did not dispute that the agency was required to convert his Fire Protection Inspection position from the GS pay system to a pay band under NSPS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has filed a petition for review. The appellant argues, among other things, that the agency properly promoted him from GS-07 to GS-08 in November 2007, he served in this position for 7 months, the agency's action in canceling his promotion constituted a reduction in pay, and the agency's action in converting him to NSPS was improper and constituted harmful error. The agency filed a response arguing that the appellant's PFR did not meet the Board's criteria for review and that the appellant was improperly attempting to shift the burden of proof to the agency to show that it reduced his pay to correct a pay rate that was contrary to law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1882"></span>The Board has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. "Grade" is defined as "a level of classification under a position classification system." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(3). In this case, it is undisputed that the appellant was not reduced in grade because a GS-07 Firefighter and a GS-08 Fire Protection Inspector are in the same NSPS pay band or level of classification. Thus, the agency's action here has not resulted in a reduction in grade. Instead, when the agency cancelled the appellant's promotion and converted his position into NSPS, the appellant experienced a loss of pay. Therefore, the issue before the Board is whether it has jurisdiction to consider the appellant's appeal as a reduction in pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Pay" is defined as "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by the employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4). The general rule is that a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). However, an exception to this rule is when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well-established that the appellant bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction over an appeal. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)]. In this type of case, an employee may make a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing entitling him to a jurisdictional hearing by establishing that the amount of his basic pay was reduced. <span class="Italic">See Vega v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 11 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, when an agency contends that it reduced the employee's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, then the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Lomax v. Department of Defense</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559-60 (1998). We have held that an employee should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his pay, since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the employee's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">Vega</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Frequently, when it is apparent from the outset that an agency's action was to correct an allegedly erroneous decision, the Board has analyzed the case under an alternative jurisdictional approach, considering whether the agency's action constituted a cancellation of a promotion or an appointment. <span class="Italic">See Marrero v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 7 (2005); <span class="Italic">Kimzey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 14 (2003).

In particular, where a promotion to a higher grade never went into effect, there was not an appealable reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For a promotion or appointment to take effect, an authorized appointing officer must take an action that reveals his awareness that he is making a promotion or appointment in the United States civil service, and the affected employee must take some action denoting acceptance. <span class="Italic">Watts v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">After reviewing our decisions in cases involving a cancellation of a promotion or an appointment, we find it necessary to clarify the parties' respective burdens of proof. The issue in such cases is identical to that involved in determining whether a reduction in grade or pay is appealable. Indeed, the origin of this jurisdictional matter is the same regulatory provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15); <span class="Italic">see also</span>,<span class="Italic"> Lovoy v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 571, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-30 (2003). Therefore, we find that, once an appellant has made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction by showing that he was appointed to a position by an authorized official, that he took some action to denote acceptance of the promotion, and that he actually performed in the position, the burden of production shifts to the agency to show that the promotion or appointment was an error contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">Lomax</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 559-60. To the extent that our prior decisions regarding the cancellation of a promotion or an appointment have indicated that the appellant bears the burden of production on this issue, they are overruled. <span class="Italic">See Shafford</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 657, &#x00B6; 8; <span class="Italic">Marrero</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Kimzey</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 457, &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Trotter v.

Because the appellant nonfrivolously alleged that he was actually promoted, that he accepted the promotion, and that it was not revoked before he performed in the position, he is entitled to a jurisdictional hearing, and we remand this appeal for that purpose. The agency must be afforded an opportunity to show that the appellant's promotion was an error contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Mulligan v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 12 (1999).

On November 16, 1994, Russell generated, but did not sign an SF-50, notification of personnel action, documenting the appellant's promotion. During the last week of November or the beginning of December 1994, Russell discovered that the appellant's promotion was the result of an administrative error.

Matters such as promotions are not appealable to the Board, <span class="Italic">see, e.g., Roush v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To obtain a jurisdictional hearing in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion, the appellant thus must raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the promotion actually occurred.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant alleged below that Vanessa Russell, the personnel officer who signed the SF-52 requesting the appellant's promotion, was authorized to approve promotions. The appellant notes that Russell is the same official who signed and approved the SF-50 cancelling her promotion. The fact that Russell had the authority to cancel her promotion, argued the appellant, demonstrated that Russell was an authorized agency official with the authority to approve her promotion. The appellant also alleged below that, two months prior to the agency's cancellation of her promotion, she had entered on duty in the GS-7 position, performed the duties of that position, and was compensated at the GS-7 level. To support this allegation, she submitted copies of position descriptions, performance appraisals, and leave and earnings statements. We find that these allegations, if proven, could establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction, and therefore the appellant made a nonfrivolous claim of jurisdiction over the alleged adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon,</span> 60 MSPR at 330.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining that the appellant's promotion had not been effected, the administrative judge considered and relied on the agency's evidence that Russell was not authorized to approve promotions. This evidence consisted of: (1) The unsworn statement of the agency's representative that an unwritten standing procedure provided that only the Chief of Administration was authorized to process or approve promotions, demotions, downgrades or removals for personnel assigned to the Park's administration branch; (2) Russell's unsworn and unsigned memorandum dated January 18, 1995, in which she stated that it was the policy in the division of Administration to obtain the Chief of Administration's approval for all personnel actions before processing; and (3) the absence of a signed SF-50 documenting the promotion. As discussed above, the appellant vigorously disputes the agency's assertions that Russell was not authorized to approve promotions. Resolution of this disputed issue requires weighing the evidence and resolution of conflicting factual assertions. The administrative judge therefore erred in considering the evidence submitted by the agency to resolve these conflicting factual assertions without affording the appellant a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Dumas</span>, 789 F.2d at 894; <span class="Italic">Ferdon</span>, 60 MSPR at 330.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following <span class="Italic">Clark</span>, <span class="Italic">Barnes v. USPS</span>, 71 MSPR 337, 338-41 (1996), resolved in the appellant's favor entitlement to a jurisdictional hearing on a set of facts that could have represented correction of an administrative error or cancelation of a promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By notice of September 20, 1995, Harry J. Rodas, Manager, Systems Integration, Purchasing and Materials, Topeka, Kansas, notified the appellant that the agency was proposing to correct an administrative error that occurred during the 1992-93 restructuring. The error led to the appellant's being carried as a Purchasing and Supply (P &#x0026; S) Systems Specialist, EAS-23, effective January 9, 1993. According to the notice, the appellant, who was a Manager, Data Preparation and Control, EAS-21, was offered and accepted a P &#x0026; S Systems Specialist, EAS-21, position in Systems Integration; however, an administrative error was made when the PS-50s were processed which led to the appellant's being placed into the EAS-23 position, and Donald Stewart, who was supposed to be placed into that position, being placed, instead, into the appellant's promised, EAS-21, position with saved grade and pay....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held, relying upon <span class="Italic">Lemon v. Department of Labor</span>, 44 MSPR 43, 46-48 (1990), that the action of correcting an employee's pay rate from a rate that is "contrary to law or regulation" to a rate that is required by law or regulation, is an action that is beyond the Board's jurisdiction. In so concluding, the administrative judge found that the appellant had not addressed the agency's assertion of administrative error. She found that the evidence showed administrative error because in evidence submitted by the agency, the appellant acknowledged in a July 25, 1995 letter that he had been offered an EAS-21 position, and that he had identified himself as an EAS-21 employee in a May 1993 application for a vacancy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the administrative judge considered the agency's argument that the appellant was "never promoted." She concluded that the appellant had failed to set forth a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction. "No explanation for the appellant's ascent into an EAS-23 position after the abolishment of his EAS-21 position has been proffered, but for the agency's claim of administrative error; and this claim is buttressed by the other affected employee, Mr. Stewart."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge erroneously relied upon <span class="Italic">Lemon</span> in dismissing this appeal. <span class="Italic">Lemon</span> involved the correction of a pay error; the erroneous setting of a within-grade step following termination of a temporary promotion. Such error resulted in pay established contrary to law and regulation and its correction was required by law and regulation. Under those circumstances, the Board held that such a pay reduction was not appealable as an adverse action<span class="Italic">. See Lemon</span>, 44 MSPR at 47-48; 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) (describing exceptions to adverse actions, including correction of a pay error).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the instant case involves a "demotion"--a change to a lower grade or a lower rate of pay--not merely a change in pay<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(4); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">also</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(3), (4). Moreover, the demotion here was discretionary with the agency, not required by law or regulation as was the within-grade step change in <span class="Italic">Lemon</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Interior</span>, 68 MSPR 453, 457 (1995), the Board set forth the test for jurisdiction in a case involving an alleged demotion after cancellation of a promotion. In order to establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion, the appellant must raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the promotion actually occurred; that is, that the promotion was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he was making the promotion, and that some action denoting acceptance of the promotion was taken. The promotion must not have been revoked prior to the appellant's performance in the higher grade<span class="Italic">. See also Watts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 484 U.S. 913 (1987).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Evidence submitted by the appellant shows that he was, in fact, assigned to an EAS-23 position and that he was, in fact, reduced-in-grade to an EAS-21 position. The promotion PS-50 appears to be an official and properly executed and signed form. While the appellant has only submitted the promotion and demotion PS-50s, and has not submitted other evidence regarding his promotion, these documents alone are sufficient to establish a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction because they show that there was a promotion, that there was an authorizing official, that the appellant accepted the promotion, and that the appellant was demoted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While, as noted above, documents submitted by the agency contain some evidence that the appellant's promotion may have resulted from administrative error, they also show that the appellant has stated that he believed that he was promoted because a promotion was promised to him and that certain personnel officials confirmed that he had been promoted. Further, he alleged that his job was different from Donald Stewart's.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the contradictory record evidence, the question of the validity of the appellant's promotion, that is, whether it was approved by an official having authority to approve it, and who was aware that he or she was granting a promotion, is a question of fact. In considering whether the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, an administrative judge may consider the agency's documentary evidence; <span id="Page_1884"></span>although to the extent that such evidence constitutes mere factual contradiction of the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction, the administrative judge may not weigh evidence and resolve conflicts<span class="Italic">.

In June 2011, the agency determined that her noncompetitive appointment to the GS-15 position was improper, and it transferred her to a GS-14-05 Budget Officer position, retroactive to the initial date of her appointment and issued her a notice of salary offset regarding the difference in salary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal. In addition to arguing that such a demotion was improper, she also argued that the agency denied her due process by failing to give her notice and the opportunity to respond.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction over the cancellation of a promotion or appointment, the appellant must show that: (1) the promotion was approved by an authorized official aware that he or she was making the promotion or appointment; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the promotion or appointment; and (3) the promotion or appointment was not revoked before the appellant performed in the position. <span class="Italic">Marrero v.

Further, it is undisputed that, by cancelling the promotion, the appellant suffered a reduction in grade and pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Deida concerned the burden of production in an appeal involving a pay-setting error and clarified that once an appellant made a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of jurisdiction the burden of production shifted to the agency to show an error contrary to law or regulation. 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 9, 15-17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction of grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512; <span class="Italic">see Kim v. Department of the Army</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 429, &#x00B6; 7 (2013) (a cancellation of an effected promotion constitutes an appealable reduction in grade). A reduction in grade or pay that is to correct a classification error or pay-setting error that is contrary to law or regulation, however, is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Trotter v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 91 M.S.P.R. 282, &#x00B6; 8 (2002), overruled on other grounds by <span class="Italic">Deida</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 16; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15) (excluding from its coverage "[r]eduction of an employee's rate of basic pay from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation"). The agency takes the position that the appeal is not within the Board's jurisdiction because its action of setting the appellant's grade at the GS-15 level was contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). We disagree; the agency's error in this circumstance does not divest the Board of jurisdiction over this appeal. The agency selected the appellant for a position that was properly graded as a GS-15 position, and the appellant performed GS-15 level work. Any error in noncompetitively promoting the appellant was in the hiring process, and the agency's action to correct such error by retroactively cancelling the appellant's promotion and placing her in a different GS-14 position is an appealable reduction in grade and pay. <span class="Italic">See Marrero</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 9. We find that the agency's action was not simply a correction of the employee's rate of basic pay within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency relies upon <span class="Italic">Gessert v. Department of the Treasury</span> to argue that the Board does not have jurisdiction over an appeal concerning an improper promotion. 113 M.S.P.R. 329 (2010), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 2010-3115, 2011 WL 463094 (Fed. Cir. Feb. 10, 2011) (nonprecedential). <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, however, is distinguishable, and we decline to follow it in this circumstance. In <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, the agency was required to follow certain regulations to noncompetitively convert Mr. Gessert, a GS-13 Budget Analyst, from the Presidential Management Fellowship program to a career or career-conditional appointment. The agency converted him to a career appointment in the same position and simultaneously promoted him to a GS-14 level in the same position. Upon discovering that it lacked the legal authority to noncompetitively promote the appellant to the GS-14 level, it returned him to the GS-13 level in the same position. The Board in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, without much discussion of jurisdiction, applied the same jurisdictional framework that it applies to an improperly granted within grade increase to find that it lacked jurisdiction because the agency was correcting an error in setting the appellant's pay.[2] 113 M.S.P.R. 329, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-9, 13 (citing <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Navy</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1997); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15)). Here, however, the agency retroactively canceled the appellant's original appointment, reduced her grade and pay, and transferred her to a different position in a different series.[3] Further, unlike in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span>, the agency did not afford the appellant notice and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The definition of "pay" is "the rate of basic pay fixed by law or administrative action for the position held by an employee." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(4); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. In Gessert, the appellant was improperly paid at a higher rate due to a promotion within the same position; to remedy this error, the agency corrected his grade and pay. The appellant otherwise remained in the same Budget Analyst position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_1885"></span>[3]&#x2003;It is worth emphasizing that the agency took these actions retroactively, effective the date of the appellant's appointment. The agency also sought the difference in pay during the time that the appellant was in the GS-15 position even though she performed the duties of her GS-15 position. Further, the appellant asserts that she lost service credit at the GS-15 level for the time that she performed in the position. These consequences far exceed a correction of a pay-setting error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the factual differences, we also decline to follow <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> because the central dispute in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> was whether the promotion itself was improper. There was little discussion concerning the jurisdictional aspect of the appeal,[4] and the Board did not consider <span class="Italic">Marrero</span> and other case law that directly applies to the jurisdictional question here. Further, the appellant in <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> received notice and an opportunity to respond to the agency's action; thus, it was not critical to distinguish the jurisdictional question--to the extent there was one--from a determination on the merits concerning the agency's action. In contrast, due to the undisputed lack of due process afforded to the appellant, the jurisdictional question is the central question in this appeal, irrespective of whether the agency properly canceled the appellant's promotion to correct a hiring error. <span class="Italic">Gessert</span> is simply not instructive on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Indeed, it does not appear that there was a dispute over jurisdiction itself; rather, the arguments concerned whether the agency's action in setting the appellant's pay was contrary to law or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Marrero</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 9; <span class="Italic">Kimzey v.

Therefore, we REVERSE the agency's action for the reasons set forth in the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Disputed facts concerning the existence of a promotion, purportedly rescinded by the agency, were sufficient to carry the appellant to a hearing in <span class="Italic">Shafford v. USPS</span>, 103 MSPR 657, 658-62 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 1, 6-12, 2006 MSPB 308 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant is a preference-eligible PS-05 Clerk at the agency's Chicago, Illinois, Cardiss Collins facility. On October 1, 2002, Selecting Official, Louis Buescher, notified the appellant that he had been selected for a promotion to the position of EAS-15 Network Specialist, effective October 5, 2002. By letter dated October 23, 2002, Transportation Networks Manager, Donald Good, notified the appellant that the October 1, 2002 letter informing him of his promotion to the EAS-15 Network Specialist position was being rescinded. The agency later explained to the appellant that his promotion had been rescinded because "the Great Lakes Area is over their EAS compliment by (185) one hundred and eighty-five supervisors." On January 22, 2003, the agency, in response to the appellant's written inquiry, informed him that "[t]here was no rescission of [his] promotion since there was never a promotion[ ]" and that the "congratulatory letter" was "sent in error and outside of the established EAS selection process." The letter further stated that "the recommendation for [his] selection was not reviewed, fully concurred with or approved by the necessary officials as required by the selection procedures." The agency subsequently selected Paulette Hanna for the position. Effective January 25, 2003, the agency detailed the appellant to work with Hanna during her "transition."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal <span id="Page_1886"></span>for lack of jurisdiction without holding the requested hearing and without reaching the timeliness issue. Specifically, she found that "the appellant failed to produce any evidence to dispute the [a]gency's claim that [he] was never promoted and that the congratulatory letter was sent in error and later rescinded." Basing her decision on the agency's January 22, 2003 letter, the administrative judge concluded that, "[t]he appellant was never officially selected for the position; the selection was not reviewed, fully concurred with or approved by the necessary officials...." Finally, the administrative judge found that "because the selection was cancelled before the appellant performed in the position, the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that the promotion to the position of Network Specialist, EAS-15, actually occurred."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant petitioned for review, again claiming that he performed in the EAS-15 Network Specialist position before it was rescinded. With his petition, the appellant attached two pages of a hearing transcript, purportedly from his July 20, 2004 EEO hearing, to prove that he worked in the EAS-15 Network Specialist position for the period claimed. The agency has not responded to the appellant's petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion or an appointment, the appellant must show that the promotion or appointment actually occurred; that is, that the promotion or appointment was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he or she was making the promotion or appointment, and that some action denoting acceptance of the promotion or appointment was taken. <span class="Italic">Marrero v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the agency's documentary evidence was dispositive, i.e., concluding that the appellant failed to present evidence to dispute the agency's January 22, 2003 letter that a promotion had not occurred and that his "selection was not reviewed, fully concurred with or approved by the necessary officials as documented in the [a]gency's letter...." At this stage, the appellant is not required to produce evidence to dispute an agency's factual assertions, but, rather, must merely raise a nonfrivolous allegation of Board jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Garcia,</span> 437 F.3d at 1344.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's claims below could be characterized as assertions that he was actually promoted to the EAS-15 Network Specialist position and that he performed in that position before his promotion was rescinded. The appellant submitted a signed letter from the selecting official that stated that he had been selected for a promotion. The appellant further claimed that two managers, including Good, the official responsible for rescinding the promotion, congratulated him on his promotion on October 5, 2002, when he reported to work in the EAS-15 position. He also asserted that three approving management officials, i.e., selecting official Buescher, approving official Good, and Plant Manager Patrick Farrell, signed the selection certificate "making it an official selection." Finally, contrary to the administrative judge's finding that "the selection was cancelled before the appellant performed in the position," the appellant plainly stated in his jurisdictional submission that he performed in the higher-graded position from October 5, 2002, until January 11, 2003, the date of Hanna's promotion.</p>

In an e-mail dated July 1, 2011, an agency human resources specialist indicated that the agency would assign the appellant to the position effective Sunday, July 3, 2011.

Where a promotion to a higher grade was not effected, however, there was not an appealable reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. For a promotion or appointment to take effect, an authorized appointing officer must take an action that reveals his awareness that he is making a promotion or appointment in the United States civil service, and the affected appointee must take some action denoting acceptance. <span class="Italic">Watts v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that, to establish jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion as a reduction in grade, the appellant must show that: (1) the promotion actually occurred; that is, it was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he or she was making the promotion; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the promotion; and (3) the promotion was not revoked before the appellant actually performed in the position. <span class="Italic">Deida</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 14. In enumerating those jurisdictional elements, the Board has cited <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 253 (D.C. Cir. 1981), for the proposition that "an appointment that has been effected may still be revoked prior to the employee's entrance on duty or performance in the higher grade." <span class="Italic">Deida</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit considered the status of a class of individuals who had received written confirmation of their selection for federal employment, but whose appointments were withdrawn in accordance with a hiring freeze ordered by the President. 663 F.2d at 242. The court held that the members of the class were appointees, but that "[a]ppointee status, by itself, does not offer class members any of the statutory protection due federal employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 246. The court therefore remanded the appeal to the district court to determine whether the appointments of particular class members had been revoked properly. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 248. The court noted, however, that 22 class members who had "inadvertently been allowed to enter onto duty in violation of the hiring freeze" and had been administered the oath of office were federal employees with statutory procedural rights. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 248 &#x0026; n.14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the court in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span> was addressing the status of appointees to federal service, it was required to consider whether class members met the definition of "employee[s]" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a). 663 F.2d at 246 &#x0026; n.10. The court held that most of the class members did not meet that definition because they were neither "engaged in the performance of a Federal function under authority of law or an Executive act," nor "subject to the supervision of an individual (authorized to make appointments to the civil service) while engaged in the performance of the duties of his position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)(2)-(3). Accordingly, the court determined that those employees were not entitled to the statutory protections provided to federal employees. <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d at 246. In the present case, however, there is no question that the appellant was, at all relevant times, a federal employee; the only question is what position and grade the appellant occupied. It is therefore not necessary for us to address the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) in this appeal.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">Rossebo v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. 447 (1984), the Board applied the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) in the context of a cancelled promotion. However, the appellant in that case was transferring to a position in another agency, and therefore the Board applied 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a) to determine which agency employed the appellant at the time of the challenged personnel action. <span class="Italic">Rossebo</span>, 20 M.S.P.R. at 448-50. No such determination is necessary in the present case, however, because the appellant was, at all relevant times, employed by the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the court in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span> held that an appointment cannot properly be revoked once the appointee has entered onto duty, we do not read the court's decision as requiring the actual performance of duties in a position in every case in order for an appointment or promotion to become irrevocable. In most cases, if an appointment or promotion has gone into effect, the employee will have entered onto duty and performed some of the duties of the position. However, in cases like the present one, where the appellant alleges that he was promoted and immediately went on annual leave, the effective date of the action precedes the date on which the appellant technically enters onto duty in the higher graded position. In such cases, we find that the effective date of the action is the point at which the promotion is no longer revocable. We therefore modify the Board's jurisdictional test as follows: To establish jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion as a reduction in grade, the appellant must show that: (1) the promotion actually occurred; that is, that it was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he or she was making the promotion; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the promotion; and (3) the promotion was not revoked before it became effective.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In some cases, such as this one, there will be an additional jurisdictional element. An "initial appointment as a supervisor" does not "become[ ] final" until the appointee completes a period of supervisory probation. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(a). The regulations implementing this statute provide that an employee "is required to serve a probationary period prescribed by the agency upon initial appointment to a supervisory...position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.904. The regulations further provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The authority to determine the length of the probationary period is delegated to the head of each agency, provided that it be of reasonable fixed duration, appropriate to the position, and uniformly applied. An agency may establish different probationary periods for different occupations or a single one for all agency employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.905. An employee who was promoted to a supervisory position and does not satisfactorily complete the supervisory probationary period "shall be returned to a position of no lower grade and pay than the position from which the individual was...promoted." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3321(b). A return to a lower-graded position under such circumstances is not appealable as a reduction in grade under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(3) &#x0026; 7513(d). <span class="Italic">Burton v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 7 (2012); <span class="Italic">DeCleene v. Department of Education</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 651, 656 (1996). Where, as here, the facts suggest that the appellant would have been a probationary supervisor at the time of the alleged reduction in grade, to establish jurisdiction the appellant must show that he was not required to serve a supervisory probationary period or that he completed such a probationary period before the reduction in grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, an agency official selected the appellant, who was in a nonsupervisory GS-14 position, for the supervisory GS-15 position, and the appellant accepted the position. Further, another agency official indicated that the agency assigned the appellant to the position effective July 3, 2011. The appellant alleges that his promotion went into effect on July 3, 2011, and that he was on annual leave for 3 weeks before the agency informed him that it was holding his promotion in abeyance. We find that those allegations, if true, are sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over the revocation of his promotion as an appealable reduction in grade, regardless of whether the appellant actually performed any duties in the higher level position, as long as the appellant was not required to serve a supervisory probationary period or completed such a probationary period before he was returned to the GS-14 position. <span class="Italic">See Marrero</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 424, &#x00B6; 9. The appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that he was not a probationer when he was allegedly returned to the GS-14 position, but he also has not been placed on notice, until now, that he must make a nonfrivolous allegation in this regard in order to get a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Burgess v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's documentary evidence appears to show that the appellant continued to be paid at the GS-14 level during the period he alleges that his promotion to the GS-15 position was in effect. That evidence, however, contradicts the appellant's otherwise adequate <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing of jurisdiction. Therefore, the agency's evidence cannot be dispositive at this stage of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ferdon</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. at 329. However, such evidence may be relevant in determining whether the appellant has established jurisdiction by preponderant evidence after a hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(2)(i) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(2)(i)(A)].</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Levy</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Kim v. Dept. of Army</span>, 119 MSPR 429, 434-35 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-11, 2013 MSPB 34 (2013), considering the jurisdictional implications of a canceled promotion:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. A cancellation of an effected promotion constitutes an appealable reduction in grade. <span class="Italic">Levy v. Department of Labor</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 6 (2012). If a promotion to a higher grade was not effected, however, there was not an appealable reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To establish jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion as a reduction in grade, the appellant must show that: (1) the promotion actually occurred; that is, it was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he or she was making the promotion; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the promotion; and (3) the promotion was not revoked before it became effective. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that an authorized official appointed the appellant to the supervisory position, and the appellant took action denoting his acceptance of the position by delaying his deployment until February 1, 2009, in an attempt to complete the promotion paperwork. We agree with the administrative judge's findings on these issues. The administrative judge, however, further found that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction over his appeal because it was undisputed that he never performed in the position before the agency cancelled his promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge issued her initial decision several months before the Board issued its decision in <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, in which the Board eliminated the jurisdictional requirement that the appellant show that he actually performed in the higher graded position before the agency revoked his promotion. <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 7. The Board explained that, "[i]n most cases, if an appointment or promotion has gone into effect, the employee will have entered onto duty and performed some of the duties of the position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 10. However, in cases like <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, in which the appellant alleged that he was promoted and immediately went on annual leave, the Board held that the effective date of the action preceded the date on which the appellant technically entered onto duty in the higher graded position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In such cases, the Board found that the effective date of the action is the point at which the promotion is no longer revocable. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we must consider whether the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his promotion took effect before the agency cancelled it. <span class="Italic">Levy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6; 10. It is undisputed that the appellant's promotion became effective in February 2009, which is before the agency issued the November 1, 2009 SF-50 cancelling his promotion. In addition, the appellant alleged that the agency demoted him to the GS-13 Electrical Engineer position and forced him to repay the $7,050.00 pay increase he received in the YF-2 Supervisory Electrical Engineer position from February 15, 2009, to November 1, 2009, when his promotion was cancelled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find those allegations, if true, typically would be sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction over the revocation of his promotion as an appealable reduction in grade, regardless of whether the appellant actually performed any duties in the higher-level position. There is, however, an exception if the appellant was required to serve a supervisory probationary period. <span class="Italic">See Levy</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 619, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12. In that case, the Board still may not have jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 282, 7 MSPB 741 (1981), represents an early but venerable case defining the Board's approach toward the jurisdictional elements of canceled promotions. The appellant appealed what he considered a demotion: he was selected for promotion from GS-9 to GS-10; a SF-52 was signed; he entered into the position and remained there for several days; then the promotion was withdrawn. A SF-50 was not issued. Reviewing court decisions, the Board observed that it is well settled that a government employee is entitled only to the rights and salary of the position held through appointment by one having proper appointment authority, and no appointment can occur without the last act required by the person or body vested with appointment power. But the last act need not be the signing of a SF-50. There is no statute or regulation making the SF-50 a legal prerequisite to appointment; the reality of federal employment is that the execution of the form is not always a practical determination. Although the SF-50 is the customary documentation for a federal personnel action, it does not constitute the personnel action itself. Nor does its absence signal with certainty that a personnel action has not occurred. In daily operation of federal personnel offices, the completion of a SF-50 or similar form is frequently accomplished after the date of the personnel action and it is often treated as a task of clerical documentation. It is more important to look at the totality of circumstances surrounding the appointment to determine if the last act of an official with appointment power has taken place. The issue is whether an official with appointing authority took, authorized, or ratified any action that reasonably could be said to have resulted in an appointment. <span class="italic">See Eakins v. Dept. of Energy,</span> SF-0752-16-0714-I-1 (NP 3/30/2023) (considering totality of circumstances and "last act" involving cancelation of promotion).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Scott</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Board determined that the personnel officer had appointment authority and approved the appellant's appointment verbally, that the appellant was in GS-10 status for four days, that the SF-52 was completed by a facility personnel office and authorized by the central personnel office, and that the normal practice of the agency was to sign the SF-50 as a clerical task subsequent to the effective date of an action. The Board concluded that the appellant was promoted and the agency was ordered to rescind cancelation of the promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bielomaz v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 276, 281 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (reciting criteria establishing the existence of a promotion or an appointment in an appeal from cancelation of a personnel action); <span class="Italic">Wenk v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 218, 221 (1984) ("It is clear that specific documentation such as a SF-52 or SF-50 is not dispositive in determining whether an appointment has been effected."); <span class="Italic">Dardis v. DOD</span>, 9 MSPR 411, 415-16 (1982) (no appointment when the appellant reported for work on the basis of a tentative agreement with another agency that the employee had reinstatement rights and when the appointing official concluded, before requesting final approval of the reinstatement, that the employee did not have reinstatement rights); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. OPM</span>, 82 MSPR 237, 245 &#x00B6; 17 (1999) ("Taking the oath of office is evidence of appointment, but it is not an invariable requirement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NTEU v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 248 &#x0026; n.14 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scott</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was followed in <span class="Italic">Dalbey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 51, 53-55 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants were employed as either Electronic Technicians, GS-9, or Equipment Specialists (Electronics), GS-9, with the Department of Navy, Maintenance Management Branch, San Diego, California. Due to the press of work, they had assumed, sometime early in 1979, duties which were later classified as duties of a GS-10 Electronics Technician. Vacancy announcements for the GS-10 positions were issued on May 7, 1979. Appellants applied for the vacancies and were orally notified of their selections on August 2, 1979. At this time, they accepted the offered positions. Initially, the effective date for the promotions was set at August 19, 1979, but later changed to August 26, 1979. Sometime before the effective date, allegations were made that the promotions were based on pre-selection. By a memorandum dated August 16, 1979, the Technical Director of the Naval Engineering Command requested the Director of the Consolidated Civilian Personnel Office to cancel the position announcements pending an investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their appeal to the Board's San Francisco Regional Office, appellants argued that the promotions had been effected and the subsequent withdrawal constituted a reduction in pay, an action appealable to the Board under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512. The agency countered that the promotions had never been effected; consequently, there was no appealable action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official adopted the standard enunciated in 45 Comp. Gen. 99 that a "promotion is effective from the time that an employee accepts the promotion and enters on duty." Applying this standard to the case, he ruled that there had been no promotions as appellants had not entered on duty. Therefore, he determined that the withdrawal of the promotions was not an action within the Board's scope of review and dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that a federal employee is entitled only to the rights and salary of the position to which he has been appointed by one having the proper authority to do so. <span class="Italic">Goutos v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 552 F.2d 922, 924, 212 Ct. Cl. 95 (1976). Furthermore, no appointment can occur in the absence of the "last act" required by the person or body vested with appointment power. <span class="Italic">See e.g. Marbury v. Madison</span>, I Cranch (5 U.S.) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803). In this regard, the Board has recently determined that rather than placing total reliance on the absence or presence of an SF-50, Notice of Personnel Action, in determining whether an appointment has been effected, it will examine the totality of circumstances surrounding the appointment to determine whether the requisite "last act" of an official with appointment power has taken place. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 741, 744, 8 MSPR 282, 287 (1981). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 246 (D.C. Cir., 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the record shows that the appointing official notified appellants of their selection on August 2, 1979 and that he considered this to be official notice of their selection. In addition, each of the selectees received procedural guidance as to the duties they were to carry out and were assigned to team leaders. Therefore, appellants were appointed to the GS-10 positions at the time they received official notice of their selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although appellants became appointees to the new positions on August 2, 1979, their appointments were capable of being revoked by the person originally authorized to make the appointment. <span class="Italic">N.T.E.U. v. Reagan</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 248. An appointment to the federal service may be revoked by the appointing official as long as the employee has not yet entered onto duty. <span class="Italic">N.T.E.U. v. Reagan, supra,</span> at 253. The issue then becomes one of whether timely revocation of appellant's appointment occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that on August 16, 1979, the Technical Director, who had appointing authority in the absence of the selecting official, instructed the personnel office to withdraw the promotions. It is undisputed that <span id="Page_1888"></span>two appellants received oral notice of this on August 20, the next work day; the third appellant was on leave at this time. Through error, written notice of the withdrawal was delayed until September 4. The presiding official concluded that regardless of the time that appellants received notice of the action, the promotions were withdrawn on August 16. We agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeals court in <span class="Italic">N.T.E.U. v. Reagan, supra,</span> at 248, n.13, noted that a properly authorized refusal to allow an employee to enter onto duty on the date previously selected would be an effective revocation of an appointment. While the testimony indicates that appellants had assumed GS-10 duties well before their promotions because of the press of work, an "entry on duty" implies some clear demarcation between one position and another, rather than a gradual accretion of duties. After August 26, 1979, the day on which the promotions would have been effective, appellants would have been performing all of their duties with official authorization, and could have been held responsible for their performance of those duties. However, appellants were informed that their promotions were being withdrawn prior to their official entry into the GS-10 positions. Accordingly, the withdrawal of the promotions did not constitute a reduction in grade, in that the promotions were properly revoked prior to entry onto duty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Scott</span> again provided guidance concerning a revoked promotion, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. INS</span>, 9 MSPR 112, 114-15 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts in the case are not in dispute. On May 1, 1980, appellant's first-level supervisor completed a Request for Personnel Action, Form DOJ-52, for appellant's promotion to a GS-9. Appellant's second level supervisor, the Assistant Regional Commissioner for Management, signified his approval by signing the Request Form and an effective date of June 29, 1980 was given for the promotion. However, the Regional Personnel Officer, the person whom the agency has contended has the authority to approve promotions, never signed the request and in fact was told by appellant's second level supervisor to withdraw the request on June 6, 1980. The record also shows that the Regional Personnel Officer directed the Supervisory Personnel Management Specialist to withdraw the request on June 9 and to take no further action in regard to processing it. However, the form was not withdrawn from the processing clerk until July 2, 1980. The basis for the withdrawal was the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) evaluation that appellant was not performing the duties of her current grade, GS-7. Appellant never argued that she was performing the duties of the higher grade, but contended that the execution of the request form by her second level supervisor effected the promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official, after examining the pertinent agency regulations, determined that the party with final authority to approve a promotion was the Regional Personnel Officer. According to the evidence presented, this person had taken no action to effect the promotion. Further, appellant introduced no evidence, such as her performance of GS-9 duties, to show that she had begun to function at this higher level. In addition, she did not introduce any evidence to show error in the presiding official's determination that the person with approval authority was the Regional Personnel Officer or that this person had done anything to effect appellant's promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Scott</span>...we decided that execution of the forms evidencing a promotion were not always necessary for a personnel action to be effective, but that the "totality of the circumstances" surrounding the action would be determinative of the effectiveness of the action. Thus, the absence of the Regional Personnel Officer's signature on the Form 52 would not necessarily establish that the promotion had not taken place. However, the lack of the Regional Personnel Officer's signature coupled with the other circumstances surrounding the action support the presiding official's decision that appellant's promotion to the GS-9 position was not effected since the last act had not occurred. However, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that appellant's appointment had been perfected, it was properly revoked before she entered on duty....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Scott,</span> the employee is not promoted and an adverse action does not result from the cancelation of the promotion if the appointment is revoked before the employee enters on duty in the new position, <span class="Italic">Furneyhough v. Dept. of Army</span>, 9 MSPR 132, 133-34 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In March 1979, the Department of Army began recruiting for the position of fire chief, GS-8, at Fort Monroe, Virginia. Appellant, then a GS-6, was one of three candidates referred to the selecting official. In May 1979, appellant was selected as the best candidate for the position of fire chief. Subsequent to the selection process, it was learned that appellant's wife was the secretary of the selecting official. Consequently, the Commander at Fort Monroe ordered a review of the entire selection process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The review concluded that some factors used in the selection were not proper and that another candidate was at least as well qualified for the position as appellant. The Commanding Officer, as appointing authority, decided to appoint another candidate. On June 18, appellant was notified of the cancellation of his selection and the appointment of the other candidate. A Standard Form 52, Request for Personnel Action, had been prepared for appellant and initialed by the Civilian Personnel Adviser sometime around June 1. The Commander, however, had not signed it. Neither had an SF-50, Notice of Personnel Action, been completed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for appeal, appellant alleged that he was promoted to the position of fire chief and that the agency's failure to employ him was a demotion. The presiding official found that appellant had never been promoted and that the revocation of the selection was not a demotion. Consequently, he concluded that the Board lacked jurisdiction to consider the appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that an appointment to the federal service is effected only when the last act required of the person or body vested with the appointing authority has been performed. <span class="Italic">Marbury</span> <span class="Italic">v. Madison,</span> 5 U.S. (I Cranch) 137, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1801); <span class="Italic">National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 245 (D.C. Cir., 1981). Moreover, the Board has recently determined that the execution of an SF-52 or SF-50 is not a prerequisite to a valid appointment, and that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the appointment must be examined to determine whether the required "last act" has taken place. <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy,</span> 7 MSPB 741, 744, 8 MSPR 282, 287 (1981). After reviewing the evidence in the record, we find that this "last act" occurred when appellant was notified of his selection, since this notification was authorized by the person with selecting authority. Thus, the presiding official erred in finding that appellant had never been appointed to the GS-8 position. However, for the reasons set out below, we agree with the presiding official's conclusion that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider appellant's case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The finding that appellant was an appointee does not establish his right to relief. It still must be determined whether his appointment was capable of being revoked and, if so, whether it was actually revoked.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appointee remains appointed until his appointment is properly revoked. However, an appointment cannot be revoked once an individual is allowed to enter onto duty. <span class="Italic">N.T.E.U. v. Reagan,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 253. The record here shows that appellant had not entered onto duty or performed in the GS-8 position at the time of the withdrawal of his selection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only one authorized to revoke an appointment is the one authorized to make it. <span class="Italic">N.T.E.U. v. Reagan, supra,</span> at 247. The Commanding Officer, as the agency official authorized to make appointments, also had the authority to revoke appointments. Our review of the record shows that appellant's appointment was properly revoked prior to his entering into the GS-8 position. Accordingly, the withdrawal of the appointment to the GS-8 position cannot be considered a reduction in grade and appellant's case does not involve an appealable action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A complex set of facts led to a determination that a promotion occurred in <span class="Italic">McGovern v. EEOC</span>, 28 MSPR 689, 695 (1985). The opinion placed particular emphasis on the agency delegation of authority to promote employees at the appellant's grade level. When the Board considered all the evidence, not only the personnel documents, it determined that the appellant was promoted. In another appeal, reduction of his grade without adverse action procedures was harmful procedural error. A SF-50 was not controlling as to a promotion that occurred through the entry of a wrong figure into a computer. The SF-50 was not signed by an individual authorized to approve promotions; it was signed only by someone who essentially certified that it conformed to the SF-52 (apparently also printed in error). The promotion, once discovered, was canceled and, once canceled, was not within the Board's jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">White v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 590, 592-94 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Scott v. Department of the Navy</span>, 7 MSPB 741, 8 MSPR 282, 287 (1981), the Board made it clear that, in determining whether an appointment or promotion took place, the totality of the circumstances must be considered. In this regard, one of the dispositive issues to be considered is whether the official with the appropriate authority took, authorized, or ratified any action which reasonably could be said to have resulted in an appointment or promotion<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In the instant case, appellant's change in grade and pay was never approved or ratified by an authorized agency official. Therefore, the agency's administrative error inadvertently giving appellant GS-07 level pay did not constitute a valid promotion, and the agency's subsequent correction of appellant's grade and pay downward to the level to which he was duly entitled was not an adverse personnel action under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512(3) and (4) which could then be appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant has argued throughout this appeal that this case is indistinguishable from the facts and holding of <span class="Italic">Miller v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States,</span> 717 F.2d 109 (3d Cir. 1983). We disagree. In <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, the employee received a Veterans Readjustment Appointment and was subsequently found to have been technically ineligible for the appointment. Although the agency removed the employee, it treated the matter not as an action appealable to the Board, but as an administrative correction of an error made prior to the employee's appointment. Because the employee was a preference eligible in the excepted service who had completed one year of current continuous service in the same or similar position (and had <span id="Page_1889"></span>therefore satisfied the statutory definition of "employee" under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)), the court held that his removal constituted an appealable action requiring the agency to follow the applicable adverse action procedures in order to correct the error. Appellant also relies on a Federal Circuit decision (<span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister,</span> 724 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1983)[2]), as well as two Board cases (<span class="Italic">Scott</span>, 8 MSPR at 287, and <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education</span>, 18 MSPR 127 (1983), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 23 MSPR 417 (1984)[3]), to support his contention that the agency's action is appealable to the Board. However, as we find that all of these cases are factually distinct from the instant case, they fail to provide support for appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Sutermeister,</span> the court held that a nonprobationary employee who obtained his position through material misrepresentation was entitled to the same procedural safeguards and review as any other employee subject to an adverse action. However, in <span class="Italic">Sutermeister,</span> as in the other cases inappropriately relied upon by appellant as support for his position, the employee in question was intentionally appointed to his position by an agency official authorized to make such an appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Appellant asserts that, even though the action in this case was based on an administrative error, appropriate agency officials authorized or ratified the action when they signed the SF-52 and SF-50 forms related to the reassignment. Appellant claims that <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> states that the agency was therefore required to give him the applicable adverse action procedures before correcting its error, unless he had committed fraud or an absolute statutory prohibition prevented him from holding the position. Since neither of these exceptions apply to his situation, appellant argues that the matter falls within the Board's jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the cited cases also involved actions founded on mistakes and/or misinformation, it is clear that the agency officials vested with the appropriate authority in each of those cases relied upon the incorrect information as though it were correct and fully intended either to appoint or to promote the individuals in question. The situation in this case is quite different in that the official authorized to act did not approve or ratify appellant's change in grade and pay. Moreover, the administrative error which occurred was not even considered or relied upon by the authorized official at the time that he initiated appellant's lateral reassignment. Neither the clerk who committed the actual error or the agency official who subsequently signed the incorrectly recorded action had the authority either to approve or to ratify the action. Further, it is evident that the staffing specialist who did have such authority did not approve or later ratify a change in appellant's grade or pay.[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although acceding that the staffing specialist did not intend to appoint him to the GS-7 level, appellant nevertheless contends that the administrative judge placed too much emphasis on this fact in his initial decision. We find this contention to be unfounded, as an unintentional change in grade and pay cannot be said to result in an appointment or promotion under any circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Scott,</span> 8 MSPR at 287.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Seward v. Dept. of Army,</span> CH-0752-11-0291-I-1 (NP 1/31/2012), applied various tests to the cancelation of a promotion. Jurisdiction was wanting because the appellant did not take the steps necessary officially to report for duty:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that the administrative judge erred in dismissing her appeal for lack of jurisdiction. To establish Board jurisdiction in an appeal from the cancellation of a promotion, the appellant must show that: (1) the promotion actually occurred; that is, that it was approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he was making the promotion; (2) the appellant took some action denoting acceptance of the promotion; and (3) the promotion was not revoked before the appellant actually performed in the position. <span class="Italic">See Hoever v. Department of the Navy,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 7 (2011); <span class="Italic">Deida v. Department of the Navy,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6; 14 (2009). There is no appealable reduction in grade or pay if a promotion to a higher grade never went into effect. <span class="Italic">See Hoever,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 487, &#x00B6; 7. The appellant must make a nonfrivolous allegation of each of the jurisdictional elements in order to obtain a jurisdictional hearing. <span class="Italic">See Deida,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 408, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-15; <span class="Italic">Clark v. Department of the Interior,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. 453, 457 (1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation that a promotion had occurred because the "last act" required to effect a promotion was military approval, which the appellant did not have. The appellant argues that, although the promotion required a verification of her Army Reserve status, the paperwork itself was not a necessary final act to effect the promotion. Indeed, she argued and submitted evidence below that she received an offer of a promotion, accepted the offer, and received travel authorization and an entry on duty date. She further submitted a sworn affidavit stating that she believed the Army Reserve verification was simply a paperwork issue and that she had verified her reserve status with the agency. It is not disputed that Army Reserve membership was a requirement of the position. It is not clear, however, to what extent the paperwork verifying her reserve status was necessary for the promotion to take place and whether it was a necessary "last act" to effect the promotion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Scott v. Department of the Navy,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 282, 286-87 (1981). Thus, we find that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that she was offered a promotion by an authorized appointing official and that she accepted the promotion.[2] <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Clark,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. at 458.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We find that <span class="Italic">Hoever v. Department of the Navy,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 487 (2011), is distinguishable from the instant appeal. In Hoever, the administrative judge held a hearing and the record was fully developed on the requirements necessary to effect the promotion. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-5, 10-18. The record revealed that the necessary last act--proper determination and authorization of the rate of pay--had not occurred before the offer was prematurely conveyed to the appellant; thus, a promotion to the higher salary was not approved by an authorized appointing official aware that he was making the promotion. <span class="Italic">Id.,</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-12, 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find, however, that the appellant has not made a nonfrivolous allegation that she entered on duty or began performing the functions of her position prior to the cancellation of the promotion. First, the appellant's own submissions demonstrate that the agency took steps to cancel the promotion on January 12 and 13, before the appellant traveled to Illinois on January 14 to begin her new position. Although she alleges that she did not receive notice that the promotion was canceled prior to reporting to the job site on January 18, 2011, it is apparent that the agency canceled her promotion prior to that time. <span class="Italic">See Dalbey v. Department of the Navy,</span> 9 M.S.P.R. 51, 54 (1981) (finding that the promotions were withdrawn on the date that the appointing official instructed that they be withdrawn, which was at least 4 days prior to the date the appellants received notification of the withdrawal).[3] Furthermore, her documents reflect that she was aware that she did not have the requisite transfer request completed, yet she traveled to Illinois on January 14, 2011, regardless. Her documents also reflect that such travel was without the supervision or approval of her supervisor, who had canceled the promotion on January 12, 2011. <span class="Italic">See Hope v. Department of the Army,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 5 (2008) (citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2105(a)); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Rossebo v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 20 M.S.P.R. 447, 450 (1984). Thus, we find unpersuasive her argument that she began performing in her higher-graded position when she traveled to Illinois. The appellant also acknowledges that she did not perform any duties in the position upon arrival and that she received instructions to return to Fort Lee shortly after she reported to the new job site on January 18, 2011. Thus, although she physically appeared at the job site, she did not enter on duty or begin performing in her higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">See Bilodeau v. American Battle Monuments Commission,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 243, 250-51 (1988) (rejecting the appellant's argument that his appearance at the job site constituted an entry on duty), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 895 F.2d 1420 (Fed. Cir. 1990). For these reasons, we find that the administrative judge properly dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing. <span class="Italic">See Clark,</span> 68 M.S.P.R. at 457.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pfaff v. Defense Investigative Service,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 633 (1985), upon which the appellant relies for the proposition that the cancellation did not occur until she received notice of it on January 18, 2011, is distinguishable from the instant appeal. There, the Board remanded for a jurisdictional hearing because, in part, the <span class="Italic">only</span> evidence of the cancellation of the promotion was the notice that the appellant received 3 days after the effective date of his promotion and after he began performing in the higher-graded position. <span class="Italic">Pfaff,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. at 636. In contrast, here the appellant's own documents demonstrate that the agency canceled the promotion prior to her departure to Illinois on January 14, 2011. Further, as we discuss, the appellant's travel to and appearance at the job site does not constitute performance in the higher-graded position.</p>

Appellant was transferred on September 22, 1985, to a GM-13 job to serve as the understudy of a GM-14 Chief who was retiring on February 21, 1986. The appellant was informed in early February by the activity director that he should immediately assume the duties of chief. On February 6, the deputy director signed a SF-52 for the Director, promoting the appellant to the GM-14 chief position on February 23. The appellant was provided a position description on February 6. But then sometime around February 19-21, the director orally requested that the SF-52 be returned to him from the agency personnel office; he had changed his mind. Appellant first learned of the withdrawal of the SF-52 on March 5, 1986. The Board concluded the appellant had no case:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Spagnola v.

The employee sought back pay for his performance of duties at the higher-grade level. Noting that the Court of Claims consistently held that neither the Back Pay Act nor any other statute authorized back pay for an employee unlawfully detailed to a higher position to which he had been detailed but not appointed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Testan, supra,</span> and a long and unbroken line of Court of Claims decisions hold that an employee cannot be paid for a position to which he has not been appointed or promoted unless such an appointment (or promotion) is mandated or required by law.

It held that the criteria defining the term "employee" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2105(a) are applicable to one seeking to claim creditable service for retirement under the CSRA. Finding that the contract employees were not entitled to such service credit, the court noted that under binding precedents,' "a significant degree of formality in the appointment process" is required, "usually in the form of an executed SF-50 or 52, to effectuate a federal appointment." <span class="Italic">See Acosta</span> at 692-93.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Watts v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed. Cir. 1987), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 108 S.

Ed.2d 216 (1987), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit similarly rejected a former employee's claim for credit under the CSRA for service performed with proprietary corporations of the Central Intelligence Agency. Noting that the totality of circumstances test could not be relied on to demonstrate an intention to appoint Watts to the civil service, the court held that the essential prerequisites of an appointment are "an authorized appointing officer who takes an action that reveals his awareness he is making an appointment in the United States civil service, and action by the appointee denoting acceptance." <span class="Italic">See id.</span>[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Our review of decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor, the Court of Claims, indicates that no distinction in the requirements for appointment is made in these courts between an original appointment to the Federal civil service, as in <span class="Italic">Acosta and Watts,</span> and an appointment of a Federal employee to a higher grade, as in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For instance, <span class="Italic">Goutos v. United States,</span> 212 Ct. Cl. 95, 552 F.2d 922 (1976), cited in <span class="Italic">Acosta,</span> involved the claimed promotion of a Federal employee who had been detailed to a higher position. There, the Court of Claims found that there was no appointment to the higher position because the CPO, the appointing official, had not executed the SF-52, which, in the facts of the case, was "the <span class="Italic">sine qua</span> <span class="Italic">non</span> to plaintiff's appointment," since it was the last act required by the person or body vested with the appointment power<span class="Italic">. See id.,</span> 552 F.2d at 924-25. The court noted that the CPO indicated his intention not to promote the appellant by resisting repeated requests by the recommending officer to sign the SF-52<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> at 924.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Acosta</span> that an executed SF-50 or 52 as an appointive document and the administration of an oath of office are the usual indicia of civil service status<span class="Italic">. See Acosta,</span> 803 F.2d at 694. However, as found by the court in <span class="Italic">Watts,</span> and as in the instant case, those are not the only indicia of appointment<span class="Italic">. See Watts,</span> 814 F.2d 1580<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">also Spagnola v. Stockman,</span> 732 F.2d 908, 912 (1984) (a Federal employee who was illegally detailed to a higher grade was not entitled to recover the pay for his performance in the higher-level position because he cited no documents that could constitute an appointment and did not claim that he was told that he was appointed to the higher grade).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, a promotion or appointment may be revoked only by one authorized to make it and must be revoked before the appellant enters on duty or performs in the position. <span class="Italic">See National</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan,</span> 663 F.2d 239, 253 (D.C. Cir. 1981), and <span class="Italic">Furneyhough v. Department of the Navy,</span> 8 MSPB 479, 9 MSPR 132, 134 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these criteria to the instant case, the record shows that the Deputy Director signed the appellant's SF-52 on February 6, 1986, after the meeting at which the Director ordered the appellant to assume the duties of Chief immediately. The agency does not claim that the Deputy Director was not authorized to execute the form. However, the proposed effective date of the action is listed in the SF-52 as February 23, 1986. There is nothing in the record to indicate that a duly authorized appointing officer intended that a date other than February 23, 1986, was to be the effective date of the appointment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the promotion became effective when the agency failed to prevent his entering on duty by notifying him that the promotion was withdrawn. We disagree. The record shows that he could not have been appointed to the position before February 23, 1986, because it was encumbered by the former chief who did not retire until February 22, 1986. About February 19, 20, or 21, 1986, the Director orally requested the personnel office to return the SF-52 to him, and it was returned in the inter-office mail on either February 21 (Friday) or February 24 (Monday). The Director did not notify the appellant of his revocation action, and the appellant did not in fact learn about it until March 5, 1986.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it might have been more appropriate for the agency to have notified the appellant of the withdrawal of the SF-52 sooner, its failure to do so could not be the basis for finding an effective appointment. <span class="Italic">See Watts,</span> 814 F.2d at 1580. Moreover, the record fails to show that the results in this case were in any way affected by the agency's failure to notify the appellant earlier. Therefore, we find no harmful procedural error in this regard. <span class="Italic">See Baracco v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Transportation,</span> 15 MSPR 112, 123 (1983) (reversal of an action is warranted only where procedural error, whether regulatory or statutory, likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied sub nom. Schapansky v. Department of Transportation,</span> 469 U.S. 1018, 105 S. Ct. 432, 83 L. Ed.2d 358 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, because the agency revoked the appellant's promotion before it became effective, the administrative judge correctly dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, <span class="Italic">Hazlett v. DOD</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3477), remanded the appeal, determining that the withdrawal of a signed SF-52 does not, in itself, operate to cancel an appointment to a position that an employee has already entered, on request of the agency, through a geographical reassignment. All the circumstances must be considered. The subsequent history of <span class="Italic">Hazlett</span> before the Board is not reported. But courts may be more stringent than the Board in determining when a promotion action takes place to define whether a downgrading occurs after the promotion is canceled. One post-Reform Act case placed considerable reliance on the issuance of a SF-50. <span class="Italic">Latimer v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 657 F.2d 235 (8th Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another factually-specific case provided some guidance concerning the analysis of appeals from canceled promotions, <span class="Italic">Brock v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 564, 566-69 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A person is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he has been duly appointed to it, even though he may have performed the duties of another position or claims that he should have been placed in a higher grade. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 402, 96 S. Ct. 948, 955, 47 L. Ed.2d 114 (1976); <span class="Italic">Spagnola v. Stockman</span>, 732 F.2d 908, 910-12 (Fed. Cir. 1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and its predecessor, the Court of Claims, a significant degree of formality is required to effectuate a federal appointment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 692-93 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Although this is usually in the form of an executed Standard Form [SF] 50 or 52, the two essential prerequisites of an appointment are an authorized appointing officer who takes an action that reveals his awareness that he is making an appointment in the United States civil service, and action by the appointee denoting acceptance. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Watts v. OPM</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. den.</span>, 484 U.S. 913, 108 S. Ct. 258, 98 L. Ed.2d 216 (1987). Moreover, a promotion or appointment may be revoked only by one authorized to make it and must be revoked before the appellant enters on duty or performs in the position. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d 239, 253 (D.C. Cir. 1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying these criteria to the present case, the record shows that, when told by the agency staffing specialist on July 18, 1986, of her selection for the promotion, the appellant asked when it would become effective. The staffing specialist replied that he would check with the selecting official, and shortly thereafter, he returned to the telephone and said the promotion would become effective on July 20, 1986. The administrative judge stated that, although both the staffing specialist and the selecting official testified at the hearing, neither could recall the conversation. However, the record shows that the staffing specialist testified that on July 18 he telephoned the appellant to notify her of her selection for the GS-11 position and to ask her if she would accept or decline. He stated that she accepted the promotion and then "talked about the release date, or starting date, which was to be Sunday, July 20, as I recall." The staffing specialist also testified that the paperwork for preparing the SF-50 and SF-52 would usually be prepared within a day or two of the effective date.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes an unexecuted SF-52 that contains the signature of the placement technician who prepared the form and the date she <span id="Page_1891"></span>completed it, July 22, 1986. July 20, 1986, is listed in Block 14 of the form as the effective date of the promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record further shows that the Civilian Personnel Officer (CPO), the person assigned appointing authority, testified that, although an agency regulation required that the SF-50 be prepared on or before the effective date of the action, occasionally the SF-50 and SF-52 would be prepared after the effective date of the appointment. Indeed, when questioned by the agency's representative, the CPO testified that it was necessary to not follow the regulations on occasion to avoid holding "the promotion back for another two weeks." Moreover, an internal agency audit of civilian personnel management at Camp Butler Marine Corps Base was critical of the failure by the civilian personnel office to use the SF-52 "to document approval of personnel actions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The selecting official, who was also the appellant's second-level supervisor, testified that he considered the appellant to be working as a GS-11 on Monday, July 21, 1986, although she had been working at that grade-level, but paid as a GS-9, for several months before her promotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record thus supports the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's appointment to the GS-11 position was effective on July 20, 1986, because she was appointed by an authorized appointing officer who took the promotion action with an awareness that he was appointing the appellant to the GS-11 position, and she noted her acceptance of the promotion. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Watts</span>, 814 F.2d at 1580 (essential prerequisites of an appointment are an authorized appointing officer who takes an action that reveals his awareness he is making an appointment in the United States civil service and action by the appointee denoting acceptance). To the extent that the administrative judge erred in relying upon the totality of circumstances test to find that the appellant was appointed to the GS-11 position, we find no harmful error because the appointment was also effective under the test applied in <span class="Italic">Watts</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the appellant did not enter on duty as a GS-11 Auditor prior to the revocation of the promotion because there was no clear demarcation between the appellant's duties which she performed as a GS-9 and those she performed after July 20, 1986. It contends that the Board has required such a demarcation and has refused to find that a gradual accretion of duties constitutes an entry on duty, citing <span class="Italic">Dalbey v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPB 412, 9 MSPR 51, 54 (1981). However, in <span class="Italic">Dalbey</span>, the Board found that, even though the appellants had assumed the duties of the higher-grade position long before the promotions were to become effective, they were informed prior to their official entry date that the promotions were being withdrawn. The Board noted that after the date on which the promotions would have been effective, "appellants would have been performing all of their duties with official authorization, and could have been held responsible for their performance of those duties." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the effective date was set by the appointing authority for July 20, 1986, the beginning of the pay period immediately after the July 18 selection. Although the appellant's duties when she reported for work on Monday, July 21, did not noticeably change, the administrative judge found that the only difference between the duties of the GS-9 Auditor and GS-11 Auditor was in the incremental growth in responsibility, and both the appellant and her second-level supervisor considered her to be working at the higher grade on that day. We find, therefore, that the record supports the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant entered on duty on July 21, 1986, and performed in the position to which she had been appointed and the appointment could not thereafter be revoked. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Reagan</span>, 663 F.2d at 253 (an appointment cannot be revoked after the employee enters on duty).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency admits that it did not provide the appellant with the procedural safeguards under 5 USC 7513, but it argues that, since its investigative procedures constituted constructive compliance with the statutory requirements, it committed no harmful error. This same argument was rejected by the administrative judge who found that, although the appellant was interviewed during the agency's investigation into various charges of alleged improprieties by the members of the rating panel, preselection of the appellant for the promotion, and the appellant's access to the rating criteria, the investigation failed to provide the appellant with any significant part of the procedural rights required under 5 USC 7513(b). He found that the appellant was not made aware of the exact nature of the charges against her and was not afforded an opportunity to reply to the charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that we need not examine the agency's further allegations concerning harmful procedural error because we agree with the administrative judge's factual finding in this regard. In a recent case, <span class="Italic">Stephen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 47 MSPR 672 (1991), the Board held that, when an appealable action against a nonprobationary Federal employee has not been effected in accordance with the minimum requirements of due process of law under <span class="Italic">Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill</span>, 470 U.S. 532, 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L. Ed.2d 494 (1985), that is, prior notice and an opportunity to present a response, the action must be reversed because it cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stephen</span>, 47 MSPR at 680, 684. Accordingly, the agency's action cannot stand, irrespective of the agency's arguments on the lack of harm caused by the procedure.</p>

Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, even in situations where it might appear that the Board has been given jurisdiction over a particular matter by law, rule, or regulation, an exception might exist that would preclude the Board from exercising jurisdiction over the matter<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Todd v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 55 F.3d 1574, 1577-78 (Fed.

For example, the Board generally finds that an individual who shows that he was otherwise entitled to adverse action procedures does not lose that protection merely because the agency's action was based on an unlawful appointment, but the Board has recognized an exception to this rule where the appointment was made in violation of an absolute statutory prohibition so that the appointee was not qualified for appointment in the civil service<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 417, 419 (1984). In addition, although the Board may generally exercise jurisdiction over a reduction in pay when the agency takes such an action against an individual who is an "employee" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), the OPM regulations implementing chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, provide that 5 C.F.R. part 752, subpart D, does not apply to the reduction of an employee's rate of basic pay from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). In accordance with this regulation, the Board has determined that such actions are not appealable<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Lomax v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In its petition for review, the agency argues that the appellants' appointments as special experts violated the OPM regulations that preclude agencies from using 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 to appoint experts or consultants to perform managerial or supervisory work or to perform work performed by the agency's regular employees<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge specifically found nothing in either 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 or 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 285a-2(b)(5) which operated as an absolute statutory bar to the appellants' appointments as special experts. However, when the Board originally adopted the rule that an individual otherwise entitled to adverse action procedures does not lose that protection merely because of an unlawful appointment unless the appointment was made in violation of an absolute statutory bar, one of the bases for that rule was the presumption that OPM had certified the appointee as eligible for the appointment<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Travaglini v. Department of Education</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 127, 132-138 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd as modified on recons.</span>, 23 M.S.P.R. 417 (1984).

<p class="Block-Quote2">[A] mistake in certification by an appointing officer of a Federal <span id="Page_1892"></span>department or agency will not ordinarily validate an otherwise unlawful appointment which OPM has not certified, even after the appointment has been offered and accepted without any fraud, misrepresentation or concealment of a material matter by the appointee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Travaglini</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. at 138 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 282(d)(1) and 285a-2(b)(5) authorize the directors of NIH and NCI to appoint experts or consultants in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109, and appointments made under this section are made "without regard to (1) the provisions of [title 5] governing appointment in the competitive service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109(b)(1). Thus, positions filled in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109, such as the appointment of experts and consultants pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 282(d)(1) and 285a-2(b)(5), are in the excepted service<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(l) (positions requiring the temporary or intermittent employment of professional, scientific, or technical experts for consultation purposes fall within Schedule A of the excepted service); <span class="Italic">Briggs v.

Briggs</span>, 83 F.3d 1384 (Fed. Cir. 1996). The OPM regulations applicable to positions in the excepted service provide as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Office of Personnel Management will decide whether the duties and requirements of <span class="Italic">any particular position</span> justify exception from the competitive service. Upon favorable determination, OPM will authorize the position to be filled by excepted appointment under Schedule A, B, or C. Unless otherwise specified in a particular appointing authority, an agency may make Schedule A, B, or C appointments on either a permanent or nonpermanent basis, with any appropriate work schedule (i.e., full-time, part-time, seasonal, on-call, or intermittent).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.102(a) (emphasis added). In this case, there is no indication in the record that OPM determined that the particular positions to which the appellants were assigned as special experts justified exception from the competitive service, nor that OPM authorized the agency to fill these positions under the excepted schedules. Accordingly, the extent to which the rule announced in <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> should apply in this case is an open question.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, although the administrative judge found that the parties failed to identify an absolute statutory bar that precluded the appellants' appointments, the administrative judge did not determine whether these appointments violated the OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109. Although the appellants argue that these regulations did not apply to limit the agency's authority to appoint the appellants as special experts pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 282(d)(1) and 285a-2(b)(5), the appellants have not provided a basis for finding that the OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109, other than those regulations related to the period of service, should not apply to the appointments at issue in these appeals. Each of the title 42 sections which authorized the appointments at issue in these appeals specifically stated that the directors could obtain the services of experts or consultants "in accordance with section 3109 of Title 5," with the only exception being the limitation in &#x00A7; 3109 regarding the limitation on the period of service. Standing alone, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 is not an appointment authority; rather, by its own terms it applies to services procured "[w]hen authorized by an appropriation or other statute." In addition, while we recognize that 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 282(d)(1) and 285a-2(b)(5) were both in existence prior to 1992 when Congress amended 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 to specifically authorize OPM to issue substantive regulations implementing that section, the appellants have pointed to no authority to support the proposition that Congress did not intend the regulations to apply to appointments made after the amendment but pursuant to appropriations or other statutes that pre-dated the 1992 amendment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, even if the "illegal appointment" rule announced in <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> applies to these appeals, the Board has not limited the application of this rule solely to statutory violations. In <span class="Italic">Daneshpayeh v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 672, 682 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 17 F.3d 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), the Board applied the rule to find that it lacked jurisdiction over an appeal in which the appellant was removed from a position for which he did not qualify under the provisions of a treaty. The treaty provided that citizens who were "ordinarily resident" in the host country could not be part of the "civilian component" employed by the United States in the host country. Although the Board cited the <span class="Italic">Travaglini</span> rule, it noted that an Article II treaty ratified by the United States Senate has the force and effect of a statutory enactment<span class="Italic">. Daneshpayeh</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 676. In addition, although the Board did not find that the appellant was not qualified for an appointment to any position in the civil service, it determined that he was appointed to the position from which he was removed in violation of the treaty, and it relied on this determination to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's termination from this position<span class="Italic">. Daneshpayeh</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. at 676, 682. Thus, the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Daneshpayeh</span>, which was affirmed by the Federal Circuit, is relevant to these appeals for two reasons: (1) it established that the Board does not have jurisdiction over an appointment that was prohibited by a law that has the "force and effect of a statutory enactment"; and (2) it established that the relevant question is not whether there was an absolute prohibition which rendered the appellant unqualified for any appointment in the civil service, but whether there was an absolute prohibition which rendered the appellant unqualified for appointment to the particular position in the civil service.</p>

Ed. 2d 208 (1979), the U.S. Supreme Court discussed the situations in which agency-issued regulations have the "force and effect of law." Under the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> test, agency regulations have the force and effect of law when they prescribe substantive, as opposed to interpretive, rules, and they are promulgated pursuant to a specific statutory grant of authority and conform with any procedural requirements imposed by Congress<span class="Italic">. Chrysler Corporation</span>, 441 U.S. at 301-303; <span class="Italic">see also Horner v. Jeffrey</span>, 823 F.2d 1521, 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We find that the OPM regulations at issue in these appeals have the force and effect of law. As set forth above in the background section, the 1992 amendment to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 authorized OPM to issue regulations necessary for the administration of this section, including regulations setting forth the circumstances in which it is appropriate to employ an expert or consultant under the provisions of this section<span class="Italic">. See</span> &#x00B6; 5, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. OPM promulgated the regulations at issue in accordance with the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553, and the regulations OPM implemented had substantive legal effect by limiting the discretion of agency officials with regard to the appropriate use of experts and consultants appointed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109. Thus, the regulations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 304.103 meet both requirements under the <span class="Italic">Chrysler</span> test, i.e., they prescribe substantive rules, and they were promulgated pursuant to a specific grant of authority in conformance with the procedural requirements imposed by Congress<span class="Italic">. See Chrysler Corp</span>., 441 U.S. at 303 (the pertinent procedural limitations on agency rulemaking are those found in the APA). Accordingly, while the limitations set forth at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 304.103(b) on the use of experts and consultants appointed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109 may not constitute statutory prohibitions, these regulations have the force and effect of law, and, to the extent that they operated to prohibit the agency from appointing the appellants to the particular positions they occupied as special experts, the Board may lack jurisdiction to consider actions that result from an agency's cancellation of appointments made in violation of these regulations<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Atchison, Topeka, &#x0026; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Scarlett</span>, 300 U.S. 471, 474, 57 S. Ct. 541, 543, 81 L. Ed. 748 (1937) (a regulation promulgated by an agency pursuant to statutory authority has the same force as though prescribed by the statute). We note, however, that the administrative judge did not determine whether the appointments at issue in these appeals, in fact, violated the OPM regulations implementing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3109.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gessert v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 113 MSPR 329, 330-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2010 MSPB 41 (2010), provided technical analysis of a technical topic--authority for promotion of an individual who completes an appointment in the Presidential Management Fellows program:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The relevant facts in this appeal are not in dispute. On September 4, 2005, the agency appointed the appellant to the position of Marketing Specialist, GS-12, through the Presidential Management Fellows (PMF) program. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 213.3102(j)(1)(ii). The appellant was appointed to the excepted service for a period not to exceed 2 years. Upon completion of the internship, the appellant would either be terminated or noncompetitively converted to a career or career-conditional appointment. Effective March 19, 2006, the agency promoted the appellant to the GS-13 level, the full performance level for his position. Effective December 10, 2006, the agency reassigned the appellant from his Marketing Specialist position to a Business Analyst position at the GS-13 level, the full performance level for that position. Effective September 4, 2007, upon completion of the 2-year internship, the agency converted the appellant to a career appointment in the Business Analyst position. Simultaneously, the agency promoted the appellant to the GS-14 level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 12, 2008, the agency proposed the appellant's demotion from his GS-14 Business Analyst position to his prior position of Marketing Specialist, GS-13. The basis for the proposed demotion was that the agency lacked the legal authority to noncompetitively promote the appellant to the GS-14 level. After the appellant responded in writing to the proposed demotion, the agency rescinded its proposal on July 17, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the same day that it rescinded its proposed demotion of the appellant, the agency proposed correcting the allegedly improper promotion. The agency indicated that the appellant had been promoted to the GS-14 level due to an administrative error and without legal authority. The appellant responded in writing to the proposed correction of his <span id="Page_1893"></span>promotion. On October 22, 2008, the agency issued a decision correcting the appellant's promotion and returning him to a GS-13 Business Analyst position. That action was effective November 9, 2008.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal challenging the agency's action on December 7, 2008. He requested a hearing. He alleged that the agency committed harmful procedural error and that its action was not in accordance with law....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In an initial decision issued on August 11, 2009, the administrative judge reversed the agency's action. Initially, she found that the appellant had established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of Board jurisdiction over his appeal concerning the cancellation of a promotion by establishing that (1) his promotion actually occurred; (2) he took some action indicating acceptance of the promotion; and (3) the promotion was not revoked before he actually performed in the position at issue. She then found that the agency failed to establish that the promotion was contrary to law or regulation, and that the Board therefore had jurisdiction over the appeal. Because the basis for the agency's action was that it lacked legal authority to promote the appellant noncompetitively, the administrative judge found that the action had to be reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has filed a timely petition for review of the initial decision. The agency argues that the administrative judge misinterpreted 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i), and that she failed to harmonize that provision with another regulatory provision, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.204. The agency also argues that the administrative judge misinterpreted written guidance from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The appellant has responded in opposition to the petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction to review an appeal of a reduction in grade or pay. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. The general rule is that a reduction in an employee's rate of basic pay is appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(4), 7512(4), 7513(d). However, an exception to this rule is when an agency reduces an employee's basic pay "from a rate that is contrary to law or regulation." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15). Such an action is not appealable to the Board. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also</span> <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Navy,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 251, 254 (1997); <span class="Italic">Warren v. Department of Transportation,</span> 19 M.S.P.R. 560, 565 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency contends that it reduced an employee's pay to correct what it believes was an error in setting pay, then the agency bears the burden of showing that it set the employee's pay at a rate contrary to law or regulation. <span class="Italic">See Lomax v. Department of Defense,</span> 78 M.S.P.R. 553, 559-60 (1998). The Board has held that an employee should not be forced to prove that the agency did not make an error in setting his pay, since the agency is in a much better position to know why it originally set the employee's pay as it did and what later led it to conclude that it made an error. <span class="Italic">Vega v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 221, &#x00B6; 11 (2008).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In claiming that it lacked the authority to promote the appellant to the GS-14 level noncompetitively, the agency cited 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 362.204(d)(1), which states, "A Fellow may be promoted up to the GS-13 level or its equivalent." The agency also cited OPM's written guidance relating to the PMF program, which states in relevant part that Fellows cannot be promoted to a higher grade level than the career ladder of their position supports, and that promotions after completion of the fellowship are to be dependent upon a number of factors, including the career ladder and full performance level of the employee's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, although OPM regulations generally require that promotions be made pursuant to a merit promotion program using competitive procedures, agencies have the discretion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i) to noncompetitively promote an employee appointed into the competitive service by noncompetitive conversion or noncompetitive appointment. She determined that the discretion granted under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i) permitted the appellant's noncompetitive promotion to the GS-14 level, and that the promotion was therefore not contrary to law or regulation. The agency disputes the administrative judge's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i). That provision permits agencies to except from competitive procedures</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a] promotion without current competition of an employee who was appointed in the competitive [service] from a civil service register, by direct hire, by noncompetitive appointment or noncompetitive conversion, or under competitive promotion procedures for an assignment intended to prepare the employee for the position being filled (the intent must be made a matter of record and career ladders must be documented in the promotion plan).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The agency argues that the regulation permits an agency to noncompetitively promote a competitive service employee appointed through any of the listed methods only if the employee was appointed into an assignment intended to prepare the employee for the position being filled. The administrative judge found that the regulation permits noncompetitive promotion of any employee who was appointed to the competitive service by noncompetitive conversion or noncompetitive appointment. In effect, the administrative judge interpreted the condition "for an assignment intended to prepare the employee for the position being filled (the intent must be made a matter of record and career ladders must be documented in the promotion plan)" contained in the regulation as applying only to employees appointed in the competitive service under competitive promotion procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency's interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i). As the agency correctly notes, the administrative judge's interpretation of that provision gives agencies broad authority to noncompetitively promote any employee who was appointed in the competitive service "from a civil service register, by direct hire, by noncompetitive appointment or [by] noncompetitive conversion." Interpreted in that manner, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i) would constitute a significant exception to the general requirement that promotions be subject to competitive procedures. We find that the better interpretation is the one proposed by the agency, which would grant agencies the discretion to noncompetitively promote an employee appointed in the competitive service through any of the listed methods "for an assignment intended to prepare the employee for the position being filled...." Such a limited exception would permit employing agencies to noncompetitively promote a competitive service employee into a position for which the employee was being prepared while preserving the general rule that competitive procedures be used in promotions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the agency that its proposed interpretation of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i) is consistent with OPM's written guidance concerning the PMF program. That guidance states in relevant part,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Promotions on or after conversion to the competitive service are dependent upon the agency's merit promotion plan, the position's career ladder and full performance level, the employee's time-in-grade, and his/her performance. While there is no presumption of promotion on or after conversion or appointment to a permanent position, Fellows who meet agency requirements for the next grade level may be non-competitively promoted within their career ladders at the successful completion of the Program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, Presidential Management Fellows Program Guide for Agencies 46 (2005). <a href="https://www.pmf.opm.gov/Documents/GuideForAgencies.pdf">https://www.pmf.opm.gov/Documents/GuideForAgencies.pdf</a> [now at <a href="http://www.pmf.gov/media/970/agencyguide.pdf">http://www.pmf.gov/media/970/agencyguide.pdf</a>]. Consistent with that guidance, an agency could noncompetitively promote an employee upon completion of the PMF program, but only in accordance with established agency policies and procedures. However, an agency would not be authorized to noncompetitively promote an employee upon completion of the PMF program beyond the intent documented in the program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore conclude that the agency did not have the discretion under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(c)(3)(i), or any other law or regulation, to noncompetitively promote the appellant to the GS-14 level. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's promotion was an error contrary to law or regulation and that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the agency's action correcting that error. <span class="Italic">Hall,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. at 254; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.401(b)(15).</p>
