<h3 class="h3" id="sec1-405"><span class="space">G.</span> REMEDIES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Remedies directed by the Board in suitability appeals concerning applicants for jobs are generally prospective, e.g., the applicant's name is restored to an eligibility roster. When the Board hears an appeal under 5 CFR 731.501 and reverses a negative suitability determination of an applicant, and when there has not been an appointment to a position, the proper remedy is to order the agency both to cancel the unsuitability rating and to return the applicant to the eligibility list for employment. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 635, 637 &#x00B6; 7 (2002); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Prehoda v. DHS,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 311, 313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP) (Board need not, when it directs cancelation of a negative suitability determination, order immediate placement, front pay, or other damages for or to the applicant); <span class="Italic">Petrecz v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 21, 23 (1987) (noting the usual remedy of placement of an appellant on the list of eligibles; priority consideration is appropriate if the appellant is not properly restored to the eligibility list). If the agency again rejects the applicant, e.g., based on new information available to the agency, the applicant may again appeal). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SCOTT_JAMES_A_CH_0731_09_0578_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_602157.pdf">116 MSPR 356</a>, 359-65 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-20, 2011 MSPB 50 (2011) (reconsid. den., <span class="Italic">Scott v. OPM</span>, 117 MSPR 467, 2012 MSPB 25 (2012)) (retroactive remedy when OPM lacked the authority to initiate a suitability action based on post-appointment conduct; the case is discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-08-105.html#sec1-104">Post-Appointment Conduct</a>"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Aguzie v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dow v. OPM</span>, 95 MSPR 355, 362-64 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (2003), summarized the Board's remedial authority in suitability appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board reverses a negative suitability determination, and there has not been an appointment to a position, the proper remedy is to order the agency to both cancel the unsuitability rating and return the affected applicant to all appropriate eligibility lists for employment. <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of Justice</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 635 &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Lewis v. General Services Administration</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 120, 123 (1992)). This is the relief the administrative judge ordered in the initial decision which became the Board's final decision when the Board denied the appellant's petition for review<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.113(b) (the initial decision becomes final if the Board denies all petitions for review).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, because an agency exercises discretion in appointment to a position, when the Board orders relief concerning an agency action that resulted in an applicant being denied consideration for a position, the Board generally orders only prospective relief<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Petrecz v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 33 M.S.P.R. 21, 23 (1987) (where the Board reversed OPM's negative suitability determination, the appropriate remedy was to give the appellant priority consideration for future vacancies for a period of 30 months); <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. I.N.S.,</span> 28 M.S.P.R. 566, 568-69 (1985) (upon reversing the agency's negative suitability determination, it is not an appropriate remedy to order the agency to place the appellant in the position he would have obtained but for the unsuitability rating); <span class="Italic">cf. Vesser v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. 282, 285 (1994) (where an applicant has been denied consideration for a position due to the application of an invalid employment practice, the Board's authority is limited to ordering OPM to afford the appellant appropriate relief by placing him in the position where he may again be considered for appointment to a vacant position); <span class="Italic">Baxter v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 125, 133 (1990) (the remedy commensurate <span id="Page_791"></span>with the denial of proper consideration for a position is some form of priority for future vacancies). In other words, the Board does not generally order the agency to provide the relief to which the appellant in this case claims entitlement under the final Board order, that is, to reopen the certificate, reconstruct the hiring process, and retroactively appoint the appellant to the position with back pay.[2] <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. General Services Administration,</span> 54 M.S.P.R. 120, 123 (1992) (because appointment to a position is at the discretion of the employing agency, the Board found that it erred in requiring the agency to retroactively place or appoint the appellant to a position after the Board reversed the agency's negative suitability determination; the Board is without authority to order back pay and benefits to an appellant who was never appointed to a position). In this case, OPM presented evidence to establish that the BPSC finished with the certificate and returned it and the original applications of the candidates not selected for appointment to the WSC on July 26, 2000. The appellant has not alleged that this certificate was re-issued or was otherwise used by OPM after it was returned to the WSC. Thus, while we have determined that the OPM's decision to sustain FIPC's objection to the appellant's certification for the investigator position constituted an appealable constructive suitability determination, we find no basis on which to order the agency to reopen this certificate and restore the appellant's name to it. Therefore, we find that the agency's refusal to restore the appellant's name to the March 28, 2000 certificate of eligibles did not constitute a failure to comply with the Board's final order in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;Although there have been several cases in which the Board has ordered an agency to reconstruct a selection process or to retroactively appoint an appellant, these cases have generally involved either the enforcement of settlement agreements, in which the agencies agreed to provide the appellants with some form of priority consideration, or a finding that the agency committed a prohibited personnel practice in denying the applicant meaningful consideration for a position. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Army,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 268, 273-74 (1996) (settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Myers v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Agriculture,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 312, 318 (1986) (settlement agreement in which the agency agreed to give the appellant "strong consideration" for a position); <span class="Italic">Bartel v. Federal Aviation Administration,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 560, 562 (1984) (the Board ordered the agency to reconstruct the selection process after finding that the agency denied the appellant meaningful consideration for a position in reprisal for his previous exercise of protected appeal rights). In the instant case, the Board did not find that OPM denied the appellant consideration as the result of a prohibited personnel practice, and the appellant's petition for enforcement was not based on OPM's alleged violation of a settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Dow</span> added that OPM is not required to expunge its investigation file if its suitability determination is reversed by the Board, and it may refer information from its files to agencies that are considering the appellant for positions other than the position that was the subject of the Board suitability ruling, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at &#x00B6; 15:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the administrative judge's recommendation, we find that OPM was not required to expunge the information which supported its constructive suitability determination from its investigation files or to withhold such information from other agencies considering the appellant for employment. The Board's underlying decision in this case merely concluded that the agency failed to sustain its reasons for finding the appellant unsuitable for the particular investigator position for which he was certified as eligible on the March 28, 2000 certificate. Yet, as the Board noted in <span class="Italic">Edwards,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 518 &#x00B6; 11, the OPM regulations allow for position-specific negative suitability determinations based on a finding that an individual's conduct or character may interfere with efficient service in the particular position for which the appellant applied or is employed. Thus, the fact that the Board overturned OPM's negative suitability determination with respect to a particular position does not necessarily rule out the possibility that the same facts might support a negative suitability determination with respect to another position. Therefore, in a case such as this, where the Board overturns a position-specific negative suitability determination, a Board order requiring OPM to cancel the negative suitability determination might preclude OPM from relying on the same facts to find the appellant unsuitable for future vacancies in the same position, <span class="Italic">see Kroeger v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 865 F.2d 235, 239 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, is appropriate when (1) an issue is identical to that involved in the prior action, (2) the issue was actually litigated in the prior action, (3) the determination on the issue in the prior action was necessary to the resulting judgment, and (4) the party precluded was fully represented in the prior action), but it does not preclude OPM from maintaining and transmitting information regarding its investigation of the appellant to agencies that may be considering the appellant for other positions. The appellant has not alleged that the INS position for which he applied was the same position for which OPM found him unsuitable, and the documentation the appellant submitted with his petition for enforcement indicates that the INS position was classified in a different occupational series than the OPM investigator position for which OPM found the appellant unsuitable. Accordingly, the Board finds that the final order in this case did not preclude the agency from providing information to the INS regarding its prior investigation of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board does not have authority to award back pay to an individual who is improperly deemed unsuitable for a job that he would have otherwise received. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Vesser v. OPM</span>, 65 MSPR 282, 285 (1994); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. GSA</span>, 54 MSPR 120, 123 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsidering</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v.

Moreover, the Board has determined that it is without authority under the Back Pay Act...to order backpay and benefits to an applicant for employment."). Under <span class="Italic">Lewis</span>, 54 MSPR at 122-23:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to be appointed to a position in the United States civil service, an authorized appointing officer must formally and unequivocally act to appoint that individual<span class="Italic">. See Watts v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 814 F.2d 1576, 1580 (Fed. Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 484 U.S. 913 (1987); <span class="Italic">Horner v. Acosta</span>, 803 F.2d 687, 692 (Fed. Cir. 1986). Although the Board has broad power to enforce compliance with its orders under <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732-33 (Fed. Cir. 1984), the Board can restore a Federal employee to his or her position only if he or she was duly appointed to it<span class="Italic">. See United States v. Testan</span>, 424 U.S. 392, 402 (1976) (one is not entitled to the benefit of a position until he or she has been duly appointed to it). When the Board reverses a negative suitability determination, and there has not been an appointment to that position, the proper remedy is to order the agency both to cancel the unsuitability rating and to return the affected applicant to the eligibility list for employment<span class="Italic">. See Lehman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 40 MSPR 286, 291 (1989); <span class="Italic">Petrecz v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 33 MSPR 21, 23 (1987); <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 28 MSPR 566, 568 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although in this case the appellant was tentatively selected for the FPO position, the actual appointment to this Federal government position required that the appellant meet the conditions that he have a security clearance and a medical examination. Our review of the record reveals that the appellant has not met either of these conditions, and thus, his tentative selection did not amount to an appointment. Therefore, because appointment to a position is at the discretion of the agency, the Board erred in requiring the agency to retroactively place or appoint the appellant to the FPO position<span class="Italic">. See Petrecz</span>, 33 MSPR at 23; <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span>, 28 MSPR at 569. However, the Board was correct to order the agency to cancel the appellant's negative suitability determination, and we find it appropriate in this case for the appellant to be placed on a list of eligibles for the FPO position<span class="Italic">. See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Board is without authority under the Back Pay Act, 5 USC 5596, to order back pay and benefits to an applicant for employment<span class="Italic">. See Schaefer</span>, 28 MSPR at 569. Under the Back Pay Act, only "employees" or "former employees" are entitled to back pay and benefits as a remedy for improper personnel actions<span class="Italic">. See</span> 5 USC 5596; 5 CFR 550.803. The appellant in this case, who was never appointed to the FPO position, was an applicant for employment and was not an employee as defined by 5 USC 2105. Therefore the Board had no authority to award back pay, interest and benefits to appellant pursuant to our reversal of the negative suitability determination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Prehoda v. DHS,</span> 157 Fed. Appx. 311, 313-14 (Fed. Cir. 2005 NP), concluded that the Board need not, when it directs cancelation of a negative suitability determination, order immediate placement, front pay, or other damages for or to the applicant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the Board reverses a negative suitability determination, the appropriate remedy is "to order the agency both to cancel the unsuitability rating and to return the affected applicant to the eligibility list for employment." <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv.</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 566, 568 (1985); <span class="Italic">see also Dow v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 355, 362 (2003). Here, the Board ordered DHS to "cancel the constructive suitability determination and return the appellant to all appropriate open eligibility lists for employment." Thus, the Board ordered the appropriate remedy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Prehoda, however, seeks "immediate reinstatement" as well as "back pay and such benefits as [he] would have enjoyed had he never been separated." It is unclear whether Mr. Prehoda is asking to be returned to the position from which he resigned in 1998 or is seeking a new appointment to the position of Central Adjudications Officer. If it is the former, Mr. Prehoda is not entitled to relief because his resignation in 1998 is not at issue here. Following his involuntary resignation hearing, the Board rejected his claim that his resignation was involuntary, and Mr. Prehoda did not appeal the Board's decision. The correctness of that ruling is therefore not at issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Mr. Prehoda is seeking to be placed in the position with DHS for which he subsequently applied, that remedy would be beyond <span id="Page_792"></span>the scope of the Board's authority. Reversal of a negative suitability determination "entitles appellant to be returned to the eligibility list, but appointment to a position is at the discretion of the agency." <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. at 569. Consequently, Mr. Prehoda is not entitled to an order requiring DHS to appoint him to the position of Center Adjudications Officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, Mr. Prehoda requests front pay until he reaches age 65. The Board has thus far declined to address whether it has "authority to order 'front pay' or other alternative remedies." <span class="Italic">Garrison v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 389, 394 n.* (2001). Nonetheless, front pay has generally been limited to those situations in which reinstatement would be ineffective. <span class="Italic">See Lewis v. Federal Prison Indus.</span>, 953 F.2d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir. 1992). Moreover, front pay is considered a "special remedy, warranted only by egregious circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1281. There has been no showing of egregious circumstances surrounding the nonselection here, and thus Mr. Prehoda is not entitled to front pay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Prehoda also seeks monetary damages as compensation for "mental anguish, humiliation, [and] pain and suffering." To find the government liable for an award of monetary damages, there must be a waiver of sovereign immunity that "extend[s] unambiguously to such monetary claims." <span class="Italic">Hubbard v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 205 F.3d 1315, 1318 (Fed. Cir. 2000). This court has held that the Board's statutory authority to order corrective action "to remedy a prohibited personnel practice [does] not constitute a waiver of sovereign immunity" with respect to claims for monetary damages, and that the Board accordingly lacks authority to grant such relief. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1317.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Prehoda argues that compensatory or consequential damages are available under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.204, and he cites <span class="Italic">Zinno v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 290 (1998), for support. <span class="Italic">Zinno</span>, however, explains that the "Board's authority to award compensatory or consequential damages is limited to cases involving claims of prohibited discrimination or reprisal for whistleblowing." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 296 n.8. Although Mr. Prehoda alleges that reprisal for whistleblowing led to his resignation in 1998 and has caused his professional reputation "to be tarnished and defamed by the Agency's representative in this instant case," the Board did not base its decision on the suitability determination issue on those grounds. An award of monetary damages in this case is therefore beyond the Board's authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Prehoda seeks punitive damages. There is, however, no basis under any law or regulation for an award of punitive damages in cases before the Board. <span class="Italic">Frier v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 327, 329 (2003). Mr. Prehoda is therefore not entitled to punitive damages. Because Mr. Prehoda has not shown that he was entitled to any of the relief he seeks in this appeal, we affirm the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Petrecz v. OPM</span>, 33 MSPR 21, 22-23 (1987), evaluated an enforcement petition asserting that OPM failed to comply with a Board order in a suitability case. Because OPM caused the compliance problem, OPM was directed to provide the remedy of priority consideration:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is before the Board on the issue of compliance pursuant to finding of the Board's Chief Administrative Judge (CAJ) in the Philadelphia Regional Office that the agency was not in compliance with the Board's November 14, 1984 decision. In that decision, the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) determination that appellant was unsuited for a Park Technician position with the National Park Service was reversed. OPM was ordered to cancel the negative suitability determination and restore appellant to all appropriate registers. Although OPM submitted evidence of compliance with the Board's decision in December of 1984, appellant was never contacted concerning any job openings for almost two years.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant sent a letter to the Board, which was treated as a petition for enforcement, questioning why he had not been notified of vacancies since technician-type personnel had been hired in at least one Federal park in the Philadelphia area during the time he was to have been restored to eligibility for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM responded to the petition for enforcement, admitting that its records had not been corrected to comply with the Board's decision reversing the negative suitability determination, with the result that appellant's name had not ever appeared on a list of eligibles. A computer printout was submitted to show that appellant's records were now clear and he was restored to eligibility. In response to this documentation, appellant inquired as to how he could be certain his name will now be referred when, in particular, the National Park Service begins hiring again.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 6, 1986, the CAJ found that the agency, while now in compliance with the Board's decision, was not in compliance for a significant period of time. Because the agency's belated compliance did not make appellant whole for the more than 18 months that his name did not appear on a list of eligibles, the CAJ fashioned a remedy to overcome the effect of the agency's past period of noncompliance. Thus, OPM was ordered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">to give appellant priority consideration for any subsequent requests for Park Technician applicants in the geographic area in which appellant's name is available for referral. Further, the agency is to extend appellant's eligibility for a period of 18 months past that date when it might otherwise expire.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents an issue of first impression to the Board. Generally when a negative suitability determination is reversed, OPM is ordered to place the appellant on a list of eligibles, as was ordered here. <span class="Italic">Mervar v. OPM</span>, 1 MSPB 298, 1 MSPR 309 (1980). However, OPM failed to place appellant's name on an eligibility list for almost two years. Appellant complains that positions have been filled with the National Park Service for which he should have been considered without his being notified. The National Park Service, however, is not the agency which was in non-compliance with the Board's decision; it was OPM. Because an agency exercises discretion in appointment to a position and the National Park Service was not the agency which erred, the Board cannot order the Park Service to hire appellant. <span class="Italic">See Schaefer v. INS</span>, 28 MSPR 566 (1985). Concomitantly, OPM is not the agency with which appellant is seeking a position. Therefore, the remedy crafted by the CAJ which gives appellant priority consideration for 30 months is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts</span>, 726 F.2d 730, 732-33 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (Board has broad power to enforce compliance with its orders).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's concern about how he will know whether OPM has complied with the Board's decision is legitimate. The parties are reminded that, under the Board's regulations, the agency is obligated to communicate promptly with appellant and appellant is to cooperate with the agency concerning compliance. 51 Fed. Reg. 25,164 (1986) (to be codified at 5 CFR 1201.181(b)). If appellant believes that the agency has not complied with this Board order, he may file a petition for enforcement with the Philadelphia Regional Office in accordance with 5 CFR 1201.182.</p>
