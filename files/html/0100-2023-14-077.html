<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-78"><span id="page_670"></span><span class="space">3.</span> Workload Management; Equalization</h4>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not negotiable that precluded the employer from assigning new cases to an employee whose workload was unmanageable. The proposal assigned a condition to management's right to assign work: that the employee's workload be manageable. The preclusion in assignment authority applied irrespective of the agency's immediate needs or its statutory or regulatory requirements. <span class="Italic">NTEU and Dept. of Treasury, IRS</span>, 6 FLRA 508, 518 (1981) (Proposal V); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA Dist. Office, New Bedford</span>, 54 FLRA 1327, 1331-33 (1998) (Proposal 1, for adjustment of adjudication and interviewing workloads of claims representatives, was nonnegotiable infringement on right to assign work; not appropriate arrangement because union failed to show what adverse effects would likely flow from modification of existing mix of interview and adjudication responsibilities), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1164 and SSA, Lawrence, Mass.</span>, 55 FLRA 999, 1002 (1999) (Proposal 2, mandating redistribution of work among claims representatives, was nonnegotiable for lack of connection with effects of management's changes in assignment practices); <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2079 and USDA, Forest Serv., Umpqua Nat'l Forest</span>, 49 FLRA 396, 398-99 (1994) (nonnegotiable Proposals 1 and 7: precluding management from changing schedules of teachers following reassignment of one instructor; proposal interfered with right to assign work; it did not constitute appropriate arrangement: it imposed blanket prohibition on any change in work assignments of remaining teachers). Without an arrangements claim, even a proposal for work assignments to be made at the beginning of a day was a nonnegotiable infringement on the right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1655 and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau, Alexandria</span>, 49 FLRA 874, 880-82 (1994) (Provision 5).</p>
<p class="noindent">Workload management was at the core of the negotiability dispute in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1367 and Dept. of Air Force, Lackland AFB</span>, 64 FLRA 869, 869 (2010), involving two proposals concerning housekeepers:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the maximum amount possible, the parties agree that Housekeepers, working seven hours a day, will not be required to clean or service more than the reasonable amount of rooms according to the standards in the [Air Force Instruction (AFI)] 34-246.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the maximum extent possible, the parties agree that Housekeepers will be assigned a reasonable amount of rooms to be accomplished in a given seven hour shift without foregoing designated breaks or lunch periods.</p>
<p class="noindent">Both proposals presented appropriate arrangements, 64 FLRA at 870-72:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...As the Union did not respond to the Agency's assertions that Proposals 1 and 2 affect management's right to assign work, the Union concedes the proposals affect that right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Union's claim that Proposals 1 and 2 are appropriate arrangements, the Authority analyzes that claim under the framework set out in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this framework, the Authority first determines whether a proposal is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 58 FLRA 616, 617 (2003). To establish that a proposal is an arrangement, a union must identify the effects or reasonably foreseeable effects that flow from the exercise of management's rights and demonstrate how those effects are adverse. <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31.</p>

In this connection, the Authority has held "that proposals 'intended to eliminate the possibility of an adverse effect, may constitute appropriate arrangements negotiable under [&#x00A7;] 7106(b)(3).'" <span class="Italic">AFGE, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 64 FLRA 728, 730 (2010) (Member Beck concurring) (<span class="Italic">Prison Locals</span>) (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA 176, 191 (1994)). "Prophylactic" proposals will be found sufficiently tailored in situations where it is not possible to determine reliably which employees will be adversely affected by an agency action so as to draft a proposal to apply only to those employees. 64 FLRA at 730<span class="Italic">. See also NTEU, Chapter 243</span>, 49 FLRA at 194 (Member Armendariz dissenting in relevant part) (proposal sufficiently tailored if it "targets a group of employees that is likely to be harmed by the exercise of a management right and seeks to address, compensate for, or prevent the actual or anticipated adverse effects of the exercise of the management right or rights on those employees"). Further, "[a]n arrangement need not 'target in advance the very individual employees who will be adversely affected.'" <span class="Italic">Prison Locals</span>, 64 FLRA at 730 (quoting <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Minerals Mgmt.

<p class="noindent-1">If the proposal is an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether the arrangement is appropriate or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with management's rights. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local</span>, 55 FLRA at 1001. In making this determination, the Authority balances the proposal's benefits to employees against its burdens on management. <span class="Italic">See NTEU</span>, 62 FLRA 267, 272 (2007) (Chairman Cabaniss dissenting in part).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposals 1 and 2 would require the Agency to follow the guidelines set forth in AFI 34-246 when determining how much work to assign housekeepers. Proposals 1 and 2 would thus mitigate the adverse effects--alleged in the housekeepers' statements and not disputed by the Agency--including employee stress, exhaustion, and an increased risk of workplace accidents that are reasonably foreseeable results of the Agency assigning more work than indicated under the AFI 34-246 guidelines.[6] In addition, as it is not possible to determine reliably which housekeepers will be adversely affected, Proposals 1 and 2 are prophylactic proposals that are sufficiently tailored to benefit those housekeepers who experience those adverse affects. <span class="Italic">See Prison Locals</span>, 64 FLRA at 730. Further, the Authority has found that a proposal that sought to mitigate employee fatigue and work-related injury that results from such fatigue constituted an arrangement. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3157</span>, 44 FLRA 1570, 1596-97 (1992). Consistent with the foregoing, we find that Proposals 1 and 2 are arrangements.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Even assuming that the Agency <span class="Italic">currently </span>is complying with AFI 34-246, that does not mean that the Union is precluded from bargaining over appropriate arrangements to apply in the event that, <span class="Italic">in the future</span>, management fails to comply with AFI 34-246 and/or requests or requires housekeepers to forego breaks or lunch periods. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Minerals Mgmt. Serv., New Orleans, La., v. FLRA</span>, 969 F.2d 1158, 1162-63 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (court rejected interpretation of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) that "use of the past tense in the phrase 'adversely affected' creates a temporal wall forbidding any negotiability except as to harm that has already occurred"). Further, even assuming that, as the dissent claims, there are existing statutory protections for affected employees, it is well established that "[p]roposals that require an agency to exercise its management's rights in accordance with applicable laws are within the duty to bargain." <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R1-203</span>, 55 FLRA 1081, 1086 (1999) (Chairman Segal concurring).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the arrangements are appropriate, the Union asserts that Proposals 1 and 2 would provide several benefits to housekeepers, including a decreased amount of stress and exhaustion, and a reduced risk of workplace accidents. In support of these assertions, the Union submits housekeeper statements that indicate that housekeepers suffer work-related stress and exhaustion.[7] By contrast, the Agency asserts only that "none of the eight proposals are appropriate arrangements under [FLRA] case law[,]" without providing any arguments that apply specifically to Proposals 1 and 2, any explanation as to <span class="Italic">why </span>Proposals 1 and 2 are not appropriate arrangements, or any explanation as to <span class="Italic">how </span>the proposals would burden management rights. Weighing the demonstrated benefits to employees against the absence of asserted or demonstrated burdens on the right to assign work, we find that Proposals 1 and 2 are appropriate arrangements under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;With regard to Proposal 2, one housekeeper's statement indicates that at least one housekeeper has found it necessary to work through a lunch period, and another housekeeper's statement indicates that employees have had to work off the clock in order to finish their work assignments. As such, it is reasonably foreseeable that, depending on the number of rooms assigned, some housekeepers may find it necessary to forego designated lunch periods and breaks in order to complete their work. We note, in this regard, that although one housekeeper statement indicates that a supervisor told at least one housekeeper not to work through lunch breaks, the Agency does not claim, and there is nothing in the record to indicate, that the Agency provided a general directive to housekeepers not to work through designated breaks or lunch periods.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1367</span>, <span class="Italic">supra,</span> also determined to be negotiable a proposal designed to fairly distribute excessive housekeeping work that developed by reason of unforeseen emergencies, a phrase the parties intended to apply when employees called in sick. Proposal 7 was that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the maximum extent possible, should there be a time that additional rooms be assigned to the Housekeepers due to an unforeseen emergency, the parties agree that the rooms will be assigned on a fair and equitable basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">The proposal was an appropriate arrangement, 64 FLRA 875-76:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Meaning of the Proposal</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The parties agree that Proposal 7 would require the Agency to assign additional work assignments fairly and equitably. The Union stated that "unforeseen emergency" means when employees call in sick.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Union stated that the proposal pertains to the distribution of work assignments among employees on regular schedules, flex schedules, and employees who are work leaders.<span class="Italic"> </span>The Agency explained that employees on flex schedules work four days a week while employees on a regular schedule work five days a week. The Agency stated that a work leader is a bargaining-unit employee who works within the quality control staff.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_671"></span>...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the proposal is an arrangement, the proposal would mitigate the adverse effects of inequitable assignment of work by ensuring that extra work assignments would be distributed to housekeepers on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, consistent with precedent, Proposal 7 is sufficiently tailored to benefit those housekeepers who are adversely affected by the Agency's assignment of work in such circumstances. <span class="Italic">See Prison Locals</span>, 64 FLRA at 730. In this regard, the Authority has found similar proposals to be arrangements. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3258</span>, 48 FLRA 232, 235-36 (1993) (Member Armendariz concurring) (proposal that workload adjustment be redistributed in a fair and equitable manner). Based on the foregoing, we find that Proposal 7 is an arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to whether the arrangement is appropriate, Proposal 7 would benefit employees by ensuring them that work will be distributed on a fair and equitable basis.<span class="Italic"> See id. </span>The housekeepers' statements that the Agency does not treat them fairly support the Union's claim that the proposal would benefit housekeepers in this regard. The Agency does not address the housekeepers' statements, and does not dispute that the proposal would benefit employees as the Union claims. Moreover, nothing in the Agency's SOP, and nothing in the record, explains the extent to which Proposal 7 would burden the Agency's right to assign work. Even assuming that Proposal 7 would impose some administrative burden on the Agency to ensure that supervisors assign work in a fair and equitable basis, the Authority has found such a burden to be minimal. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 3258</span>, 48 FLRA at 236. Therefore, we find that the benefits to employees outweigh the burdens on management and thus, that Proposal 7 is within the duty to bargain as an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal to assign employees to relieve workload imbalances on the basis of a criterion stated to be an "equitable basis," without regard to grade, sex, or group, was a nonnegotiable infringement on the right to assign work. It prevented management from taking into account the level of difficulty of the work, relative to the grade of the employee assigned. <span class="Italic">NTEU and IRS, Dallas Dist.</span>, 13 FLRA 48, 49 (1983). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 147 and DHHS, SSA, Teleservice Ctr., Phoenix, Ariz.</span>, 38 FLRA 110, 111-17 (1990) (Provisions 1 and 2), <span class="Italic">post</span>; <span class="Italic">VA, Dept. of Memorial Affairs</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>. A proposal that required management to authorize additional preparation time for added work necessitated by a change in work instructions was nonnegotiable. The proposal was not an appropriate arrangement, because establishment of job requirements did not in itself adversely affect employees. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n and DODDS</span>, 28 FLRA 700, 701-04 (1987). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 26 FLRA 612, 612-15 (1987) (allowing "non-measured" work time for employees to comply with new instructions concerning their assignments). [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-603.html#sec6-604">Critical Elements and Performance Standards</a>."]</p>
<p class="noindent">Another proposal seeking to limit assignments of work to offices losing personnel during a reorganization was nonnegotiable as either a procedure or an arrangement. <span class="Italic">ACTION Employees Local, AFSCME and ACTION</span>, 31 FLRA 1053, 1056-58 (1988). Nonnegotiable was a proposal that assignment of work to employees between "blocks, types of work or sections" be fair and consistent at all times. The proposal precluded the agency from taking into account considerations such as individual judgment and reliability or workload needs within the various sections. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 32 and OPM</span>, 26 FLRA 612, 617, 618 (1987) (Proposal 13). Also nonnegotiable was a proposal that work on detail be equally divided among those detailed. <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU Chap. 32</span>, 27 FLRA 664, 671 (1987) (Proposal 7). A proposal was not negotiable that required redistribution of certain work of employees who were temporarily assigned to fire-control duties. The benefits of the proposal, analyzed as an arrangement, including increased availability of overtime work, were outweighed by the agency's inability to choose whether to assign the duties at all. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2192 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 59 FLRA 868, 870-71 (2004) ("Option A").

<p class="noindent">The union could not insist on negotiating a provision that permitted the union to participate in determining when additional work could be assigned to an organizational element of the agency. Union participation impaired management's flexibility in determining assignment of work and direction of employees. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R14-89 and Dept. of Army, Hq., Army Air Defense Ctr.</span>, 15 FLRA 14, 15 (1984). Negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Council 147 and DHHS, SSA, Teleservice Ctr., Phoenix, Ariz.</span>, 38 FLRA 110, 111, 114-16 (1990), were Provisions 1 and 2, calling on the agency to distribute downtime (duties other than telephone responses) equitably to "qualified volunteers," to the extent that the arrangement "does not interfere with the agency's mission and objectives":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees and Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management</span>, 29 FLRA 1491, 1506-08 (1987)...the Authority held that a provision requiring the agency to attempt to equalize overtime work among those employees in the unit who are already assigned to perform that work was negotiable. In our view, Provision 1 has the same effect as the disputed provision in <span class="Italic">BLM</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 requires the Agency to attempt to equalize downtime assignments among the TSRs.&#x2003;As noted previously, it appears from the record that all TSRs are qualified to perform, and regularly perform, downtime assignments. Even if all TSRs were not equally qualified, however, the provision preserves the Agency's right to determine requisite qualifications and make assignments consistent with those determinations. Accordingly, we conclude that Provision 1 does not directly interfere with the Agency's right to assign work....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In so concluding, we note, in response to the Agency's argument, that nothing in the wording of Provision 1 or in the record supports a conclusion that the provision would limit the Agency's right either to make particular downtime assignments or to consider its overall work exigencies when making assignments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[N]othing in the wording of Provision 2 or in the record indicates that Provision 2 obligates the Agency to change the content of its existing performance standards or the manner in which it applies those standards...or...to promulgate new performance standards.</p>
