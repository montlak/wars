<h5 class="h5" id="sec16-136"><span class="space">b.</span> Time for Initiating Enforcement</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For the timing of an enforcement petition, under 5 CFR 1201.182 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Appellate jurisdiction</span>. Any party may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision or order issued under the Board's appellate jurisdiction, or for enforcement of the terms of a settlement agreement that has been entered into the record for the purpose of enforcement in an order or decision under the Board's appellate jurisdiction. The petition must be filed promptly with the regional or field office that issued the initial decision; a copy of it must be served on the other party or that party's representative; and it must describe specifically the reasons the petitioning party believes there is noncompliance. The petition also must include the date and results of any communications regarding compliance. Any petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Timeliness of an enforcement petition may be raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board. <span class="Italic">Torres v. DHS</span>, 110 MSPR 482, 488 n.3, 2009 MSPB 19 (2009); <span class="Italic">Principe v. USPS</span>, <span class="blue">100 MSPR 66</span>, 73 &#x00B6; 13 (2005) (citing <span class="Italic">Kasarsky v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>,<span class="Italic"></span> 296 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2002)). An enforcement petition is not untimely only because a related petition for review was untimely; the enforcement regulation contains a different measure for the timing of the enforcement petition than for a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 89, 93 n.*, 2009 MSPB 231 (2009).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the regulation now in effect, 5 CFR 1201.182(a) (2022), the appellant has 30 days to petition for enforcement, starting from the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied (or longer with an adequate explanation of good cause for delay). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Saldivar v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 2002 NP No. 02-3062). The Board's regulations, rather than the regulations of the employing agency governing submission of claims for back pay, control the timing of an enforcement petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gallagher v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 93-3338). Once the agency files its notice of compliance, the timeliness of an enforcement petition is measured from that date, not from a later agency action that was not compelled by the Board's order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fernandez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 86 Fed. Appx. 410, 412 (Fed. Cir. 2003 NP). When the agency issues a notice of compliance, enforcement is subject to a 30-day limit, subject to extension for good cause, <span class="Italic">Portis v. SSA</span>, CB-7121-12-0031-C-1 (NP 10/22/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If an the appellant prevails in a Board appeal, a petition for enforcement of the Board's final decision must be filed no later than 30 calendar days after the agency informs the appellant that it has fully complied. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). As the administrative judge found, the appellant's petition for enforcement was filed almost a year after the agency informed her that it had complied with the Board's Order. Thus, the petition for enforcement was untimely. To establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for enforcement, a party must show that she exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">Alonzo v.

To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of her excuse and her showing of due diligence, whether she is proceeding <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, and whether she has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances <span id="Page_4977"></span>beyond her control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to her inability to timely file his petition. <span class="Italic">Moorman v.

<p class="Body-Text">The compliance notice should be issued with formality and regard for Board procedures. A letter by an agency to a union representative stating that the agency is in compliance is not sufficient notice of compliance to the appellant if the union representative was not designated to represent the appellant before the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mascarenas v. DOD</span>, 60 MSPR 320, 322-23 (1993) (union representative was authorized to represent the appellant only on an EEO complaint concerned with the agency's alleged violation of EEO regulations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an agency does not serve a notice of compliance--and often a notice will not be issued--the appellant may initiate enforcement proceedings within a reasonable time from when he becomes aware of noncompliance. The "reasonable time" rule also applies to known violations of a settlement agreement within the Board's enforcement authority. The measure of reasonableness depends on the circumstances, <span class="Italic">Tarin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 70 MSPR 234, 239 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Any petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Where the employee has not received written notice of compliance from the agency, however, the employee is not required to show good cause for the delay. <span class="Italic">See Shamblen v. US Postal Service</span>, 54 MSPR 55, 57 (1992). Because an agency is not required to serve a notice of compliance with a settlement agreement, a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement "must be filed 'within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach,' and...the 'reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case.'" <span class="Italic">Olson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A petition for enforcement alleging breach of a settlement agreement must be filed "within a reasonable amount of time of the date the petitioning party becomes aware of a breach of the agreement. The reasonableness of the time period depends on the circumstances of each case." <span class="Italic">Kasarsky v. Merit Systems Protection Board.</span>, 296 F.3d 1331, 1335 (Fed.

Here, although the appellant did not petition for enforcement until four months after she became aware that the agency apparently had breached the settlement agreement, she contacted the agency to obtain a copy of her OPF promptly after learning of the apparent breach. She thus acted diligently to determine whether the agency had complied with its expungement obligations and filed her petition for enforcement within six days after receiving her OPF from the agency. Under the circumstances--including the agency's lengthy delay in providing the OPF, which appears to have influenced the appellant's failure to immediately file her petition--we find that the petition for enforcement was filed within a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">See Bostick v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 399, 402 (1994) (4-month delay was reasonable under the circumstances, though 21-month delay was not); <span class="Italic">cf. Chudson v.

<p class="Body-Text">Summarizing decisions, the Board concluded that a seven-month delay was too long for enforcement of a settlement, <span class="Italic">English v. SBA,</span> DE-0752-13-0353-C-1 (NP 7/23/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Any petition for enforcement that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and a request for an extension of time for filing the petition. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a). Because an agency is not required to serve a notice of compliance with a settlement agreement, a petition for enforcement of a settlement agreement must be filed within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach of the agreement, taking into consideration the date of the petitioning party's knowledge of the alleged breach, and the reasonableness of the time period depends on the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="Italic">See Dean v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 515, (2012), the appellant filed a petition for enforcement 4 months after she became aware that the agency apparently had breached the settlement agreement. The Board found 4 months was a reasonable delay under the circumstances of that case because the appellant had contacted the agency to obtain a copy of her OPF promptly after learning of the apparent breach. The Board concluded that she acted diligently to determine whether the agency had complied with its expungement obligations, and in filing her petition for enforcement within 6 days after receiving her OPF from the agency. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 515, &#x00B6; 11. Under the circumstances--including the agency's lengthy delay in providing the OPF, which appears to have influenced Appellant Phillips' failure to immediately file her petition--the Board found that the petition for enforcement was filed within a reasonable amount of time. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's situation differs from that in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>. He had access to his OPF electronically without any need to make any request to his agency. None of the agency's alleged wrongdoing affected his ability to know for certain of the agency's alleged breach of the settlement agreement. Thus, the agency's actions identified by the appellant do not provide a circumstance that appears to have influenced his 7-month delay in filing his petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bostick v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 399 (1994), the appellant also filed his petition for enforcement 4 months after he apparently learned that the agency breached a settlement agreement by withholding the authority he allegedly needed to perform the duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Bostick</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 401. However, he filed a grievance concerning the matter, and he filed his petition for enforcement only 10 days after he received the agency's decision on that grievance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that generally the pursuit of other avenues of redress, including the grievance process, does not constitute good cause for waiving the Board's filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bachelor v. Department of the Army</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 108, 110 (1992). However, because the appellant received only the more general information about petitions for enforcement that is provided in cases involving settlement agreements, and not the more specific information provided in other cases, the Board found that he acted within a reasonable time of the date of the alleged breach. <span class="Italic">Bostick</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 410.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's situation also differs from that in <span class="Italic">Bostick</span>. Although the appellant states that he filed an equal employment opportunity complaint, a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel, and a complaint with the Inspector General, he does not allege that any of these complaints involved the agency's alleged failure to place his FY 2013 appraisal in his OPF. Thus, they provide no basis to find that the appellant acted within a reasonable time to file his petitions for enforcement. Further, although the appellant received only the more general information about petitions for enforcement that is provided in cases involving settlement agreements, by his own admission, he was familiar with Board proceedings, having filed other Board complaints, a circumstance supporting a finding that the appellant failed to act with due diligence in filing his petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Cf. Chudson v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1996) (1-year delay was unreasonable where appellant was an experienced Board litigant and was represented by counsel), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 132 F.3d 54 (Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">If there is a dispute between the agency and the appellant over compliance, and the appellant attempts to straighten the matter out with the agency before invoking Board assistance, the Board will not dismiss a petition as untimely if the agency has advised neither the appellant nor the Board that it has completed compliance, or if the agency fails to fully advise the appellant of its compliance efforts. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. USPS</span>, 56 MSPR 633, 636-37 (1993).

Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that the appellant was not entitled to such pay. Because the appellant filed a petition for review of the initial decision in his suspension appeal, that decision was not a final order, and the administrative judge should have dismissed the petition for enforcement of that initial decision as premature. <span class="Italic">See Walker v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 99 M.S.P.R. 367, &#x00B6; 8 (2005) (finding that a petition for enforcement was premature because the initial decision at issue had <span id="Page_4978"></span>not yet become final); <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

In any event, we find that the administrative judge was correct to dismiss the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If, however, the appellant takes a final decision to the Federal Circuit on a compliance issue, the Board does not have jurisdiction to consider that issue in an enforcement proceeding initiated during the pendency of the court case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Edwards v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, in a nonprecedential decision having no immediate impact beyond the parties to the case, <span class="Italic">Sanso v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1999 NP No. 99-3223), injected into the timeliness equation a requirement that the appellant notify the agency of alleged noncompliance, to permit the agency to address the issue before the Board becomes involved, and to then "force" the agency to issue a notice of compliance, triggering the period for resort to the Board. The Board has not yet adopted the Federal Circuit's suggestion in <span class="Italic">Sanso</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Implicit within the regulation is the requirement that the aggrieved party communicate to the agency his or her allegations that the agency has not complied with the Board's final decision, as such communication is what triggers the agency to generate its notice of compliance, and in turn, the 30 day deadline for filing an enforcement petition. This implicit requirement is the reason why all communications between the party and the agency must be included within the petition for enforcement submitted to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a) (1997) ("The petition also <span class="Italic">must</span> include the date and results of any communications regarding noncompliance.") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the agency that the Board property dismissed Sanso's third petition for enforcement, but for a reason different from that articulated by the Board. The Board held that it lacked jurisdiction because Sanso had filed the petition in an untimely manner and had provided no good cause for doing so. However, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Sanso never communicated his noncompliance allegations to the agency, an action which necessarily must precede the filing of a petition for enforcement. The Board noted that Sanso had failed to present any evidence substantiating his claim that he had discussed the agency's alleged noncompliance with the agency; on appeal, Sanso likewise fails to direct us to any evidence in the record to support his claim. Moreover, the agency submitted the declaration of Sanso's supervisor, Cynthia West, who stated that Sanso had never approached her concerning an EVA award or merit pay. We therefore conclude that the Board's finding that Sanso failed to communicate to the agency his allegations of noncompliance with the Board's final decision is supported by substantial evidence, and thus conclude that the Board properly dismissed the petition under &#x00A7; 1201.182(a)....</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the agency certifies compliance with the Board's order, initiating the 30-day period for initiating enforcement proceedings, the determination of good cause for waiver of the regulatory period will be made on a specific evaluation of the circumstances, as the Federal Circuit explained when it reversed the Board's failure to consider an enforcement petition relating to deductions from the appellant's back pay, <span class="Italic">Porter v. MSPB</span>, 210 Fed. Appx. 996, 997-98 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On June 30, 2005 the DFAS informed Ms. Porter that they had overpaid her by $30,148.00, and that this amount must be remitted within 30 days. The letter stated that the overpayment arose became the agency had inadvertently failed to account for wages earned and unemployment payments to Ms. Porter during her 19-month separation from federal service. The letter from DFAS explained the procedures for obtaining waiver of overpayment for good cause, told her who to contact with any questions, and included the Internet site for the form to request waiver by DOD of all or part of the overpayment. The following day, July, 1, 2005, DOD notified Ms. Porter that it had fully complied with the Board's March 25, 2005 decision. Within a month of the final DFAS payment Ms. Porter filed the waiver form with DOD, in accordance with the instructions. She received no response to this filing. The DOD started to garnish her wages from the National Institutes of Health, in the amount of $289.42 per month.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 16, 2005 Ms. Porter filed a "petition for enforcement" with the MSPB, objecting to the garnishment and again requesting waiver. In a supplemental petition filed January 10, 2006 she alleged hardship in the total amount, and made an offer of compromise. In its response to the petition the DOD argued, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Ms. Porter's petition to the MSPB was untimely because it was not filed within 30 days of the DFAS initial notice of overpayment on June 30, 2005. Ms. Porter replied that she had submitted the form requesting waiver to DOD within a month of the overpayment, and only after it became clear that the DOD would not answer her request did she seek to proceed before the Board. Her "petition for enforcement" was filed four and a half months after the DFAS notice of overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge held that the petition was untimely and that Ms. Porter failed to show good cause for the delay, stating that "[i]t was plainly unreasonable for the appellant to believe that filing a form requesting waiver of her debt with [DOD] was equivalent to filing a [petition for enforcement] with the Board." The full Board denied review, and this appeal followed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations require that a petition for enforcement be filed within 30 days of the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied with the Board's order, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.182(a); the Board's March 25, 2005 order advised Ms. Porter of that 30-day requirement. Accordingly, her petition for review was due for filing within 30 days of the service of the July 1, 2005 notice from the DOD advising her that it had complied with the Board's order. Her petition for enforcement, filed on December 16, 2005, was therefore untimely. Under the circumstances, however, we conclude that the Board abused its discretion by failing to find good cause for the delay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's June 30, 2005 notice of overpayment provided instructions for requesting a waiver of the requirement that she repay the overpayment, and she diligently pursued that avenue of relief. However, DOD did not respond to the request, and instead started to garnish her wages. While a waiver proceeding before the agency is distinct from an enforcement proceeding, it was reasonable for Ms. Porter, who was <span class="Italic">pro se</span>, to conclude that the need for recourse to the MSPB would not arise until and unless DOD denied her request for waiver or until it became apparent that the DOD was not going to respond to her waiver request. The DOD's silence is unexplained in the record provided. It was not unreasonable for the petitioner to wait for the agency's response to her waiver request, before taking a litigation-type step of filing a petition for enforcement. We therefore conclude that Ms. Porter showed good cause for the delay in filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We take note that neither the notice from DFAS stating that it had made an error, nor the letter from DOD stating that it had fully complied, gave notice of a 30-day period for filing a petition with the MSPB. None of the correspondence between the agency and Ms. Porter made it clear that if she wished to contest the debt, she needed to file a prompt petition with the MSPB even if she took advantage of the opportunity to request a waiver. Since the grant of a waiver would have obviated the need for enforcement proceedings, it was reasonable for Ms. Porter to assume that initiating enforcement proceedings could wait for the agency's decision on the waiver request if she made such a request on a timely basis, which she did. In light of the miscalculation by DFAS of the payment, DOD's notice of full compliance, Ms. Porter's prompt filing of the waiver request, and DOD's failure to respond; and taking cognizance of Ms. Porter's <span class="Italic">pro se</span> status and the absence of notice to her of the time limit for filing with the Board, we conclude that the Board's holding that good cause for the delay had not been shown was an abuse of Board discretion. We reverse the dismissal, and remand for determination of the merits of her petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an agency has not certified compliance, the appellant should avoid undue delay in seeking compliance, so as not to prejudice the agency in its defense of the enforcement petition, <span class="Italic">Wooten v. GPO</span>, 21 MSPR 425, 426-27 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The doctrine of laches has been applied in the past to federal employee appeals for back pay and reinstatement because of illegal discharge from civil service. <span class="Italic">See Brundage v.

The Court of Claims stated in <span class="Italic">Brundage, supra</span>, that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Laches is a "fairness" doctrine by which relief is denied to one who was unreasonably and inexcusably delayed in the assertion of a claim. Failure to act promptly will operate as a bar to recovery <span id="Page_4979"></span>where the delay results in injury or prejudice to the adverse party. The doctrine of laches is based upon considerations of public policy, which require, for the peace of society, the discouragement of stale demands. It recognizes the need for speedy vindication or enforcement of rights, so that courts may arrive at safe conclusions as to the truth.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Brundage</span> at 1384.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The same policy considerations enunciated by the Court of Claims are applicable to proceedings before this Board. Therefore, we find as a general proposition that the equitable doctrine of laches is applicable to our administrative proceedings. However, laches will not be applied where a plaintiff or appellant has a satisfactory explanation for the delay and the defendant or agency fails to show resulting prejudice. <span class="Italic">See Alpert v. United States</span>, 161 Ct. Cl. 810, 820-821 (1963). Of course, the longer the delay the greater the plaintiff's or appellant's need to show lack of prejudice. <span class="Italic">Brundage</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, at 1386.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's actions do not represent those of a prudent man exercising due diligence in this case. He was represented by a union representative, and at one point by an attorney, yet he waited for over one year before filing a petition for enforcement. Appellant's argument that he was involved in negotiations with the agency concerning a race discrimination claim is raised for the first time in his petition for review. Additionally, negotiations concerning his allegations of race discrimination were distinct from his removal for physical disability that was reversed by the presiding official of the Board's Washington Regional Office. Therefore, we conclude that the presiding official properly dismissed appellant's petition for enforcement of the Board's final decision on the ground of laches....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit found unreasonable a delay of 11 years and affirmed the Board's dismissal of an enforcement petition based on the equitable doctrine of laches, <span class="Italic">Traunig v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 93-3262):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Imposition of the equitable doctrine of laches requires two elements: 1) unreasonable and inexcusable delay by the petitioner; and 2) prejudice to the respondent because of the delay. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brundage v. United States</span>, 504 F.2d 1382, 1384-86 (Ct.

Dept. of the Navy</span>, 957 F.2d 861, 863 (Fed. Cir. 1992). The MSPB found that petitioner's delay of nearly twelve years in filing his petition for enforcement was unreasonable and inexcusable and that the agency had shown that it would be severely prejudiced if it were required to demonstrate that it had complied with the Board's final order of 1981. Accordingly, the Board dismissed the petition on the ground that it was barred by the doctrine of laches.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The defense of laches is frequently invoked to bar claims in which civilians in government have unnecessarily delayed in seeking restoration to their former positions. Courts have sustained the use of this equitable doctrine in numerous cases in which the delays were far shorter than the twelve year delay of the present case. Litigation delays ranging from 11 months to 4 years and 5 months have provided sufficient grounds upon which the doctrine of laches has been invoked to bar individuals' claims. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> <span class="Italic">Albert v. United States</span>, 161 Ct. Cl. 810, 820-21 (1963) (citing extensively cases in which the doctrine of laches was applied to bar recovery for a Government employee's claim of improper discharge). For example, a delay of only 11 months was deemed sufficient to preclude plaintiff's recovery in <span class="Italic">Norris v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States</span>, 257 U.S. 77 (1921).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, petitioner's delay in filing his petition for enforcement was extraordinarily long. It was almost twice as long as the six-year period allowed by the statute of limitations for filing any civil action against the United States. 28 USC 2401 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the element of prejudice, the Board found that the Veterans Administration would be severely prejudiced if it were required to demonstrate in 1992 that it had complied with the Board's final reinstatement order of 1981. We agree that it would be exceedingly difficult to litigate the issue of compliance under the present circumstances in which documents no longer exist and witnesses are not available. Furthermore, the Board found that the appellant presented no evidence and no argument on the issue of prejudice to the agency.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But a five-year delay was no bar to enforcement, <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 957 F.2d 861, 863 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (not reaching economic difficulties for the agency):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Having found unreasonable delay and prejudice, the Board barred Hoover's petition on the ground of laches....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The imposition of laches requires both unreasonable delay by the petitioner, and prejudice to the respondent because of the delay.... Laches is an affirmative defense, and the burden of proving both elements rests with the party raising it....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency relies on "defense prejudice," whereby a defendant encounters increased and prejudicial difficulty in mounting its defense due to the claimant's delay. Examples of defense prejudice are the loss of records, destruction of evidence, fading memories, and the unavailability of witnesses....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency offered no evidence of the unavailability of...key witnesses beyond stating that they had retired....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is the availability and memory of witnesses, not their employment status, that is relevant. The burden of establishing witness unavailability or memory failure is not met by simply showing that a potential witness has retired....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the agency did not meet its burden of showing prejudice, an essential element of laches was not established. Thus we need not reach the issue of the reasonableness of Hoover's delay....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Lacking agency certification of compliance, a two-year delay in seeking adjudication of a back pay claim related to a successful appeal was no impediment to Board enforcement jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Shamblen v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 55, 57 (1992):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations require the appellant to file his petition for enforcement "promptly," and to show good cause when it is submitted more than thirty days after "the date of service of the agency's notice that it has complied." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR 1201.182(a). In finding that the petition was untimely, the administrative judge cited only the portion of the regulation that requires filing "promptly," but not the thirty-day provision that further explains the general requirement.... The proper interpretation of the regulation supports the appellant's allegation that his petition was not untimely filed, and that he was not required to show good cause, because he did not receive written notice of compliance from the agency....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Substantial delay in initiating enforcement was unobjectionable in <span class="Italic">Vargo v. USPS</span>, 78 MSPR 66, 71-72 (1998), when the agency failed to certify compliance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has the authority to order any federal agency to comply with decisions issued under the Board's jurisdiction, and the authority to enforce compliance with its decisions. An employing agency must inform a prevailing appellant promptly of the actions it takes to comply with a Board order, and the losing employing agency must tell the appellant when it believes that it has completed its compliance. If the appellant is not notified that the agency believes that [iT]has completed its compliance, he should, from time to time, ask the agency about its progress. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181. An appellant may petition the Board for enforcement of a final decision issued under the Board's jurisdiction; any such petition that is filed more than 30 days after the date of service of the agency's notice that has completed its compliance must contain a statement and evidence showing good cause for the delay and request for an extension of time for filing the petition. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182(a) and (b). If, however, the agency fails to notify the appellant that it has completed its compliance, the appellant is not required to show good cause regardless of any delay in filing a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tarin v. Department of the Army</span>, 70 MSPR 234, 239 (1996); <span class="Italic">Shamblen v.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. Postal Service,</span> 54 MSPR 55, 57 (1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, on July 8, 1991, the Board ordered the agency to restore the appellant with back pay.... On July 19, 1991, the agency sent the appellant a notice stating that the appellant's "entitlement to back pay begins on August 20, 1986, and ends on April 7, 1988, the date that [the appellant] resigned pending a removal action for separation disability." The notice states further that "[s]teps are being taken to immediately calculate your back pay entitlement and issue payment at the earliest possible date." Although this notice concerns compliance, we find, based on its terms, that it does not constitute a notice that the agency has completed its compliance under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181<span class="Italic">. See Mascarenas v. Department of Defense,</span> 60 MSPR 320, 322-23 (1993); <span class="Italic">Shamblen</span>, 54 MSPR at 57. Thus, the administrative judge erred in finding that it triggered the start of the 30-day period for filing a petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Subsequently, as noted above, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement seeking back pay, and the parties entered into a settlement agreement dated August 22, 1991. That settlement agreement provides that the appellant is entitled to back pay and interest beginning August 30, 1986 and ending April 7, 1988. It also provides that the appellant will withdraw his first-filed petition for enforcement. The settlement agreement does not, however, state that the agency has completed compliance. Further, it is silent with regard to the issue of reinstatement. Thus, the Board finds that the settlement agreement also does not constitute notice that the agency has completed its compliance under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.181. The appellant therefore was not required to establish good cause when he filed his second petition for enforcement.[1] <span class="Italic">See Shamblen</span>, 54 MSPR at 57.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The appellant's petition for enforcement does not allege breach of the settlement agreement. Thus, the appellant's petition is not subject to the requirement that it be filed within a reasonable time of the discovery of the alleged breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Adamcik v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 48 MSPR 493, 496 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4980"></span><span class="Italic">Shamblen</span>, in which, as noted above, the Board found that the agency did not give appellant Shamblen notice that it had completed its compliance under 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.182, and thus found that the petition for enforcement was timely, is factually very similar to appellant Vargo's case. In <span class="Italic">Shamblen</span>, the initial decision reversing the agency's action became the final decision of the Board on April 24, 1989, and the appellant filed his petition for enforcement on November 4, 1991, more than eighteen months later. The time between the date of the final decision and the date of filing the petition for enforcement in appellant Vargo's case, a little more than twenty-two months, is comparable to that in <span class="Italic">Shamblen</span>. Thus, we find that the appellant's petition for enforcement was timely filed. Because we find that the appellant's petition was timely filed, we need not address his contention on petition for review that any untimeliness in filing his petition for enforcement was due to his continuing battle with schizophrenia.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mangabat v. OPM</span>, 74 MSPR 209, 211-12 (1997) (although enforcement petitions should be filed promptly after an initial decision becomes final, 5 CFR 1201.182 (1997), a lengthy delay in filing a PFR, treated as an enforcement petition by the Board, was excused because of OPM's "extremely egregious delay" and continued failure to comply with a Board order requiring the issuance of a reconsideration decision); <span class="Italic">Eikenberry v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 37 MSPR 438, 447 (1988) (laches will not be applied if the appellant has a satisfactory explanation for a delay in compliance proceedings and the agency fails to show prejudice; during the delay of 15 months, the appellant was involved in complaints to agency officials at various levels); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 57 MSPR 545, 554 (1993) (general commentary concerning laches relative to back pay entitlement).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board must act reasonably concerning the timing of enforcement procedures. <span class="Italic">Rolle v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3456), said of the dismissal of an enforcement petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board allowed the Postal Service to miss by 51 days the deadline for filing compliance evidence. However, when Rolle requested a 15-day extension, the Board failed to respond and subsequently dismissed Rolle's petition. Rolle, as a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> litigant, is entitled to leniency with respect to court formalities. <span class="Italic">Kelley v. Secretary of Labor</span>, 812 F.2d 1378, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 1987). The actions of the Board here constitute an abuse of discretion....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to a case seeking enforcement of a settlement agreement, <span class="Italic">Ayala v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 56 MSPR 1, 2-3 (1992), decided that the AJ's "ultimate determination that the petition for enforcement was untimely filed because the appellant had taken no action to file with the Board for more than three years after the agreement was reached, despite his awareness of the alleged breach, and that he did not establish good cause for his delay, is correct."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An enforcement petition, once filed, may be withdrawn by the appellant or counsel. Once the petition is withdrawn, may it be refiled? One case suggested that if the enforcement petition is withdrawn by counsel, the Board will not direct its reinstatement because the appellant claims on PFR that her attorney erroneously withdrew enforcement proceedings "for reasons too complicated for her to understand." The Board observed that "[t]he appellant has not shown, or even asserted, that her attorney was not acting in her behalf at the time he made the request." <span class="Italic">Moore v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 28, 30 (1989). [Refer below to "<a href="0100-2023-23-146.html#sec16-144">Multiple Enforcement Petitions; <span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span></a>."]</p>
