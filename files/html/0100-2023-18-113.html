<h5 class="h5" id="sec11-113"><span class="space">g.</span> Performance Cases</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Mitigation or aggravation of a penalty is not an issue in a Chapter 43 performance case, but due process during the reply period remains an issue under <span class="Italic">Ward</span> and <span class="Italic">Stone</span>. <span class="Italic">Heimer v. VA</span>, DE-0432-14-0347-I-1 (NP 3/24/2015), involved an appellant whose employer assessed that she failed the PIP and <span id="Page_3292"></span>then unilaterally placed the appellant into an abeyance period following the PIP and an ensuing proposal for removal and reply. The abeyance conditions were that employment would not be terminated if there were no new instances of misconduct or performance deficiencies during the 90-day abeyance period. The appellant was then removed because during the period of abeyance she failed to meet her performance standards and because she failed successfully to complete the PIP. The removal was set aside because the appellant was not put on notice of the specific failings during the abeyance period with an opportunity to respond to those alleged deficiencies:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency did not refer to the appellant's allegedly poor performance of 2014 in its September 27, 2013 notice of proposed removal; indeed, it could not have done so. Nevertheless, in the April 22, 2014 decision letter, the deciding official stated that it had been determined to remove the appellant, effective April 28, 2014, "for the following reasons": her failure to successfully complete the PIP, <span class="Italic">and</span> her failure to meet the performance standards for critical elements 1 and 2 during the period from January 15, 2014, through April 15, 2014, the period provided for in the abeyance letter. Because the deciding official considered information that was not included in the notice of proposed removal, we find that she relied on <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in her decision to remove the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Howard v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 106, &#x00B6; 4 (2012). However, such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information will only violate an employee's right to due process when it introduces new and material information to the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine if the deciding official's consideration of this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information constituted a due process violation, we must inquire whether the information is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. In making this determination, the Board will consider, among other factors: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information merely introduces "cumulative information" or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the information and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279; <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that information as to the appellant's performance during the period of abeyance was not cumulative because, even if similar in nature to the incidents of poor performance in the agency's notice of proposed action, it concerned performance of which the appellant was not given notice and an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1376 (procedural due process guarantees are not met if the employee has notice only of certain charges or portions of the evidence relied upon by the agency). Furthermore, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has noted that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information is plainly material when the deciding official has admitted that the information influenced his penalty determination. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. Although penalty is not at issue in chapter 43 performance-based actions, <span class="Italic">see Lisiecki v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 769 F.2d 1558, 1566-67 (Fed. Cir. 1985), it is clear, based on the decision letter, that the deciding official in this case considered the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information; <span class="Italic">see Silberman v. Department of Labor</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 12 (2011). It is equally clear that the appellant did not know of the information and had no opportunity to respond to it.[5] In fact, the agency, in its decision letter, did not provide any specific incidents of unacceptable performance, but only stated that, during the period of abeyance, the appellant failed to meet the performance standards for critical elements 1 and 2. Finally, as to the undue pressure factor, the court in <span class="Italic">Ward</span> clarified that it is only one of several enumerated factors and is not the ultimate inquiry in the <span class="Italic">Stone</span> analysis. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280 n.2. The court added that, although <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information of a type likely to result in undue pressure may make it more likely that an appellant was deprived of due process, the lack of undue pressure may be less relevant to finding a constitutional violation where, as here, the deciding official admits that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information influenced his determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant did not, for example, have the opportunity to explain to the deciding official why she believed that her performance between January 15, 2014, and April 15, 2014, was not deficient.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, even if, as the agency now argues, its intention in holding the appellant's removal in abeyance for 90 days was to afford her one last chance to demonstrate acceptable performance,[6] we find that the deciding official's admitted <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> consideration of the appellant's performance during the abeyance period undermined her constitutional due process guarantee of notice and of the opportunity to respond.[7] The agency's error cannot be excused as harmless, and the appellant's removal must be cancelled. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280. The agency may not remove the appellant unless and until she is afforded a new "constitutionally correct removal procedure." <span class="Italic">See Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377; <span class="Italic">see also Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1280.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;To be clear, the agency decision to hold the appellant's removal in abeyance was a unilateral action and not the product of an agreement in which the appellant waived any of her rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;Given our finding of a due process violation, we need not determine whether the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's alleged performance deficiencies in 2014 also constituted harmful procedural error. <span class="Italic">Silberman</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 501, &#x00B6; 4 n.3.</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ex parte</span> consideration of information during the reply process was constitutionally insignificant in a performance-based appeal of a GS-12 paralegal specialist in <span class="Italic">Bolton v. SSA</span>, DC-0432-12-0121-I-1 (NP 1/24/2014), noting that the information could not have had too much importance, since the deciding official mitigated the proposed removal to a grade reduction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official testified that, prior to issuing his decision, he received comments from two ALJs complaining that the appellant's decisions required extensive editing and that "it took more time for them." He further testified that he took the comments into consideration in reaching his decision on the proposed action. Because the agency did not refer to the ALJs' negative comments in its notice of proposed removal, the deciding official considered <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information in his decision. <span class="Italic">See Lopes v. Department of the Navy</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 470, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2011). However, such <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information will only violate an employee's right to due process when it introduces new and material information to the deciding official. <span class="Italic">Ward v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 634 F.3d 1274, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2011); <span class="Italic">Stone v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</span>, 179 F.3d 1368, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to determine whether the deciding official's consideration of this <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information constituted a due process violation, it is necessary to determine whether the information is so substantial and so likely to cause prejudice that no employee can fairly be required to be subjected to a deprivation of property under such circumstances. <span class="Italic">Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1279. In reaching this determination, the Board considers the facts and circumstances of each particular case. Among the factors to be considered are: (1) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information merely introduced "cumulative" information or new information; (2) whether the employee knew of the error and had a chance to respond to it; and (3) whether the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> information was of the type likely to result in undue pressure upon the deciding official to rule in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">Stone</span>, 179 F.3d at 1377.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In challenging the administrative judge's finding that there was no due process violation, the appellant argues that the comments of the ALJs constituted new information. In support of her contrary finding, the administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Blank v. Department of the Army</span>, 247 F.3d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2001), wherein the court held that information regarding pending charges obtained by communications that do no more than confirm or clarify the record does not undermine an employee's constitutional due process rights.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1229. Although the appellant asserts that Blank is wrong, it remains good law. In the instant case, the agency had in its possession considerable evidence showing that the appellant's work was, and had been for some time, of unacceptable quality. We therefore agree that the information from the ALJs was cumulative and not new. <span class="Italic">See Martinez v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7, 11 (2012) (a deciding official's familiarity with the facts of a case does not constitute a due process violation). It is true that the appellant was not aware that the information had been provided to the deciding official and therefore did not have a chance to specifically respond to it. However, it was not of a type likely to result in undue pressure on the deciding official to rule in a particular manner, as evidenced by the fact that, upon consideration of all the evidence, he mitigated the removal penalty to a reduction in grade. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we agree with the administrative judge that the deciding official's consideration of the two ALJs' comments did not deprive the appellant of due process.[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We similarly find that the appellant did not establish that the deciding official's consideration of the comments of the two ALJs was harmful error because it did not likely cause the agency to reach a conclusion different from the one it would have reached in <span id="Page_3293"></span>the absence or cure of the error. <span class="Italic">See Ward</span>, 634 F.3d at 1281; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r)].</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Performance case decisions predating <span class="Italic">Ward</span> applied a harmful error approach to arguable <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications. In one unacceptable performance action, the proposing official, who was also the immediate supervisor, wrote a memo to the deciding official, with no copy to the appellant, consisting of his rebuttal to the appellant's statements in her defense and his contentions as to why the deciding official should not reduce the proposed removal to demotion. The memo also contained discussion that was not included in the charges against the appellant concerning her performance during an interim performance appraisal period. The Board noted that a supervisor serving as a proposing official is not <span class="Italic">per se</span> an adversarial party for purposes of determining whether a prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication occurred. There is no general requirement that one involved in the agency's decisional process be entirely removed from communicating with the deciding official once the process has begun. Although the appellant demonstrated that the deciding official considered allegations of unacceptable performance in addition to those in the proposal notice in reaching his decision to remove the appellant, the issue was whether or not there was harmful error. To show that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications impaired her ability to defend against agency action, the appellant was required to show that new allegations or information were considered by the deciding official that the appellant could not review and respond to; the deciding official was influenced by the new allegations or information in his or her decision-making process; and the procedural error of considering the new allegations or information likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the action before the agency. The test was not met when the information provided by the supervisor was given in response to comments by the employee about satisfactory performance during an earlier period covered by an appraisal that was supplied to the appellant. The AJ did not consider those documents in sustaining the agency action. <span class="Italic">Klippert v. DCAA</span>, 27 MSPR 339, 342-43 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another pre-<span class="Italic">Ward</span> decision determined that no unlawful <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications occurred between the proposing and deciding official, or any other officials or persons during the agency's decisionmaking process, unless there was a violation of statute, OPM regulation, or agency internal regulation. The Board did not preclude the agency from using advisory information of an investigative, nonadversarial nature during the Chapter 43 decision process, <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of State</span>, 27 MSPR 344, 347-51 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant contends further that the agency engaged in prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications in that: (1) the proposing official, after hearing appellant's oral reply, submitted a memorandum to the deciding official which generally discussed appellant's responses to the charges, withdrew certain specifications, listed several alternative disciplinary actions and recommended a best alternative; (2) the proposing official, after hearing the oral reply, requested assistance from appellant's bureau chief in formulating his recommendation; and (3) the decision letter was prepared by the proposing official and was issued by the deciding official without exercising his independent judgment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds, in regard to the claims of prohibited <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications, that there is no statutory or regulatory prohibition of <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the proposing and deciding officials or any other officials or persons during the agency's decision making process. The Board finds that <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the proposing and deciding officials or any other agency officials or persons during the agency's decision making process are proper absent a showing by the appellant that they are prohibited by statute, Office of Personnel Management regulation, or agency internal regulation. <span class="Italic">Depte v. United States,</span> 715 F.2d 1481, 1484 (Fed. Cir. 1983)<span class="Italic">. See Welcker v. United States,</span> 752 F.2d 1577, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The Board will not place nonstatutory or nonregulatory encumbrances upon the agency decision making process involving the furnishing of advisory information which is of an investigative, nonadversarial nature. <span class="Italic">See Hairston v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 440, 444 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee's procedural rights in a Chapter 43 proceeding are set forth in 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303 and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 432.101.... Further, the employee is entitled to a written decision which specifies the instances of unacceptable performance by the employee on which the action is based, and unless proposed by the head of the agency, has been concurred in by an employee who is in a higher position than the employee who proposed the action. 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(D); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 432.101(b). There is, however, no statutory or regulatory prohibition on the proposing and deciding officials or other agency officials or persons conferring about the proposed Chapter 43 action prior to the decision. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Peterson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 25 MSPR 572 (1985); <span class="Italic">Beatty v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 20 MSPR 436, 438 (1984). <span class="Italic">See also Sibert v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Health, Education, and Welfare,</span> 4 MSPB 132, 4 MSPR 41 (1980), in which the Board held that no violation of the procedural rights found in 5 CFR Part 752 results from <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the proposing and deciding officials in a case where the agency has adopted a two-stage decision making process not required by statute or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">means</span> by which the deciding official learned of additional allegations or information against the employee during the decision making process, which the employee did not have the benefit of reviewing and responding to, is not the focus of the Board's concern in reviewing an employee's allegation that his or her statutory or regulatory procedural rights were violated in a Chapter 43 action. The Board's concern, rather, is directed specifically to whether the deciding official predicated his or her ultimate decision on the information contained in the advance written notice, and not on additional allegations or information, and whether the employee had an opportunity to address the specific instances of unacceptable performance on which the proposed action is based.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that an allegation by the appellant that new allegations or information were erroneously considered during the agency's decision making process which he or she did not have the benefit of reviewing and responding to and which impaired his or her ability to defend against the agency's action is subject to the harmful error analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">Baracco v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Transportation,</span> 15 MSPR 112 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 735 F.2d 488 (Fed. Cir. 1984); and <span class="Italic">Parker v. Defense Logistics Agency,</span> 1 MSPB 489, 1 MSPR 505 (1980). In order to support an allegation that the introduction of new allegations or information during the agency's decision making process constituted harmful error, the appellant must show: 1) that new allegations or information were introduced which the appellant has not had the benefit of reviewing and responding to; 2) that the deciding official was influenced by the new allegations or information in his or her decision making process; and 3) that the procedural error of considering the new allegations or information likely had a harmful effect upon the outcome before the agency.[2] <span class="Italic">See Baracco,</span> 15 MSPR at 121-23; <span class="Italic">Parker</span>, 1 MSPB at 492-93, 1 MSPR at 512-14. <span class="Italic">See also Sandland</span>, 23 MSPR at 590 n.11.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The appellant, further, may show that additional allegations or information which improperly influenced the agency's decision making process were motivated by animus, reprisal or some other improper motive, and thus also establish that the agency's action was based on a prohibited personnel practice against the appellant under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)<span class="Italic">. See Sullivan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266, 1274-76 (Fed. Cir. 1983), where the court found that the improper influence of an agency official in the decision making process of the removal action, motivated by animus against the employee for filing a grievance against the official, rendered the action a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Farris v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 26 MSPR 299, 303 (1985), the Board stated that no law or regulation prohibits the proposing and deciding officials from "meeting, discussing and/or consulting on a case if no new evidence, subject matter or material is introduced, which the appellant has not had the benefit of responding to or viewing...." The Board hereby clarifies its statement in <span class="Italic">Farris</span> by holding that the introduction of additional allegations or information during the agency's decision making process which the employee has not had the benefit of reviewing and responding to does not constitute harmful error unless the appellant shows that such error occurred under the analysis set forth [above].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that appellant failed to show any error in the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> discussions of the proposing and deciding officials with subordinate managerial officials concerning their recommendations and appellant's arguments raised in his oral and written replies. The court in <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Department of the Navy,</span> 720 F.2d 1266, 1272 (Fed. Cir. 1983), distinguished its holding from those cases in which communications to a decision maker during the decision making process merely involved the furnishing of internal information and documents of an advisory nature. The court, further, in <span class="Italic">Depte,</span> 715 F.2d at 1484-85, held that an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> discussion by a deciding official with an impartial agency witness to the misconduct charged against an employee is not improper or a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(2). The record in the instant case discloses that no new allegations or information were introduced at these discussions and that the discussions merely involved the furnishing of advisory information by impartial management officials and were of an investigative, nonadversarial nature. <span class="Italic">See Hairston, supra,</span> at 444.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds further that the proposed decision letter submitted to the deciding official by the proposing official cannot be interpreted as precluding the deciding official from reaching his own considered judgment on the merits of the action. While 5 USC &#x00A7; 4303(b)(1)(D)(ii) and 5 CFR &#x00A7; 432.101(b) require an employee who is in a higher position than the proposing employee to concur in a demotion or removal action, it is that independence of judgment on the merits, which the deciding official testified without contradiction that he exercised in evaluating the removal action and adopting the proposed decision letter, that <span id="Page_3294"></span>is required by statute, regulation, and judicial precedent. The Board perceives no error in this regard in the instant case. <span class="Italic">See Anderson v. Department of Transportation</span>, 15 MSPR 157, 166-68 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 735 F.2d 537 Fed. Cir. 1984)<span class="Italic">. See also Sullivan,</span> 720 F.2d at 1272.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit followed the <span class="Italic">Anderson</span> line of reasoning. A memo from a nonadversarial charging official to the deciding official concerning an appellant's continuing work deficiencies did not constitute an improper <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communication under <span class="Italic">Sullivan</span>. <span class="Italic">Sztan v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3443).</p>
