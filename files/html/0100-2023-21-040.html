<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-40"><span class="space">b.</span> Permanent Light Duty Position</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether a permanent light duty assignment constitutes assignment of an individual into a vacant position defeating disability annuity entitlement was considered by the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bracey v. OPM</span>, 236 F.3d 1356, 1357-63 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Bracey v. OPM</span>, 89 MSPR 311 (2001)). The court reversed the Board's result in <span class="Italic">Bracey v. OPM,</span> 83 MSPR 400 (1999), and determined that a light duty assignment does not constitute a disqualifying reassignment under CSRS. The court determined that an employee's entitlement to disability retirement is defeated if the employee is qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade level, and that the term "position" refers to a position that is properly classified and graded rather than "an unclassified set of duties devised to meet the needs of a particular employee who cannot perform the duties of his official position":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case raises an important question regarding the eligibility of federal civilian employees for disability retirement. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Merit Systems Protection Board ruled that an employee is ineligible for disability retirement as long as the employee is retained at the same grade and pay, even if the employee is unable to perform the duties of his official position, and even if he is not transferred to a vacant position within the agency. Because that ruling is contrary to the language of the governing statute and regulations, we reverse.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner Bruce A. Bracey was a civilian employee of the Navy at the Naval Aviation Depot in Norfolk, Virginia, where he held the position of Electronics Worker, WG-2604-8. In 1991, he suffered several work-related injuries. As a result of his injuries, the Navy assigned Mr. Bracey to the light-duty shop at the facility where he worked. He worked there between 1991 and 1993, and again between April 1995 and September 28, 1996, when the Navy separated him as a result of a reduction in force that accompanied the closure of the Naval Aviation Depot. While he was assigned to the light-duty shop, Mr. Bracey retained the grade and pay of his Electronics Worker position, but the tasks he performed were not those of an Electronics Worker.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 13, 1996, before the facility was closed, Mr. Bracey filed an application for disability retirement. OPM, however, denied the application. It found that although his injuries prevented him from performing the duties of his Electronics Worker position, he was not entitled to disability retirement because his employing agency had accommodated his medical condition by providing him with light-duty work that was within his medical restrictions and was not temporary in nature.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute governing entitlement to disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System provides that an employee is eligible for disability retirement if he becomes disabled after completing five years of civilian service. 5 U.S.C. 8337(a). The statute defines disability as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> The pertinent OPM regulation elaborates on the statutory definition by providing that an employee is eligible for disability retirement only if (1) the disabling medical condition is expected to continue for at least one year; (2) the condition results in a deficiency in performance, conduct, or attendance, or is incompatible with useful and efficient service or retention in the employee's position; and (3) the agency is unable to accommodate the disabling condition in the employee's position or in an existing vacant position. 5 C.F.R. 831.1203(a). The regulation defines "accommodation" to mean "an adjustment made to an employee's job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position," and it defines "useful and efficient service" to mean "acceptable performance of the critical or essential elements" of the employee's position. 5 C.F.R. 831.1202. Read together, the statute and regulation provide that an employee is ineligible for disability retirement in two specific circumstances: (1) if the employee, with appropriate adjustments to the job or work environment, can perform the critical or essential elements of his own position; or (2) if the employee is qualified for reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same grade or level as the employee's current position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, OPM argued that a light-duty assignment constitutes a "position" for purposes of the disability retirement regulations, even if it is not a formally established position, and even if the employee cannot perform the duties of his or her position of record or any established position within the agency. Accordingly, OPM argued that even though Mr. Bracey was not able to perform the duties of his Electronics Worker position and even though he was not reassigned (or qualified for reassignment) to a vacant established position within the agency at the same grade and pay, he was not eligible for disability retirement because the agency was able to find work for him and was willing to retain him at his former grade and pay level.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this court, OPM has refined its legal argument. It does not contend, as it did before the Board, that Mr. Bracey has been assigned to a new, albeit unclassified, "position" in the agency. Instead, OPM argues that Mr. Bracey has been "accommodated" in his original Electronics Worker position by being given a light-duty assignment, and that he occupies the "accommodated position" of Electronics Worker, even though he is not performing the official duties of the Electronics Worker position. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Mr. Bracey cannot be denied the relief he seeks either on the theory that his light-duty assignment constitutes an assignment to a "vacant position" at the same grade and pay, or on the theory that his light-duty assignment constitutes an "accommodation" of his disability in his Electronics Worker position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to OPM's argument before the Board that his light-duty position could properly be viewed as a "vacant position" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8337(a), Mr. Bracey argues that his light-duty assignment was not a "position" and therefore not a "vacant position"--because it was not formally described, classified, or graded. We agree with Mr. Bracey that OPM's argument fails, because the term "vacant position" in section 8337 refers to an officially established position that is graded and classified, not to an informal assignment of work that an agency gives to an employee who cannot perform the duties of his official position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A "position" in the federal employment system is required to be classified and graded in accordance with the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements associated with it. The "resulting position-classification system" is "used in all phases of personnel administration." 5 U.S.C. 5101(2). We are aware of no setting in the federal employment system in which an employee is considered to hold a "position" consisting of a set of ungraded, unclassified duties that have been assigned to that employee on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis, and the government has not called our attention to any instance in which the term "position" is used in that manner. As Vice Chair Slavet pointed out, to define the term "vacant position" in that manner would be fundamentally inconsistent with the highly formalized federal personnel system in which hiring, compensation, evaluation, and retention decisions are all made based on the classifications, grades, and performance elements of formally established "positions."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the statutory scheme established by section 8337(a) would be unworkable if "vacant position" were defined to mean simply a set of duties selected on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis to fit the needs of a particular disabled employee. It would be impossible to determine whether the employee could provide "useful and efficient service" in the vacant position, as required by section 8337(a), without a formal description of the duties of the position, including the critical or essential elements of the position, against which to measure the employee's performance. <span class="Italic">See</span>5 C.F.R. 831.1202 (defining "useful and efficient service" in terms of performance of the critical or essential duties of the employee's position). Similarly, a "vacant position" must be graded in order to determine whether it is "at the same grade or level," as required by section 8337(a) and 5 C.F.R. 831.1202 (defining "vacant position" as "an unoccupied position of the same grade or pay level and tenure"), and to determine whether the employee is "qualified for reassignment" to that position, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.1202 (defining "qualified for reassignment" as "able to meet the minimum requirements for the grade and series of the vacant position in question"). Indeed, it would be difficult to determine whether a "vacant position" exists and whether an employee can be reassigned to it except with reference to established positions. The use of the term "vacant" modifying "position" thus supports construing the term "vacant position" to mean something that is definite and already in existence rather than an unclassified set of duties devised to meet the needs of a particular employee who cannot perform the duties of his official position. For those reasons, we conclude that Mr. Bracey was not "qualified for reassignment...to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service." 5 U.S.C. 8337(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4138"></span>In this court, OPM does not argue that Mr. Bracey's light-duty assignment constituted assignment to a "vacant position." Instead, OPM argues that Mr. Bracey's light-duty assignment constituted an "accommodation" of his disability within his Electronics Worker position and that he was ineligible for disability retirement on that ground. That argument, however, is contrary to the plain terms of the statutory and regulatory scheme.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found, and OPM does not dispute, that because of his medical condition Mr. Bracey was unable to perform the duties of his official Electronics Worker position and that the light duties to which he was assigned were not those of his official position but "were those of a lower-graded job." OPM's argument thus turns on its contention that it was not necessary for Mr. Bracey to be able to perform the duties of his official position in order for him "to render useful and efficient service" in that position, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 8337(a). Put another way, OPM contends that the assignment of duties different from those of his official position was the "accommodation" that the OPM regulations required the agency to provide in order to enable Mr. Bracey to render useful and efficient service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The problem with that argument is that it runs headlong into the regulatory definitions of "useful and efficient service" and "accommodation." OPM's regulations define "useful and efficient service" to mean "acceptable performance of the critical or essential elements of the position." 5 C.F.R. 831.1202. The Board's finding that Mr. Bracey did not perform the duties of his official Electronics Worker position, but performed the duties of a lower-graded position, means that he did not perform the "critical or essential elements" of the Electronics Worker position in his light-duty post. He thus was not able to render "useful and efficient service in [his] position," 5 U.S.C. 8337(a), as that phrase is defined in OPM's regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying on the regulatory definition of "accommodation," the government contends that Mr. Bracey's light-duty assignment "accommodated" his disability because the agency "restructur[ed] the job" by assigning him to light duty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.1202 (defining "accommodation" to mean "an adjustment made to an employee's job" that includes "restructuring the job"). For that reason, the government argues, Mr. Bracey was ineligible for disability retirement because the Navy was able "to accommodate the disabling medical condition in the position held or in an existing vacant position." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.1203(a)(4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The flaw in the government's argument is that the regulatory definition of an "accommodation" requires that the adjustment made to the employee's job or work environment "enable[&#8197;] the employee to perform the duties of the position,"<span class="Italic">i.e.,</span> the employee's official position, in this case the position of Electronics Worker, WG-2604-8. As the Board made clear, however, the purported accommodation did not enable Mr. Bracey to continue to perform the duties of his official Electronics Worker position. The light-duty assignment therefore cannot be considered an "accommodation" as that term is used in the regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government seeks to avoid the effect of the regulatory definitions by arguing that although Mr. Bracey was not performing the duties of his official Electronics Worker position, he was performing the duties of an "accommodated position," i.e., his light-duty assignment, even though he was never formally reassigned to a new position, and even though he was never given a new set of critical elements by which to measure his performance in the "accommodated position." The government's argument simply cannot be squared with the language of OPM's regulation, which requires that an accommodation enable the employee to perform the duties of "the position." The term "the position" plainly refers to the employee's official position. If the term "the position" referred to an "accommodated position" as the government's argument suggests, the accommodation regulation would be circular: "accommodation" could be achieved by selecting any duties whatsoever, no matter how unrelated to the duties of the employee's official position, and by declaring those duties to be the duties of the "accommodated position." That is not a reasonable interpretation of the regulatory requirement that an "accommodation" be "an adjustment made to an employee's job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, the statutory and regulatory scheme provides two ways for an agency to retain a disabled employee-by assigning the employee to an established vacant position at the same grade and pay, or by accommodating the employee's disability in a way that enables the employee to perform the duties of his official position. The Navy did neither in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In support of its argument that Mr. Bracey is ineligible for disability retirement, OPM points to provisions of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. 701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> and the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. 8101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span> The Rehabilitation Act and FECA, OPM suggests, may impose a duty on the employing agency to offer an individual a light-duty assignment in lieu of separation and therefore would conflict with the requirements of section 8337 if that statute is read to authorize disability retirement for an employee who can perform useful work but not within his official position or any other established vacant position in the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to OPM's contention, nothing in the Rehabilitation Act or its implementing regulations conflicts with our interpretation of the disability retirement scheme. The Rehabilitation Act regulations require that if an employee cannot perform the essential functions of his position even with reasonable accommodation, the agency must reassign the employee to a "vacant position...at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the individual would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary," unless such a reassignment would result in undue hardship to the agency. 29 C.F.R. 1614.203(g). When an employee cannot perform the essential functions of his position even with reasonable accommodation, "the employee has a duty to identify a vacant, funded position whose essential functions he is capable of performing." <span class="Italic">Mengine v. Runyon,</span> 114 F.3d 415, 420 (3d Cir. 1997). An agency is not required to create a light-duty position for the employee. <span class="Italic">See Shiring v. Runyon,</span> 90 F.3d 827, 831 (3d Cir. 1996). Therefore, consistent with the disability retirement statute, the Rehabilitation Act requires an agency to provide an employee with work in an existing position only if such work is available and the employee is able to perform the essential duties of that position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, OPM's interpretation of "position" in section 8337 would appear to be contrary to the use of that term in the Rehabilitation Act. If "position" were an informal assignment defined simply by the duties an employee is capable of performing, an employee could construct a suitable "position" and require an agency to implement it in order to avoid violating the Act. The <span class="Italic">Shiring</span> court rejected such an argument, explaining:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The [light-duty] position to which [Shiring] was temporarily assigned was not an official position, but had been created by the Postal Service to give Shiring something to do on a temporary basis. Therefore, Shiring's suggestion that he would have been qualified to perform the requirements of such a position does not help his case because under the Act employers are not required to create positions specifically for the handicapped employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">90 F.3d at 831. OPM offers no reason why the word "position" should be read differently in these two related contexts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's argument based on FECA is also unconvincing. FECA provides that if a government employee is injured on the job, the employee is entitled to certain benefits, including compensation for the injury. One of the conditions of continuing to receive those benefits is that a partially disabled employee must be willing to accept "suitable work" when the agency offers such work. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. 8106(c)(2); 20 C.F.R. 10.515(b). The employee's refusal to accept such work results in termination of his FECA benefits. If the employee's disability renders the employee eligible for disability retirement, however, the employee is free to refuse the offer of such work and to take disability retirement instead of the FECA benefits. The two schemes offer different benefits under different circumstances, and there is nothing anomalous about the fact that an employee may be eligible for one set of benefits while being ineligible for the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM relies in part on the legislative history of the 1980 amendment to the Civil Service Retirement Act. That amendment overturned a judicial decision, <span class="Italic">Cerrano v. Fleishman,</span> 339 F.2d 929 (2d Cir. 1964), in which the court had held that a disabled employee had to take disability retirement because the employee could not perform useful and efficient service in his official position. Congress amended the statute to provide that before the employee is considered to be disabled, the agency must determine that the employee is not qualified for reassignment to a vacant position at the same grade level. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 96-1167, at 206 (1980), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1980 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5526, 5651. As we have discussed, that provision was not satisfied here because Mr. Bracey was not shown to be qualified for reassignment to a "vacant position" within the agency at the same grade and pay level. Nothing in the legislative history of the 1980 amendment suggests that the agency may avoid disability retirement simply by assigning an injured employee to an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> set of light duties as long as it continues to pay the employee at the same level as before.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are likewise not persuaded by OPM's argument of congressional acquiescence. OPM contends that it has interpreted the statute consistently for years and that if Congress had disagreed with that construction, it would have altered it. As we have indicated, the plain language of OPM's regulations suggests an interpretation of the statute that is quite the opposite of the interpretation OPM has offered here. We are unwilling to assume that Congress, if it adverted to this issue at all, read past OPM's regulations, discovered OPM's actual practice under those regulations, and gave its tacit approval to that practice by failing to amend the disability retirement statutes.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have noted, the problem with OPM's legal theory lies principally in OPM's own regulations. If OPM is persuaded that the statute should be read to permit the kind of informal light-duty assignment that occurred in this case as a means of avoiding disability retirement, it should revise <span id="Page_4139"></span>its regulations accordingly. The Board--and this court--would then be required to determine whether OPM's interpretation of the statute was reasonable, a determination that would then not be skewed by regulatory language squarely at odds with OPM's litigating position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's final argument is that this case involves a factual inquiry that is outside this court's jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 470 U.S. 768 (1985). <span class="Italic">Lindahl</span> holds that 5 U.S.C. 8347(c) bars this court from reviewing "the factual underpinnings of...disability determinations," 470 U.S. at 791, but does not bar review of legal questions, such as whether OPM and the Board have misapplied a statute or committed some error "going to the heart of the administrative scheme,"<span class="Italic">id.</span> In this case, there is no dispute about the pertinent facts, and certainly no dispute about the "factual underpinnings" of the determination that Mr. Bracey was disabled. OPM and the Board both found that Mr. Bracey's medical condition rendered him incapable of performing the duties of his Electronics Worker position and that his duties in his light-duty assignment were not those of his official position. We accept those findings, which the government does not challenge. Accordingly, we have not reviewed the "factual underpinnings" of a disability determination, but have addressed only the issue of the proper construction of the pertinent statute and regulations to a case in which the facts are undisputed. Our review of the legal issue in this case is thus entirely consistent with <span class="Italic">Lindahl.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on our analysis of the CSRS disability retirement scheme, we are satisfied that Mr. Bracey is not disqualified for disability benefits by virtue of his assignment to the light-duty shop. We therefore reverse the order of the Merit Systems Protection Board and remand the case for further proceedings relating to Mr. Bracey's disability retirement application.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit followed <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> in a FERS appeal, <span class="Italic">Marino v. OPM</span>, 243 F.3d 1375, 1377-78 (Fed. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have recently considered this same question for employees serving under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). <span class="Italic">See Bracey v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 236 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The only difference between disability retirement under CSRS and disability retirement under FERS is that the preambles to the two regulations state the different eligibility requirements for the two retirement systems. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 C.F.R. 831.1203 <span class="Italic">with</span> 5 C.F.R. 844.103. Otherwise, the conditions in the two regulations are identical. Because of the similarities between the two retirement systems, commentary on one helps to construe the other. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 142 F.3d 1463, 1470 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> we held that the adjustment made to the employee's job or work environment must enable the employee to continue to perform the duties of his or her official position. 236 F.3d at 1361. A "light-duty assignment therefore cannot be considered an 'accommodation' as that term is used in the regulations." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, Marino was never assigned to another position within the agency. Until his separation, he maintained his official position of Materials Handler. His assignment to light duties, therefore, was not an accommodation which allowed him to perform the duties of his official position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Marino also asserts that the board incorrectly weighed the evidence of his disability. We may not review the factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations. <span class="Italic">Anthony,</span> 58 F.3d at 626. However, he argues that in determining his disability, the board improperly relied upon his ability to perform useful and efficient service in his unofficial light duty position, and not his official position of Materials Handler. This is an alleged error going to the heart of the administrative determination, which we may review. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The board found that Marino suffers from allergies and respiratory problems, but concluded that the evidence did not support a finding of disability. In so concluding, it relied on OPM's finding that Marino was "providing useful and efficient service in the <span class="Italic">accommodation</span> position."<span class="Italic">Marino</span> at 7 (emphasis added). Marino acknowledged that he was able to perform any activity in a dust-free (accommodated) environment, but could not provide useful and efficient service as a Materials Handler. Section 8451 of title 5 of the United States Code requires a finding that the employee is unable "to render useful and efficient service in the employee's <span class="Italic">position.</span>" (Emphasis added). As we stated in <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> "[a] 'position' in the federal employment system is required to be classified and graded in accordance with the duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements associated with it." 236 F.3d at 1359. Therefore, any evaluation of useful and efficient service for disability purposes must be with respect to the employee's official position, not an unofficial light duty assignment.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Our dissenting colleague contends, in agreement with OPM, that the appellant's application for disability retirement should be denied based on Dr. Lewis's February 2004 assertion that it did not seem "logical" to deem the appellant disabled on the basis of his low back symptoms since he had been able to continue to work until the time his job was terminated. However, this disposition is squarely at odds with the decision of our reviewing court in <span class="Italic">Bracey.</span> As in <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> prior to his termination due to a reduction-in-force, the appellant had been assigned to light-duty work following an injury to his back. Moreover, it is apparent that the light duties assigned to the appellant constituted an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> attempt to provide duties within his medical limitations, rather than an assignment to a vacant position. Indeed, the undisputed evidence shows that the appellant had been unable to work an eight hour day for many years and that the various light duty assignments he performed were primarily clerical duties associated with ordering and issuing tools and equipment and keeping an inventory of the tools and equipment checked in and out. Although the position description for the appellant's position as a Tool Room Mechanic indicates that it entailed some recordkeeping responsibilities, it additionally indicates that the essential functions of this position were primarily physical in nature and included lifting, standing, bending, kneeling and reaching, all of which the appellant was unable to do. Where, as here, an employee is given a light-duty assignment that does not enable him to continue performing the critical or essential elements of his official position, <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> compels a finding that he has not been afforded an accommodation disqualifying his entitlement to a disability retirement annuity. <span class="Italic">See Bracey,</span> 236 F.3d at 1359-61. Accordingly, we find, in agreement with the administrative judge, that the appellant has established his entitlement to disability benefits by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A temporary light duty position was not a suitable reassignment, <span class="Italic">Benjamin v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 187, 192 (1990):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his memorandum of May 5, 1988, the appellant's supervisor stated that "[t]hese 'light duty' assignments were never intended as a permanent solution. They are a common practice in cases where an employee has a temporary injury and is expected to recover." Although the supervisor later testified at the hearing that a permanent light-duty position would have been a possibility, it would have required rewriting the appellant's position or some other formal action for it to be done permanently, and no formal action was ever taken in that respect.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although both the Supervisor's Statement (SF-2824B) and the Agency Certification of Reassignment and Accommodation Efforts (SF-2824D) indicated that accommodation efforts had been made by assigning the appellant to temporary light duty, neither certified that such duty would continue. Moreover, there was unrebutted testimony at the hearing that the appellant's position had been abolished for budgetary reasons.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.502(b)(7), an offered position must be, among other things, of the same tenure as the position from which the employee seeks disability retirement. "Tenure" is defined at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 210.102(b)(17) as "the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment." The appellant occupied a full-time, permanent position. The record reflects that the assignments offered to him were only temporary light-duty assignments. Thus, because the <span id="Page_4140"></span>assignments were not permanent, they did not constitute a reasonable accommodation of his medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Noyer v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 336, 339 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find this case to be similar to <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 30 M.S.P.R. 153, 156 (1986), where the Board expressly relied upon additional evidence that the employee's light-duty position was later abolished in finding that the employing agency could no longer continue to accommodate him, since this was the only means of accommodating the employee. Here, the employing agency certified that reassignment was not possible because there were no vacant positions for which the appellant qualified. We thus find that the appellant established by preponderant evidence that his light-duty status would not continue.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following the <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> analysis, <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, SF-844E-12-0489-I-1 (NP 9/9/2013), determined that the appellant was eligible to disability retirement when the agency took altered the set of duties ordinarily assigned to the appellant, meaning that the employee was not performing significant job responsibilities as a police officer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that the agency did not require the appellant to perform any part of his job that caused him pain, granting him what the administrative judge described as a "very liberal, <span class="Italic">de facto</span> accommodation." For example, the appellant testified that as of March 2010, his condition worsened such that he was unable to walk for days at a time and that, when he discussed his circumstances with his supervisor in April 2010, she advised him to not do anything to irritate his back and instead "just be here." The appellant claimed that his medical condition rendered him unable to subdue or apprehend suspects, as his position required, and he was concerned not only for his safety but also for the safety of others because he "was no longer able to assist someone in an emergency situation," another of the major duties and responsibilities of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, with regard to the first method for establishing eligibility for a disability retirement annuity, the administrative judge found it "very significant that the appellant's employing agency did not report any deficiency in [the appellant's] performance or conduct" relative to his medical condition. However, as noted above, the record reflects that the agency did not require the appellant to perform all the duties of his Police Officer position, consistently advising him to refrain from those duties that aggravated his medical condition. It appears, therefore, that the agency did not find any deficit in the appellant's performance because it did not require him to perform all the duties of his Police Officer position. But, just excusing an employee from performing significant portions of their duties is not an accommodation. <span class="Italic">E.g., Bracey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 236 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The pertinent regulations define accommodation "as a reasonable adjustment made to an employee's job or work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties of the position." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.102. Excusing the appellant from significant portions of his duties does not enable him to perform the duties of his Police Officer position. <span class="Italic">See Bracey</span>, 236 F.3d at 1361. As a result, the agency's failure to find a deficit in the appellant's performance is not helpful or even pertinent to the analysis of his disability claim. Instead, the relevant question is whether the appellant could perform the duties of his official position, not the duties of an ad-hoc "accommodation" position with indefinite duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's analysis of the second method by which the appellant may demonstrate his entitlement to a disability retirement annuity, i.e., by showing that his medical condition is incompatible with either useful and efficient service or retention in his Police Officer position, is inapposite. In that regard, the administrative judge found that "[n]either Dr. Mak nor Dr. Lee addressed the question of why the appellant could not continue working as a Police Officer if he would not be required to perform any physical tasks causing him pain." Again, whether the appellant was able to perform a set of duties other than that of his official position is not the right question. <span class="Italic">See Bracey</span>, 236 F.3d at 1361-62 (an informal assignment defined simply by the duties an employee is capable of performing is not a position). The proper question is whether the employee's medical impairments preclude him from rendering useful and efficient service in his official position. <span class="Italic">Id.; Jackson</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 6, &#x00B6; 7; <span class="Italic">Henderson</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 313, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the appellant's physicians wrote letters indicating that the appellant's medical condition, degenerative disc disease, rendered him unable to perform the essential elements of his duties as a Police Officer. On July 27, 2010, Dr. Peter Lee of the Palo Alto Veterans Affairs Health Care System wrote that he had treated the appellant over the prior 31/2 years for ongoing lower back pain that was increasing in severity and rendered the appellant unable to perform the physical elements of his position "including arresting, apprehending, [and] subduing, individuals suspected of committing crimes, as well as physically assisting victims." Dr. Lee also wrote that the appellant was limited in his ability to stand, sit, walk, and run and that, in his opinion, the appellant was unable to perform his job for the foreseeable future. Just under 2 months later, Dr. Mak of the Permanente Medical Group included significantly more detail regarding the appellant's duties and job requirements and opined that, "because of reduced strength and the precarious state of his back, [the appellant's] continuation in such a job would have placed not only himself but potentially others, in danger." Dr. Mak further opined that the appellant's condition was most likely permanent. Moreover, the appellant also submitted extensive medical treatment records that, as the administrative judge noted, substantiate the doctors' assertions.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Earlier law may have more favorably evaluated light duty placements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Pernicano v. OPM</span>, 9 MSPR 530 (1982) (a factor in the Board's deliberation is whether the light duty assignment is permanent, meaning that it is the last position occupied.); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Kirwin v. OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 683 (1984) (examining ability of appellant to perform in a permanent light duty position).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an appellant should not be retired on disability where the disability can be reasonably accommodated by the agency. <span class="Italic">See Bruno v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPB 1 (1982). <span class="Italic">Also see Appleman v. U.S. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 MSPB 265 (1982). In the instant case, the record shows that appellant has certain limitations because of his back condition. These include his inability to lift 70 pounds on a continuous or frequently repeated basis. Appellant is also precluded from standing or sitting for long periods of time. The appellant's employing agency, the U.S. Postal Service, certified that appellant was in a limited duty status which accommodated his limitations, and that such limited duty could continue. Appellant's supervisor stated that he was still performing his assigned, duties as a limited duty employee, albeit with occasional problems because of medication. Thus, although appellant's medical evidence of record shows that he cannot perform the full range of Distribution Clerk duties, there is no showing that appellant cannot perform the limited duties assigned to him, and no showing that this limited duty status will not continue.</p>

OPM</span>, 69 MSPR 115, 122 (1995) ("An applicant for disability retirement who can perform assigned limited duties as an accommodation must, however, show by preponderant evidence that such limited-duty status will not continue and that there is no suitable vacant position to which the applicant can be reassigned."); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Breyer v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 628, 630 (1992) (light duty assignment was accommodation for the appellant's physical condition; if he can perform the light duties assigned to him, he must show that his light duty status will not continue).</p>
