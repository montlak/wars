<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;an unmarried dependent child under 18 years of age, including (i) an adopted child, and (ii) a stepchild but only if the stepchild lived with the employee or Member in a regular parent-child relationship, and (iii) a recognized natural child, and (iv) a child who lived with and for whom a petition of adoption was filed by an employee or Member, and who is adopted by the surviving spouse of the employee or Member after his death;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;such unmarried dependent child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;such unmarried dependent child between 18 and 22 years of age who is a student regularly pursuing a full-time course of study or training in residence in a high school, trade school, technical or vocational institute, junior college, college, university, or comparable recognized educational institution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For the purpose of this paragraph and subsection (e) of this section, a child whose 22nd birthday occurs before July 1 or after August 31 of a calendar year, and while he is regularly pursuing such a course of study or training, is deemed to have become 22 years of age on the first day of July after that birthday. A child who is a student is deemed not to have ceased to be a student during an interim between school years if the interim is not more than 5 months and if he shows to the satisfaction of the Office of Personnel Management that he has a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> intention of continuing to pursue a course of study or training in the same or different school during the school semester (or other period into which the school year is divided) immediately after the interim.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If an employee or Member dies after completing at least 18 months of civilian service, or an employee or Member dies after retiring under this subchapter, and is survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;60 percent of the average pay of the employee or Member divided by the number of children;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;$900; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;$2,700 divided by the number of children;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">subject to section 8340 of this title. If the employee or Member is not survived by a spouse or a former spouse who is the natural or adoptive parent of a surviving child of the employee or Member, that surviving child is entitled to an annuity equal to the smallest of--</p>

This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the child--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;becomes capable of self-support after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then such a student;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;becomes 22 years of age if he is then such a student and capable of self-support;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;ceases to be such a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then incapable of self-support; or</p>

<p class="Body-Text">For explanation of the CSRS and FERS benefits, refer to the Congressional Research Service report, "Survivor Benefits for Families of Civilian Federal Employees and Retirees" (April 2014) <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21029">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/RS21029</a>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sawyer v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 201, 203-06 (1988), discussed the nature of, and termination of, survivor annuity benefits for a child who is not capable of self-support because of a physical disability incurred before age 18:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the physically disabled son of a deceased annuitant, the appellant received survivor annuity benefits from the time of his mother's death in 1976 until 1984. OPM terminated his benefits in 1984 upon determining that he was no longer "incapable of self-support because of a...physical disability incurred before age 18..." as required under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(B).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the administrative judge's initial decision, she considered the medical evidence and work history of the appellant, and concluded that he submitted no evidence that he was incapable of self-support. She therefore affirmed OPM's reconsideration decision terminating the appellant's survivor annuity benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant contends that, in judging whether an individual is capable of self-support, the Board should apply the same standards in judging whether an individual has recovered from a disability as are employed by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(f), the SSA cannot terminate a recipient's disability benefits unless there is "substantial evidence which demonstrates that...there has been any medical improvement in the [recipient's] impairment...and that the [recipient] is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity." The appellant argues that OPM should be required to apply this "medical improvement" standard in deciding whether to terminate his annuity benefits. Specifically, he asserts that under the SSA there is a presumption of continuing disability which must be overcome by substantial evidence before it can be found that an annuitant is capable of substantial gainful activity. OPM has not submitted a reply to the appellant's petition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this issue was raised at the hearing, the administrative judge did not address it. We shall therefore consider it here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, entitlement to civil service retirement benefits must be determined by reference to the statute and regulations governing these benefits. <span class="Italic">See Zucker v. United States,</span> 758 F.2d 637, 640 (Fed. Cir. 1985). There are, however, no statutory or regulatory definitions of the phrase "incapable of self-support" for purposes of determining entitlement to a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341; and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.603. Neither the legislative history of the statutory standard nor the Federal Personnel Manual contains any indication of the legislative intent as to the meaning of the "incapable of self-support" standard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the Social Security Disability Reform Act of 1984 at 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(f) became effective on October 9, 1984, while section 8341 of Title 5 was amended on November 8, 1984, and, since that date, on both February 27 and April 7, 1986. Consistent with the general rules of statutory construction, Congress can be presumed to know that the courts had interpreted the Social Security "medical improvement" standard to involve a presumption of a continuing disability which must be overcome before benefits may be terminated, and that OPM had applied its "incapable of self-support" standard differently. If Congress had intended that the same or a similar presumption was to be read into the "incapable of self-support" standard, it would have expressed that intention when it amended the retirement law, and its failure to do so indicates a purpose not to. Any change in OPM's application of the statutory standard for the termination of disability retirement annuity benefits should originate with Congress, not the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well established in American jurisprudence generally and in civil service retirement cases specifically, that one who asserts entitlement to statutory benefits bears the burden of proving that he meets the statutory criteria for such entitlement. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 404-15 (1981), and cases cited therein. The Board has also held that an annuitant receiving disability retirement benefits bears the burden of demonstrating that the disability, and thus the entitlement to an annuity, continues. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Prestien v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 8 M.S.P.R. 698, 704 (1981). <span class="Italic">See also McMakin v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 32 M.S.P.R. 294, 298-99 (1987) (retiree not entitled to continuation of disability retirement annuity on basis that physical condition was essentially unchanged since he was granted disability retirement, where present medical evidence did not render him disabled). Other than his reliance on the SSA cases, the appellant had advanced no reason to conclude that the burden should be different with respect to a survivor annuitant's right to continuing benefits based on his continuing disability. We find in that analogy insufficient basis for a conclusion which is directly contrary to the Board's holdings in the civil service retirement cases noted above.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having determined that the burden of proof should not be shifted in this case, however, our inquiry is not ended since neither the initial decision nor OPM's reconsideration decision states explicitly how the statutory phrase "incapable of self-support" is to be interpreted. When the intention of the legislature is not clear from the face of the statute and there is a question as to its meaning, it is necessary to seek further interpretation elsewhere. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 24 M.S.P.R. 379, <span id="Page_4267"></span>381 (1984). However, none of the analogous statutes we have examined reflects an interpretation of the phrase under consideration. Therefore, we agree with the appellant that it is appropriate to use relevant portions of the Social Security Act (Act) as guidance. <span class="Italic">See Salazar v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 31 M.S.P.R. 248, 250-51 (1986) (the Board approved of the administrative judge's decision on the definition of "stepchild" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 on guidance from the Act); and <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 419-23 (1981) (the Board analyzed the disability benefits provisions of the Act regarding elements of proof to establish disability under the Civil Service Retirement System). Although we have rejected 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(f) on the burden of proof issue regarding medical improvement, it is nonetheless useful to apply the implementing regulations of the "substantial gainful activity" standard, since the dominant purpose embodied in the statutory scheme of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 is to promote financial support for dependent survivors. <span class="Italic">See Gentry v. United States,</span> 546 F.2d 343 (Ct. Cl. 1976), <span class="Italic">reh. den.</span> 551 F.2d 852 (1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While on is phrased in the positive and the other in the negative, we find that the Social Security standard of "able to engage in substantial gainful activity" is sufficiently similar to the civil service retirement standard of "incapable of self-support" to be relevant here. The essence of both is to set a standard by which to determine whether the person receiving benefits should continue to receive them or whether he could work and thereby support himself. Basically, under the Act, substantial gainful activity is work that involves doing significant physical or mental activities, even if done on a part-time basis; work which is done for pay or profit, whether or not a profit is realized. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572. In addition, the impairment must render the individual incapable of performing any occupation suitable for his age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity. <span class="Italic">See Lyons v. Heckler,</span> 638 F. Supp. 706, 710 (E.D. PA. 1986). <span class="Italic">See also</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1529.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant suffers from a loss of vision to the right side in both eyes and complains of "fatigue and some emotional problems. The record contains little medical evidence supporting the asserted severity of appellant's problems, however. Considering the nature of these impairments, we find that the appellant could engage in some form of light duty or sedentary work for remuneration. In addition, it appears that the appellant possesses the means, marketable skills and ability to satisfactorily hold a position[10] that provides some measure of income, and that he could perform basic work-related activities. In sum, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that although appellant submitted evidence to show that he could not engage in strenuous job duties, he has not established by preponderance evidence that he is incapable of self-support by performing work suitable to his age, education and training, and work experience. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1512. Accordingly, we agree with OPM that the appellant has failed to show that his medical condition precludes employment. <span class="Italic">Cf. Kimsey v. Department of the Interior</span>, 24 M.S.P.R. 528, 532 (1984) (the administrative agency's interpretation of its own regulations, or of an act with the implementation of which it is charged, is generally entitled to great deference unless the interpretation is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or act). The appellant has not shown that OPM erred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;Under certain circumstances, part-time employment is adequate. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572(a). Thus, it is not necessary to determine if the appellant is not capable of working an eight-hour day, as he claims.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Staples v. OPM</span>, 68 MSPR 570, 573-77 (1995), also discussed the standard for determining the incapacity for self support and the means for tracing whether an injury or disease began before age 18:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, to show entitlement to the retirement benefits he seeks.&#8197;...Section 8341(a)(4)(B) of title 5 of the United States Code governs the appellant's entitlement to survivor annuity benefits. It provides that the "unmarried dependent child" of a deceased Federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity, regardless of age, if he "is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because OPM has found that the appellant established that he was an unmarried dependent child, it is necessary to determine whether he has satisfied the other requirement of the statute, i.e., whether he has shown that he is incapable of self-support because of a disability incurred before age eighteen....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying a standard developed by the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Board has defined the phrase "incapable of self-support" to mean that the appellant's impairment must render him incapable of performing any occupation suitable for his age, education, work experience, and residual functional capacity. <span class="Italic">See Salarzon v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 588, 592 (1990), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 925 F.2d 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table); <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. Office of Personnel Management</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 201, 205-06. The documentary evidence on that issue contains information reported by a high school counselor, a treating physician, a social worker, and the appellant's mother. Each of them confirms that all of the appellant's attempts to maintain employment have been thwarted by his paranoid schizophrenic condition, which has been clinically diagnosed as severe and chronic. When the appellant has obtained employment, the manifestations of his condition have resulted in his inability to meet the requirements of the job at issue. In addition, it appears that his mother has had to assume responsibility for taking care of the appellant and managing his financial affairs due to his inability to discharge such responsibilities. Based on the documentary record before us, then, we find that the appellant has established by preponderant evidence that he is "incapable of self-support."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only remaining issue, then, is whether the appellant incurred his condition before age eighteen. The earliest clinical diagnosis in the record of the appellant's schizophrenia is dated June 24, 1987, when the appellant was twenty years old. The treating physician (Dr. Gary Crawley), however, cited history supplied by the appellant's mother (Elizabeth Staples), suggesting that the appellant had shown symptoms of that condition four years prior to the diagnosis. In a September 1994 report again assessing the appellant's condition as schizophrenia, a social worker (Vikkie Tucker) outlined a history of the condition that was given to her by Mrs. Staples. According to that history, the appellant's behavior changed when he was approximately fifteen years old, and the change was manifested by: A rigid, staccato gait; flat affect; poor self-care skills; diminished appetite; striking his mother and siblings without provocation; social isolation; poor performance as a student and wage-earner; and hallucinatory episodes in which he would hear voices or see "electric robots."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In two statements regarding her son's condition, Mrs. Staples confirmed that the appellant had hallucinations involving various sights and sounds between the ages of fourteen and seventeen and that he also performed poorly in high school and became socially isolated during that period. A high school guidance counselor (Martin McAfee) reported that the appellant had graduated from high school on May 30, 1985, with a ranking of 334 in a class of 334 and a grade-point average of 0.77 on a 4.0 scale. He stated that the appellant was a "loner" and "non-communicative"; was disruptive and would mumble to himself or appear to be off in another world; was unable to "react with others in a social way"; and could not maintain any kind of employment. Another individual (Gloria Ford) stated, based on her personal observation of the appellant, that he had become antisocial and had acted strangely and exhibited unusual behavior since 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence regarding the appellant's condition before age eighteen thus is largely subjective (based on the observations of Mrs. Staples, Ms. Ford, and Mr. McAfee), although Dr. Crawley and Ms. Tucker did find that the observations reported by Mrs. Staples supported a diagnosis of a schizophrenic condition. In the analogous context of disability retirement cases, however, the Board has held that subjective evidence of disability is relevant and important in supplementing the available objective clinical findings and diagnoses; it is permissible to accord such evidence great probative value. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rozar v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 136, 141 (1994)] . Objective evidence is but one of the elements of proof to be considered, along with expert opinion evidence and subjective evidence, in evaluating a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Chavez v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. 404, 422 (981). In fact, it is well-established that, when objective medical evidence and expert diagnostic opinion are not adequate to determine whether a condition has a disabling effect, subjective evidence can support a finding of disability if it is not inconsistent with the objective evidence. <span class="Italic">See Davis v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 10 M.S.P.R. 109, 112 (1982); <span class="Italic">Chavez,</span> 6 M.S.P.R. at 422<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore, long-standing Board precedent allows us to accord great probative weight to the subjective evidence presented by the appellant here; contrary to the assertion contained in the dissenting opinion, then, we have not taken an "impermissible leap" by doing so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">That evidence indicates that the appellant's schizophrenic condition developed before he reached age eighteen. OPM suggests that the appellant also had to show that he was incapable of self-support before age eighteen because of his schizophrenic condition in order to confirm the existence of that disability. The Board, however, has rejected this argument, and OPM has previously stated its agreement that such an interpretation would be unreasonable and incorrect. <span class="Italic">See Ingram v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. 556, 558 n.* (1988). In any event, however, applying OPM's construction here would not change the result. As noted above, the phrase "incapable of self-support" has been defined based on an SSA standard. <span class="Italic">See Sawyer,</span> 36 MSPR at 205-06<span class="Italic">.</span> That standard requires a claimant to show that there is a medically determinable basis for impairment. He can make such a showing by, <span class="Italic">inter alia,</span> introducing medical evidence that he suffers from one or more of the serious impairments described in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix I. If he can demonstrate that he suffers from one of those "listed" impairments, he is considered to have met the SSA standard <span class="Italic">per se. See Kangas v. Bowen,</span> 823 F.2d 775, 777 (3d Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Spada v. Bowen,</span> 687 F. Supp. 188, <span id="Page_4268"></span>190 (E.D. Pa. 1988). In deciding this issue, subjective evidence of pain and disability may be considered along with objective clinical findings and diagnoses. <span class="Italic">See Spada,</span> 687 F. Supp. at 191. The courts have construed the SSA's standard liberally, finding that the remedial intent of the law favors a finding of disability and inclusion rather than exclusion. <span class="Italic">See Rivera v. Schweiker,</span> 717 F.2d 719, 723 (2d Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Black v. Sullivan,</span> 793 F. Supp. 45, 47 (D.R.I. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, subjective evidence shows that the appellant experienced the following symptoms before age eighteen: Hallucinations involving "electric robots" and other sights and sounds; flat and aloof affect; social isolation; unprovoked acts of violence; and impairment in cognitive skills with respect to atrocious academic performance. (The dissenting opinion thus significantly understates the degree of the appellant's impairment when it asserts below that this evidence merely shows that he engaged in "odd or anti-social behavior" and that he demonstrated "poor performance in school.") Proof of those symptoms is enough to establish that the appellant's condition had the required level of severity to be classified as the "listed" impairment of schizophrenia for children under age eighteen. <span class="Italic">See</span> 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Section 112.03. The appellant thus is considered to have met the SSA standard <span class="Italic">per se. See Kangas,</span> 823 F.2d at 777. Since the appellant has met that standard, he has also shown under the Board's definition that he was "incapable of self-support" before age eighteen.&#8197;...Therefore, even under OPM's construction, the appellant has shown that he incurred a disability before age eighteen. Accordingly, we find that the appellant has satisfied the statutory requirements for entitlement to survivor annuity benefits....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Deese v. OPM</span>, 116 MSPR 166, 168-70 &#x00B6; 6-10, 2011 MSPB 46 (2011), also discussed the requirements for an annuity for an unmarried dependent child over the age of 18 who is incapable of self-support because of mental disability incurred before age 18:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proving entitlement to a survivor annuity is on the applicant for benefits. <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 791 F.2d 138, 140-41 (Fed. Cir. 1986). As the administrative judge recognized, the appellant was over 22 years of age at the time of his father's death. Section 8341(a)(4)(B) of title 5 of the United States Code therefore governs the appellant's entitlement to survivor annuity benefits. It provides that the "unmarried dependent child" of a deceased federal employee is entitled to a survivor annuity, regardless of age, if he "is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge stated that, "because the child annuity commences on the day after the employee dies, and the statute makes no provision to allow such an annuity to commence at a later date, the appellant was required to prove that he met the statutory definition of 'child' on the day following his father's death." He thus concluded that the appellant bore the burden of proving, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that at the time of his father's death in 2001, he <span class="Italic">"was</span> incapable of self support."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This was error. The plain language of section 8341(a)(4)(B) requires that an applicant for a child survivor annuity demonstrate that he currently "is incapable of self-support." Thus, the Board has previously rejected as "unreasonable and incorrect" the suggestion that, in addition to the requirement that the appellant establish that he suffered from a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18, he "also had to show that he was incapable of self-support before age eighteen because of his...condition...." <span class="Italic">Staples v.

We also reject as inconsistent with the governing statutory language a requirement that an applicant demonstrate that he "was" incapable of self-support at the time of the employee's or parent's death. Because the administrative judge's conclusion that the appellant failed to establish his entitlement to a child survivor annuity is based solely on his finding that the appellant failed to establish that he was incapable of self-support at the time of his father's death, it cannot be sustained. We therefore VACATE the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, because OPM's reconsideration decision also denied the appellant's application for a survivor annuity based on a lack of medical records showing that the appellant "was" incapable of self-support because of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18, it also employed an incorrect legal standard in denying the appellant's application for a survivor annuity. Because OPM's reconsideration letter contains no determination whether the appellant currently "is incapable of self-support," within the meaning of section 8341(a)(4)(B), we do not have jurisdiction over that issue here. <span class="Italic">See Salarzon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 44 M.S.P.R. 588, 593 (1990),<span class="Italic"> aff'd,</span> 925 F.2d 1479 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.110. We therefore REMAND this matter to OPM for a determination whether the appellant "is incapable of self-support," and if so, whether the appellant's condition is "because of a mental or physical disability incurred before age 18." OPM should make new determinations on these issues in the first instance, taking into consideration the records produced by the appellant below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that under section 8341(a)(4)(B), an applicant must also have been an "unmarried dependent." The statute defines the term "dependent" to mean "in the case of any child,...that the employee or Member involved was, <span class="Italic">at the time of the employee or Member's death,</span> either living with or contributing to the support of such child, as determined in accordance with such regulations as [OPM] shall prescribe." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(3) (emphasis added). Again, because OPM has not made a determination whether the appellant was unmarried or a dependent, we lack jurisdiction to make determinations on those issues in the first instance on review. Accordingly, on remand, OPM should also make determinations on these matters.</p>

In order to qualify for a survivor annuity as a dependent child, the appellant was required to demonstrate that she is an "unmarried dependent child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(B). The statutory right to a dependent child annuity terminates under a variety of circumstances as set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(3), including when the child "ceases to be...a student after becoming 18 years of age unless he is then incapable of self-support." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(3)(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's hearing testimony, she first realized that she had serious eye problems between the ages of 38 and 40 and was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa 8 to 10 years ago. The record reflects that the appellant turned 18 on February 2, 1972, and she testified that she subsequently attended 1-2 years of college at Columbus State University. After that, she held several part-time jobs over the course of her adult life, a full-time job with a credit card company for 10 years in the 1980s, and a fulltime job from 1994-2007 as a paraprofessional in the public school system. She returned to Columbus State University from 1995-1998 to obtain her undergraduate degree. The appellant testified that she never married and lived with her mother, for whom she cared over the course of 30 years until her mother's death in October 2009.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant was capable of self-support after she completed her 1-2 years at Columbus State University after she turned 18. Indeed, the record reflects that she engaged in meaningful employment after her initial period of time at Columbus State University, that she returned to college to obtain her undergraduate degree, and that she supported her mother for 30 years. Furthermore, the appellant does not dispute the administrative judge's finding that she was capable of self-support after she completed her 1-2 years at Columbus State University subsequent to turning 18. Consequently, we agree with the administrative judge's finding that any right to a survivor annuity as a dependent child terminated and there is no provision in the statute to revive such a right.[3] 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(3)(D).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;For example, the statute explicitly revives the right to a dependent child annuity for an individual whose annuity terminated by virtue of marriage and whose marriage subsequently dissolves through divorce or death of the spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(3)(E), (e)(4); <span class="Italic">see</span> Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, sec. 633, &#x00A7; 8341(e)(4), 110 Stat. 3009 (1996).

<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Downs is the son of a retired civil service employee.

Mr. Downs received this annuity as an "unmarried dependent child regardless of age who is incapable of self-support because of mental or physical disability incurred before age 18." 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(a)(4)(B). Mr. Downs, a disabled quadriplegic, qualified for this child survivor's annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On October 7, 1982, Mr. Downs married. Under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(e)-(3)(E) his survivor annuity terminated on the last day of the month before his marriage--September 30, 1982.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Downs divorced on November 24, 1993. After his divorce, Mr. Downs appealed for reinstatement of his child survivor's annuity. The Office of Personnel Management denied Mr. Downs' reinstatement of his annuity because it terminated upon his marriage. The Office of Personnel Management reasoned that no statutory authority permits reinstatement of a child's survivor annuity previously terminated by marriage.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court must affirm the Board's decision absent a showing that it was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, not in accordance with the law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 7703(c) (1994). Entitlement to a survivor annuity under the Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA) is a question of law which this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See Sandel v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 28 F.3d 1184, 1186 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, this court must determine whether the CSRA, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8331, permits reinstatement of a child survivor annuity terminated by marriage when that marriage ends in divorce. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(e)(3). In some limited circumstances, the CSRA allows reinstatement of an annuity terminated by marriage. For instance, section 8341(g) permits reinstatement of a survivor annuity to a remarried widow or widower when the remarriage ends in divorce. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(g). The CSRA, however, contains no similar reinstatement provisions for children or divorced "former spouses" of deceased federal employees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(e)(3) has a reinstatement provision. This section terminates a child's survivor annuity when the child is no longer a student. The same section permits reinstatement of the annuity if the child becomes a student again. 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(e)(3). Sections 8341(g) and 8341(e)(3) show that the CSRA expressly provides reinstatement in some circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8341(a)(4)(B), the section governing child survivor annuities because of mental or physical disability, contains no reinstatement provision. Once terminated by marriage, the CSRA gives no entitlement to reinstatement, even when that marriage ends in divorce. The CSRA creates such a reinstatement opportunity for remarried widows or widowers, but provides no similar opportunity for child survivors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The United States Constitution limits payments of monies from the Federal Treasury to those authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">See Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 2467, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990). Without statutory provision for reinstatement under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8341(a)(4)(B) once the annuitant has married, this court lacks authority to order reinstatement. Mr. Downs' remedy lies with the legislative branch.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's decision is not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise contrary to law. Therefore, this court affirms the Board's decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To obtain a child survivor annuity, the statutory family relationship must be met. Equitable considerations will not govern, <span class="Italic">Cleland v. OPM</span>, 984 F.2d 1193, 1194-95 (Fed. Cir. 1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner, Clara T. Cleland (Cleland), seeks review of the February 19, 1991 decision of the administrative judge (AJ), made final by the Merit Systems Protection Board (board) in a decision dated April 1, 1992, 53 M.S.P.R. 425, holding that Cleland was not eligible to recover survivor benefits for her two minor grandchildren based upon the federal service of William Cleland, her deceased husband. This court affirms.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case are not in dispute. Petitioner was married to William Cleland, a former federal worker. On January 18, 1980, petitioner's daughter, Alisa Cleland Curtis, died, leaving behind her husband, Arthur Curtis, and their two minor children, Amanda Curtis and Christopher Curtis. Arthur Curtis abandoned his two children and they were eventually placed in the custody of their Cleland grandparents by a Florida state court. On March 31, 1989, William Cleland passed away. Petitioner receives an annuity as his widow but challenges the decision of the Office of Personnel Management, affirmed by the AJ, denying survivor annuities for the two grandchildren also based upon William Cleland's federal service under the Civil Service Retirement System. The AJ's decision became the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board when the board denied review on April 1, 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2), a federal worker's minor dependent child may be eligible to receive a survivorship annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System. The statutory definition of "child" includes "an adopted child," and the statute can be satisfied if a petition for adoption was filed by the federal worker prior to his or her death and if the "child" is adopted by the surviving spouse. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4). In this instance, however, there is no evidence in the record to indicate that William Cleland had adopted Amanda Curtis and/or Christopher Curtis, or that William Cleland filed a petition for their adoption prior to his death.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner argues that under North Carolina state law the grandparents, in fact, were in <span class="Italic">loco parentis</span> with the grandchildren who therefore should be deemed his "children." The court can understand and sympathize with this view but it cannot extend this statute to cover these grandchildren as requested. When Congress wishes to include grandchildren within the meaning of "child" for purposes of a statute it knows how to do so. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 416(e) (1988). Federal law rather than state law determines who is a child for purposes of the Civil Service Retirement System. Although federal law has generally limited applicability in the field of domestic relations, the Supreme Court has not been reluctant to protect, under the Supremacy Clause, rights established by federal law against state law and to preserve congressional policy embodied in federal law. <span class="Italic">Cf. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Christ,</span> 979 F.2d 575 (7th Cir. 1992) (state divorce decree must cede to conflicting federal law); <span class="Italic">Ridgway v. Ridgway,</span> 454 U.S. 46, 102 S. Ct. 49, 70 L. Ed.2d 39 (1981) (same). Here the definition of "child" in federal law preempts state law even assuming that the grandparents had the same duties of care and support as apply to adoptive parents. <span class="Italic">See Money v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 811 F.2d 1474, 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Roebling v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 788 F.2d 1544, 1548 (Fed. Cir. 1986). We cannot amend the statute. Only Congress has that authority. Petitioner's position is contrary to the statute which governs in this matter and is contrary to the administrative interpretation consistent with the statute. Petitioner's claim that the statute and the MSPB decision violate constitutional due process and equal protection is without merit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of petitioner's failure to present evidence to demonstrate eligibility under the Civil Service Retirement System, the board's decision is affirmed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The influence of an SSA determination on the survivor annuity formulation for children incapable of self support was defined and limited by <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary v. OPM</span>, 91 MSPR 192, 194-98 &#x00B6; 5-14 (2002):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge, relying on <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 201 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Duvall v</span>. <span class="Italic">Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 334 (1997), found that the appellant proved that he met the statutory requirement that he be incapable of self-support because "the severity of the appellant's condition meets the standard for a 'listed' impairment under the SSA regulations" and that circumstance establishes <span class="Italic">per se</span> that he is incapable of self-support.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;A "listed" impairment is one included in the list of specific impairments of each of the major body systems at 5 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, OPM argues that the administrative judge erred in applying SSA regulations to find that the appellant is <span class="Italic">per se</span> incapable of self-support because, citing <span class="Italic">Trevan v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 69 F.3d 520 (Fed. Cir. 1995), OPM is not bound by SSA regulations. It further contends that evidence in the record shows that the appellant is capable of self-support. In response to OPM's interrogatories, the appellant acknowledged that he has worked at Nepal Bank, Limited, in Kathmandu, Nepal, since 1987 as a "record keeper (lower level assistant position)."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM in regard to the general statement that it is not bound by SSA regulations. However, we find that the administrative judge in this case did not find that SSA regulations were binding. Rather, he relied on the Board's decisions interpreting the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(B), "incapable of self-support." In <span class="Italic">Sawyer,</span> 36 MSPR at 203-06, the Board noted that there was no statutory or regulatory definition of the phrase "incapable of self-support," and neither the legislative history nor the Federal Personnel Manual then in effect contained any indication of the legislative intent as to the meaning of the "incapable of self-support" standard. Noting that the dominant purpose of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341 is to promote financial support for dependent survivors, the Board found it useful to look for guidance to the regulations implementing the Social Security Act regarding its "substantial gainful activity" standard. <span class="Italic">Sawyer</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. at 205-06. In <span class="Italic">Duvall</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 339, in which the appellant had a hearing loss similar to this appellant's, the Board reaffirmed its use of SSA regulations as guidance. In the absence of any clear direction from Congress and OPM, the Board acted properly in <span class="Italic">Sawyer</span> and <span class="Italic">Duvall</span> and may continue to interpret the statutory provision, using SSA regulations as guidance. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Northcross v. Board of Education of Memphis City Schools,</span> 412 U.S. 427, 428 (1973) (statutes containing similar language and sharing a common purpose should be interpreted similarly).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite our continued general approval of such analysis, we further find that the presence of a "listed" impairment does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> render an applicant "incapable of self-support" and thus qualified for a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(B) and (e)(2). In <span class="Italic">Staples v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 570, 576-77 (1995), the Board, citing <span id="Page_4270"></span><span class="Italic">Kangas v. Bowen,</span> 823 F.2d 775, 777 (3d Cir. 1987), stated that if an appellant "can demonstrate that he suffers from one of those 'listed' impairments, he is considered to have met the SSA standard <span class="Italic">per se.</span>" In <span class="Italic">Kangas,</span> the court stated that a claimant can show that he meets the SSA standard of unable to engage in substantial gainful activity by producing evidence that he "is disabled <span class="Italic">per se</span> by meeting or equaling certain listed impairments" and cited to <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Campbell,</span> 461 U.S. 458, 460 (1983). <span class="Italic">Kangas,</span> 823 F.2d at 777. The Court in <span class="Italic">Heckler v. Campbell</span> stated that the SSA regulation at 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1520(d) (1982) provides that certain impairments listed in Appendix 1 are so severe that they prevent a person from pursuing any gainful work, and a claimant who establishes that he suffers from one of these impairments will be considered disabled without further inquiry. <span class="Italic">Heckler,</span> 461 U.S. at 460. It does not appear from the decisions, however, that the claimants in <span class="Italic">Kangas</span> or <span class="Italic">Campbell</span> were employed. Thus, the courts were not required to address the issue of the effect of current employment on a claim.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 423(a), an individual who is <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> "under a disability" is entitled to SSA benefits. Section 432(d), 42 U.S.C., defines "disability" as <span class="Italic">inter alia</span> "the inability to do any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months...." The determination of whether an individual qualifies for SSA benefits because of a disability has been described as a five-step sequential inquiry, and, if the claimant is found to be "disabled" or "not disabled" at any step in the sequence, there is no need to consider subsequent steps. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1520 (1999); <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Yuckert,</span> 482 U.S. 137, 140-41 (1987); <span class="Italic">Butera v. Apfel,</span> 173 F.3d 1049, 1054 (7th Cir. 1999). The first question is whether the claimant is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity. A claimant who is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity is not entitled to benefits, and the analysis goes no further. <span class="Italic">Butera,</span> 173 F.3d at 1054. Only if the finder of fact determines that the claimant has satisfied steps one and two will he consider step three, i.e., whether the impairment meets or equals a "listed" impairment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the sole existence of a listed impairment does not <span class="Italic">per se</span> qualify one for SSA disability benefits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM that a <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that ignores the fact that an applicant is currently working does not further the goal of the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to provide support for a survivor who can not support himself. The fact that an applicant for a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2) works and earns a salary is relevant to the determination of whether he is incapable of self-support. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Staples</span> and <span class="Italic">Duvall</span> held that the presence of a "listed impairment" <span class="Italic">per se</span> qualifies an applicant under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(e)(2) for a survivor annuity, we overrule them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We reject OPM's position, however, that the fact of current employment alone disqualifies an applicant. Under SSA regulations, the mere fact that an applicant is employed is not necessarily disqualifying. The SSA standard is "incapable of performing substantial gainful activity." The regulation at 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572 defines substantial gainful activity as work activity that is both substantial and gainful. Substantial work activity involves significant physical or mental activities, even if part time. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572(a). Gainful work activity is work activity usually done for pay or profit. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572(b). In determining whether work is substantial and gainful, SSA will consider the amount of earnings the claimant had. Ordinarily, under current regulations, average monthly earnings over certain amounts set forth in the regulations will show that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1574(b)(2) (Table 1). Likewise, monthly earnings of less than certain specified amounts will ordinarily show that the applicant did not engage in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1574(b)(3) (Table 2). The regulations also provide that reasonable costs of certain items and services necessary to enable the claimant to work may be subtracted from earnings. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1576. Moreover, SSA claimants may be entitled to a trial work period that will not be considered to be substantial gainful activity. 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 422.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, these provisions show that SSA will not disqualify an applicant merely because he earns some money. Substantial gainful activity is more than employment. Likewise, we find that the standard for survivor benefits under the CSRS for a child who is incapable of self-support does not necessarily exclude an individual who is employed. Self-support would include at the least being able to house, feed, and clothe oneself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405 (an individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance, taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses which the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary); <span class="Italic">Tatum v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 82 M.S.P.R. 96, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-21</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As stated above, the record indicates that the appellant has been employed as a recordkeeper for a bank since 1987. The record does not indicate what his earnings are. Moreover, OPM's reconsideration decision and its initial determination to deny the application for a survivor annuity do not address the question of whether the appellant's earnings render him capable of self-support. Under the circumstances, we remand this case to OPM for further development of the record, including affording the appellant an opportunity to show that, although he is employed, he is incapable of self-support because his earnings from that employment are insufficient to provide him with the necessities of life. OPM may seek whatever information from the appellant that it deems relevant to the question of his ability to be self-supporting. OPM shall issue a new reconsideration decision, after considering any evidence submitted by the appellant....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, OPM disputes the administrative judge's finding that the appellant meets the statutory qualification that he be unmarried. As the administrative judge discussed in the initial decision, the appellant completed the Disabled Dependent Questionnaire as if he were unmarried and indicated that he lived with a "guardian or fiduciary. During the proceedings below, OPM served the appellant with interrogatories seeking the following information, "If you were ever married, specify the period(s) of your marriage(s). The appellant responded, "Currently I am living together with a lady." Because the appellant's response is equivocal, on remand OPM shall afford the appellant an opportunity to clarify his marital status.[2]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no statutory or regulatory definition of the phrase "incapable of self-support." <span class="Italic">See Rajbhandary</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 7. In the absence of any clear direction from Congress and OPM as to what constitutes "incapable of self-support" for purposes of determining entitlement to a survivor annuity under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341, the Board has looked for guidance to the Social Security Administration (SSA) regulations implementing the Social Security Act regarding its "substantial gainful activity" standard. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Sawyer v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 36 M.S.P.R. 201, 205-06 (1988), and<span class="Italic"> Duvall v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 334, 339 (1997) (overruled on other grounds)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the Board explained in <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary</span>, a claimant who is currently engaged in substantial gainful activity does not qualify for SSA disability benefits. 92 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 9. The regulation at 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572 defines substantial gainful activity as work activity that is both substantial and gainful. Substantial work activity involves significant physical or mental activities, even if part time. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572(a). Gainful work activity is work activity usually done for pay or profit. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1572(b). In determining whether work is substantial and gainful, SSA will consider the amount of earnings the claimant had. <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 11. Ordinarily, average monthly earnings over certain amounts set forth in the regulations will show that the claimant has engaged in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1574(b)(2) (Table 1). Likewise, monthly earnings of less than certain specified amounts will ordinarily show that the applicant did not engage in substantial gainful activity. 20 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 404.1574(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant has a current annual salary well above the threshold used by the SSA to determine whether an individual is capable of substantial gainful activity. (citing Cost-of-Living Increase and Other Determinations for 2013, 77 Fed. Reg. 65755 (Oct. 30, 2012) (determining the 2013 substantial gainful activity threshold for non-blind individuals to be $12,480.00 per year)); (affidavit of the appellant's sister, C.P., stating that the appellant earns approximately $41,000). That the appellant's earnings exceed the SSA substantial gainful activity threshold is not dispositive of whether the appellant is incapable of self-support, however. In <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary</span>, the Board found that self-support would include at the least being able to house, feed, and clothe oneself. 91 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 12 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405 (an individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses include rent, mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, food, clothing, insurance, taxes, installment payments, medical expenses, and other miscellaneous expenses which the individual can establish as being ordinary and necessary)). Thus, although an individual's earnings exceed the substantial gainful activity threshold, he would nonetheless be incapable of self-support if his earnings are insufficient to provide him with the necessities of life. <span class="Italic">See Rajbhandary</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 13 (remanding the case to OPM for further development of the record, including affording the appellant an opportunity to show that he is incapable of self-support because the earnings from his employment are insufficient to provide him with the necessities of life).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_4271"></span>In assessing whether the appellant is incapable of self-support, the administrative judge considered the hearing testimony and the documentary evidence in the record, including the document entitled "Monthly Family Budget," which the appellant submitted during the proceedings below. The budget shows the income and expenses of the appellant and C.P., with whom he lives. The expenses include a category entitled "outside assistance," which consists of a list of various services the appellant claims he would require were he to live on his own. These services and the purported cost of each service per month are as follows: housekeeper/maid service ($630.40); cook ($225.25); facilities manager ($1,480.74); computer operator ($607.92); psychologist ($931.00); logistics analyst ($241.20); interior designer ($84.64); bookkeeper/money management ($330.99); administrative assistant ($318.58); general maintenance worker ($143.28); and groundskeeper ($136.26). Thus, according to the budget, the appellant would have to spend $61,559.52 per year for these services if he were to live on his own.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the necessity of the above services "is at best hypothetical."The administrative judge further stated, "More importantly, that the total cost of living for a year exceeds his annual income according to the appellant's proposed budget is neither particularly compelling nor legally sufficient." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 8 (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405, which, as noted above, defines "ordinary and necessary living expenses"). The administrative judge concluded that, "the record as a whole demonstrates that [the appellant's] medical condition does not preclude him from gainful employment, nor does it prevent him from taking care of his ordinary and necessary living expenses."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant challenges this finding on review, arguing that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405 "regards one's rights to avoids [sic] debt" and thus does not apply to the issues in this case. We disagree. As previously noted, and as the appellant acknowledges on review, there is no statutory or regulatory definition of the phrase "incapable of self-support," and the Board in <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary</span> clarified the meaning of that term by finding that self-support would include at the least being able to house, feed, and clothe oneself. 91 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 12. The appellant also acknowledges on review that, "[t]o further clarify the definition of 'self-support,' the Board [in <span class="Italic">Rajbhandary</span>] cited 5 CFR 831.140[5]." By citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405 in conjunction with its finding that self-support would include at the least being able to house, feed, and clothe oneself, the Board in Rajbhandary clearly indicated that it is appropriate to consider an individual's ordinary and necessary living expenses as defined in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1405 in determining whether that individual is incapable of self-support for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the expenses of the services listed in his budget are necessarily hypothetical inasmuch as he is not incurring these expenses because his family members are providing the services due to his inability to afford them. The appellant appears to have misread the initial decision. The administrative judge did not find that the expenses for the services are hypothetical. Rather, he found that the necessity of the services is "at best hypothetical," i.e., that the appellant failed to establish that the services are necessary. Although the appellant clearly disagrees with this finding, the appellant has not shown below or on review that the services listed in the "outside assistance" category of his budget are necessary. Thus, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that these services are not necessary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because these services are not necessary, it follows that the purported costs of these services do not constitute necessary ordinary and necessary living expenses for purposes of determining whether the appellant is incapable of self-support. Accordingly, the administrative judge properly excluded the purported costs of the services listed in the "outside assistance" category of the appellant's budget in determining that the appellant's medical condition does not prevent him from taking care of his ordinary and necessary living expenses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues on review that in finding that he failed to prove that he is incapable of self-support, the administrative judge failed to consider that there was no evidence in the record contradicting the testimony of the appellant and his witnesses regarding his "lack of complete self-independence." He further asserts that the administrative judge appears to have overlooked the fact that the testimony of the appellant and his witnesses "was totally consistent with one another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may require the assistance of others to navigate many of the activities of daily life, such as grocery shopping and cooking, that does not mean that he is unable to support himself for purposes of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341. As noted above, the Board indicated in<span class="Italic"> Rajbhandary</span> that the standard for determining whether an individual is incapable of self-support within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8341(a)(4)(B) is whether his earnings are insufficient to provide him with the necessities of life. <span class="Italic">See Rajbhandary</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 192, &#x00B6; 13. Here, the appellant has failed to show that the administrative judge erred in finding that his disability does not render him incapable of taking care of his ordinary necessary living expenses. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 9. Therefore, even assuming that the hearing testimony established that the appellant lacks "complete self-independence," the appellant has shown no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant failed to establish by preponderant evidence that he is incapable of self-support. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether an applicant is unsuccessful in obtaining employment for reasons unrelated to his physical or mental capabilities is immaterial to the determination of self support under 5 USC 8341(a)(4)(B). <span class="Italic">Salarzon v. OPM</span>, 44 MSPR 588, 592 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cull v. OPM</span>, 55 MSPR 476 (1992) (considering validity of OPM regulations defining "dependency"; providing statutory interpretation of 5 USC 8341(a)(3); 8342(d)); <span class="Italic">Ingram v. OPM</span>, 38 MSPR 556 (1988) (possibility that mental illness began prior to age 18 did not establish the statutory requirement that the appellant in fact suffered the disease prior to reaching his eighteenth birthday).</p>
