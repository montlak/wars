<h3 class="h3" id="sec15-168"><span class="space">D.</span> COSTS AND EXPENSES</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Attorney fees in the form of billings for counsel's time comprise the bulk of the expense incurred by the represented appellant. But there are also expenses incurred by counsel and billed to the client: deposition transcript costs, postage, phone toll charges, secretarial overtime, courier bills, expert witness fees, mileage, airplane and rail tickets, hotel charges, and meals. Whether costs can be recovered depends on the nature of the cost and the type of appeal, <span id="Page_4712"></span>i.e., adverse action appeal, mixed case, or IRA appeal. Allowable costs do not include capital expenses. The allowance of fees to cover costs does not include an allowance of fees to subsidize the purchase or maintenance of equipment used by counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Garcia v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 198, 202 (1997); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Nantkwest, Inc. v. Iancu</span>, 898 F.3d 1177, 1187-90 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (statutory provisions for expenses would not ordinarily encompass counsel fees; analysis of statutes distinguishing or providing for allowances of counsel fees and expenses); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Hyatt v. PTO</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210818133">9 F.4th 1372</a>, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (considering as to several statutory fee shifting provisions whether the phrase "all expenses of the proceedings" includes expert witness fees).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The allowance of expenses and costs for counsel was addressed for the CSRA, <span class="Italic">O'Donnell v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 2 MSPR 445, 456, 2 MSPB 604 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Attorney fees may properly include reimbursement for counsel's out-of-pocket disbursements for "incidental and necessary expenses incurred in furnishing effective and competent representation."...&#8197;However, such reimbursable expenses are limited to those reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the attorney which are normally charged to a fee-paying client, in the course of providing legal services. Such recoverable expenses include reasonable photocopying, paralegal expenses, travel and telephone costs, and necessary supplemental secretarial costs....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other costs, however, incurred or paid to a third person, not to appellant's attorney or to the organization which pays the attorney's salary, cannot reasonably be considered in awarding attorney fees. These non-recoverable costs include witness fees and expenses, investigation expenses, deposition expenses, and the cost of charts and maps....&#8197;The Board's regulations reflect the prohibition of the award of costs other than to reimburse counsel or the organization which paid his salary, providing that witness fees shall be paid by the party requesting the presence of the witness.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit tackled costs in <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 699 F.2d 1140, 1145-46 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The court appeal sought a ruling on the recovery of deposition costs--essential to discovery--denied by the Board as part of an otherwise unobjectionable counsel fee award. The court ruled in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> that because the Reform Act states that only counsel fees may be awarded, the Board is authorized to award only fees, not "costs" as they are defined in 28 USC 1920. Because statutory costs--typically including fees of the clerk and marshal, fees for stenographic transcripts used in the appeal, fees for printing and witnesses, docket fees, and compensation of experts--were excluded from the CSRA counsel fee formulation, the court was left with the task of determining what expenses could reasonably be considered part of counsel fees yet not fall within the definition of statutory costs. The court concluded that, as to CSRA cases, deposition costs and witness fees, being "costs," were not recoverable, affirming the Board although rejecting the Board's reasoning that these fees were unrecoverable because they were paid to "third persons":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner has appealed the MSPB's decision asserting (1) that Congress intended the phrase "attorney fees" under section 7701(g)(1) to include all normal litigation expenses, and (2) that there is no rational basis for awarding some litigation expenses but not others, such as deposition costs and witness fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7701(g)(1) expressly provides that attorney fees may be awarded in certain instances. The statutory language, however, does not expressly provide that all other litigation expenses may also be awarded, as petitioner says we should read it. We view this omission to be significant. If Congress intended section 7701(g)(1) to encompass all other expenses besides attorney fees, it could easily have manifested such broad intent. It did not do so. Therefore, we will not ascribe this intent to Congress....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The petitioner, however, contends that the legislative history of section 7701(g)(1) supports her position. We cannot agree. The limited legislative history, which even petitioner concedes is "not a model of clarity," does evince a congressional concern with the amount of money employees might have to spend defending against nonmeritorious actions, and a congressional awareness that the costs of litigation could be as much as the attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 60, reprinted in 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2782; and Transcript of House-Senate Conference Committee Mark-up Session on S. 2640, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 31 (September 18, 1978). But there is certainly no "persuasive showing" from the legislative history that Congress intended section 7701(g)(1) to encompass all litigation expenses rather than just the major expense of attorney fees....&#8197;On the contrary, the legislative history clearly shows that following a discussion of whether all "reasonable costs and expenses of litigation" should be included in the legislation, as provided in the House bill, the conferees left out any mention of them in the conference report and the bill as enacted. Nor are litigation costs named in the applicable regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.806, 1201.37 (1982). Therefore, we hold that under section 7701(g)(1) the MSPB is authorized to award only attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "expenses" is generally understood to include all the expenditures made by a litigant in connection with an action....&#8197;As noted above, we do not view the term "attorney fees" to be synonymous with "all expenses," as petitioner urges. Rather, attorney fees are but one discrete type of expense incurred by litigants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The difficulty, of course, is in identifying those expenses that can fairly be categorized under the rubric of attorney fees. Numerous courts have attempted to do so under other statutory attorney fee provisions....&#8197;From reading these cases, and others, we do not perceive any well-established or consistent test for determining when expenses will qualify as attorney fees. Thus, although we respect the varied results in these decisions, we will forge our own definition of attorney fees for this case and do so in a manner that we believe is in harmony with both the common and congressional understanding of the term, and that we believe is a reasonable interpretation of the attorney fee provision in the particular statute involved here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin our analysis by employing the negative definition technique to narrow our scope of inquiry. The concept of attorney fees does not comprise those expenses that are commonly known as "taxable costs." Taxable costs are set forth in 28 USC &#x00A7; 1920 (1976 &#x0026; Supp. V 1981), which reads:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A judge or clerk of any court of the United States may tax as costs the following: (1) Fees of the clerk and marshal; (2) Fees of the court reporter for all or any part of the stenographic transcript necessarily obtained for use in the case; (3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses; (4) Fees for exemplification and copies of papers necessarily obtained for use in the case; (5) Docket fees under section 1923 of this title; (6) Compensation of court appointed experts, compensation of interpreters, and salaries, fees, expenses, and costs of special interpretation services under section 1828 of this title. A bill of costs shall be filed in the case and, upon allowance, included in the judgment or decree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that the term "taxable costs" has an identity all its own and is not to be considered part of an award of attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Copper Liquor</span>, 684 F.2d at 1100-01; <span class="Italic">Northcross</span>, 611 F.2d at 640; <span class="Italic">Vecchione</span>, 481 F. Supp. at 799. We find further support for this proposition in the recently enacted Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), Pub. L. No. 96-481, tit. II, &#x00A7; 204(a), 94 Stat. 2321, 2327-29 (codified at 28 USC &#x00A7; 2412 (Supp. V 1981)). Under the EAJA, "costs" and "fees and other expenses" are expressly authorized, but under different subsections and different standards....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It therefore seems evident that when Congress enacted the EAJA it considered costs and attorney fees to be distinct concepts, and that costs and expenses are not synonymous but are words of art. We thus believe that when Congress authorized the MSPB to award attorney fees under section 7701(g)(1) it did not authorize the award of those expenses considered to be "taxable costs." Instead, the expenses listed in section 1920 may be recovered only if they are allowed by that section. <span class="Italic">See Copper Liquor</span>, 684 F.2d at 1101.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Normally, the distinction between costs and attorney fees is academic, as both are routinely awarded in many cases. Unfortunately for petitioner, however, taxable costs cannot be awarded here because the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to taxable costs in administrative actions such as we are reviewing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 28 USC &#x00A7; 2412(a) (Supp. V 1981) ("a judgment for costs...may be awarded...in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency and any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity in any court having jurisdiction...") We conclude, therefore, that the MSPB was correct in denying recovery of deposition costs and witness fees under the guise of attorney fees although, as shown, we do not accept the MSPB's rationale for this result. It was the board's view that any costs incurred or paid for a third person's services should be rejected. We do not believe this to be entirely consistent with its treatment of the expenses allowed (telephone tolls, postage, travel of counsel), which were also paid to third parties by counsel on behalf of his client. The sounder view is that stenographic fees for depositions and witness fees are taxable costs as to which there is no statutory right of recovery in an administrative proceeding under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We turn now to those expenses that are recoverable under the attorney fee provision of section 7701(g)(1) and 5 CFR &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 550.806, 1201.37 (1982). We view an award of attorney fees to encompass those reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket expenses of providing a lawyer's services that are not covered by the hourly rate[5] because they cannot always be anticipated with any certainty in a given case, that are routinely paid by counsel and billed to the client for services rendered, that are not taxable costs or prohibited by statute or authorized regulation, and that are not expenses incurred for the mere convenience of counsel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Examples of expenses that would be covered by the hourly rate include fixed overhead such as utilities, rent, and secretarial expense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ideally, the hourly rate would fully compensate attorneys for their services. In the real world of actual law practice, however, the hourly rate charged is only an approximation, benchmark, or lodestar. As a result, <span id="Page_4713"></span>a few variable expenses of servicing a case must routinely be, and are, billed to clients in addition to the hourly rate. In the case before us, these expenses include travel of counsel, postage, and telephone tolls, which were allowed by the MSPB as a part of the fee for legal services.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit left open in <span class="Italic">Bennett</span> the possibility that a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant could recover some categories of expenses before the MSPB, <span class="Italic">Naekel v. Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 845 F.2d 976, 980 (Fed. Cir. 1988), but the court did not say what those recoverable expenses might comprise.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Equal Access to Justice Act does not provide authority in ordinary appeals for the Board to award expenses, <span class="Italic">Page v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1995 NP No. 95-3145):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ further held that Page's claimed out-of-pocket expenses were not recoverable under 5 USC 7701(g)(1) (1994). In addition, the AJ held that the board had no authority under this statutory provision to award expert witness fees....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Page also contends that the board should have reimbursed him for these items under the Equal Access to Justice Act ("EAJA"). In response, the government argues that the EAJA does not apply to this case. We agree with the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">Gavette v. OPM</span>, 785 F.2d 1568, 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">in banc</span>), the EAJA applies only to "civil actions" and "adversary adjudications." A civil action is one that involves judicial proceedings; thus, an appeal to the board from an agency is not a civil action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, Page's appeal to the board concerned the tenure of an employee, viz., his removal from his position with the agency. Administrative determinations involving the "tenure of an employee" are specifically excluded from being adversary adjudications covered by the EAJA. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 504(b)(1)(C), 554(a)(2) (1994); <span class="Italic">Olsen v. Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau</span>, 735 F.2d 558, 562 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("The discharge of an employee involves his 'tenure.'"). As such, the board proceeding did not concern an adversary adjudication within the meaning of the EAJA and thus the board had no statutory authority to apply the EAJA to Page's case. We therefore conclude that the board did not err in not applying the EAJA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board has not spent much time discussing the documentation required to support a request for recoverable costs. As a matter of practice, timekeeping entries seem to suffice for small items, e.g., postage, toll calls, and copies. In <span class="Italic">Chin v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 55 MSPR 84, 86 (1992), appellant's affidavit was accepted as proof of the costs that he incurred.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For whistleblower reprisal cases, where the scope of recovery of fees and expenses is broader than that permitted for adverse actions, the ordinary costs of the practice of law are still not recoverable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Guzman v. DHS</span>, SF-0752-15-0170-A-2 (NP 1/6/2023) ("The administrative judge noted that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(g) permits recovery of costs and the Board has interpreted this provision to permit a broader recovery than may apply in appeals under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. AID at 19 (citing <span class="Italic">Smit v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 612 (1994), and <span class="Italic">Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services v.
