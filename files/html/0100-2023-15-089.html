<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-89"><span class="space">j.</span> Sensitive Duties Not Requiring a Clearance: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Conyers</span></span></h5>
<p class="Body-Text">A major issue before the Board in 2010 was whether it had the authority to review the substantive basis for an agency's determination that a person should not be able to continue employment in a position if the agency determines that he can no longer be assigned sensitive duties of a position that requires neither a security clearance nor access to classified information. Preliminarily, definition of a sensitive position is provided by <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 120 MSPR 607, 610 &#x00B6; 8, 2014 MSPB 10 (2014), construing DOD regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A sensitive position is one whose occupant could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security. Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3(b), 3 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 937 (1949-1953); 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(a); SECNAV M-5510.30, &#x00B6; 5-2.1. Sensitive positions are designated by the agency at one of three sensitivity levels: Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Non-Critical Sensitive. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.106(c)(2); 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(b); SECNAV M-5510.30, &#x00B6; 5-2.1. Position sensitivity designations are based on a variety of criteria, which may include, but do not necessarily include, the access to classified information required by the position. 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(b)(1); SECNAV M-5510.30, &#x00B6; 5-3. Hence, a position may be sensitive regardless of whether it requires access to classified information. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564(e); <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d at 1160.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After receiving <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefing and oral argument, the Board decided, over the carefully reasoned dissent of Member Rose, that the Board has authority to review the agency determination of whether the employee should have been denied access to sensitive information, with a consequential loss of employment. A principal point of discussion was the scope of the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision: did it prevent the Board from reviewing the substantive bases for only loss or suspension of security clearances, or did the Supreme Court decision have a broader import? The narrower construction of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was chosen by the Board majority in <span class="Italic">Conyers v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CONYERS_RHONDA_K_CH_0752_09_0925_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_562382.pdf">115 MSPR 572</a>, 573-599, 2010 MSPB 247 (2010), involving an appeal, and an interlocutory appeal on the central issue, from an indefinite suspension of a DFAS accounting technician, and determining that "<span class="Italic">Egan</span> limits the Board's review of an otherwise appealable adverse action only if that action is based upon a denial, revocation or suspension of a 'security clearance,' i.e., involves a denial of access to classified information or eligibility for such access." The Board's decision is reprinted in part below. It did not survive in the Federal Circuit; the court determined that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was not as cabined as the Board opined.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2561"></span>The Federal Circuit determined in an <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision that the Board lacked jurisdiction to review the underlying agency determination that an employee no longer qualified to hold a noncritical sensitive position, making substantively unreviewable (still allowing for procedural due process) the removal of the employee from the federal service for lack of that qualification. The court's decision (with the dissenting opinion following the decision of the court) was provided in <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, <span class="blue">733 F.3d 11</span>48, 1154-66 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (dissent by Judge Dyk, joined by Judges Newman and Reyna), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 134 S. Ct. 1759 (March 31, 2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutes provide a two-track system for removal of employees based on national security concerns. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 526. In particular, relevant provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the United States Code entitled, "Adverse Actions," provide two subchapters related to removals. The first, subchapter II (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7514), relates to removals for "cause." Under &#x00A7; 7512, a reduction in grade of an employee, as here, may qualify as an "adverse action." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3). An employee subject to an adverse action is entitled to the protections of &#x00A7; 7513, which include written notice of the specific reasons for the proposed action, an opportunity to respond to the charges, and the requirement that the agency's action is taken to promote the efficiency of the service. An employee removed for "cause" has the right, under &#x00A7; 7513(d), to appeal to the Board. On review of the action by the Board under &#x00A7; 7701, the agency must show that its decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). The appeal here proceeded pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The second, subchapter IV (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7531-7533), relates to suspensions and removals based upon national security concerns. An employee suspended under &#x00A7; 7532(a) is not entitled to appeal to the Board. Nonetheless, the statute provides for a summary removal process that entitles the employee to specified pre-removal procedural rights, including a hearing by an agency authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s Application to This Case</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Northover urge this court to limit <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s application to security clearance determinations, reasoning that national security concerns articulated in that case pertain to access to classified information only. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> cannot be so confined. Its principles instead require that courts refrain from second-guessing DoD national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, which may not necessarily involve access to classified information. For the following reasons, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> must apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Egan</span> Addressed Broad National Security Concerns That Are Traditionally the Responsibility of the Executive Branch</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Egan</span>, at its core, explained that it is essential for the President and the DoD to have broad discretion in making determinations concerning national security. In particular, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> noted the absence of a statutory provision in &#x00A7; 7512 precluding appellate review of determinations concerning national security created a presumption in favor of judicial review. 484 U.S. at 526-27. The Court, nevertheless, held that "proposition is not without limit, and it runs aground when it encounters concerns of <span class="Italic">national security</span>, as in this case, where the grant of security clearance to a particular employee, a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 527 (emphasis added). Affording such discretion to agencies, according to <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, "flows primarily from [the Commander in Chief Clause] and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant." 484 U.S. at 527. The Court has consistently articulated that matters touching upon foreign policy and national security fall within "an area of executive action 'in which courts have long been hesitant to intrude'" absent congressional authorization. <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. Vigil</span>, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993) (quoting <span class="Italic">Franklin v. Massachusetts</span>, 505 U.S. 788, 819 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment)); <span class="Italic">see also Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529 (Foreign policy is the "province and responsibility of the Executive...[C]ourts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs.") (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deference owed to the Executive Branch in these matters stems from our constitutional principle of separation of powers among the branches of government, <span class="Italic">see United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp</span>., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936) (recognizing the "plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international relations"), and the long-recognized convention that the judiciary's institutional expertise is limited under these circumstances, <span class="Italic">Boumediene v. Bush</span>, 553 U.S. 723, 797 (2008) ("Unlike the President and some designated Members of Congress, neither the Members of this Court nor most federal judges begin the day with briefings that may describe new and serious threats to our Nation and its people. The law must accord the Executive substantial authority to apprehend and detain those who pose a real danger to our security."). Indeed, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applied that same reasoning in the context of this case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is not reasonably possible for an outside non-expert body to review the substance of such a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence. Nor can such a body determine what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">484 U.S. at 529. This rationale applies to <span class="Italic">all</span> prediction of risk regarding national security. Thus, absent congressional action, judicial review of national security matters is generally prohibited.[8].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The Dissent argues that we should afford <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to the Board's interpretation of its own jurisdiction under the CSRA. Dissent 21. Although <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> would normally apply to the Board's interpretation of the CSRA, where the agency's interpretation raises serious constitutional doubts, courts are required to inquire whether there exists another permissible interpretation. <span class="Italic">Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. and Const. Trades Council</span>, 485 U.S. 568, 575-76 (1988). The principle of separation of powers dictates here and we do not read the CSRA to "assum[e] that Congress...casually authorize administrative agencies to interpret a statute to push the limit of congressional authority." <span class="Italic">Solid Waste Agency of N. Cook Cnty</span>., 531 U.S. 159, 172-73 (2001). The President has the primary responsibility along with the necessary power to protect the national security. The Board cannot usurp that power by asserting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Northover's focus on only one factor, eligibility of access to classified information, is misplaced. The centerpiece of the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> analysis, Executive Order No. 10,450, makes no mention of "classified information."[9] Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.) ("The head of any department or agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within his department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position."). In addition, other relevant statutes and regulations define "sensitive" position in the broadest sense by referring to "national security" generally. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564 ("Security clearance investigations.... (e) Sensitive duties.--For the purposes of this section, it is not necessary for the performance of duties to involve classified activities or classified matters in order for the duties to be considered sensitive and critical to the national security.") (emphasis omitted); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102 ("(a) For purposes of this part, the term national security position includes: (1) Those positions that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage..."). The Board and Northover also conflate "classified information" with "national security information," but <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not imply those terms have the same meaning. In fact, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s core focus is not on "information," but rather on the Executive's discretion to act on threats--information-based or not--to national security generally. 484 U.S. at 527 (recognizing the government's "'compelling' interest in withholding national security information") (emphasis omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;The Dissent contends no Presidential Order here authorizes the DoD to make judgments whether an employee is a risk to national security. Dissent 4. Executive Order No. 10,450 directs agencies, such as the DoD, to establish programs "to insure that the employment and retention...of any civilian...employee...is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security." That Presidential Order applied in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. It applies here. The Dissent nevertheless claims support in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536 (1956), but the Dissent's reliance on <span class="Italic">Cole</span> is erroneous. The question in <span class="Italic">Cole</span> was whether the Civil Service Commission could review Mr. Cole's discharge from the military. The government conceded the review was expressly authorized by the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 ("VPA"), but argued express authorization in the VPA can be overridden by Executive action pursuant to Executive Order No. 10,450. Thus, the issue presented was whether the Executive could override express Congressional authority to take action. In this case, as in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, there is no such express Congressional authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, government positions may require different types and levels of security protection, depending upon the sensitivity of the position sought. 484 U.S. at 528. A government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies in scope according to the degree of adverse effect the applicant could have on national security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citing Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.)). As OPM states: "An agency's national security calculus will vary widely depending upon, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the agency's mission, the particular project in question, and the degree of harm that would be caused if the project is compromised." As a result, an agency's determination concerning national security entails consideration of multiple factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, categorizing a sensitive position is undertaken without regard to access to classified information, but rather with regard to the effect the position may have on national security. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 10,450 &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.). Similarly, agencies make predictive judgments about an individual as:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2562"></span>an attempt to predict his [or her] possible future behavior and to assess whether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, he [or she] might compromise sensitive information. It may be based, to be sure, upon past or present conduct, but it also may be based upon concerns completely unrelated to conduct such as having close relatives residing in a country hostile to the United States.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528-29. These predictive judgments are predicated on an individual's potential to compromise national security, which may entail classified or unclassified information. Consequently, the inquiry in these Agency determinations concerning national security is not contingent upon access to "information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the focus is placed on "information," the Board and Northover fail to appreciate that the compelling interest of withholding both classified and unclassified information is not new. Courts have long recognized that sensitive but unclassified material can be vital to national security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Snepp v. United States</span>, 444 U.S. 507, 511-12 (1980) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>) ("[F]ormer intelligence agent's publication of...material relating to intelligence activities can be detrimental to vital national interests even if the published information is unclassified."). The Court provides us with an illustrative example:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A foreign government can learn a great deal about the [CIA's] activities by knowing the public sources of information that interest the Agency. The inquiries pursued by the Agency can often tell our adversaries something that is of value to them. For example, disclosure of the fact that the Agency subscribes to an obscure but publicly available Eastern European technical journal could thwart the Agency's efforts to exploit its value as a source of intelligence information. Similarly, had foreign governments learned the Agency was using certain public journals and ongoing open research projects in its MKULTRA research of "brainwashing" and possible countermeasures, they might have been able to infer both the general nature of the project and the general scope that the Agency's inquiry was taking.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">CIA v. Sims</span>, 471 U.S. 159, 177 (1985) (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Certainly, unclassified information can have detrimental effects on national security the same way as classified information. That is acknowledged by Executive Order No. 13,526, which states, in part: "Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that...meets the standards for classification under this order...." Exec. Order No. 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Dec. 29, 2009); 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2001.13(c). In addition, courts have recognized the same. <span class="Italic">See Kiareldeen v. Ashcroft</span>, 273 F.3d 542, 551 n.2 (3d Cir. 2001) ("Certain information which would otherwise be unclassified when standing alone...may require classification when combined with or associated with other unclassified or classified information. Additionally, when presented in a context that would reveal the FBI's investigative interest in certain individuals, organizations, or countries, information which would normally be unclassified may be properly classified."); <span class="Italic">see also Kasza v. Browner</span>, 133 F.3d 1159, 1168-69 (9th Cir. 1998) (recognizing the "mosaic" or "compilation theory" of classifying information based on a combination of unclassified items of information).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board nevertheless cites <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536 (1956), and references the Court's discussion of the legislative history of the Act of August 26, 1950[10] ("the Act") in support of its proposition that national security concerns relate strictly to access to classified information. The Board's analysis is flawed. <span class="Italic">Cole</span> held that a sensitive position is one that <span class="Italic">implicates</span> national security, and in defining "national security" as used in the Act, the Court concluded that the term "was intended to comprehend only those activities of the Government that are <span class="Italic">directly concerned with the protection of the Nation from internal subversion or foreign aggression</span>, and not those which contribute to the strength of the Nation only through their impact on the general welfare." 351 U.S. at 544 (emphasis added).[11] Thus, even in <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, sensitive positions were defined as those that involve national security generally and not necessarily those that involve classified information only.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The Act of August 26, 1950, Pub. L. No. 81-733, ch. 803, 64 Stat. 476 (1950), gave heads of certain departments and agencies of the Government summary suspension and unreviewable dismissal powers over their civilian employees, when deemed necessary in the interest of the national security of the United States. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 583 n.17. The Act was the precursor to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;It follows that an employee can be dismissed 'in the interest of the national security' under the Act only if he occupies a <span class="Italic">'sensitive' position</span>, and thus that a condition precedent to the exercise of the dismissal authority is a determination by the agency head that the <span class="Italic">position occupied is one affected with the 'national security</span>.'" <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, 351 U.S. at 551 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court in <span class="Italic">Cole</span> remanded the case to determine whether the petitioner's position was one in which he could adversely affect national security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 557.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, "sensitive positions" that can affect national security and "access to classified information" are parallel concepts that are <span class="Italic">not</span> necessarily the same. As the Court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where applicable, the Act authorizes the agency head summarily to suspend an employee pending investigation and, after charges and a hearing, finally to terminate his employment, such termination not being subject to appeal. There is an obvious justification for the summary suspension power where the employee occupies a "sensitive" position in which he could cause serious damage to the national security during the delay incident to an investigation and the preparation of charges. <span class="Italic">Likewise</span>, there is a reasonable basis for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 546 (emphasis added).[12] DoD regulations support this conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;By using the word, "likewise," the Court compares the two concepts, "sensitive positions" and "access to classified information." In doing so, it makes clear that they are parallel but not identical concepts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(a) states "[c]ertain civilian positions" that "entail duties of such a sensitive nature, including access to classified information" are referred to as "sensitive positions." Hence, the regulations define "sensitive positions" as a position that may include but that is not limited to access to classified information. For example, DoD categorizes a position as "noncritical sensitive" position by considering <span class="Italic">one or more</span> of the following criteria:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003;Access to Secret or Confidential information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003;Security police/provost marshal-type duties involving the enforcement of law and security duties involving the protection and safeguarding of DoD personnel and property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003;Category II automated data processing positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003;Duties involving education and orientation of DoD personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003;Duties involving the design, operation, or maintenance of intrusion detection systems deployed to safeguard DoD personnel and property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)&#x2003;Any other position so designated by the head of the Component or designee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(b)(ii). A position entailing any <span class="Italic">one or more</span> of these instructive examples and "the misconduct, malfeasance, or nonfeasance of an incumbent in any such position" would potentially have "an unacceptably adverse impact upon national security." 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.13(a). The regulations contemplate the fact that a "noncritical sensitive" position requiring access to classified information is of the same substance as a "noncritical sensitive" position involving, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, security police-type duties involving enforcement of law and protection and safeguarding of DoD personal property. Regardless of "access to classified information," these positions might be sensitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, there is no meaningful difference in substance between a designation that a position is "sensitive" and a designation that a position requires "access to classified information." Rather, what matters is that both designations concern national security. As a result, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> prohibits review of DoD national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, which may not necessarily involve access to classified information. Consequently, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s pronouncements regarding national security must apply to this case absent contrary congressional action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">B.&#x2003;The CSRA Does Not Grant Broad Authority to the Board in This National Security Context</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the undisputed role of the Executive within this realm, Northover argues applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to these cases "may deprive either the Congress or the Judiciary of all freedom of action merely by invoking national security." Certainly, under the Constitution, Congress has a substantial role in both foreign affairs and national security. Subject to Constitutional constraints, Congress has the power to guide and limit the Executive's application of its powers. Neither the CSRA nor any other legislative action provides a basis for limiting the Executive's role in these cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Egan</span> explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employee who is removed for cause under &#x00A7; 7513, when his required clearance is denied, is entitled to the several procedural protections specified in that statute. The Board then may determine whether such cause existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. Nothing in the Act, however, directs or empowers the Board to go further.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2563"></span>484 U.S. at 530-31. As a result, Congress presumably has left the President and Executive Branch agencies broad discretion to exercise their powers in this area. <span class="Italic">See Dames &#x0026; Moore v. Regan</span>, 453 U.S. 654, 678 (1981) ("Congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act," and "[s]uch failure of Congress...does not, 'especially...in the areas of foreign policy and national security,' imply 'congressional disapproval' of action taken by the Executive.") (citation omitted). Accordingly, when "the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization from Congress," his actions should be "'supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion...rest[s] heavily upon any who might attack it.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 668 (quoting <span class="Italic">Youngstown Sheet &#x0026; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). Nothing in the CSRA directs otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSRA was amended in 1990 after <span class="Italic">United States v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439 (1988). <span class="Italic">Fausto</span> held the CSRA's silence regarding appeal rights reflected congressional intent to preclude any review under chapter 75 for non-preference eligible members of the excepted service. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 448. In response, Congress passed the Civil Service Due Process Amendments ("1990 Amendments") expanding the Board's jurisdiction to some, but not all, non-preference eligible excepted service employees. Pub. L. No. 101-376, 7104 Stat. 461 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Northover construes the 1990 Amendments as extending by implication Board review of agency determinations concerning sensitive positions. Because certain agencies relating to national security, such as the FBI, CIA, and the NSA, were expressly exempted, Northover posits that Board review must extend to all other positions not expressly excluded. However, certain employees of the General Accounting Office, the Veterans Health Sciences and Research Administration, the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority were also excluded. <span class="Italic">See</span> Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990). The exclusion of these varying agencies negates Northover's contention that there was a congressional directive for the Board to review security decisions affecting all employees of particular intelligence agencies. The argument that Congress crafted some exceptions for national security and not others is flawed; national security was not a categorical factor in these exclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the Board and Northover point to the creation of the National Security Personnel System ("NSPS") in 2003 to support their argument that Congress spoke on the issue before this court. This position is supported neither by statutory language nor legislative history. NSPS was established to overhaul the then-existing personnel management system and polices of the DoD. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003). The Board and Northover's focus on the provisions relating to appellate procedures, which replaced Board review and provided that: "[t]he Secretary...may establish an appeals process that provides employees of the [DoD] organizational and functional units that are included in the [NSPS] fair treatment in any appeals that they bring in decision relating to their employment...." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But the NSPS also provided for several other modifications to the DoD's personnel system, including a pay for performance system and modifications to certain collective bargaining rights. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Am. Federation of Gov't Emps., AFL-CIO v. Gates</span>, 486 F.3d 1316, 1330 (D.C. Cir. 2007).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 2009, NSPS was repealed largely due to strong opposition from labor organizations regarding collective bargaining issues. H.R. Rep. No. 110-146 at 394 (2007) ("The committee is concerned that the implementing regulations, issued in November, 2005, exceeded congressional intent, especially with respect to limitations on employee bargaining rights."); S. Rep. No. 110-77 at 11 (2007) ("Repealing the existing authority of the [DoD] to establish a new labor relations system under the [NSPS]. This would guarantee the rights of DoD employees to union representation in NSPS."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 111-35 at 185 (2009) ("[T]he committee has received many complaints from DoD employees during the 5 years during which the D[oD] has sought to implement NSPS, to the detriment of needed human capital planning and workforce management initiatives."); Department of Defense Human Resources Management and Labor Relations Systems, 70 Fed. Reg. 66,116, 66,123 (November 1, 2005) ("Significant differences with many of the labor organizations remain...."). The statute creating the NSPS, the subsequent repeal of certain regulations concerning the DoD appeals process, and the ultimate repeal of the statute creating the NSPS itself in 2009, do not prove congressional intent to preclude DoD from insulating employment decisions concerning national security from Board review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Northover nevertheless claim support in the enactment and subsequent repeal of the NSPS. In particular, Northover contends that Congress created the NSPS to give DoD power to foreclose Board review in non-security clearance cases because it recognized that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was confined to security clearances; Congress' repeal of NSPS thereby returned to the full scope of Board review that had existed prior to the creation of the NSPS. These assertions are also speculative.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is nothing in Congress' enactment or repeal of NSPS indicating that Congress was concerned with the application of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Indeed, changes proposed to the appeals process in the NSPS applied to all DoD employees, and therefore, they made no particular exceptions to security clearance determinations. In addition, the Board and Northover's emphasis on the NSPS's appellate process is misplaced because the NSPS did far more than attempt to replace the Board's review of DoD employment cases, it fundamentally altered labor-management relations and pay structures. As discussed above, the NSPS faced strong opposition from labor organizations due to unpopular limitations on bargaining rights. That Congress chose to ultimately repeal the NSPS has no bearing on the issue in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Northover further argue that Congress has spoken directly on the issue of removal for national security concerns by enacting &#x00A7; 7532. This argument has already been rejected by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. 484 U.S. at 533 ("The argument is that the availability of the &#x00A7; 7532 procedure is a 'compelling' factor in favor of Board review of a security-clearance denial in a case under &#x00A7; 7513. We are not persuaded.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Court observed the alternative availability of &#x00A7; 7513 and &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 532. Specifically, the Court acknowledged that &#x00A7; 7532 does not preempt &#x00A7; 7513 and that the two statutory provisions stand separately and provide alternative routes for administrative action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In addition, the Court held that the two sections were not anomalous, but rather, different. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533. The Court also held that one section did not necessarily provide greater procedural protections than the other. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 533-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Carlucci v. Doe</span>, 488 U.S. 93 (1988), further articulated and clarified &#x00A7; 7532's applicability. In that case, the Court determined that the summary removal mechanism(s) set out in &#x00A7; 7532 and 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 833[13] were discretionary mechanisms in cases involving dismissals for national security reasons. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 100. The Court found that &#x00A7; 7532 was not mandatory, but permissive: "'[n]otwithstanding other statutes,' the head of an agency 'may' suspend and remove employees 'in the interests of national security.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 100-01 (finding nothing in &#x00A7; 7532 or its legislative history indicating that the statute's procedures are the exclusive means for removals on national security grounds or that &#x00A7; 7532 displaces the otherwise applicable removal provisions of the agencies covered by the section). Therefore, it was held that the National Security Agency was not required to apply either &#x00A7; 7532 or &#x00A7; 833 and was entitled to act under its ordinary dismissal procedure if it so wished.[14] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 99-100.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Section 833 was a summary removal provision in the 1964 National Security Agency Personnel Security Procedures Act, 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831-35 (repealed October 1, 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span> Court also affirmed <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s conclusion regarding &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513 and 7532:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">We thus agree with the conclusion of the Merit Systems Protection Board in a similar case that "section 7532 is not the exclusive basis for removals based upon security clearance revocations," <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509, 521 (1985), and with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that "[t]here is nothing in the text of section 7532 or in its legislative history to suggest that its procedures were intended to preempt section 7513 procedures whenever the removal could be taken under section 7532. The language of section 7532 is permissive." <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 802 F.2d 1563, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 488 U.S. 518 (1988). <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>, 488 U.S. at 95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span> held that Congress enacted &#x00A7; 7532 to "supplement, not narrow, ordinary agency removal procedures." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 102. The Court reasoned that because of its summary nature, "Congress intended &#x00A7; 7532 to be invoked only where there is an immediate threat of harm to the national security in the sense that the delay from invoking normal dismissal procedures could 'cause serious damage to the national security.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956)). Consequently, should &#x00A7; 7532 be mandatory as the Board and Northover effectively argue, it would become the exclusive procedure in this case and similar cases, and "no national security termination would be permissible without an initial suspension and adherence to the <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span> standard." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Given <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>'s teaching, we are unconvinced that Congress intended any such result when it enacted &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. No congressional act exists curtailing the Executive's inherent powers in these matters to make the underlying eligibility determination concerning national security. Thus applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> here, the DoD's discretion to control the selection and retention of employees whose positions present risks to national security, whether or not they involve access to "information," need not be second-guessed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">C.&#x2003;Predictive Judgments Must Be Committed to Agency Discretion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">National security concerns render the Board and Northover's positions untenable. It is naive to suppose that employees without direct access to <span id="Page_2564"></span>already classified information cannot affect national security. The Board and Northover's narrow focus on access to classified information ignores the impact employees without security clearances, but in sensitive positions, can have.[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15] There are certainly numerous government positions with potential to adversely affect national security. The Board goes too far by comparing a government position at a military base commissary to one in a "Seven Eleven across the street." Oral Argument at 28:10-15, <span class="Italic">Berry v. Conyers</span>, 2011-3207 (May 11, 2012), available at <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html</a>. Commissary employees do not merely observe "[g]rocery store stock levels" or otherwise publicly observable information. In fact, commissary stock levels of a particular unclassified item--sunglasses, for example, with shatterproof lenses, or rehydration backpacks--might well hint at deployment orders to a particular region for an identifiable unit. Such troop movements are inherently secret. <span class="Italic">Cf. Near v. State of Minnesota ex rel. Olson</span>, 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931) ("When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right....' No one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the <span class="Italic">publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops</span>.")(quoting <span class="Italic">Schenck v. United States</span>, 249 U.S. 47, 52 (1919)) (emphasis added). This is not mere speculation, because, as OPM contends, numbers and locations could very well be derived by a skilled intelligence analyst from military commissary stock levels. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Argument at 13:19-14:03, <span class="Italic">Berry v. Conyers</span>, 2011-3207 (May 11, 2012), available at <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html</a> (Q: "Can a position be sensitive simply because it provides observability? That is, one of these examples that was given was someone working at a commissary; it seems to me that someone working at a commissary has an opportunity, without access to classified information, to observe troop levels, potential for where someone is going, from what they are buying, that sort of thing." A: "I think that is right your honor. We agree with that, and I think in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, he, Mr. Egan worked on a nuclear submarine. And so, part of it was simply from what he was observing by coming and going of a nuclear submarine. And so, sensitivity can be the place where the employee works, what are they able to observe, what could they infer from, what you say, from the purchases and shipments....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Defining the impact an individual may have on national security is the type of predictive judgment that must be made by those with necessary expertise. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529 ("The attempt to define not only the individual's future actions, but those of outside and unknown influences renders the 'grant or denial of security clearances...an inexact science at best.'") (citation omitted). When evaluating an individual for employment, it is those with such expertise who effectively can apply the Agency's "clearly consistent with the interests of national security" standard, which otherwise would conflict with the Board's "preponderance of the evidence" standard. While in certain circumstances courts can certainly consider the merits of a decision concerning national security, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> held that scenario unworkable here:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As noted above, security clearance normally will be granted only if it is "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security." The Board, however, reviews adverse actions under a preponderance of the evidence standard. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). These two standards seem inconsistent. It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing from the "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security" test. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift this emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 531. DoD regulations require that the determination of an employee's ineligibility to hold a sensitive position must be "consistent with the interests of national security." <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.6(b) ("The personnel security standard that must be applied to determine whether a person is eligible for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties is whether, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that entrusting the person with classified information or assigning the person to sensitive duties is <span class="Italic">clearly consistent with the interests of national security</span>.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 937 (1949-1953 Comp.). Thus, such Agency determinations cannot be reviewable by the Board because it would improperly place an inconsistent burden of proof upon the government.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the sources upon which intelligence is based are often open and publically available. Sometimes, intelligence is obtained from sources in a fashion the source's government would find improper. Occasionally, those means of obtention are coercive and/or subversive. For example, the intelligence community may view certain disparaging information concerning an employee as a vulnerability which can be used to blackmail or coerce information out of the individual. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528 (recognizing that the government has a compelling interest in protecting truly sensitive information from those who, "under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons...might compromise sensitive information"). The type of information that can be coerced may vary depending on the employee's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Mr. Northover was a Commissary Management Specialist for the Defense Commissary Agency. This position is not the type of position that involves mere stocking of items on shelves. It is a management position that entails carrying out a range of computer assisted ordering tasks. The work is described to include generating and utilizing a wide variety of system reports as inventory and merchandising management tools. The incumbent is responsible for training, overseeing, and monitoring the work of lower-grade employees. A Commissary Management Specialist may work <span class="Italic">uncommon tours of duty</span> as required. At bottom, this position does not merely involve a "low-level" employee whose duties and exposure are inconsequential.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This area of National Security Law is largely about preventing human source intelligence gathering in a manner which does not, in an open society, unnecessarily limit the public's right to access information about its government's activities. Still, there clearly is a need for such prevention. Within the sphere of national security limitations on government employment, our society has determined that courts should defer to the agencies' threat limiting expertise. <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528-30.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While threats may change with time, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s analysis remains valid. The advent of electronic records management, computer analysis, and cyber-warfare have made potential espionage targets containing means to access matters concerning national security vastly more susceptible to harm by people without security clearances. The mechanics of planting within a computer system a means of intelligence gathering are beyond the ken of the judiciary; what matters is that there are today more sensitive areas of access than there were when <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was authored. Its underlying analysis, nevertheless, is completely applicable--the President, as Commander-in-Chief, has the right and the obligation, within the law, to protect the nation against potential threats. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 527.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The potential for arbitrary application of this right under the guise of national security is a point of contention for Northover and the Board. These concerns however do not require a different result. Specifically, Northover and the Board raise concerns of the likely preclusion of judicial review of any alleged constitutional and statutory violations (e.g., whistleblower retaliation) for federal employees. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> rejected similar concerns of arbitrary designations and pretextual removal of federal employees, and there is no basis for a different conclusion in this case. Indeed, these concerns can no more justify review of an eligibility determination than of a clearance determination. Former Chief Judge Markey's analysis is worth noting:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The...underlying rationale is a felt necessity to "protect" civilian employees against "arbitrary" denials of security clearances. <span class="Italic">Amicus</span> and the majority see the boogy-men of "specious, arbitrary, discriminatory" clearance denials.... Whence the fear of arbitrary denials? Whence the automatic refusal of even a modicum of at least initial trust in Navy officials? Whence the disregard of the process (denial response denial appeal final denial) conducted by the Navy...before denying a clearance?.... The conjecture that Navy officials might act arbitrarily is not only unwarranted, it is far too weak a reed on which to rest a determination that MSPB must decide which employees of the armed forces should be granted security clearances. Given that the responsibility is the Navy's, and given the system of high level, objective, impersonal, decisionmaking employed by the Navy in carrying out that responsibility, including the employee's chance to respond and to appeal to higher authority within the agency, I can see no reason why, under those circumstances, the Navy should not be allowed to exercise its <span class="Italic">judgment</span> in exercising <span class="Italic">its</span> authority to grant or deny security clearances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Egan v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 802 F.2d 1563, 1576-77 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Markey, C.J. dissenting), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988) (emphasis in original). Moreover, DoD maintains an internal review process of eligibility determinations, which undermines the concerns Northover and the Board raise. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.56; <span class="Italic">see also Romero v. Dep't of Def</span>., 658 F.3d 1372, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (articulating the general organizational framework and review process used by the DoD when making security clearance determinations). Accordingly, the merits of the Agency determination before us are not reviewable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">V.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2565"></span>For the foregoing reasons, the Board cannot review the merits of DoD national security determinations concerning eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security. There is nothing talismanic about eligibility for access to classified information. The core question is whether the Agency determination concerns eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security. When the answer to that question is in the affirmative, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies and the Board plays a limited role in its review of the determination. Thus, the Board's decision with respect to Mr. Northover is reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Ms. Conyers's appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A compelling, but not controlling, dissent was offered in the <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> <span class="Italic">en banc</span> decision by Circuit Judge Dyk, joined by Judges Newman and Reyna, who were of the opinion that the measure of discretion to agency officials making determinations on eligibility of employees to hold sensitive positions was outweighed by statutory and constitutional due process constraints on adverse actions, 733 F.3d at 1166-80:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority opinion upholds sweeping claims by the Department of Defense ("DoD") that it may take adverse actions against non-critical sensitive employees without review by the Merit Systems Protection Board ("MSPB" or "Board"). The effect is to effectively deny MSPB review for hundreds of thousands of federal employees--a number that is likely to increase as more positions are designated as non-critical sensitive. In my view, the DoD has acted without authority from either the President or Congress, and contrary to the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1101 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In essence, the majority's decision rests on the flawed premise that the DoD, acting on its own--without either Congressional or Presidential authority--has "inherent authority" to discharge employees on national security grounds. No decision of the Supreme Court or any other court supports this proposition. Whatever the policy justifications for precluding MSPB review, this is a matter for Congress (and the President), not the DoD, to determine. Ironically, the majority rests its decision on grounds of separation of powers. But the majority decision both blesses and itself engages in a violation of separation of powers principles--sustaining agency action without either Presidential or Congressional authorization, and resting its decision on its own assessment of national security requirements. I respectfully dissent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As an initial matter, the majority's decision is not mandated by, or even supported by, the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). The majority extends <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to create an implied exception to MSPB review of the merits of suitability determinations for non-critical sensitive employees--here, a commissary employee (Northover) whose job required neither a security clearance nor access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Supreme Court held that the MSPB could not review the merits of an agency decision to deny an employee a security clearance where that employee was required to access classified information as a condition of his employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 520, 529. The majority extends <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to bar the MSPB from reviewing the merits of agency determinations that employees are not suitable to hold sensitive positions. In other words, the majority extends <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s prohibition of MSPB merits review of the DoD's <span class="Italic">security clearance determinations</span> to its <span class="Italic">suitability determinations</span> (i.e., whether an employee is eligible to hold a non-critical sensitive position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority's extension of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not supported by the language of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> itself. The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> opinion emphasizes that it decided the "narrow question" of "whether the [MSPB] ha[d] authority by statute to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action." 484 U.S. at 520. The majority's extension of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> marks a departure from our own prior reading of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and makes it unique among federal courts of appeals. We have explained that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> "held that the [MSPB] has no authority to review the merits of a <span class="Italic">security clearance determination</span>." <span class="Italic">Cheney v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 479 F.3d 1343, 1349-50 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (emphasis added) (citing <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529). Other circuits have similarly characterized <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as limited to security clearances.[2] Indeed, the Fifth Circuit recently confirmed that "[n]o court has extended <span class="Italic">Egan</span> beyond security clearances." <span class="Italic">Toy v. Holder</span>, 714 F.3d 881, 885 (5th Cir. 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Rattigan v. Holder</span>, 689 F.3d 764, 768 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (noting that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> "covers only security clearance-related decisions"); <span class="Italic">Zeinali v. Raytheon Co</span>., 636 F.3d 544, 549-50 (9th Cir. 2011) (noting that the "core holding" of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is that "federal courts may not review the merits of the executive's decision to grant or deny a security clearance"); <span class="Italic">Duane v. U.S. Dep't of Def</span>., 275 F.3d 988, 993 (10th Cir. 2002) ("<span class="Italic">Egan</span> held that the Navy's substantive decision to revoke or deny a security clearance...was not subject to review on the merits by the [MSPB].").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the majority appears not to dispute that the actual holding in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not support the DoD's action here, the majority finds in the "principles" of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> DoD authority to remove employees on national security grounds. The majority concludes that there is no distinction between security clearance determinations and suitability determinations when those determinations implicate national security. In the majority's view, because Congressional legislation does not forbid the exercise of such authority, the DoD is assumed to possess inherent authority. But neither <span class="Italic">Egan</span> nor any other decision of the Supreme Court, this court, or any other appeals court supports this remarkable claim of inherent authority. Rather, these decisions have rejected such claims of independent agency authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, in the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> case, Egan did not contend that the President had failed to delegate authority to the agencies, and notably the agencies were specifically authorized by Executive Order to make "final" access determinations. There is no similar Presidential Order here. The President has not delegated any authority to the DoD to make "final" decisions with respect to suitability determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The President has traditionally had special authority in safeguarding classified information, and has delegated that authority--which includes the authority to deny or revoke such access--to agencies employing such individuals. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> recognized and relied on the President's unique authority over classified information. The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> court noted that the President's "authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security...exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant." 484 U.S. at 527.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the delegation issue was not raised in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Presidential authority was specifically delegated to the relevant agencies. Executive Orders, both at the time of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and later, prescribed procedures for granting and revoking access to classified information, and the agency decisions in those respects were explicitly deemed to be "final," unreviewable decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 12,968, &#x00A7; 5.2(a)(6), 3 C.F.R. 391 (1995 Comp.) (appeals panel within the agency makes the "final" decision), <span class="Italic">reprinted as amended in</span> 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435; Exec. Order No. 10,865, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 398 (1959-1963 Comp.) (allowing "an authorization for access to a specific classification category" granted by an agency to be "finally denied or revoked"), <span class="Italic">reprinted as amended in</span> 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435. Thus, the President unambiguously delegated to agencies determinations as to whether an employee was entitled to access classified information. The President here has claimed no such executive authority over removal of employees on national security grounds, and there is no delegation of removal authority to agencies. The majority points to no Executive Order delegating removal authority to the DoD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM") suggests that authority can be found in Executive Order 10,450, that Executive Order confers no authority to agencies to make either final classified access or suitability determinations. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the Supreme Court relied on Executive Order 10,450 for only two propositions: (1) that access to classified information could be granted only after a background investigation and (2) the standard for such access was that the access was "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security." <span class="Italic">See Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528 (citing Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 936 (1949-1953 Comp.), <span class="Italic">reprinted as amended in</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7311). The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> court did not rely on the Executive Order for the proposition that agencies have "final," unreviewable authority with respect to the necessary suitability determinations at issue here--a matter that was addressed in the security clearance context by Executive Order 10,865, as referenced above. Notably, a later Executive Order specifically distinguished between 10,450 and 10,865, noting that "denial and revocation procedures" were governed by Executive Order 10,865, as amended, and not by Executive Order 10,450. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 12,968, &#x00A7; 7.2(c), 3 C.F.R. 391 (1995 Comp.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Just as Executive Order 10,450 did not render determinations regarding access to classified information unreviewable, it also does not render suitability determinations unreviewable, and unlike the situation in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, there is no other executive order that does so. In other words, Executive Order 10,450 does not delegate to agencies either the authority to terminate access to classified information (a matter addressed in another executive order) or general removal authority where the employee is not suitable for a national security position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Executive Order 10,450 deals with removal at all, the executive order does no more than provide for removal pursuant to a specific Congressional statute authorizing such removal on national security grounds, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532, a provision not invoked here. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 10,450 &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4-6. This is confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, which concluded that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">it is clear from the face of...Executive Order [10,450] that the President did not intend to override statutory limitations on the dismissal of employees, and <span class="Italic">promulgated the Order solely as an implementation of the 1950 Act [i.e., &#x00A7; 7532]</span> . Thus &#x00A7; 6 of the Order purports to authorize dismissals only 'in accordance with the said Act of August 26, 1950,' [&#x00A7; 7532] and similar references are made in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 4, 5, and 7....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2566"></span>351 U.S. 536, 557 n.20 (1956) (emphasis added). At oral argument here, OPM conceded that, to the extent that Executive Order 10,450 addresses the President's removal authority over employees, it does no more than implement &#x00A7; 7532. As the Court in <span class="Italic">Cole</span> further noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When the President expressly confines his action to the limits of statutory authority, the validity of the action must be determined solely by the congressional limitations which the President sought to respect, whatever might be the result were the President ever to assert his independent power against that of Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">351 U.S. at 557 n.20. Unsurprisingly, then, OPM conceded before the MSPB that its Part 732 regulations, which "have their genesis in Executive Order 10[,] 450," did not authorize removal procedures and "are silent on the scope of an employee's rights to Board review when an agency deems the employee ineligible to occupy a sensitive position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, Executive Order 10,450 does not authorize the DoD's actions. In contrast to the situation existing at the time of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, OPM can point to no other Executive Order that renders final agency decisions with respect to suitability. The lack of delegated authority with respect to suitability determinations, as opposed to security clearance determinations, is fatal to OPM's position. The lack of such delegated authority here makes <span class="Italic">Egan</span> inapposite, and the DoD's actions without authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the few national security and foreign affairs cases (other than <span class="Italic">Egan</span>) on which the majority relies all involve situations in which the authority asserted was authorized by Congressional legislation or an Executive Order of the President. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Dames &#x0026; Moore v. Regan</span>, 453 U.S. 654, 686 (1981) ("[T]he President was authorized to suspend pending claims <span class="Italic">pursuant to Executive Order No. 12294</span>." (emphasis added)); <span class="Italic">United States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp</span>., 299 U.S. 304, 325-28 (1936) (various statutes and joint resolutions passed by Congress authorized the President to prohibit certain exports from the United States).[4] None of those cases remotely supports agency action on national security grounds without Congressional or Presidential authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See also Boumediene v. Bush</span>, 553 U.S. 723, 732-33 (2008) (declining to address the question of whether the President has authority hold detainees at Guantanamo Bay but holding that the statutes giving the President authority to suspend habeas corpus "operate[d] as an unconstitutional suspension of the writ"); <span class="Italic">Lincoln v. Vigil</span>, 508 U.S. 182, 194 (1993) (holding that an agency decision to discontinue a program was authorized by law because the action "f[ell] within the [Indian Health] Service's statutory mandate to provide health care to Indian people"); <span class="Italic">Youngstown Sheet &#x0026; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>, 343 U.S. 579, 585, 588-89 (1952) (rejecting the President's assertion of authority to seize steel mills because "[t]he President's power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, as a general matter, agencies only have such removal authority as is conferred by Congressional statute. We are dealing with the DoD's authority to remove employees for national security reasons--either by removing them from a position by demotion as here (in Northover's case) or by discharging them from DoD employment entirely.[5] Employees such as Northover who are appointed by members of the Executive Branch other than the President can only be removed as authorized by Congressional legislation. In <span class="Italic">United States v. Perkins</span>, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886), the Supreme Court made this clear in holding that Executive Branch employees not appointed by the President cannot be removed without Congressional authority:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]hen Congress, by law, vests the appointment of inferior officers [or civil service employees] in the heads of [agencies] <span class="Italic">it may limit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest</span>. The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to the officers so appointed. <span class="Italic">The head of a[n]</span> <span class="Italic"> [agency]</span> <span class="Italic"> has no constitutional prerogative of appointment to offices independently of the legislation of Congress</span>, and by such legislation he must be governed, not only in making appointments, but in all that is incident thereto [i.e., removals].</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphases added). There is no claim here that the DoD's actions bypassing MSPB review were authorized by Congress.[6] <span class="Italic">Perkins</span> is directly inconsistent with the DoD's claim of inherent authority to discharge employees appointed by the agency without MSPB review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In the case of Conyers, she was removed from her position by an indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The only statute that the majority cites that appears remotely relevant is 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564, which states that, "[f]or the purposes of" a statutory provision providing for expedited processing of background investigations for DoD security clearances, "it is not necessary for the performance of duties [of investigated employees] to involve classified activities or classified matters in order for the duties to be considered sensitive and critical to the national security." This provision was merely meant to prioritize some DoD background investigations for positions that require investigations, <span class="Italic">see</span> H.R. Rep. No. 106-945, at 853 (2000) (Conf. Rep.), and does not provide any indication that Congress intended to grant authority to agencies to take adverse actions, without MSPB review, against DoD employees who do not require access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This limitation on agency authority in the removal context is a manifestation of the general principle that agencies do not have independent authority apart from Congressional statute. Agencies may not act "in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 706. And while the majority relies on a variety of DoD regulations to support its position, the Supreme Court has held that "[t]he rulemaking power granted to an administrative agency charged with the administration of a federal statute is not the power to make law. Rather, it is the power to adopt regulations <span class="Italic">to carry into effect the will of Congress as expressed by the statute</span>." <span class="Italic">Ernst &#x0026; Ernst v. Hochfelder</span>, 425 U.S. 185, 213-14 (1976) (emphasis added) (quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, the Supreme Court has held that agencies have no authority, apart from the President and Congress, to take action on grounds of national security. The leading decision is <span class="Italic">Greene v. McElroy</span>, 360 U.S. 474 (1959). In that case, the petitioner was removed from his job in the private sector after his required security clearance was revoked by the Secretary of the Navy, and that revocation was affirmed by the Eastern Industrial Personnel Security Board ("EIPSB"). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 481-83, 489-90. The court of appeals there determined "that the Executive Department alone [wa]s competent to evaluate the competing considerations which exist in determining the persons who are to be afforded security clearances," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 491, much like the majority does here. However, the Supreme Court found that the removal procedures established by the agency and the EIPSB "were established by...the Secretary of Defense or the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force," and that "[n]one [of the procedures] was the creature of statute or of an Executive Order issued by the President." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 495. Accordingly, the majority reversed the administrative determination, concluding that,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n the context of security clearance cases,...<span class="Italic">it must be made clear that the President or Congress, within their respective constitutional powers, specifically has decided that the imposed procedures are necessary and warranted and has authorized their use.</span> Such decisions cannot be assumed by acquiescence or nonaction. They must be made <span class="Italic">explicitly</span> not only to assure that individuals are not deprived of cherished rights under procedures not actually authorized, but also because explicit action, especially in areas of doubtful constitutionality, requires careful and purposeful consideration by those responsible for enacting and implementing our laws. Without explicit action by lawmakers, decisions of great constitutional import and effect would be relegated by default to administrators who, under our system of government, are not endowed with authority to decide them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 507 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted); <span class="Italic">see also Cafeteria &#x0026; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy</span>, 367 U.S. 886, 889, 893 (1961) (upholding a commanding officer's decision to deny a cafeteria worker access to a military installation where it was "well settled that a Post Commander c[ould], under the authority conferred on him by <span class="Italic">statutes</span> and regulations,...exclude private persons and property therefrom" (emphasis added)). Nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> purports to overrule <span class="Italic">Greene</span> (cited by the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> dissent, <span class="Italic">see</span> 484 U.S. at 536 (White, J., dissenting)), or suggests that agencies can exercise removal powers without Presidential or Congressional authorization. Rather, as noted earlier, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> relies on the existence of Presidential--not agency--authority to determine access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Quite apart from the DoD's lack of Presidential or Congressional authority, the DoD action here is directly contrary to the CSRA, which broadly provides for review of adverse actions. Congress, by adopting specific national security exemptions from MSPB review that do not apply to Northover, has confirmed that the statutory MSPB review procedures are applicable in other circumstances. This determination is binding on both the DoD and the President.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When it enacted the CSRA, Congress created a broad statutory scheme that was designed to confer upon the MSPB extensive review authority over adverse actions affecting government employees. Subchapter II of Chapter 75 of the CSRA gives every "employee" the right to seek MSPB review of adverse actions, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), and "employee" includes most government employees who have served in either the competitive or excepted service for at least one year. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). Beyond the CSRA's broad coverage of government employees, the act also provides the MSPB with review authority over a broad array of adverse actions, including "removals," "suspension[s] for more than 14 days," "reduction[s] in grade," "reduction[s] in pay," and "furlough[s] of 30 days or less." <span class="Italic">See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7512. Congress made clear when it passed the CSRA that "[t]hese provisions [were to] govern <span class="Italic">any</span> [adverse] action where the basis of the <span id="Page_2567"></span>agency action is misconduct <span class="Italic">or any other cause</span> besides unacceptable performance." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 46 (1978) (emphases added). The agency concedes that Northover received a demotion, which is among the enumerated adverse actions covered by the statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress granted this broad authority for a reason: by providing for MSPB review, civil service employees would be "protected against arbitrary action, personal favoritism, and...partisan political coercion" that may occur within government agencies. S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 19 (1978). The MSPB was designed as a check on both agency and OPM actions, as "[e]stablishment of a strong and independent Board" was designed to "discourage subversions of merit principles." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 7. In fact, Congress made clear that, "[a]bsent...[the] mandate for independence [of] the Merit Board, it is unlikely that [Congress] would have granted [OPM] the power it has or the latitude to delegate personnel authority to the agencies." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress has been notably aware of national security issues in the context of government employment. Congress has not created a general national security exception that places limitations on MSPB review or given agencies the authority to create such an exception. Instead, Congress created specific exceptions to deal with national security issues, balancing the needs of national security with the right to MSPB review. None of those exceptions is applicable here, and the very existence of these numerous exceptions refutes the existence of agency authority to create others.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, implementing the decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, Congress has authorized agencies to deny access to classified information and has exempted such determinations from MSPB review. Congress, in 1994, added Title VIII to the National Security Act of 1947, granting the President authority to "establish procedures to govern access to classified information." Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Title VIII, &#x00A7; 802(a), 108 Stat. 3423, 3435 (1994) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435(a)). The statute authorizes the President to establish "uniform minimum standards" of procedures for "employees in the executive branch...whose access to classified information is...denied or terminated," <span class="Italic">see</span> 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435(a)(5), and makes those standards "binding upon all departments, agencies, and offices of the executive branch of Government," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 435(a); <span class="Italic">see also id</span>. &#x00A7; 435(a)(2) (noting that the standards govern Executive Branch employees "who require access to classified information as part of their official responsibilities"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 435(a)(3) (same); <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 435(a)(4) (referring to employees "requir[ing] access to particularly sensitive classified information"). Consistent with <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the goal of the statute was to provide minimal procedural protections to employees in connection with security clearance procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> H.R. Rep. No. 103-753, at 54 (1994) (Conf. Rep.). The statute conferred no authority to terminate employees in non-critical sensitive positions that did not require access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.[8]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Along the same lines, Congress amended Title VIII in 2004 to require the President to designate an agency (ultimately, OPM) that would "conduct...security clearance investigations of [government] employees...<span class="Italic">who require access to classified information</span>...." Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, &#x00A7; 3001(c)(1), 118 Stat. 3638, 3707 (emphasis added) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 435b(c)(1)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, Congress, in &#x00A7; 7532, conferred general authority on the heads of government agencies to remove employees where the removal "is necessary or advisable in the interests of national security." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532(b). While <span class="Italic">Egan</span> concluded that &#x00A7; 7532 did not provide the sole means of ordering the review of security clearances--a view confirmed by <span class="Italic">Carlucci v. Doe</span>, 488 U.S. 93 (1988)[9] --the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> had no occasion to address national security suitability determinations or the impact of this exception on the scope of the Civil Service Reform Act as to national security suitability determinations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 484 U.S. at 532-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>, an employee of the National Security Agency ("NSA") was terminated after the employee disclosed to the NSA that he had engaged in homosexual relationships with foreign nationals. 488 U.S. at 97-98. Though <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span> explained (and the majority emphasizes) that the summary removal procedures of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532 and 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 833 did not furnish the exclusive basis for agency removals on national security grounds, it emphasized that, apart from the summary suspension authority, the NSA had a general authority to remove employees for national security reasons under 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 831. <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>, 488 U.S. at 102-03; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 831 (permitting the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations "to assure...that no person shall be employed in, or detailed or assigned to, the <span class="Italic">National Security Agency</span>..., or continue to be so employed...unless such employment...is clearly consistent with the national security" (emphasis added)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Thus, in contrast to this case, a specific statute conferred removal authority on the NSA, and exempted the NSA from the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 831; <span class="Italic">see also Carlucci</span>, 488 U.S. at 96-97 (noting that 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 831 was part of the NSA Personnel Security Procedures Act, which adopted separate removal procedures from the CSRA).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, before <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, Congress granted the director of the Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA") plenary authority to "terminate the employment of any officer or employee of the [CIA] whenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States." National Security Act of 1947, Pub. L. No. 80-253, &#x00A7; 102(c), 61 Stat. 495, 498 (1947) (codified at 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 403-4a(e)(1)). In 1964, similarly, Congress exempted employees of the National Security Agency ("NSA") from MSPB review. <span class="Italic">See</span> Act of Mar. 26, 1964, Pub. L. No. 88290, &#x00A7; 303(a), 78 Stat. 168, 169. These exemptions covered employees of these agencies whether or not their positions required access to classified information, and were designed to enable heads of agencies to discharge employees based on national security concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, after <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, in 1990, when Congress expanded MSPB review to the excepted service, <span class="Italic">see</span> Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990), it provided that employees of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") as well as the CIA and NSA were exempted from MSPB review "because of their sensitive missions." H.R. Rep. No. 101-328, at 5. In 1996, Congress expanded the exemptions from MSPB review even further to include <span class="Italic">all</span> "intelligence component[s] of the Department of Defense." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(b); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Policy Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-201, &#x00A7; 1634(B), 110 Stat. 2745, 2752 (1996). DoD did not seek, and Congress did not grant, such authority over employees in non-intelligence components of the DoD.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Then, also in 1996, Congress granted the Secretary of Defense the authority to "terminate...<span class="Italic">any employee</span> in a defense intelligence position," regardless of whether the employee was part of an intelligence component, where he "determine[d] that the procedures prescribed in other provisions of law that authorize the termination of the employment of such employee [e.g., &#x00A7; 7513] cannot be invoked in a manner consistent with the national security." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1609(a)-(b) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see</span> Department of Defense Civilian Personnel Policy Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-201, sec. 1632(a), 110 Stat. 2745, 2748 (1996) (relevant portion codified as amended at 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1609). These terminations are "final and may not be appealed or reviewed outside the [DoD]." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1609(b). Unlike &#x00A7; 7532, the provision "does not affect the right of the employee involved to seek or accept employment with any other department or agency of the United States if that employee is declared eligible for such employment by the Director of [OPM]." 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1609(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fifth, in 2003, Congress took further action to limit MSPB merits review of certain national security employees under Chapter 75 of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-136, &#x00A7; 1101, 117 Stat. 1392, 1621-33 (2003). The legislation empowered the Director of OPM to establish a National Security Personnel System ("NSPS"). <span class="Italic">Id</span>. &#x00A7; 1101(a) (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(a) (2006)). It allowed OPM to establish appeal procedures separate from the MSPB's procedures. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h)(1)(A) (2006)). Though the MSPB review standards were to apply by default in the NSPS, Congress made clear that the standards were not to apply where "<span class="Italic">such standards and precedents [we]</span> <span class="Italic">re inconsistent with legal standards established [by the Secretary]</span> <span class="Italic">.</span>" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (codified at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 9902(h)(3) (2006)) (emphasis added). By creating this exception, then, Congress allowed the Secretary of Defense to bypass the independent MSPB review process--and to do so with respect to any employee, including those who did not require security clearances. And that is exactly what the Secretary did. However, on January 28, 2008, Congress eliminated the DoD's authority to create a separate appeals process and invalidated those regulations that would have restricted the MSPB's review authority. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-181, &#x00A7; 1106(a), (b)(3), 122 Stat. 3, 349, 356-57.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evolution of these numerous exceptions to MSPB review in the national security context confirm that Congress did not create or authorize a general national security exemption from MSPB review. This extensive Congressional action is quite inconsistent with the majority's view that the DoD has inherent authority to remove employees on national security grounds without MSPB review. If the DoD had such inherent authority there would have been no need for these detailed and specific Congressional actions. There is also not the slightest suggestion in the long series of Congressional actions that it viewed the DoD as having inherent authority to remove employees on national security grounds without MSPB review. The majority's contrary view is inconsistent with established authority holding that "'[w]here Congress explicitly enumerates certain exceptions to a general prohibition, additional exceptions are not to be implied, in the absence of evidence of a contrary legislative intent.'" <span class="Italic">Hillman v. Maretta</span>, 569 U.S. __, __, 133 S. Ct. 1943, 1953 (2013) (quoting <span class="Italic">Andrus v. Glover Constr. Co</span>., 446 U.S. 608, 616-17 (1980)); <span class="Italic">see also TRW Inc. v. Andrews</span>, 534 U.S. 19, 28 (2001) (same); <span class="Italic">United States v. Brockamp</span>, 519 U.S. 347, 352 (1997) (noting that an "explicit listing of exceptions...indicate[s] to us that Congress did not intend courts to read other unmentioned...exceptions into the statute"). <span id="Page_2568"></span>Congress's careful creation and, in one case, elimination of national security exceptions is directly inconsistent with the majority's claim that the DoD possesses inherent authority apart from the CSRA to discharge employees on national security grounds without MSPB review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority makes a specious attempt to suggest that some of these numerous Congressional actions were not motivated by national security concerns. No objective reading of these Congressional actions can avoid the conclusion that national security and employment was a matter of intense Congressional concern and that Congress legislated repeatedly in this area to accommodate these national security concerns. Neither the existence of non-security related exemptions for other agencies promulgated in the 1990 amendments to the CSRA nor Congressional concern with employee bargaining rights in repealing the NSPS should indicate that these Congressional actions were not the product of a Congressional decision to strike an appropriate balance between national security concerns and the right to MSPB review, a balance that is deeply undermined by today's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, even if the CSRA were ambiguous (which it is not), the Board (and not the DoD or OPM) is charged with administering the pertinent adverse action provisions of Chapter 75 of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204, 7701. The Board has concluded that it has jurisdiction over national security removals (not involving access to classified information), and <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> requires that we defer to the MSPB's interpretation of its own jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the MSPB held that it lacked jurisdiction over "underlying security clearance determination[s]." <span class="Italic">Egan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509, 514-15, 519-20 (1985). Here, in contrast, the Board, interpreting the pertinent sections of the CSRA, concluded that its jurisdiction to review adverse actions extended to review of the underlying suitability determination. <span class="Italic">Conyers v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572, 577, 585-86 (2010); <span class="Italic">Northover v. Dep't of Defense</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 451, 456, 464 (2010). The Board reasoned that 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204 directs the Board to "adjudicate...all matters within [its] jurisdiction," and that employees subjected to adverse actions, as defined in &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511 and 7512, are "entitled to appeal to the [Board] under section 7701." <span class="Italic">See Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 577; <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1204, 7511, 7512. The Board considered and rejected OPM's argument that it could not review the merits of national security determinations underlying adverse actions. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 578-86.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">City of Arlington, Texas v. Federal Communications Commission</span>, which was decided after briefing in this case, the Supreme Court made clear that <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference extends to an agency's interpretation of its own jurisdictional statutes, 133 S. Ct. 1863, 1868 (2013), holding that "no exception exists to the normal [deferential] standard of review for jurisdictional or legal question[s] concerning the coverage of an Act." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1871 (quoting <span class="Italic">NLRB v. City Disposal Sys., Inc.,</span> 465 U.S. 822, 830 n.7 (1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other cases, both our court and the Supreme Court have afforded <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to Board interpretations of the CSRA. <span class="Italic">See Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 659 (1985); <span class="Italic">Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec</span>., 437 F.3d 1322, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 407 F.3d 1326, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">see also Lovshin v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 767 F.2d 826, 840 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (acknowledging that "deference is appropriately given to the MSPB's interpretation of the CSRA"). Here, the Board resolved the statutory ambiguity in a formal adjudication. <span class="Italic">See Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 572; <span class="Italic">Northover</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 451. Formal adjudications are entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Fed'n of Fed. Emps., Local 1309 v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 526 U.S. 86, 89-90, 98-99 (1999). Thus, deference is due to the Board's interpretation of its authority, just as deference would have been due to the MSPB's interpretation that it lacked merits review jurisdiction in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ultimately, the majority decision rests on its policy judgment that the MSPB should not review suitability determinations based on national security. For example, the majority urges that the Board is unable to make judgments about national security issues and that the "efficiency of the service" standard implemented by the Board does not leave room for the assessment of predictive judgments as to national security. As the Board points out, while the Board cannot make judgments about security clearances, the Board is required to make judgments in a wide variety of areas as to the suitability of employees. Indeed, in several cases the MSPB has made predictive judgments as to whether an employee is suitable to hold a position, even positions that have an apparent nexus with national security and have striking similarities to the positions at issue here. As with Northover, whose adverse action was taken against him on the basis of delinquent finances, the MSPB has made predictive judgments under the efficiency of the service standard on the basis of delinquent finances.[14]</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">At the end of the day, there may be good policy reasons to cabin MSPB review of adverse actions based on national security suitability determinations. But Congress has made a judgment to restrict, rather than eliminate, MSPB review in the area of national security. If broader authority is necessary, the affected agencies must seek such authority from Congress or the President, as they have done in the past. What agencies cannot do is claim authority when that authority has not been delegated by either Congress or the President.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The consequences of the majority's decision will be profound. In the DoD alone, it will affect at least 200,000 non-critical sensitive civilian employees whose positions do not require access to security clearances, as OPM conceded at oral argument. Numerous employees in other agencies will be affected as well, as agencies other than DoD designate positions as non-critical sensitive. For example, agencies under the umbrellas of the Department of Homeland Security (such as the Transportation Security Administration), the Department of Energy, the Department of State, and the Justice Department designate positions as non-critical sensitive.[15] There are dozens of pending appeals before the MSPB involving individuals who suffered an adverse action based on their purported ineligibility to hold a sensitive position that await our court's disposition in this case.[16] MSPB review of these and many more such appeals will inevitably be foreclosed by the majority's holding, even though the majority purports to limit its holding to the DoD. These appeals will involve a wide range of positions, including accounting technician and commissary positions (like those held by Conyers and Northover), as well as secretarial, human resources, contract specialist, engineering, and other positions. <span class="Italic">See supra</span> note 16. These appeals will not just apply to removals, but will also apply to suspensions, demotions, reductions in grade or pay, and numerous other adverse actions that effectively remove employees from national security positions. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Meanwhile, the number of employees affected is likely to increase, as a new rule proposed by OPM would allow agencies to designate as non-critical sensitive any "[p]ositions not requiring eligibility for access to classified information, but having the potential to cause significant or serious damage to the national security." <span class="Italic">Designation of National Security Positions in the Competitive Service, and Related Matters</span>, 78 Fed.

If positions of grocery store clerk and accounting secretary are deemed to be sensitive, it is difficult to see which positions in the DoD or other executive agencies would not be deemed sensitive.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;STATUTORY GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL SECURITY BASED REMOVAL OF GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutes provide a two-track system for removal of employees based on national security concerns. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 526. In particular, relevant provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA" or the "Act"), Chapter 75 of Title 5 of the United States Code entitled, "Adverse Actions," provides two subchapters related to removals. The first, subchapter II (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7514), relates to removals for "cause." Under &#x00A7; 7512, an agency's indefinite suspension and a reduction in grade of an employee, as here, may qualify as "adverse actions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2)-(3). An employee subject to an adverse action is entitled to the protections of &#x00A7; 7513, which include written notice of the specific reasons for the proposed action, an opportunity to respond to the charges, the requirement that the agency's action is taken to promote the efficiency of the service, and the right to review by the Board of the action. An employee removed for "cause" has the right, under &#x00A7; 7513(d), to appeal to the Board. On review of the action by the Board under &#x00A7; 7701[6], the Board may sustain the agency's action only if the agency can show that its decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 provides, in relevant part: "An employee, or applicant for employment, may submit an appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board from any action which is appealable to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(a). It is undisputed that Respondents are "employees" as defined in the applicable statutes in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A) ("[E]mployee means...an individual in the competitive service....").</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The second, subchapter IV (&#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7531-7533), relates to removals based upon national security concerns. An employee suspended under &#x00A7; 7532(a) is not entitled to appeal to the Board. Nonetheless, the statute provides for a summary removal process that entitles the employee to specified pre-removal procedural rights, including a hearing by an agency authority. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">EGAN</span>'S APPLICATION TO <span class="Italic">CONYERS</span> AND <span class="Italic">NORTHOVER</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Respondents urge this court to limit <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s application to security clearance determinations, reasoning that national security concerns articulated in that case pertain to access to classified information only. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> cannot be so confined. Its principles instead require that courts refrain from second-guessing Executive Branch agencies' national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, which may not necessarily involve access to classified information. For the following reasons, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> must apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Egan</span> Addressed Broad National Security Concerns That Are Traditionally the Responsibility of the Executive Branch</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Egan</span>, at its core, explained that it is essential for the Executive Branch and its agencies to have broad discretion in making determinations concerning national security. Affording such discretion to agencies, according to <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, is based on the President's "authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and to determine" who gets access, which "flows primarily from [the Commander in Chief Clause] and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant." 484 U.S. at 527. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> also recognized the general principle that foreign policy is the "province and responsibility of the Executive." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 529 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the Court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[I]t is not reasonably possible for an outside non-expert body to review the substance of such a[n agency determination concerning national security] and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction [that a particular individual might compromise sensitive information] with confidence. Nor can such a body determine what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> Hence, unless Congress specifically has provided otherwise, courts traditionally have shown "great deference" to what "the President--the Commander in Chief--has determined...is essential to national security." <span class="Italic">Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council</span>, 555 U.S. 7, 24, 26 (2008) (citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Despite the undisputed role of the Executive within this realm, Respondents argue applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to these cases "may deprive either the Congress or the Judiciary of all freedom of action merely by invoking national security." Certainly, under the Constitution, Congress has a substantial role in both foreign affairs and national security. Congress, therefore, has the power to guide and limit the Executive's application of its powers. Nevertheless, no controlling congressional act is present here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As <span class="Italic">Egan</span> recognized, the CSRA did not confer broad authority to the Board in the national security context.[8] 484 U.S. at 530-31 ("An employee who is removed for 'cause' under &#x00A7; 7513, when his required clearance is denied, is entitled to the several procedural protections specified in that statute. The Board then may determine whether such cause existed, whether in fact clearance was denied, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. <span class="Italic">Nothing in the Act, however, directs or empowers the Board to go further</span>.") (emphasis added). As a result, Congress presumably has left the President and Executive Branch agencies broad discretion to exercise their powers in this area. <span class="Italic">See Dames &#x0026; Moore v. Regan</span>, 453 U.S. 654, 678 (1981) ("Congress cannot anticipate and legislate with regard to every possible action the President may find it necessary to take or every possible situation in which he might act," and "[s]uch failure of Congress...does not, 'especially...in the areas of foreign policy and national security,' imply 'congressional disapproval' of action taken by the Executive.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Haig v. Agee</span>, 453 U.S. 280, 291 (1981)). Accordingly, when "the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization from Congress," his actions should be "supported by the strongest of presumptions and the widest latitude of judicial interpretation, and the burden of persuasion...rest[s] heavily upon any who might attack it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 668 (quoting <span class="Italic">Youngstown Sheet &#x0026; Tube Co. v. Sawyer</span>, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). Courts thus must tread lightly when faced with the potential of second-guessing discretionary agency determinations concerning national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;The dissent states the majority has "completely fail[ed] to come to grips with the [CSRA]." In 1990, the CSRA was amended after the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">U.S. v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439 (1988). There, the Court decided that the CSRA's silence regarding appeal rights for non-preference eligible members of the excepted service reflected congressional intent to preclude any review under chapter 75 for such employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 448. In response, Congress passed the Civil Service Due Process Amendments ("1990 Amendments") expanding the Board's jurisdiction to some, but not all, non-preference eligible excepted service employees. Pub. L. No. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The dissent construes the 1990 Amendments as extending by implication Board review of agency determinations concerning sensitive positions. Because certain agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency, and National Security Agency were expressly exempted, the dissent posits that Board review must extend to all other positions that were not excluded. Certain employees of the General Accounting Office, the Veterans Health Sciences and Research Administration, the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, however, were also excluded, because separate statutes excluded the employees of these agencies from the normal appeals process. H.R. Rep. No. 101-328 at 5 (1989), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 695. Thus, the dissent's view that Congress "crafted some exceptions for national security and not others" is speculative because "national security" was not a factor providing for these exclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_2571"></span>Similarly, the dissent refers to the Department of Defense's ("DOD") creation of the National Security Personnel System ("NSPS") in 2003 to further support the notion that Congress spoke on the issue before this court. The dissent's position is neither supported by statutory language nor legislative history. The statute creating the NSPS, the subsequent repeal of certain regulations concerning the DOD's appeals process, and the ultimate repeal of the statute creating the NSPS itself in 2009, do not show that Congress intended to preclude the DOD from insulating employment decisions concerning national security from Board review. NSPS was established to overhaul the then-existing personnel management system and polices of the DOD. <span class="Italic">See</span> National Defense Authorization Act, Pub. L. 108-136, 117 Stat. 1392 (2003). In 2009, NSPS was repealed largely due in part to strong opposition from labor organizations regarding issues of collective bargaining. <span class="Italic">See</span> Department of Defense Human Resources Management and Labor Relations Systems, 70 Fed. Reg. 66,123; <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 111-35 at 185 (2009) ("[T]he committee has received many complaints from DOD employees during the 5 years during which the [DOD] has sought to implement NSPS, to the detriment of needed human capital planning and workforce management initiatives."). There is nothing in these statutes that shows Congress intended Board review of agency determinations pertaining to employees in sensitive positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The existence of &#x00A7; 7532 does not alter the agencies' broad discretion to exercise their powers in the national security context. The Board and Respondents argue that Congress has spoken directly on the issue of removal for national security concerns by enacting &#x00A7; 7532, and that applying <span class="Italic">Egan</span> in this instance "would in essence allow the Executive to replace &#x00A7; 7532 with &#x00A7; 7513...rendering &#x00A7; 7532 a nullity." This argument is similar, if not identical, to those rejected by the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> Court. 484 U.S. at 533 ("The argument is that the availability of the &#x00A7; 7532 procedure is a 'compelling' factor in favor of Board review of a security-clearance denial in a case under &#x00A7; 7513.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Court observed the alternative availability of &#x00A7; 7513 and &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 532. Specifically, the Court acknowledged that &#x00A7; 7532 does not preempt &#x00A7; 7513 and that the two statutes stand separately and provide alternative routes for administrative action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In addition, the Court found that the two sections were not anomalous, but merely different. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 533. The Court also found that one section did not necessarily provide greater procedural protections than the other. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 533-34.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court in <span class="Italic">Carlucci v. Doe</span>, 488 U.S. 93 (1988), further articulated and clarified &#x00A7; 7532's applicability. In that case, the Court determined that the summary removal mechanism set out in &#x00A7; 7532, as well as 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 833,[9] were discretionary mechanisms in cases involving dismissals for national security reasons. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 100. The Court found that &#x00A7; 7532 was not mandatory, but rather permissive: "'Notwithstanding other statutes,' the head of an agency 'may' suspend and remove employees 'in the interests of national security.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting &#x00A7; 7532) (finding nothing in the legislative history of &#x00A7; 7532 indicating that the statute's procedures are the exclusive means for removals on national security grounds or that &#x00A7; 7532 displaces the otherwise applicable removal provisions of the agencies covered by the section). Therefore, it was held that the National Security Agency was not required to apply either &#x00A7; 7532 or &#x00A7; 833 and could have acted under its ordinary dismissal procedure if it so wished.[10] <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 99-100.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[9]&#x2003;50 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 833 was a summary removal provision in the 1964 National Security Agency Personnel Security Procedures Act, 50 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 831-35 (repealed October 1, 1996).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span> Court also affirmed <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s conclusion regarding &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513 and 7532:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">We thus agree with the conclusion of the Merit Systems Protection Board in a similar case that "section 7532 is not the exclusive basis for removals based upon security clearance revocations," <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509, 521 (1985), and with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that "[t]here is nothing in the text of section 7532 or in its legislative history to suggest that its procedures were intended to preempt section 7513 procedures whenever the removal could be taken under section 7532. The language of section 7532 is permissive." <span class="Italic">Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 802 F.2d 1563, 1568 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 488 U.S. 518 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>, 488 U.S. at 104.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span> held that Congress enacted &#x00A7; 7532 to "supplement, not narrow, ordinary agency removal procedures." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 102. The Court reasoned that because of its summary nature, "Congress intended &#x00A7; 7532 to be invoked only where there is 'an immediate threat of harm to the national security' in the sense that the delay from invoking 'normal dismissal procedures' could 'cause serious damage to the national security.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956)). Consequently, should &#x00A7; 7532 be mandatory as the Board and Respondents effectively argue, it would become the exclusive procedure in this case and similar cases, and "no national security termination would be permissible without an initial suspension and adherence to the <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span> standard." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Given <span class="Italic">Carlucci</span>'s teaching, we are unconvinced that Congress intended any such result when it enacted &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, eligibility to occupy a sensitive position is a discretionary agency determination, principally within the purview of the Executive Branch, the merits of which are unreviewable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s Analysis Is Predicated On "National Security Information"</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Respondents conflate "classified information" with "national security information," but <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not imply those terms have the same meaning.[11] In fact, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s core focus is on "national security information," not just "classified information." 484 U.S. at 527 (recognizing the government's "compelling interest in withholding <span class="Italic">national security information</span>") (emphasis added). As <span class="Italic">Egan</span> noted, the absence of a statutory provision in &#x00A7; 7512 precluding appellate review of determinations concerning national security creates a presumption in favor of review. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Court, nevertheless, held that this "proposition is not without limit, and <span class="Italic">it runs aground when it encounters concerns of national security</span>, as in this case, where the grant of security clearance to a particular employee, a sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call, is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added).[12] <span class="Italic">Egan</span> therefore is predicated on broad national security concerns, which may or may not include issues of access to classified information. Thus, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not limited to adverse actions based upon eligibility for or access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;Likewise, the dissent's key error is that it conflates "authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security" with "the authority to protect classified information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;It is clear from the use of the clause "as in this case" following the "runs aground" clause that national security concerns are the Supreme Court's general proposition, and security clearances simply exemplify the types of concerns falling within this broad category.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, sensitive positions concerning national security do not necessarily entail access to "classified information" as the Board and Respondents contend. The Board cites <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span> and references the Court's discussion of the legislative history of the Act of August 26, 1950[13] in support of its proposition that national security concerns relate strictly to access to classified information. However, the Board's analysis is flawed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;The Act of August 26, 1950, Pub. L. No. 81-733, ch. 803, 64 Stat. 476 (1950), gave heads of certain departments and agencies of the Government summary suspension and unreviewable dismissal powers over their civilian employees, when deemed necessary in the interest of the national security of the United States. <span class="Italic">Conyers</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 580 n.17. The Act was the precursor to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">Id</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cole</span> held that a sensitive position is one that <span class="Italic">implicates</span> national security, and in defining "national security" as used in the Act of August 26, 1950, the Court concluded that the term "was intended to comprehend only those activities of the Government that are <span class="Italic">directly concerned with the protection of the Nation from internal subversion or foreign aggression</span>, and not those which contribute to the strength of the Nation only through their impact on the general welfare." 351 U.S. at 544 (emphasis added).[14] Thus, even in <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, sensitive positions were defined as those that involve national security information and not necessarily those that involve classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;It follows that an employee can be dismissed 'in the interest of the national security' under the Act only if he occupies a <span class="Italic">'sensitive' position</span>, and thus that a condition precedent to the exercise of the dismissal authority is a determination by the agency head that the <span class="Italic">position occupied is one affected with the 'national security</span>.'" <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, 351 U.S. at 551 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the Court in <span class="Italic">Cole</span> remanded the case to determine whether the petitioner's position was one in which he could adversely affect national security. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 557.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, "sensitive positions" that can affect national security and "access to classified information" are parallel concepts that are <span class="Italic">not</span> necessarily the same. As the Court reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Where applicable, the Act authorizes the agency head summarily to suspend an employee pending investigation and, after charges and a hearing, finally to terminate his employment, such termination not being subject to appeal. There is an obvious justification for the summary suspension power where the employee occupies a "sensitive" position in which he could cause serious damage to the national security during the delay incident to an investigation and the preparation of charges. <span class="Italic">Likewise</span>, there is a reasonable basis for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for <span id="Page_2572"></span>the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cole</span>, 351 U.S. at 546 (emphasis added)[15] . Hence, contrary to the Board and Respondents' contentions, "classified information" is not necessarily "national security information" available to an employee in a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;By using the word, "likewise," the Court compares the two concepts, "sensitive positions" and "access to classified information." In doing so, it makes clear that they are parallel concepts that are not the same.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and Respondents' focus on one factor, eligibility of access to classified information, is misplaced.[16] Government positions may require different types and levels of clearance, depending upon the sensitivity of the position sought. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528. A government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies in scope according to the degree of adverse effect the applicant could have on national security. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.)). As OPM states: "An agency's national security calculus will vary widely depending upon, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the agency's mission, the particular project in question, and the degree of harm that would be caused if the project is compromised." As a result, an agency's determination in controlling access to national security information entails consideration of multiple factors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;The centerpiece of the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> analysis, Executive Order No. 10,450, makes no mention of "classified information." Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953) ("The head of any department or agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within his department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, <span class="Italic">a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position</span>.") (emphasis added). In addition, other relevant statutes and regulations define "sensitive" position in the broadest sense by referring to "national security" generally. <span class="Italic">See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564 ("Security clearance investigations...(e) <span class="Italic">Sensitive duties</span>.--For the purposes of this section, <span class="Italic">it is not necessary for the performance of duties to involve classified activities or classified matters</span> in order for the duties to be considered sensitive and critical to the national security.") (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102 ("(a) For purposes of this part, the term <span class="Italic">national security position</span> includes: (1) Those positions that involve activities of the Government that are <span class="Italic">concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage</span>....") (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For example, categorizing a sensitive position is undertaken without regard to access to classified information, but rather with regard to the effect the position may have on national security. <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec Order No. 10,450 &#x00A7; 3. Similarly, predictive judgments[17] are predicated on an individual's potential to compromise information, which might be unclassified. Consequently, the inquiry in these agency determinations concerning national security is not contingent upon access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;A predictive judgment of an individual is "an attempt to predict his [or her] possible future behavior and to assess whether, under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons, he [or she] might compromise sensitive information. It may be based, to be sure, upon past or present conduct, but it also may be based upon concerns completely unrelated to conduct such as having close relatives residing in a country hostile to the United States." <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 528-29.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s concerns regarding the agencies' "clearly consistent with the interests of national security" standard conflicting with the Board's preponderance of the evidence standard apply equally here. <span class="Italic">Egan</span> held that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As noted above, security clearance normally will be granted only if it is "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security." The Board, however, reviews adverse actions under a preponderance of the evidence standard. &#x00A7; 7701(c)(1)(B). These two standards seem inconsistent. It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing from the "clearly consistent with the interests of the national security" test. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift this emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">484 U.S. at 531. An agency's determination of an employee's ineligibility to hold a sensitive position must be "consistent with the interests of national security." <span class="Italic">See</span> Exec. Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 3. Thus, such agency determinations cannot be reviewable by the Board because this would improperly place an inconsistent burden of proof upon the government. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> prohibits review of Executive Branch agencies' national security determinations concerning eligibility of an individual to occupy a sensitive position, which may not necessarily involve access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;Unclassified Information Can Have a Material Adverse Effect on National Security</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">National security concerns render the Board and Respondents' positions untenable. It is naive to suppose that employees without direct access to already classified information cannot affect national security. The Board and Respondents' narrow focus on access to classified information ignores the impact employees without security clearances, but in sensitive positions, can have.[18]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[18]&#x2003;There are certainly numerous government positions with potential to adversely affect national security. The Board goes too far by comparing a government position at a military base commissary to one in a "Seven Eleven across the street." Oral Argument at 28:10-15, <span class="Italic">Berry v. Conyers, et al.,</span> 2011-3207, available at <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html</a>. Commissary employees do not merely observe "[g]rocery store stock levels" or otherwise publicly observable information. In fact, commissary stock levels of a particular unclassified item--sunglasses, for example, with shatterproof lenses, or rehydration products--might well hint at deployment orders to a particular region for an identifiable unit. Such troop movements are inherently secret. <span class="Italic">Cf. Near v. State of Minnesota ex rel. Olson,</span> 283 U.S. 697, 716 (1931) ("When a nation is at war many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.... No one would question but that a government might prevent actual obstruction to its recruiting service or the <span class="Italic">publication of the sailing dates of transports or the number and location of troops</span>.")(citing <span class="Italic">Schenck v. United States,</span> 294 U.S. 47, 52 (1919)) (emphasis added). This is not mere speculation, because, as OPM contends, numbers and locations could very well be derived by a skilled intelligence analyst from military commissary stock levels. <span class="Italic">See</span> Oral Argument at 13:19-14:03, <span class="Italic">Berry v. Conyers, et al.,</span> 2011-3207, available at <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html">http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/oral-argument-recordings/search/audio.html</a> (Q: "Can a position be sensitive simply because it provides observability? That is, one of these examples that was given was someone working at a commissary; it seems to me that someone working at a commissary has an opportunity without access to classified information to observe troop levels, potential for where someone is going, from what they are buying, that sort of thing." A: "I think that is right your honor. We agree with that, and I think in<span class="Italic"> Egan,</span> he, Mr. Egan worked on a nuclear submarine. And so, part of it was simply from what he was observing by coming and going of a nuclear submarine. And so, sensitivity can be the place where the employee works, what are they able to observe, what could they infer from, what you say, from the purchases and shipments....").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Defining the impact an individual may have on national security is the type of predictive judgment that must be made by those with necessary expertise. <span class="Italic">See Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 529 ("The attempt to define not only the individual's future actions, but those of outside and unknown influences renders the 'grant or denial of security clearances...an inexact science at best.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Adams v. Laird,</span> 420 F.2d 230, 239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). The sources upon which intelligence is, based are often open and publically available. Occasionally, intelligence is obtained from sources in a fashion the source's government would find improper. Occasionally, those means of obtention are coercive and/or subversive.[19]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[19]&#x2003;For example, the intelligence community may view certain disparaging information concerning an employee as a vulnerability which can be used to blackmail or coerce information out of the individual. <span class="Italic">See Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 528 (recognizing that the government has a compelling interest in protecting truly sensitive information from those who, "under compulsion of circumstances or for other reasons...might compromise sensitive information."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> Exec.

Such information [relating, but not limited to]...(ii) Any deliberate misrepresentations, falsifications, or omissions of <span class="Italic">material facts</span>...(iii) Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, sexual perversion, <span class="Italic">or financial irresponsibility.")</span> (emphasis added). Hence, as the Agency found, information regarding Ms. Conyers's debt is a reasonable concern.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This area of National Security Law is largely about preventing human source intelligence gathering in a manner which does not, in an open <span id="Page_2573"></span>society, unnecessarily limit the public's right to access information about its government's activities. Still, there clearly is a need for such prevention. Within the sphere of national security limitations on government employment, our society has determined that courts should tolerate and defer to the agencies' threat limiting expertise. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While threats may change with time, <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s analysis remains valid. The advent of electronic records management, computer analysis, and cyber-warfare have made potential espionage targets containing means to access national security information vastly more susceptible to harm by people without security clearances. The mechanics of planting within a computer system a means of intelligence gathering are beyond the ken of the judiciary; what matters is that there are today more sensitive areas of access than there were when <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was authored. Its underlying analysis, nevertheless, is completely applicable--the President, as Commander-in-Chief, has the right and the obligation, within the law, to protect the government against potential threats. <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 527.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Some rights of government employees are certainly abrogated in national security cases. The Board and Respondents must recognize that those instances are the result of balancing competing interests as was the case in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and as is the case here. <span class="Italic">See Hamdi v. Rumsfeld,</span> 542 U.S. 507, 529 (2004) ("[T]he process due in any given instance is determined by weighing the 'private interest that will be affected by the official action' against the Government's asserted interest, 'including the function involved' and the burdens the Government would face in providing greater process.") (quoting<span class="Italic"> Mathews v. Eldridge,</span> 424 U.S. 319, 335 (1976)). [20] Hence, as Lord Cyril Radcliffe noted, security must be weighed against other important questions "in that free dialogue between government...and people" out of which public life is built.[21]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;Working for the government is not only an example of civic duty but also an honorable and privileged undertaking that citizens cannot take lightly. This is especially true when the government position implicates national security. In other words, being employed by a government agency that deals in matters of national security is not a fundamental right. Accordingly, the competing interests in this case undoubtedly weigh on the side of national security.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In our society, it has been accepted that genuine and legitimate doubt is to be resolved in favor of national security.[22] <span class="Italic">See Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 527; <span class="Italic">see also United States v.

That was the philosophical underpinning of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and it is the holding of this court today. Accordingly, the merits of these agency determinations before us are not reviewable by the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;Although adverse actions of this type are largely unreviewable, courts may examine allegations of constitutional violations or allegations that an agency violated its own procedural regulations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 530.

<p class="Block-Quote1">V.&#x2003;Conclusion</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the foregoing reasons, the Board cannot review the merits of Executive Branch agencies' national security determinations concerning eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security. As OPM notes, "there is nothing talismanic about eligibility for access to classified information." The core question is whether an agency determination concerns eligibility of an employee to occupy a sensitive position that implicates national security. When the answer to that question is in the affirmative, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> applies and the Board plays a limited role in its review of the determination. We REVERSE and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before its reversal in the Federal Circuit, the Board's underlying decision in <span class="Italic">Conyers v. DOD</span>, 115 MSPR 572, 573-599, 2010 MSPB 247 (2010) (Member Rose dissenting), was:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This appeal is before the Board on interlocutory appeal from the administrative judge's February 17, 2010 order. The administrative judge stayed the proceedings and certified for Board review her ruling that she would not apply the limited scope of Board review set forth in <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan,</span> 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988), in adjudicating the appellant's indefinite suspension. For the reasons discussed below, we AFFIRM the administrative judge's ruling AS MODIFIED by this Opinion and Order, VACATE the stay order, and RETURN the appeal to the administrative judge for further adjudication consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Background</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective September 11, 2009, the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant from the competitive service position of GS-525-05 Accounting Technician at the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). The agency took the action because the appellant had been "denied eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by [the agency's] Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF), and we are awaiting a decision on your appeal of the CAF's denial from the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge."[3] The agency stated that the appellant's position required her to have access to sensitive information, the WHS/CAF had denied her such access, and therefore she did not meet a qualification requirement of her position. In its notice of proposed indefinite suspension, the agency stated that the reason for the proposal was the WHS/CAF's decision to deny the appellant "eligibility for access to sensitive or classified information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The record indicates that the DOHA administrative judge issued a recommendation in the appellant's favor, but that on September 15, 2009, the Clearance Appeal Board did not accept the recommendation and denied her appeal. The agency subsequently removed the appellant effective February 19, 2010. The Board denied the appellant's motion to incorporate her removal into this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed an appeal of her indefinite suspension. In responding to the appeal, the agency stated that the appellant's position had been designated non-critical sensitive (NCS) under the Department of Defense Personnel Security Program Regulation, that her position required her to access "sensitive or classified information," and that, under <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Board cannot review the merits of the WHS/CAF's decision to deny her eligibility for access "to sensitive or classified information and/or occupancy of a sensitive position."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In creating the Merit Systems Protection Board, Congress expressly mandated that the Board adjudicate all matters within its jurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1204. Congress further provided that an employee, as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, against whom certain adverse actions are taken, has the right to invoke the Board's jurisdiction under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d). Such appealable adverse actions include suspensions for more than 14 days. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(2). Congress also clearly delineated the scope of our review in non-performance adverse action appeals by requiring that the Board determine whether the agency's decision is supported by preponderant evidence and promotes the efficiency of the service, and whether the agency-imposed penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a); 7701(b)(3) and (c)(1); <span class="Italic">Gregory v. Department of Education,</span> 16 M.S.P.R. 144, 146 (1983). More specifically, in appeals such as this, when the charge involves an agency's withdrawal of its certification or approval of an employee's fitness or other qualification for the position, the Board has consistently recognized that its adjudicatory authority extends to a review of the merits of that withdrawal. <span class="Italic">See Adams,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The instant appeal falls squarely within our statutory jurisdiction. Specifically, at the time of the action giving rise to this matter, the appellant had been a permanent employee in the competitive service with a service computation date of September 3, 1985. She therefore comes within the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii), which the agency does not dispute. On September 11, 2009, DFAS indefinitely suspended her from her position of GS-525-05 Accounting Technician. That suspension extended beyond 14 days, and therefore, <span id="Page_2574"></span>constitutes an appealable action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7512(2); 7513(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency contends, however, that because this appeal involves the denial of eligibility to occupy an NCS position, it is subject only to the limited review prescribed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Egan.</span> In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Court limited the scope of Board review in an appeal of an adverse action based on the revocation or denial of a "security clearance." There, the Court held that the Board lacks the authority to review the substance of the security clearance determination or to require the agency to support the revocation or denial of the security clearance by preponderant evidence, as it would be required to do in other adverse action appeals. Rather, the Court found that the Board has authority to review only whether the employee's position required a security clearance, whether the clearance was denied or revoked, whether the employee was provided with the procedural protections specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, and whether transfer to a nonsensitive position was feasible. 484 U.S. at 530-31; <span class="Italic">see also Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 217 F.3d 1372, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the course of this interlocutory appeal, the parties stipulated as follows concerning security clearances and access to classified information:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The parties agree that the positions held by appellants Conyers and Northover did not require the incumbents to have a confidential, secret or top secret clearance. The parties also agree that the positions held by appellants Conyers and Northover did not require the incumbents to have access to classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the appellant is not required to have a security clearance and she is not required to have access to classified information. Therefore, we conclude that<span class="Italic"> Egan</span> does not limit the Board's statutory authority to review the appellant's indefinite suspension appeal. We further conclude that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> limits the Board's review of an otherwise appealable adverse action only if that action is based upon a denial, revocation or suspension of a "security clearance," i.e., involves a denial of access to classified information or eligibility for such access, as we more fully explain below.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore direct the administrative judge, on return of this appeal, to conduct a hearing consistent with the Board's statutory duty to determine whether the appellant's indefinite suspension is supported by a preponderance of the evidence, promotes the efficiency of the service and constitutes a reasonable penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(a); 7701(b)(3) and (c)(1). As contemplated by the Board's statutory mandate and our precedent, this adjudicatory authority extends to a review of the merits of the agency's denial of the appellant's eligibility to occupy a NCS position. <span class="Italic">See Adams,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Court characterized its decision as addressing the <span class="Italic">"narrow question</span> presented by this case [namely] whether the [Board] has authority by statute to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action." 484 U.S. at 520 (emphasis added). In holding that it did not, the Court relied primarily on the premise that the President, as Commander in Chief under the Constitution, had authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and that such authority exists apart from any explicit Congressional grant. It concluded therefore that "the grant of security clearance to a particular employee...is committed by law to the appropriate agency of the Executive Branch." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 527. The Court thus found that 'an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting<span class="Italic"> Cole v. Young,</span> 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We believe that the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> Court's limitation of the Board's statutory review authority must be viewed narrowly, most obviously because the Court itself so characterized its holding in that case. Moreover, the Court's rationale rested first and foremost on the President's constitutional authority to "classify and control access to information bearing on national security" and does not, on its face, support the agency's effort here to expand the restriction on the Board's statutory review to any matter in which the government asserts a national security interest. <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 527-528. In fact, although Mr. Egan held a position that was designated as NCS<span class="Italic">, Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 521, the Court's limitation of Board review was based on the requirement that he hold a security clearance and on the government's need to protect the classified information to which he had access.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 527-30. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> indicates that the Court considered the NCS designation alone as sufficient to preclude Board review of the merits of the determination underlying Mr. Egan's removal.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Department of the Navy's designation of a position as "noncritical-sensitive" was defined by the applicable Chief of Naval Operations Instruction to include "[a]ccess to Secret or Confidential information." 484 U.S. at 521 n.1. By contrast, here, the agency's designation of the appellant's position as NCS pursuant to OPM regulations includes no such requirement for access to, or eligibility for access to, any classified information. Indeed, the parties stipulated that the appellant is not required to have a security clearance and she has no need for access to any classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is there any basis upon which to assume that the Court in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> used the term "security clearance" to mean anything other than eligibility for access to, or access to, classified information. In that regard, we note that the words "security clearance" historically have been used as a term of art referring to access to classified information, and they are not synonymous with eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jones v. Department of the Navy</span>, 978 F.2d 1223, 1225 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (quoting <span class="Italic">Hill v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 844 F.2d 1407, 1411 (10th Cir. 1988) and describing a "security clearance [as] merely temporary permission by the Executive for access to national secrets"). In addition, the agency in this appeal has conceded that "determinations whether to grant an individual a security clearance and whether an individual is eligible to occupy a national security sensitive position are separate inquiries."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order No. 12,968 (Aug. 2, 1995) ("Access to Classified Information"), although failing to provide an explicit definition of "security clearance," pertinently provides that "[n]o employee shall be granted access to classified information unless that employee has been determined to be eligible in accordance with this order and to possess a need-to-know." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, Section 1.2 (a). Executive Order No. 12,968 further provides that employees shall not be granted access to classified information unless they have: (1) Been determined "eligible" for access by "agency heads or designated officials" under Section 3.1 "based on a favorable adjudication of an appropriate investigation of the employee's background"; (2) a demonstrated need-to-know; and (3) signed a nondisclosure agreement. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, Section 1.2(c)(1)-(3). The Department of Defense Personnel Security Program Regulation, consistent with the above, defines "security clearance" as "[a] determination that a person is eligible under the standards of [32 C.F.R. Part 154] for access to classified information." 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.3(t). We thus conclude that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> limits the Board's statutory review of an appealable adverse action only when such review would require the Board to review the substance of the "sensitive and inherently discretionary judgment call...committed by law to the...Executive Branch" when an agency has made a determination regarding an employee's access to classified information, i.e., a decision to deny, revoke or suspend access, or eligibility for access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 527. Our use of the term "security clearance" in this Opinion and Order includes this specific understanding.[13]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[13]&#x2003;Member Rose suggests in dissent that when the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> Court used the term "security clearance," it did not use it as a term of art limited to the grant of access to, or eligibility for access to, classified information. Rather, she suggests that <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, "when read as a whole," shows that the Court was more generally concerned with any "discretionary national security judgments committed to agency heads, regardless of whether the employee...needed access to classified information as part of his job." As we thoroughly explain in our opinion today, such an expansive reading of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> ignores the facts and much of the analysis in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, numerous decisions of the Federal Circuit and Board interpreting <span class="Italic">Egan</span> over the last 20 years, as well as the definition of security clearance found in the Department of Defense's own regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, prior to the Board's now vacated decision in <span class="Italic">Crumpler v. Department of Defense</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 636 (2009)<span class="Italic">, vacated</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 94 (2009), the Board had long considered <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s restriction on its statutory review as confined to adverse actions based on security clearance revocation and refused to extend the restriction to non-security clearance appeals where the actions arguably implicated national security. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jacobs v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 688 (1994); <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50. In <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, the Board held that it had the authority to review a security guard's disqualification from the Chemical Personnel Reliability Program based on his alleged verbal assault of a security officer. 62 M.S.P.R. at 689-90, 694. The Board stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The role of protecting that national chemical weapons program is, without doubt, a very important role. The importance of that role, however, should not divest civilian employees who work in that program of the basic employment protections guaranteed them under law. Neither should the 'military' nature of such employment, nor should the program's requirements for the ability to react to changing situations with dependability, emotional stability, proper social adjustment, sound judgment, and a positive attitude toward program objectives and duly constituted authority.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 694. The Board explicitly found as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was narrow in scope and specifically applied only to security clearance revocations. As the protector of the government's merit systems, the Board is not eager to expand the scope of the rationale in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to divest federal employees whose positions do not require a security clearance of basic protections against non-meritorious agency actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 695.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2575"></span>In <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span>, the Board further addressed the agency's concern, expressed also in this appeal, that as an outside non-expert body, the Board should not second-guess its attempts to predict the appellant's future behavior. The Board found that most of the removal actions taken by agencies are based at least in part on an attempt to predict an employee's future behavior. It noted that, in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), the Board set forth a range of factors that an agency should consider in making a penalty determination, which included an estimate of the employee's rehabilitation potential. The Board found that the basis of progressive discipline is that an employee who has engaged in repeated misconduct will be likely to do so again in the future. <span class="Italic">Jacob</span>s, 62 M.S.P.R. at 695. Thus, when an agency acts based on such predictive judgments in imposing a penalty, the Board is required by its statutory mandate to evaluate the propriety of those agency judgments.[14] <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> and <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> are not isolated cases, as the Board's case law is replete with decisions in which the Board has reviewed an agency's predictions regarding an employee's future conduct and potential for rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Jacob</span>s, 62 M.S.P.R. at 695.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[14]&#x2003;The record before us lacks evidence of any "delicate national security judgments that are beyond [the Board's] expertise" as suggested by the dissent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, the Board found that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> did not preclude its review of the propriety of the agency's denial of access to sensitive personnel information in an appeal of a human resources assistant's removal for "failure to maintain access to the Command computer system." 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 9-12. The Board acknowledged the agency's argument, similar to that made in this appeal, that the suspension of computer access was not an appealable adverse action, that the federal government had not waived its sovereign immunity from challenges to such actions, and that the Board's authority to review those actions was barred under <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. <span class="Italic">See Adams</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50<span class="Italic">,</span> &#x00B6; 9. But the Board found no merit to those arguments. It noted that the agency did not deny that, in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513, Congress has authorized the Board to adjudicate removals. As previously noted, the Board found that adjudication of such an appeal requires the Board to determine whether the agency has proven the charge or charges on which the removal is based; and, when the charge consists of the employing agency's withdrawal or revocation of its certification or other approval of the employee's fitness or other qualifications to hold his position, the Board's authority generally extends to a review of the merits of that withdrawal or revocation. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, the Board acknowledged "narrow exceptions" to the Board's authority to review the merits of agency determinations underlying adverse actions, and found that one such exception was addressed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. It distinguished <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, however, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The present appeal does not involve the national security considerations presented in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. While the agency's computer system provides employees with access to sensitive information, the agency has acknowledged that the information is not classified and has indicated that it does not consider access to that information to be equivalent to possession of a security clearance.&#8197;...The decision to suspend the appellant's computer access is similar instead to determinations the Board has found it has the authority to review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 12.[15]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[15]&#x2003;In addition to <span class="Italic">Jacobs</span> and <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, the Board has held that, despite <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, it has the authority to review the decision of an agency credentials committee to revoke an employee's clinical privileges, when that revocation was the basis for the employee's removal, <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 684, 687-91 (1988); and to review the validity of a medical determination underlying the removal of an air traffic control specialist, <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 16, 18-19 (1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to our longstanding precedent, however, we are guided by the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536 (1956),[16] cited with approval in <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 529, which provides persuasive and considerable support for viewing <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as narrowly limited to appeals involving security clearances. There, the Court addressed whether the removal of a preference-eligible veteran employee of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare was authorized under the Act of August 26, 1950 (the Act).[17] In ruling that Executive Order No. 10,450[18] did not trump the employee's statutory veterans' preference rights, the <span class="Italic">Cole</span> Court interpreted "national security" as used in the Act[19] <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, 351 U.S. at 538. Significantly, in so doing, the <span class="Italic">Cole</span> Court did not avoid review of the removal or identify any rule of limited review merely because the Executive Branch of the government alleged that matters of "national security" were at issue.[20] Moreover, although the Court determined that an employee may be dismissed using the summary procedures and unreviewable dismissal power authorized by the 1950 statute only if he occupied a "sensitive" position, the Court plainly equated having a "sensitive" position with having access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 551, 557 n.19. The <span class="Italic">Cole</span> decision thus clearly supports the Board's determination that its statutory jurisdiction over an otherwise appealable action cannot be preempted by an agency's generalized claim of "national security."[21]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[16]&#x2003;Member Rose sees little value in the Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Cole</span> decision, in part because it was decided in 1956, "22 years before the Civil Service Reform Act." As we note in our decision, though, <span class="Italic">Cole</span> specifically addressed the "Act of August 26, 1950," the predecessor to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. Further, Executive Order No. 10,450, significantly relied on by the dissent, was promulgated in 1953 to implement the 1950 Act. In addition, the relevant regulations issued by OPM, and relied on by Member Rose to find that the Board lacks authority to review the adverse action at issue, are based on Executive Order No. 10,450, and OPM has advised the Board that the regulations do not create or diminish any employee appeal rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[17]&#x2003;The Act was the precursor to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532 and gave to the heads of certain government departments and agencies summary suspension and unreviewable dismissal powers over civilian employees when deemed necessary "in the interest of the national security of the United States." This express provision within the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) for accommodating national security concerns further undermines the agency's claim that the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief preempts our statutory review. The argument is tenuous, at best, insofar as it rests upon the misguided premise that the President alone possesses power in the area of national security. Instead, the Constitution gives Congress the power "to declare war" (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 11), "to raise and support Armies" (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 12), "to provide and maintain a Navy" (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 13) and "to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" (Art. 1, sec. 8, cl. 14), and, thus, plainly establishes that Congress also has authority with regard to ensuring national security. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. v. North</span>, 708 F. Supp. 380, 382 (D.D.C. 1988) (rejecting plaintiff's constitutional argument that "the asserted primacy of the White House in foreign affairs" precludes prosecution for false Congressional testimony, the court looked to various constitutional provisions in recognizing that "Congress surely has a role to play in aspects of foreign affairs....")</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The CSRA is the comprehensive scheme created by Congress governing federal employment. <span class="Italic">See U.S. v. Fausto</span>, 484 U.S. 439, 443 (1988). In 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532, Congress expressly delineated those areas where Board review is circumscribed due to national security concerns. There is no evidence that Congress intended that the President could unilaterally and broadly expand these exceptions so as to effectively eliminate Board and judicial review of the reasons underlying adverse actions taken against federal employees, such as the appellant, whose positions do not require access, or eligibility for access, to classified information. Absent any indication that Congress contemplated and ordained such a result, we believe that <span class="Italic">Egan's</span> exception to the Board's statutory jurisdiction must be read narrowly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[18]&#x2003;Executive Order No. 10,450 was promulgated in April 1953 to provide uniform standards and procedures for agency heads in exercising the suspension and dismissal powers under the 1950 Act. <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, 351 U.S. at 551. It also extended the Act to other agencies. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 542.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[19]&#x2003;The Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Cole</span> decision and its decision in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), plainly contradict the dissent's bold claim that an agency's decision "that retaining an employee would be inconsistent with the interests of national security has never been subject to third-party review before today." In both cases, the Court subjected agency claims regarding national security to judicial scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See also</span> note 21 <span class="Italic">supra.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[20]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">Cole</span> Court notably stated that it would not lightly assume that Congress intended to take away the normal dismissal procedures of employees "in the absence of some overriding necessity, such as exists in the case of employees handling defense secrets." 351 U.S. at 546-47.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[21]&#x2003;Even in cases where the Executive Branch has sought to defend its action on the grounds of protecting classified information, the Court has not abstained from subjecting such assertions to searching judicial scrutiny. <span class="Italic">See Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656. There, employees challenged the Customs Service decision to subject whole categories of employees to random drug-testing on the basis of their presumed access to classified information. Deeming the record insufficient to determine whether the agency overreached, the Court remanded to the Fifth Circuit with instructions to "examine the criteria used by the [Customs] Service in determining what materials are classified and in deciding whom to test under this rubric." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 678.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this regard, we agree with the appellant that the potential impact of the agency's argument that <span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes the Board from reviewing the <span id="Page_2576"></span>merits of an agency's adverse action, even when security clearances are not involved, is far-reaching. Accepting the agency's view could, without any Congressional mandate or imprimatur, preclude Board and judicial review of alleged unlawful discrimination, whistleblower retaliation, and a whole host of other constitutional and statutory violations for multitudes of federal employees subjected to otherwise appealable removals and other adverse actions. <span class="Italic">See El-Ganayni v. Department of Energy</span>, 591 F.3d 176, 184-186 (3d Cir. 2010) (First Amendment claim and Fifth Amendment Equal Protection claim must be dismissed because legal framework would require consideration of the reasons a security clearance was revoked); <span class="Italic">Bennett v. Chertoff</span>, 425 F.3d 999, 1003-04 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (adverse action based on denial or revocation of a security clearance not actionable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); <span class="Italic">Hesse</span>, 217 F.3d at 1377 (<span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes Board review of Whistleblower Protection Act whistleblower claims in indefinite suspension appeal); <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Reno</span>, 168 F.3d 520, 524 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (adverse action based on denial of a security clearance not actionable under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); <span class="Italic">Jones</span>, 978 F.2d at 1225-26 (no employee has a "property" or "liberty" interest in a security clearance or access to classified information and thus no basis for a constitutional right); <span class="Italic">Pangarova v. Department of the Army</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 319, 322-24 (1989) (<span class="Italic">Egan</span> precludes the Board from reviewing discrimination or reprisal allegations intertwined with the agency's denial of a security clearance).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, we find that the Supreme Court's decision in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not support the conclusion that the Board lacks the authority to review the determination underlying the agency's indefinite suspension here.[22] The Board may exercise its full statutory review authority and review the agency's determination that the appellant is no longer eligible to hold a "sensitive" position, because this appeal does not involve a discretionary agency decision regarding a security clearance.[23]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[22]&#x2003;We are not finding that the Board has the authority to determine whether the agency has properly designated the appellant's position as NCS. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Department of the Navy</span>, 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (Board lacks the authority to review an agency's determination that a position requires a security clearance); <span class="Italic">Brady v. Department of the Navy</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 133, 138 (1991) (Board lacks the authority to review an agency's determination to designate a position as NCS). We are simply finding that the agency's decision to designate a position as a "national security" position or as a "sensitive" one, standing alone, does not limit the Board's statutory review authority over an appealable adverse action. We note that the agency has not contested the appellant's assertion that DFAS has designated 100% of its positions as sensitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[23]&#x2003;We recognize that Congress has specifically excluded groups of employees from having Board appeal rights or from having protection against prohibited personnel practices, such as employees of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and intelligence components of the Department of Defense. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 2303(a)(2)(C), 7511(b)(7), (8). Congress has not similarly excluded the agency in the current appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The agency's decision to characterize the appellant's position as a national security position and to designate it NCS is insufficient to limit the Board's scope of review to that set forth in Egan.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In 5 C.F.R. Part 732, OPM set forth "certain requirements and procedures which each agency shall observe for determining national security positions pursuant to Executive Order No. 10450--Security Requirements for Government Employment (April 27, 1953), 18 FR 2489, 3 CFR 1949-1953 Comp., p. 936, as amended." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.101. OPM's regulations state that the term "national security position" includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;Those positions that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, including development of defense plans or policies, intelligence or counterintelligence activities, and related activities concerned with the preservation of the military strength of the United States; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Positions that require regular use of, or access to, classified information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a). The regulations further provide:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For purposes of this part, the head of each agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within the department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position at one of three sensitivity levels: Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). The agency argues that, although the appellant's position did not require a security clearance, the Board is nevertheless precluded under <span class="Italic">Egan</span> from reviewing whether she was improperly suspended based upon the agency's determination that she was ineligible to occupy a national security position. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's interpretation of its own regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 732 supports the conclusion that our review of an adverse action is not limited by <span class="Italic">Egan</span> solely based on the agency's designation of the position as a national security position or as "sensitive." In that regard, OPM has not interpreted its regulations to preclude the usual scope of Board review for adverse actions taken against employees based on ineligibility to occupy NCS positions. Rather, OPM concluded that the Board cannot determine the scope of its review by referring to 5 C.F.R. Part 732. OPM stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">OPM's regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 732 are silent on the scope of an employee's rights to Board review when an agency deems the employee ineligible to occupy a sensitive position. The regulations do not independently confer any appeal right or affect any appeal right under law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2. It similarly stated concerning its regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[T]hey do not address the scope of the Board's review when an agency takes an adverse action against an employee under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a) following an unfavorable security determination. Likewise, OPM's adverse action regulations in 5 C.F.R. Part 752 do not address any specific appellate procedure to be followed when an adverse action follows an agency's determination that an employee is ineligible to occupy a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 3. Thus, OPM has not interpreted its own regulations as precluding the Board's usual scope of review in these appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its October 18, 2010 statement, ODNI refers to Executive Order No. 13,467 (June 30, 2008), in arguing that the limited scope of Board review set forth in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> should apply in this appeal. ODNI notes that Executive Order No. 13,467, which is entitled "Reforming Processes Related to Suitability for Government Employment, Fitness for Contractor Employees, and Eligibility for Access to Classified National Security Information," designated the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) as the Security Executive Agent (SEA) for the federal government. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1. It further notes that, in setting forth the SEA's responsibilities relating to overseeing investigations, developing policies and procedures, issuing guidelines and instructions, serving as a final authority, and ensuring reciprocal recognition among agencies, the Executive Order consistently referred to that authority as relating to both determinations of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1-2. It thus argues that the President has given the DNI "oversight authority over eligibility determinations, whether they entail access to classified information or eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, regardless of sensitivity level." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ODNI appears to be arguing, as does the agency, that because executive orders refer to both eligibility for access to classified information and eligibility to occupy a sensitive position--or because the agency decided to adjudicate determinations involving access to classified information and eligibility to occupy a sensitive position through the same WHS/CAF process--the same Board review authority must necessarily apply. Neither ODNI nor the agency has shown that such a circular argument provides a basis for limiting the statutory scope of our review in adverse action appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the first time at oral argument and in its closing brief, the agency apparently argues that, following <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, Congress has imposed another limitation on the Board's review authority by enacting 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564(e). Section (e) provides as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sensitive Duties.--For the purpose of this section, it is not necessary for the performance of duties to involve classified activities or classified matters in order for the duties to be considered sensitive and critical to national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has failed to show that 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564 imposes an additional Congressional limitation on the Board's review authority. Section 1564 is entitled "Security clearance investigations." Subsection (a) sets outs the reason for the section as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Expedited Process.--The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe a process for expediting the completion of the background investigations necessary for granting security clearances for Department of Defense personnel and Department of Defense contractor personnel who are engaged in sensitive duties that are critical to the national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the statutory section as a whole reveals that it is concerned with the process for granting security clearances, which are not at issue in this appeal.[24] In any event, the statute does not limit the Board's authority to adjudicate adverse action appeals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[24]&#x2003;In that regard, we note that the statute does not explicitly define "security clearances" as anything other than eligibility for access to, or access to, classified information. We reject the agency's attempt to equate "security clearances" with its decisions to designate positions as "sensitive" or to find that employees are no longer eligible for such sensitive positions. Absent a requirement that an employee have access to classified information, or be <span id="Page_2577"></span>eligible for such access, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> does not limit the Board's review of an appealable adverse action taken against a covered employee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the Board has the authority to review the merits of the agency's decision to find the appellant ineligible to occupy an NCS position, and that the Board's authority to exercise its statutory review of the appellant's indefinite suspension is not limited by <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. Applying the full scope of Board review in appeals such as this will not prevent agencies from taking conduct-based adverse actions or suitability actions in appropriate cases. Likewise, agencies may respond to urgent national security issues, even for employees who do not have eligibility for access to, or access to, classified information, by exercising their statutory authority to impose indefinite suspensions and removals through the national security provisions in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., King v. Alston</span>, 75 F.3d 657, 659 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Here, however, the agency did not choose to act under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532, an option the dissent fails to mention. If the agency believed that a Board appeal would involve delicate national security matters beyond the Board's expertise, or that a Board order might create a conflict with its national security obligations pursuant to Executive Order No. 10,450, it could have exercised its authority pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7532. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency argues that a Board decision to reverse its action would place it in an impossible position because it must either violate an agency head's decision and allow an employee "who presents a national security risk" to occupy a sensitive position or violate the Board's order. We note, however, that the agency's own actions belie its concern. Although on June 27, 2007, the WHS/CAF issued the appellant its tentative decision to deny her eligibility to occupy her NCS position, the agency did not issue its decision to actually suspend her from the position until September 3, 2009. Thus, the agency kept the appellant in her NCS position for over two years after making a tentative determination to deny her eligibility. Although the appellant was admittedly proceeding through the agency's internal review process during part of this time, the record does not indicate that the agency took any action between the appellant's September 22, 2007 response to its tentative determination to deny her eligibility and its February 18, 2009 decision to deny her eligibility, i.e., for over one year. Therefore, the agency's own actions do not support its fear of being put in an impossible position by the possibility that the Board might disagree with its decision and order reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The interlocutory appeal must be returned for further proceedings.</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s limited scope of Board review does not apply in this appeal, Board review of the challenged indefinite suspension includes consideration of the underlying merits of the agency's reasons to deny the appellant eligibility to occupy an NCS position. The administrative judge should thus adjudicate this appeal under the generally applicable standards the Board applies in adverse action appeals, including the legal principles governing off-duty or on-duty conduct as applicable.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISSENTING OPINION OF MARY M. ROSE</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained below, I would hold that the Board cannot review the reasons underlying the agency's determination that the appellant is no longer eligible to occupy a sensitive position. When Congress created the Merit Systems Protection Board, it did not mean to limit (assuming it could have) the longstanding discretion vested in the President and agency heads over national security matters. The substance of an agency's decision that retaining an employee would be inconsistent with the interests of national security has never been subject to third-party review before today, and I would hold that it is not subject to such review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">BACKGROUND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was a GS-525-05 Accounting Technician with the Defense Finance &#x0026; Accounting Service. By authority of Executive Order No. 10,450 and 5 C.F.R. Part 732, the agency designated the appellant's position as "non-critical sensitive," based on its judgment that the incumbent "could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security." <span class="Italic">[S]</span> ee 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). Effective September 11, 2009, the agency suspended the appellant indefinitely because the agency's Washington Headquarters Services (WHS) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) had denied her continued "eligibility to occupy a sensitive position." Specifically, the agency stated that the appellant's position required her to have access to sensitive information, that the WHS/CAF had denied her such access, and that as a result she did not meet a qualification requirement of her position. The suspension was imposed pending her appeal to the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">DISCUSSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Executive Order No. 10,450, 18 Fed. Reg. 2489 (1953), provides in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States..., and as President of the United States, and deeming such action necessary in the best interests of the national security, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">Sec.2.

<p class="Block-Quote2">Sec.3. (a) The appointment of each civilian officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be made subject to investigation.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on Executive Order No. 10,450, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3301, and other authorities, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has issued regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 732 governing "National Security Positions." The regulations provide, at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.101, as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">This part sets forth certain requirements and procedures which each agency shall observe for determining national security positions pursuant to Executive Order 10450....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The regulations further provide, at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For purposes of this part, the term "national security position" includes:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(1)&#x2003;Those positions that involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, including development of defense plans or policies, intelligence or counterintelligence activities, and related activities concerned with the preservation of the military strength of the United States; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(2)&#x2003;Positions that require regular use of, or access to, classified information. Procedures and guidance provided in OPM issuances apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the regulations provide at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)&#x2003;For purposes of this part, the head of each agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within the department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position at one of three sensitivity levels: Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority holds that although the Board lacks authority to review the reasons underlying an agency's decision to deny an employee access to classified information, the Board is authorized to review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible to occupy a sensitive position where classified information is not involved. I disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Supreme Court precedent precludes the Board from reviewing the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible to occupy a sensitive position.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 520-21 (1988), the Supreme Court considered the appeal of an individual appointed to a non-critical sensitive position on a military base, with his duties limited pending "satisfactory completion of security and medical reports." The agency discovered unfavorable information about Mr. Egan during its background investigation that it believed made him a security risk, and notified him of his right to respond. In the meantime, however, Mr. Egan completed his probationary period, thereby gaining appeal rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-7513. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 521-22. Ultimately the agency found Mr. Egan ineligible for his position and removed him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 522. On appeal, the Board held that it lacks authority to review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an individual poses an unacceptable threat to national security if allowed to remain in his position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 524; <span class="Italic">see Egan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 509 (1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a later phase of the appeal, the Supreme Court agreed with the Board. The Court framed the issue before it to be whether the Board "has authority by statute to review the substance of an underlying decision to deny or revoke a security clearance in the course of reviewing an adverse action." 484 U.S. at 520. I do not agree with the majority that the <span id="Page_2578"></span>Court was using the term "security clearance" as a term of art to mean a grant of access to classified information or eligibility for such access. The <span class="Italic">Egan</span> decision, when read as a whole, makes clear that the Court was concerned with the Board intruding on discretionary national security judgments committed to agency heads, regardless of whether the employee affected needed access to classified information as part of his job. One clear indication of the meaning of <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is the Court's statement that once Mr. Egan was denied a "security clearance," his only possibility for continued employment was in a "nonsensitive position." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 522. In other words, the Court considered a "security clearance" to be a requirement for <span class="Italic">any</span> sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, the centerpiece of <span class="Italic">Egan</span>'s discussion of the limits on Board review, Executive Order No. 10,450, makes no mention of classified information whatsoever. The Court discussed the requirements of Executive Order No. 10,450 in depth while using the terms "security clearance" and "clearance" in reference to "national security" positions generally, and did not confine its discussion to positions involving access to classified information. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 528-29, 531. "National security position" refers not just to positions that require access to classified information, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a)(2), but also to positions not requiring such access but that "involve activities of the Government that are concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage, including development of defense plans or policies, intelligence or counterintelligence activities, and related activities concerned with the preservation of the military strength of the United States," 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.102(a)(1). Accordingly, I interpret <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as holding that the Board lacks authority to review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is not eligible for a sensitive position, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, a "national security position" within the meaning of Executive Order No. 10,450 and 5 C.F.R. Part 732, regardless of whether the employee worked with classified information. 484 U.S. at 529-30. As the Court explained, national security matters are traditionally the province of the President and, by delegation, the heads of the relevant agencies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 530. A non-expert outside body such as the Board is poorly-suited to making the necessary "predictive judgments" about the risk that an individual poses to national security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 529. Congress simply did not intend to "involve the Board in second-guessing [an] agency's national security determinations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 531-32.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Title 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1564, "Security Clearance Investigations," provides further support for my view that the term "security clearance" does not have the fixed, limited meaning ascribed to it by the majority. Subsection (a), "Expedited Process," charges the Secretary of Defense with improving the timeliness of completion of "background investigations necessary for granting security clearances." Subsection (e), "Sensitive Duties," provides that "[f]or the purpose of this section, it is not necessary for the performance of duties to involve classified activities or classified matters in order for the duties to be considered sensitive and critical to the national security." I therefore disagree with footnote 20 of the majority opinion, which states that under section 1564 the term "security clearance" relates only to employees who need access to classified information as part of their jobs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case of <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young</span>, 351 U.S. 536 (1956), discussed by the majority, does not alter my conclusion. <span class="Italic">Cole</span> was decided 22 years before the passage of the Civil Service Reform Act, which created the Board and contained the version of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513 addressed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span>. As a consequence, <span class="Italic">Cole</span> does not provide guidance on the scope of the Board's review authority under section 7513. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Cole</span> is distinguishable. In <span class="Italic">Cole</span>, the Court held that an agency could not invoke a 1950 law authorizing summary removal of an employee who posed a threat to "national security" unless it had first made the "subsidiary determination" that the employee's position actually implicated "national security." 351 U.S. at 556. The Court found that Mr. Cole's termination was not authorized by the 1950 law because his employing agency had never made the requisite "subsidiary determination." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 557. By contrast, in the present appeal, it is undisputed that the agency has formally determined, in accordance with Executive Order No. 10,450 and 5 C.F.R. Part 732, that the appellant's Accounting Technician position is a "national security" position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additional cases cited by the majority also do not provide guidance on the issue at hand. In <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 273 Fed. Appx. 947 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the Board held that it had authority to review the reasons underlying the agency's decision to suspend the appellant's access to certain computer systems that he needed to use as part of his job. In <span class="Italic">Jacobs v. Department of the Army</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 688 (1994), the Board held that it had authority to review a security guard's disqualification from the Army's Chemical Personnel Reliability Program based on his alleged misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Siegert v. Department of the Army</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 684, 687-91 (1988), the Board held that it had authority to review the agency's reasons for revoking a Clinical Psychologist's privileges, and in <span class="Italic">Cosby v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 30 M.S.P.R. 16, 18-19 (1986), the Board held that it had authority to review the agency's determination that an Air Traffic Controller was medically disqualified from his position. <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, <span class="Italic">Jacobs, Siegert</span>, and <span class="Italic">Cosby</span> stand for the proposition that agencies cannot evade Board review of the reasons for an adverse action merely by creating their own credentialing or fitness standards and then finding those standards unmet. <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, <span class="Italic">Jacobs, Siegert</span>, and <span class="Italic">Cosby</span> do not discuss or even cite Executive Order No. 10,450 or 5 C.F.R. Part 732; as a result, they do not support a finding that the Board has authority to review an agency's national security judgments made under delegation from the President.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab</span>, 489 U.S. 656 (1989), the Court ruled that the Customs Service could institute a drug testing program for employees involved in drug interdiction and who carried firearms, notwithstanding the employees' objection that such testing violated their constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches; the Court remanded the cases for findings on the validity of the drug testing program as it related to employees who handled classified material. <span class="Italic">Van Raab</span> said nothing about Executive Order No. 10,450 or Board review of adverse actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Alternatively, even if Supreme Court precedent does not directly address the issue, the Board cannot review an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible to occupy a sensitive position because doing so would involve the Board in sensitive national security judgments that are beyond its expertise and that it is not authorized to make.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The majority reads <span class="Italic">Egan</span> as leaving open the question of the scope of Board review in adverse action appeals involving employees who occupied sensitive positions but did not need access to classified information as part of their jobs. I do not read <span class="Italic">Egan</span> this narrowly. If I did, however, I nevertheless would hold that the Board cannot review the reasons underlying an agency's decision that an employee is no longer eligible for a sensitive position, even when the employee did not work with classified information, because doing so would involve the Board in delicate national security judgments that are beyond its expertise and that it is not authorized to make.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Regardless of whether an employee in a sensitive position handles classified information, for the Board to review the reasons underlying the agency's decision that an individual's continued employment poses a threat to national security requires the Board to make the "predictive judgments" that the Court said in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> the Board is ill-equipped to make. 484 U.S. at 529. The majority likens these "predictive judgments" to matters that the Board routinely considers under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981). It is true that when reviewing an agency-imposed penalty for misconduct the Board may consider an employee's rehabilitation potential, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 305, which is akin to predicting future behavior. Nevertheless, any such prediction within the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> framework is fundamentally different from determining "what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk" that an employee poses to national security. <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, 484 U.S. at 529. The latter judgment is an inherently military one where, as in this appeal, the employee worked for a component of the Department of Defense. In <span class="Italic">Egan</span>, the Court explicitly found that the Board is not an expert in the methods for protecting classified information in the military's custody, 484 U.S. at 529, and nothing in the structure or staffing of the Board makes it sufficiently expert in military affairs to review other military judgments not involving classified information. As agency counsel observed at oral argument, although an employee with access to classified information might pose a more obvious threat to national security than an employee in a sensitive position who does not work with classified information, the difference between the two employees is one of degree, not kind.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Apart from the Board's lack of expertise in national security matters, the Board is not authorized to decide whether an employee is eligible for retention in a sensitive position. When the Board reviews an adverse action, the standard the Board applies is whether the action "promote[s] the efficiency of the service." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a). When an agency determines whether an individual may continue to occupy a sensitive position, the standard the agency applies is whether "retention in employment" is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security." Executive Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 2. The Board does not apply the latter standard in adverse action appeals, nor is it permitted to do so under statute, Executive Order No. 10,450, or any other authority. Therefore, the distinction between an agency's determination to deny an employee access to classified information, which the majority says the Board cannot review, and an agency's determination to deny continued employment in a sensitive position where classified information is not involved, which the majority says the Board may review, is an artificial one.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It bears emphasizing that Executive Order No. 10,450 was issued 25 years before Congress created the Board in the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111. As stated in the Preamble to Executive Order No. 10,450, the position sensitivity system is based on the President's authority under the Constitution and related statutes which, as <span class="Italic">Egan</span> explains, make the President the head of the Executive branch and the steward of national security. The President has delegated <span id="Page_2579"></span>certain national security and management functions to agency heads in Executive Order No. 10,450. Assuming that Congress has the power to limit the authority of the President and agency heads over national security matters,[2] it did not do so when it authorized the Board to adjudicate adverse action appeals. If in 1978 Congress meant to alter longstanding arrangements and delegations by giving the Board the power to overrule an agency head's judgment about the threat a particular employee poses to national security, one would expect a clear indication of such an intention. I find no such indication. In fact, given that Congress instructed the Board to review adverse actions under the "efficiency of the service" standard and not any standard related to national security, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(a), it is reasonable to infer that Congress did not intend to allow the Board to review an agency head's judgment on national security matters.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The majority observes that under the Constitution, Congress has the power "to declare war," "to raise and support Armies," "to provide and maintain a Navy," and "to make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." U.S. Const. Art. I, &#x00A7; 8, cl. 11-14. It does not appear that these broad powers pertain to the classic Executive functions of managing the civilian workforce at military installations and providing for the security of such installations. In any event, despite my doubts, I assume for purposes of this dissent that Congress could create an agency in the Executive branch to review an agency head's determination that retaining a particular employee in a sensitive position would pose a risk to national security. I simply would find that Congress did not intend to do so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">III.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The Board should not review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is ineligible to occupy a sensitive position because doing so creates the possibility of an irreconcilable conflict between a Board order and an agency head's authority under Executive Order No. 10,450.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the explanation above, there is a separate reason why the Board should not review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible for a sensitive position. Executive Order No. 10,450, &#x00A7; 7, provides that--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Any person whose employment is suspended or terminated under the authority granted to heads of departments and agencies by or in accordance with the said act of August 26, 1950, or pursuant to the said Executive Order No. 9835 or any other security or loyalty program relating to officers or employees of the Government, shall not be reinstated or restored to duty or reemployed in the same department or agency and shall not be reemployed in any other department or agency, unless the head of the department or agency concerned finds that such reinstatement, restoration, or reemployment is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This restriction on reinstatement also appears in Department of Defense regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 32 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 154.57(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board reviewed the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible for a sensitive position, and if it found those reasons unproven, ostensibly it would order cancellation of the employee's removal. As explained in Part II above, however, the Board's decision would be based on application of the "efficiency of the service" standard and not on the relevant "interests of national security" standard under Executive Order No. 10,450. Thus, even after the Board's decision, there would remain the undisturbed judgment of the agency that the individual's continued employment would not be consistent with the interests of national security. Under such circumstances, the agency head would be derelict in his responsibility under Executive Order No. 10,450 if he allowed the individual's reinstatement, yet he would be in violation of a Board order if he denied reinstatement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">I see no way to resolve this conflict. If the Board undertakes a review of the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible for a sensitive position, it may be conducting empty process resulting in an unenforceable Board order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">CONCLUSION</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For the reasons given above, I would hold that the Board cannot review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible to occupy a position that the agency has designated "sensitive" under Executive Order No. 10,450 and its implementing regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). Before today those reasons have never been subject to third-party review, and I am unwilling to make this the first such case. Assuming for the sake of discussion that Congress could, consistent with the Constitution, empower the Board to review the reasons underlying an agency's determination that an employee is no longer eligible to occupy a sensitive national security position, there is no indication that it gave the Board such authority.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> <span class="Italic">Crumpler v. DOD</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/CRUMPLER_STELLA_DC_0752_09_0033_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_453071.pdf">112 MSPR 636</a>, 639-44 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-19, 2009 MSPB 224 (2009) (vacated, 113 MSPR 94, 2009 MSPB 233 (2009), to permit OPM participation in the appeal following a change in Board membership), decided that if the employee is determined by the agency, with due process protections, to be unable to fill a sensitive position, the agency's decision to fire the employee for that reason will not be reviewed by the Board, meaning that the inability to fill a sensitive position is analytically the same as the inability to maintain a clearance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have reopened this case, however, to address whether the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> rule limiting the scope of Board review of a removal based on the revocation of a security clearance also applies to a removal from a "non-critical sensitive" position based on the employee having been denied eligibility "to access classified information and/or occupy a sensitive position." An understanding of the Supreme Court's holding and rationale in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is therefore an essential starting point. The respondent in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was hired into a position that had been classified as "sensitive" by the agency, with a condition precedent to his employment being his "satisfactory completion of security and medical reports." 484 U.S. at 520. Following procedural safeguards deemed adequate, the respondent was denied a security clearance. Without a security clearance, the respondent was ineligible for the position and he was removed for that reason. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 521-22. The respondent sought review by the Board pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(d), and the case ultimately reached the Supreme Court on the question of whether the Board had authority to review the merits of the agency's decision to deny the respondent a security clearance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court held that the Board does not have such authority, reasoning that the unique role played by the Executive Branch to protect national security precluded the inference without clear direction that Congress granted the Board the authority to review security clearance decisions. The Court explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[The President's] authority to classify and control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position in the Executive Branch that will give that person access to such information flows primarily from this constitutional investment of power in the President and exists quite apart from any explicit congressional grant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 527. The President, in turn, has delegated to the heads of agencies the responsibility to "protect sensitive information and to ensure proper classification throughout the Executive Branch." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 528. Thus, agency heads have authority to classify positions "in three categories: critical sensitive, noncritical sensitive, and nonsensitive. Different types and levels of clearance are required, depending upon the positions sought. A Government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies according to the degree of adverse effect the appointment could have on the national security." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whether to grant a particular employee access to classified information requires a predictive judgment regarding a person's potential future actions. And per the Supreme Court:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Predictive judgment of this kind must be made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified information....[t]he protection of classified information must be committed to the broad discretion of the agency responsible, and this must include broad discretion to determine who may have access to it. Certainly, it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction with confidence. Nor can such a body determine what constitutes an acceptable margin of error in assessing the potential risk.... [W]ith respect to employees in sensitive positions "there is a reasonable basis for the view that an agency head who must bear the responsibility for the protection of classified information committed to his custody should have the final say in deciding whether to repose his trust in an employee who has access to such information."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 529 (quoting <span class="Italic">Cole v. Young,</span> 351 U.S. 536, 546 (1956)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, as previously noted, the appellant's position was classified by the agency as non-critical sensitive pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). That section directs the head of each agency to designate</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">any position within the department or agency the occupant of which could bring about by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position at one of three sensitivity levels: Special-Sensitive, Critical-Sensitive, or Noncritical-Sensitive.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a). The "investigative requirements" for each sensitivity level are provided in OPM issuances. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Egan</span> and the language and structure of the regulation, it is well-settled that the Board does not have authority to review the merits of an agency's designation of a position as a "sensitive position" at one of the three levels. <span class="Italic">See Skees v. Department of the Navy,</span> 864 F.2d 1576, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (reasoning that if, under <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> "the Board cannot review the employee's loss of security clearance, it is even further beyond <span id="Page_2580"></span>question that it cannot review the Navy's judgment that the position itself requires the clearance"); <span class="Italic">Bolden v. Department of the Navy,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 151, 154 (1994) (holding that "the Board is without authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing the security access requirement"); <span class="Italic">Brady,</span> 50 M.S.P.R. at 138 (holding that the Board has no authority to review an agency's decision to classify a position as non-critical sensitive). By designating the appellant's position as non-critical sensitive under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a), the agency made the unreviewable judgment that "the occupant...could bring about by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(b), the agency imposed an appropriate investigative requirement to ensure that the appellant's background did not create, in its judgment, an undue risk to national security. As a result of that investigation, the WHS/CAF, an independent branch of the agency, determined that the appellant was ineligible to occupy a sensitive position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these facts, no meaningful distinction warrants treating the determination that the appellant is ineligible to occupy a sensitive position any differently from a determination denying or revoking an employee's security clearance. In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the Supreme Court clearly described the precise authority under which the agency here designated appellant's position as sensitive,[2] and went on to include an employee's eligibility to hold such a position as the type of discretionary judgment that is not reviewable by the Board because executive agency heads have authority to classify and control access to information consistent with national security.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;The Supreme Court cited Executive Order No. 10450, &#x00A7; 3, 3 C.F.R. 937 (1949-1953 Comp.). <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> 484 U.S. at 528. The regulations authorizing agency heads to designate positions as "sensitive" and authorizing OPM to establish investigative requirements for each sensitivity level--5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 732.201(a) and 732.201(b)--had not been codified at the time <span class="Italic">Egan</span> was decided. However, Executive Order No. 10450 is the authority for the regulations and their requirements are drawn from the Executive Order. Thus, the Supreme Court clearly had in mind the language now contained in those two regulations when, as previously noted, it described the authority of agency heads to classify positions "in three categories: critical sensitive, noncritical sensitive, and non-sensitive. Different types and levels of clearance are required, depending upon the positions sought. A Government appointment is expressly made subject to a background investigation that varies according to the degree of adverse effect the appointment could have on the national security." 484 U.S. at 528.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's judgment as to whether the position involves access to classified information or otherwise implicates national security is irrelevant. Under <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> <span class="Italic">Skees,</span> and <span class="Italic">Brady,</span> the Board has no authority to review the agency's decision to designate the appellant's position as non-critical sensitive. Although a reasonable argument could be made that there <span class="Italic">should</span> be some limitation upon or review of an agency's discretion to designate positions under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 732.201(a), that fact does not bear upon whether the Board has such authority. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hesse v. Department of State,</span> 217 F.3d 1372, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (in response to the argument that an employee who is denied Whistleblower Protection Act appeal rights to challenge as retaliatory the revocation of his security clearance would have no other recourse, the court observed that "employees typically have internal appeal procedures within their agencies through which to object to adverse decisions on security clearance issues").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is also irrelevant that the appellant's position did not require a security clearance. As the foregoing discussion shows, <span class="Italic">Egan</span> is not limited to security clearances, <span class="Italic">per se.</span> Its reasoning applies to any access eligibility standard that an agency, in its discretion, chooses to impose on candidates for a position that the agency has designated as sensitive because, in its judgment, the occupant of the position could materially, adversely affect national security. Moreover, the term "security clearance" should not be viewed as a term of art, but merely as a semantic device to describe--in the Supreme Court's words--any "background investigation" an employee must undergo and pass before being placed in a position deemed a national deemed a national security risk. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Romero v. Department of Defense,</span> 527 F.3d 1324 (Fed. Cir. 2008), the court rejected the argument that the appellant's security clearance was not revoked, on the grounds that "the WHS-CAF's statement that his eligibility 'for access to classified information and to occupy a sensitive position has been revoked' shows that his clearance was revoked." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1330 n.2. Notably, this is the language used by the agency to describe the appellant's loss of eligibility to occupy her "sensitive" position. <span class="Italic">See also Tchakmakjian v. Department of Defense,</span> 57 Fed. Appx. 438, 439-41 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (applying the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> standard of review to the removal of an employee who occupied a position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was removed when the agency revoked his "security clearance and eligibility to occupy a sensitive position"); <span class="Italic">Bolden,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. at 154 (holding that the Board did not have the authority to review the agency's reasons for imposing a "security access requirement or to review the merits of the security access determination" when reviewing the appeal of an employee holding a position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was indefinitely suspended when his "access to classified information and areas was revoked"); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Department of the Navy,</span> 49 M.S.P.R. 277, 278 (1991) (applying the <span class="Italic">Egan</span> standard of review to removal of an employee who occupied a position that was designated non-critical sensitive and who was removed when his access to "sensitive duties or classified information" was revoked).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note the difficulty that an AJ would encounter in weighing the merits of the agency's decision to deny an appellant "eligibility for access to classified information and/or [to] occupy a sensitive position." In <span class="Italic">Egan,</span> the AJ who originally heard the case held that the Board could review the merits of the security clearance denial and imposed on the agency the burden to (1) specify the precise criteria used in its security-clearance decision; (2) show that those criteria are rationally related to national security; and (3) prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the acts precipitating the denial of his clearance actually occurred and that the alleged misconduct has an actual or potentially detrimental effect on national security interests. 484 U.S. at 523. These standards would obviously require the AJ to make the very determinations that the Supreme Court deemed in <span class="Italic">Egan</span> to be beyond the expertise of the Board. As the Supreme Court explained, "it is not reasonably possible for an outside nonexpert body to review the substance of such a judgment [to deny a security clearance] and to decide whether the agency should have been able to make the necessary affirmative prediction [that the employee did not pose a national security threat] with confidence." 484 U.S. at 529. The absence of an alternative standard that would satisfy <span class="Italic">Egan</span> further demonstrates that Board review of the agency's determination in this case would be incompatible with that controlling Supreme Court precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we conclude that the AJ properly sustained the appellant's removal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency renews its claim, raised below, that the administrative judge should have applied an abuse of discretion standard in her review of the Clearance Appeal Board (CAB)'s decision finding the appellant ineligible to occupy an NCS position. However, in <span class="Italic">Conyers</span> and <span class="Italic">Northover</span>, the Board found that the Board may exercise its full statutory review authority and review the agency's determination that the appellant is no longer eligible to hold a "sensitive" position. <span class="Italic">Conyers,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 572, &#x00B6; 25; <span class="Italic">Northover,</span> 115 M.S.P.R. 451, &#x00B6; 25, <span class="Italic">see also Adams v. Department of the Army,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 12 (2007) (when the charge consists of the employing agency's withdrawal or revocation of its certification or other approval of the employee's fitness or other qualifications to hold his position, the Board's authority generally extends to a review of the merits of that withdrawal or revocation), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 273 F. App'x 947 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Therefore the agency has not shown that the administrative judge erred in reviewing the merits of the CAB's decision that the appellant is not eligible to occupy an NCS position, and in not subjecting that decision to an abuse of discretion standard.</p>
