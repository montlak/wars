<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-121"><span class="space">2.</span> Omitted Findings</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Although <span class="Italic">Spithaler v.</span> OPM, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/SPITHALER_SF831L09002_80_69_OPINION_AND_ORDER_252539.pdf">1 MSPR 587</a>, 2 MSPB 2 (1980), and its progeny, as well as the Board's regulations, call for detailed factual and legal findings, the Board may forgive an AJ's lapses when the Board receives a PFR challenging the analytical sufficiency of an initial decision. An AJ is not required to refer to specific testimony in an initial decision. <span class="Italic">Coombs v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 604, 610 (1989). An AJ's determination not to mention all of the extensive testimony and evidence in his initial decision does not mean that he did not consider it in reaching his decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 294, 295 n.2 (1985); <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 300, 303 (1984) (same analysis as <span class="Italic">Harrison,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 65 MSPR 186, 195-96 (1994) ("[T]he administrative judge's failure to mention every aspect, limitation, or inconsistency in Martin's and Estrada's testimony does not mean that he did not fully consider the testimony."). Nor is there an error because the initial decision lacks a statement of evidentiary burden as to nexus. The omission does not suggest an inappropriate standard of proof; the Board examines the evidence relied upon by the AJ and will not reverse for lack of a recitation of the nexus standard. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ahr v. DOJ</span>, 23 MSPR 238, 242 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no error by an AJ who omits intermediate factual findings if a correlation exists between the charges and the result reached in the initial decision, even though the correlation is not expressly stated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Kline v. DHHS</span>, 22 MSPR 326, 328 (1984). But the determining factor is how the case strikes the Board. Board members have criticized their colleagues for forgetting about the requirements of <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> and brushing aside as inconsequential the failure of an AJ to describe and weigh competing testimony on material points. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Thomas-Rivas v. OPM</span>, 53 MSPR 334, 341 n.* (1992). For all the cases that dismiss PFRs based on factual findings or credibility determinations that the AJ should have but did not make, there occasionally appears a decision like <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 140, 142-43 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge failed to make adequate credibility determinations in the instant case. First, the administrative judge ignored the explanation offered by the agency's investigator as to why she did not apprehend the appellant immediately after witnessing the alleged misconduct. Second, the administrative judge did not comment upon parts of the investigator's testimony that suggest that the appellant admitted she was stealing. Finally, while emphasizing that the testimony of the agency's witnesses was "uncorroborated," the administrative judge failed to recognize that the similarities between the incidents of misconduct which the witnesses described also constituted a form of corroboration.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More typical is the decision deferring to the AJ's decision without particularly detailed credibility findings, e.g., <span class="Italic">Hankins v. Dept. of Army</span>, DA-0752-13-0423-I-1 (NP 9/8/2014):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also challenges the administrative judge's credibility findings regarding his allegedly "evasive and argumentative" approach to the interviews. Specifically, he argues that, in weighing the testimony of the appellant against that of the proposing official and the interview witness, the administrative judge failed to make explicit demeanor findings and failed to analyze the appellant's credibility at all. We disagree. First, the Board has long recognized that demeanor-based credibility determinations that an administrative judge makes during an in-person hearing need not be explicit to be entitled to deference. <span class="Italic">See Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (the Board is required to give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based explicitly or implicitly on witness demeanor); <span class="Italic">Rumsey v. Department of Justice</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 259, &#x00B6; 12 (2013) (same). Furthermore, the administrative judge conducted a proper credibility analysis for all relevant witnesses under <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Department of the Army</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987), when he compared the agency witnesses' testimony to one another, reviewed the appellant's written responses to the interview questions, and considered the witnesses' potential bias. We lack a sufficiently sound basis to disturb these credibility determinations. <span class="Italic">See Haebe</span>, 288 F.3d at 1301.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Hornsby v. Fed. Housing Finance Agency</span>, DC-0752-15-0576-I-2 (NP 4/28/2022), credited implicit credibility findings:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board must defer to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on observing the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing, and the Board may overturn such credibility findings only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). It is well established that when, as here, an administrative judge has heard live testimony, her credibility determinations must be deemed to be at least implicitly based upon the demeanor of the witnesses. <span class="Italic">See Purifoy v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 838 F.3d 1367, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding that the Board must defer to an administrative judge's demeanor-based credibility determinations, "[e]ven if demeanor is not explicitly discussed"); <span class="Italic">Little v. Department of Transportation</span>, 112 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 4 (2009). Thus, the Board may overturn credibility findings only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so, as when the administrative judge's findings are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">Rapp v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 674, &#x00B6; 13 (2008).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1707"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Haas v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 36, &#x00B6; 34 (2022) ("An administrative judge's failure to mention all of the evidence of record does not mean that she did not consider it in reaching her decision. <span class="Italic">Mithen v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 122 M.S.P.R. 489, &#x00B6; 14 (2015), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 652 F. App'x 971 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Not specifically discussing every evidentiary matter or credibility factor does not mean that an administrative judge failed to consider them. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, the Board must give deference to an administrative judge's credibility determinations when they are based explicitly or implicitly on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing. <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 838 F.3d 1367, 1372-73 (Fed. Cir. 2016); <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice,</span> 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Here, the administrative judge implicitly relied on demeanor in finding that the Port Director credibly denied that the appellant's protected activity had any effect on his actions.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the AJ need not recite all the evidence, significant evidence should not be overlooked. In <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 420, 425-26 (1996), the Board sent the appeal back to the region with the observation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency must prove its charge by a preponderance of the evidence. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.56(a)(1)(ii) [now 5 CFR 1201.56(b)(1)(ii)]. Here, the agency's evidence in support of charge (1) is entirely circumstantial. Where there is no significant contrary proof, circumstantial evidence can constitute proof by preponderant evidence, <span class="Italic">see Special Counsel v. Lee</span>, 58 MSPR 81, 87 (1993), but the appellant presented significant evidence in rebuttal to the agency's evidence. The administrative judge gave no reason for rejecting the appellant's account of the events of November 4, and did not even discuss the testimony of Joyce Smith, Jason Smith, and Delmar Tompkins. In the absence of an analysis of the appellant's evidence in rebuttal, we must set aside the administrative judge's decision to sustain charge (1). <span class="Italic">See Grant v. Dept. of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 374-75 (1994) (an administrative judge's determination that the appellant's performance was unacceptable was set aside, where the determination was based almost exclusively on the testimony of an agency witness, and the administrative judge did not explain why he did not find the appellant's testimony credible or why he rejected testimony from several witnesses who corroborated the appellant's testimony); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 50 MSPR 140, 142-43 (1991) (an administrative judge's finding that the appellant did not steal government property was set aside, where the administrative judge made no mention of key aspects of the testimony of an agency witness, and did not analyze evidence that corroborated the testimony of agency witnesses).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appeal must be remanded to the regional office for reconsideration of charge (1), including an assessment of the credibility of the appellant's witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grant</span>, 61 MSPR at 375, 378 (where the administrative judge did not adequately explain why he found one witness credible and others not, the appeal was remanded for credibility determinations); <span class="Italic">see also Beardsley v. Dept. of Defense</span>, 55 MSPR 504, 508 (1992) (the administrative judge, who heard the testimony firsthand and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, is in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 5 F.3d 1504 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Young v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 53 MSPR 384, 386 (1992), found the factual analysis a tad lacking when the AJ failed to discuss the expert opinion of a classifier in a constructive demotion appeal. The Board explained that the "administrative judge was free to reject Mr. Katz's opinion, [but] she was not free to ignore it." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Grant v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 61 MSPR 370, 375 (1994) ("[T]here is little explanation of why he found Mouzon credible and almost no explanation of why he found the appellant's testimony lacking in credibility."). Speaking of critical testimony ignored by an AJ, <span class="Italic">Wallace and Martin v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 106 MSPR 23, 33-36 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-16, 2007 MSPB 141 (2007), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must give deference to an AJ's credibility determinations when they are based, explicitly or implicitly, on the observation of the demeanor of witnesses testifying at a hearing; the Board may overturn such determinations only when it has "sufficiently sound" reasons for doing so. <span class="Italic">Haebe v. Department of Justice</span>, 288 F.3d 1288, 1301 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Sufficiently sound reasons to overturn an administrative judge's demeanor-based credibility determinations include circumstances when the judge's findings are incomplete, inconsistent with the weight of the evidence, and do not reflect the record as a whole. <span class="Italic">Faucher v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6; 8 (2004). Based on the analysis set forth below, we find that the record here provides sound reasons to overturn the AJ's credibility determinations regarding this conversation between Grace and Wallace.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Further, the AJ's analysis of the conversation between Grace and Wallace was incomplete in that it completely ignored the testimony of another participant in the conversation, Andrea Wellington.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...However, the ID completely ignored Wellington's testimony that she was present at the time of the conversation in question and that her testimony was both consistent with Wallace's version and contradicted Grace's version of the conversation. While it is possible that the AJ considered the conflicting evidence in concluding that Grace was more credible than Wallace with respect to their conversation, "[his] finding contrary to a significant piece of evidence that has a direct bearing on the case, without mentioning it, raises a question as to its consideration." <span class="Italic">Barrett v. Department of the Interior</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 356, 362 (1992).... <span class="Italic">Cf. Ray v. Department of the Army</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 101, &#x00B6; 44 (2004) (the Board rejected the credibility findings on which the AJ relied in support of his conclusion that the agency failed to sustain a specification and sustained the specification upon determining that the testimonial evidence in support of the specification was more credible than the appellant's version of the events), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 176 Fed. Appx. 110 (Fed. Cir. 2006).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Despite the occasional remand, the AJ is responsible for analysis of the major issues in the appeal, and a general treatment of those issues may be tolerated by the Board as a reviewer. Not every subsidiary factual issue need be the subject of complete factual analysis. <span class="Italic">Leonard v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 142, 144, 3 MSPB 251 (1980) (rejecting the assumption that a regulation requires the AJ to respond to each theory or speculation advanced by the appellant). It suffices to resolve an issue by implication rather than by a direct finding. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Duchene v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 59, 60 (1985). As a practical matter, if the AJ fails to make findings on an issue of significance--e.g., an affirmative defense of reprisal--the Board makes the necessary findings during the PFR process if there is no need for the AJ to reconsider the evidence to resolve credibility disputes. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 294, 295 (1985) (Board cured the AJ's omitted finding on a reprisal claim by conducting its own analysis of the evidence), <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Bonds v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 616, 618 (1987) (Board remanded for the AJ to provide a proper analysis of the defense of personal animus in a performance action). These decisions predated <span class="Italic">Hillen v. Dept. of Army</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/HILLEN_PHILLIP_G_DC075285103241_OPINION_AND_ORDER_218101.pdf">35 MSPR 453</a>, 458 (1987), requiring an AJ to conduct detailed and articulated analysis of credibility issues. Decisions postdating <span class="Italic">Hillen</span> demonstrate that the Board may supply its own analysis based on findings that it makes, or assumes for purposes for discussion, based on the evidence developed before the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cole v. VA</span>, 77 MSPR 434, 439-40 (1998) (Board made a factual finding on the charge that did not require a credibility analysis when the charge was sufficient to sustain an action without regard to other charges); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">McIver-Smith v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 464, 469 (1997) (satisfaction of an element of a claim may be assumed for the purposes of the analysis of a law that the AJ failed to apply).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board prefers a comprehensive treatment of credibility issues, if credibility is not in dispute the Board will make the factual findings that should have been made by the AJ if it can do so from the record. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 583, 585 &#x0026; n.1 (1993) (no hearing; the Board reviewed the AJ's credibility assessments on the record presented to the AJ); <span class="Italic">Coleman v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 537, 542 (1993) ("[W]e need not reverse the initial decision or remand the appeal to the administrative judge, because the record, including the administrative judge's findings on the first two charges and the appellant's affirmative defenses, establishes that the third charge should be sustained."). Remand may be required to obtain further analysis by the AJ of an issue material to disposition of the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Arauz v. DOJ</span>, 89 MSPR 529, 539-40 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-24 (2001) (remand was required when the AJ failed to address the issue after receiving evidence (over the agency's objection that the issue was not included in the appellant's prehearing submission) and then failing to reconvene the hearing, as he assured the parties that he would, after reviewing hearing testimony and determining it to be material).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">To provide an idea of the latitude allowed to factfinders by a reviewing court, consider the outcome of an unacceptable performance case decided by an arbitrator, <span class="Italic">DePauw v. ITC</span>, 782 F.2d 1564, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The last of petitioner's complaints is that the arbitrator did not adequately discuss DePauw's actual performance in the light of the elements of the performance standards he was held to have failed to meet. Although the arbitrator's decision might have been fuller on this precise point, we are satisfied from his entire decision that he canvassed the full record, was aware of the requirements of the performance standards, and understood and accepted the agency's strong proof of petitioner's specific deficiencies. DePauw's failure to present rebuttal evidence as those matters made it acceptable for the arbitrator to be as general as he was in his treatment of the uncontradicted ITC evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lowder v. DHS</span>, 504 F.3d 1378, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 2007), declared of alleged deficiencies in an AJ's initial decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The failure to discuss particular contentions in a case, however, does not mean that the tribunal did not consider them in reaching its decision. <span class="Italic">See Hartman v. DVA</span>, 483 F.3d 1311, 1315 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("'That the court did not specifically mention the [argument] in its opinion forms no basis for an assumption that it did not consider [it]....'"). <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">also Charles G. Williams Const., Inc. v. White</span>, 326 F.3d, 1376, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (stating "[t]he Board's failure to discuss the evidence upon which Williams relies does not mean that it did not consider it"); <span class="Italic">Carolina Tobacco Co. v. Bureau of Customs and Border Prot.</span>, 402 F.3d 1345, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (stating "a district court's failure to discuss an issue does not necessarily establish that the court did not consider it"). All that it means is that the author of the opinion, for whatever reasons, did not deem it necessary or appropriate specifically to discuss those points. The author of an opinion has broad discretion to determine what the opinion should contain and in what detail. As we recently stated, a "'litigant's right to have all issues fully considered and ruled on by the appellate court does not equate to a right to a full written opinion on every issue raised.'" <span class="Italic">Bernklau v. Principi</span>, <span id="Page_1708"></span>291 F.3d 795, 801 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (quoting <span class="Italic">United States v. Garza</span>, 165 F.3d 312, 314 (5th Cir. 1999)). "While it may be desirable in some cases to afford each issue a complete written discussion, no statute or rule compels such an approach...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the analysis of charges in a disciplinary case, the Board is inclined to regard as harmless an AJ's error in the analysis of some charges or specifications if the sustained charges analyzed by the AJ justified the penalty imposed by the agency. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 62 MSPR 71, 74 (1994); <span class="Italic">Curry v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 35 MSPR 301, 304 (1987) (no harm when AJ did not address all 25 specifications; charges relied on by deciding official and sustained by AJ supported the adverse action).
