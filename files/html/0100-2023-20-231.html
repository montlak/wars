<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-223"><span id="Page_4048"></span><span class="space">1.</span> Basis for Stay Sought by Appellant</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">First considered are stays requested by appellants. Guidance on some IRA stay regulations and Board stay authority was provided by <span class="Italic">Gergick v. GSA</span>, 43 MSPR 651 (1990). After exhausting his requirement to seek assistance from OSC, the appellant sought a stay from the Board of an agency inquiry into possible misconduct. The agency's letter to the appellant requested his cooperation with the inquiry and warned of the possibility of disciplinary action. Believing that the inquiry and possible disciplinary action evolved from his whistleblowing, the appellant sought a stay from the Board of the threat of discipline. The Board, reviewing the legislative history, had no trouble determining that &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), as amended by the WPA, included threats within the ambit of the actions that the Board could prevent. It was not necessary for the agency to state that a disciplinary action was proposed, nor did the agency need to refer to any particular kind of disciplinary action that could be imposed. The mention that an inquiry could result in disciplinary action served as notice of the possibility of discipline and was a threat.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gergick</span> considered whether there was a substantial likelihood that the action threatened was a personnel action, as defined at &#x00A7; 1209.15(a)(5)(i) of Board regulations, 43 MSPR at 658-59:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The term "substantial likelihood" is not defined in the regulations or in the Whistleblower Protection Act. We note that the meaning of that term varies according to the context in which it is used.... We also note, however, that the term generally is said to refer to..."more than 'seeming or imaginary,'" and "not illusive"; and that it is said to "indicate that which is serious as opposed to that which is trivial."... We find these definitions appropriate...and we therefore will apply them in considering whether the appellant has met his burden of proving his entitlement to a stay.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 1209.5(a) defines a "personnel action" as including an adverse action under chapter 75 of title 5, United States Code, "or other disciplinary or corrective action."... The agency has not denied...that it ultimately may effect some kind of adverse action (such as a removal, a demotion, or a suspension of more than 14 calendar days). Furthermore, the agency's reference to a possible violation of its standards of acceptable conduct or behavior indicates that any charges arising from the agency's inquiry may be serious enough in nature to support an adverse action.... We therefore equate the threatened personnel action at issue in this case with a "personnel action," as that term is defined in 5 CFR 1209.5(a), and we find that the Board has jurisdiction over this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Gergick</span> then defined the appellant's burden of proof, 43 MSPR at 659-63:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The Board's regulations provide, at 5 CFR 1209.15, that a request for a stay of a personnel action must contain "[e]vidence and/or argument demonstrating that there is a substantial likelihood that the...[I]ndividual will prevail on the merits of his or her appeal of the personnel action." In order to prevail on the merits of his appeal, the appellant must demonstrate that a disclosure described under 5 USC 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the threatened personnel action....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the "contributing factor" standard is a lower standard than the "substantial factor" standard that was in effect in whistleblower cases before the Whistleblower Protection Act became law.... Statements made during the congressional floor debate on this legislation indicate that one of the primary purposes of the Act was to lower the burden that previously had been imposed on employees seeking to show that their agencies had proposed or effected actions because of their whistleblowing activities....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their joint explanatory statement regarding the Whistleblower Protection Bill, House and Senate members made the following explicit statement regarding methods of meeting the "contributory factor" burden:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One of the many possible ways to show that the whistleblowing was a factor in the personnel action is to show that the official taking the action knew (or had constructive knowledge) of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant in this case has presented evidence that his whistleblowing was a factor in the threatened personnel action at issue. The record of inquiry the agency issued him...includes a specific reference to the appellant's complaints to OSC and to the agency's Inspector General. It therefore is obvious that the official who issued that inquiry knew about at least some of the appellant's disclosures....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the circumstances described above, we find that there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant can show that his whistleblowing complaints were a "contributing factor"...in his threatened personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The findings we have stated above do not end our inquiry into the merits of the appellant's request for a stay of the threatened personnel action. Under 5 USC 1221(e)(2), the Board may not order corrective action "if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of [the employee's] disclosure [under 5 USC 2302(b)(8)]." "Clear and convincing evidence" is...a higher quantum of evidence than "preponderant evidence." It has been defined as meaning "that measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established."...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board proceeded to a detailed examination of the agency's vague accusations against the appellant (contained in the agency's internal investigation of the appellant), most of them unsupported by specific evidence. A stay was granted pending the Board's final determination on the IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next the Board reviewed a stay request in a removal action, <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 45 MSPR 146 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Williams I</span>), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 46 MSPR 549 (1991) (on jurisdictional grounds) (<span class="Italic">Williams II</span>), <span class="Italic">enforcement den.</span>, <span class="Italic">Williams v. DOD</span>, 53 MSPR 23 (1992) (denying stay enforcement on jurisdictional grounds). In <span class="Italic">Williams I</span>, on interlocutory appeal from the denial of a stay, the Board considered the importance of the contributing factor analysis, 45 MSPR at 148-51:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction of the appellant's stay request. Board regulations provide that an employee may request a stay of a personnel action that the employee alleges was or will be based on his whistleblowing. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.14(a). In this case, the agency effected the appellant's removal prior to his stay request. Further, a removal, an adverse action under chapter 75 of Title 5, is a "personnel action" within the meaning of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.5(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the merits of the appellant's stay request, the Board's regulations provide, at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.15, that a stay request must contain "[e]vidence and/or argument demonstrating that there is a substantial likelihood that the...[I]ndividual will prevail on the merits of his or her appeal of the personnel action." Section 1209.15 also provides that the agency's response to the stay request must contain "[e]vidence and/or argument addressing whether there is a substantial likelihood that the individual will prevail on the merits of the appeal and whether granting the stay would result in extreme hardship to the agency." Thus, although the burden of persuasion with respect to the stay request is the appellant's, the burden of going forward with evidence shifts to the agency once the appellant shows a substantial likelihood that his disclosure described under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was a "contributing factor" in the threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USCA &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1). Generally, &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) prohibits an agency from taking a personnel action because of any disclosure which an employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of law or a waste of funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "contributing factor" standard is a lower standard than the "substantial factor" standard that was in effect in whistleblower cases prior to the enactment of the WPA. <span class="Italic">See Gergick v. General</span> <span class="Italic">Services Administration,</span> 43 MSPR 651, 659 (1990). The administrative judge erred, therefore, in applying <span class="Italic">Warren</span> to this case. Thus, we must decide whether the appellant presented evidence that there is a substantial likelihood that he can show that his whistleblowing is protected and was a contributing factor in his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his stay request, the appellant asserts that he engaged in the protected activity of filing Equal Employment Opportunity complaints, that the proposing and deciding officials are named in his EEO complaints, and that his removal was the direct result of this whistleblowing activity. The evidentiary submissions in support of this assertion are: a copy of a letter from the Special Counsel notifying the appellant of his right to seek corrective action from the Board; a copy of an amended complaint of discrimination filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the appellant was denied a promotion because of race discrimination and a copy of a letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accepting a subsequent EEO complaint, filed by the appellant on October 2, 1989, alleging reprisal; a copy of a letter to the Special Counsel authored by a co-worker of the appellant alleging that the agency engaged in prohibited personnel practices including race discrimination; copies of the appellant's "exceptional" performance ratings for 1987 and 1988; and copies of his award certificates for sustained superior performance and outstanding effort for 1987 and 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The joint explanatory statement of the Senate and House floor managers of the WPA stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">One of the...ways to show that the whistleblowing was a factor in the personnel action is to show that the official taking the action knew...of the disclosure and acted within such a period of time that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">135 Cong. Rec. H749 (daily ed. Mar. 21, 1989). In this case, the agency does not deny that the proposing and deciding officials had knowledge of the appellant's protected activities and were named in the EEO complaints. Further, the adverse action was effected while the appellant's EEO complaints were ongoing. In view of the newly-enunciated lower <span id="Page_4049"></span>standard of proof for those claiming reprisal based on whistleblowing, the Board finds that the appellant has shown that there is a substantial likelihood that he can demonstrate that a disclosure under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), here an alleged violation of law, i.e., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was a contributing factor in the personnel action taken against him. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">generally Valerino v. Department of Health and Human Services,</span> 7 MSPB 347, 7 MSPR 487 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the agency's assertion that the alleged whistleblowing occurred after the misconduct is without merit. The appellant established that he filed his latest EEO complaint on October 2, 1989; the alleged misconduct occurred on November 1, 1989, and the removal was proposed on November 15, 1989.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, our finding that the appellant has shown that there is a substantial likelihood that he will be able to show that his whistleblowing is a contributing factor in his removal does not end our inquiry. Under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), the Board may not order corrective action "if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of [the employee's] disclosure [under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)]." <span class="Italic">See Gergick,</span> at 662-63. The Board finds in this case that the record in the stay action does not demonstrate a substantial likelihood that the agency will present clear and convincing evidence that it would have removed the appellant in the absence of his whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has submitted the Notice of Proposed Removal which states that the reason for the appellant's removal is discourteous and disrespectful conduct toward his supervisor. Specifically, the Notice states that the appellant's supervisor informed the appellant by memo that a case was overdue and the appellant replied in writing that his supervisor had shown gross incompetence, negligence, and lack of integrity, as well as sloppy recordkeeping, incompetent screening, and lack of a rudimentary knowledge of the job. The agency has also submitted its Notice of Decision, finding the charge as cited to be fully supported and warranting the appellant's removal. The record, however, contains no evidence to support the charge. For example, the writing in which the appellant allegedly demonstrated discourteous and disrespectful conduct has not been submitted. Nor are there any affidavits attesting to the alleged misconduct. Further, assuming without finding that the appellant engaged in the misconduct as charged, this record does not establish a substantial likelihood that the agency will prove by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the action in any event. In this regard, the record contains neither evidence or argument that other employees were removed for the same offense, nor an agency table of penalties showing that removal is within the range of penalties for such an offense.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has submitted proof that it earlier suspended the appellant for ten days for use of abusive language to his supervisor in front of others. Such proof, however, does not establish a substantial likelihood that it can show by clear and convincing evidence that the appellant engaged in the charged misconduct and that it warrants his removal. The character of the misconduct specified in the removal notice is different from that for which the appellant was suspended. The removal misconduct, characterized as discourteous, not abusive or insubordinate, was written, and is not alleged to have disrupted the office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency's assertion that granting a stay would cause it irreparable harm is unsupported. The Board rejects the agency's arguments that granting the stay would "disrupt the order and discipline which is essential to the efficient operation of a federal agency" and would "send the wrong message to the thousands of personnel within the Agency's employ" as too general. The agency is merely disagreeing with the Congressional intent that stays in these types of circumstances be liberally granted because they are temporary and will avoid further harm to those who ultimately have meritorious cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 508, 100th Cong., 2nd Sess. 17 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, based on the record as submitted by the parties, we grant the appellant's stay request. We emphasize that our determination is based only on the record in the stay proceeding. The merits determination will be made on the record that is developed in that appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">El v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 123 MSPR 76, 88 &#x00B6; 18, 2015 MSPB 64 (2015) ("Even if the appellant's claims constituted a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure that contributed to a personnel action, the agency submitted considerable documentary evidence in support of its charge that the appellant misused his Government travel card. We find, therefore, that the appellant did not provide evidence and argument demonstrating a substantial likelihood that he would prevail on the merits of his whistleblowing claim.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A stay requested by an employee was denied in <span class="Italic">Visconti v. EPA</span>, 78 MSPR 17, 22-25 (1998). The Board employed an analysis that considered the timing of events, the motivation of the proposing official, and the nature of the charged misconduct:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted below that the agency removed him in reprisal for whistleblowing disclosures he made "repeatedly throughout 1988, 1989 and 1990." The appellant claimed that, as a result of observational inspections of sewage sludge barges, he found that persistent organic and inorganic floatables were being discharged into the ocean in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, and the ocean dumping permits issued by the agency. The appellant asserted that he informed the New York branch chief that most of these violations were occurring in New York State, but the branch chief told him that the branch had conducted its own inspections of sewage sludge dumping activities and found no floatables being discharged into the ocean. The appellant claimed that in 1993, the agency forced him to work for this same New York branch chief, who was now the New York section chief. He asserted that the New York section chief withheld his within-grade increase and proposed his 10-day suspension in 1995, and proposed his termination in 1996. The agency responded in opposition to the stay request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may request a stay of an effected personnel action allegedly based on whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(a), (c)(1); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.8(a). A stay request must contain, among other things, "[e]vidence and/or argument demonstrating that there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant will prevail on the merits of the appeal." 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.9(a)(6). The agency's response must similarly contain evidence and/or argument addressing whether there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant will prevail on the merits of the appeal, as well as evidence and/or argument addressing whether the grant of a stay would result in extreme hardship to the agency, and any documentation relevant to the agency's position on these issues. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1209.9(c)(2). The term "substantial" generally refers to "something worthwhile as distinguished from something without value or merely nominal." <span class="Italic">Gergick v. General Services Administration,</span> 43 MSPR 651, 658 (1990). It also means "of real worth and importance," "more than 'seeming or imaginary,'" and "not illusive," and "indicate[s] that which is serious as opposed to that which is trivial." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no dispute that the agency took a personnel action by removing the appellant. Further, there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant will be able to show that he had a reasonable belief that his disclosures evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation and/or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). In this regard, the appellant appears to have worked as a GS-12 Environmental Engineer for a number of years, and he claims that he observed, pursuant to his job-related inspections, the ocean discharges. <span class="Italic">Cf. Scott v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice,</span> 69 MSPR 211, 238 (1995) (the appellant's position as a supervisor and experience as a law enforcement officer placed him in a position to form a reasonable belief that a subordinate altered documentary evidence), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 99 F.3d 1160 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;To the extent that the appellant's disclosures could be interpreted as indirectly suggesting that the section chief was not doing his job, the disclosures were made to the alleged wrongdoer, rather than to persons who may have been in a position to act on and remedy them. This is not normally viewed as whistleblowing activity. <span class="Italic">See Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 282 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Criticism directed to the wrongdoers is not normally viewable as whistleblowing."); <span class="Italic">Woodford v. Department of the Army,</span> 75 MSPR 350, 359-60 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant has the burden of persuasion with respect to the stay request, the burden of going forward with evidence shifts to the agency if the appellant shows a substantial likelihood that his disclosures were a "contributing factor" in the personnel action. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">see Williams v. Department of Defense</span>, 45 MSPR 146, 148 (1990), <span class="Italic">rev'd on recons. on other grounds</span>, 46 MSPR 549 (1991). Thus, we must decide whether the appellant established that there is a substantial likelihood that his whistleblowing was a contributing factor in his removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not specifically address the "contributing factor" requirement in his stay request, other than questioning whether he would have been removed absent his 1988-90 actions. Nevertheless, an appellant may demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that the official taking the personnel action had actual or constructive knowledge of the disclosure and took the action within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the action. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Department of the Interior,</span> 74 MSPR 666, 672 (1997); <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 MSPR 104, 108 (1994). The appellant does not claim, let alone show, that the deciding official knew of the alleged protected disclosures when he removed the appellant. However, an appellant may establish imputed knowledge by demonstrating that an individual with actual knowledge of the disclosure influenced the official accused of taking a retaliatory action. <span class="Italic">See Marchese,</span> 65 MSPR at 108. The appellant may be able to show that the New York section chief, as the proposing official and an individual with purported actual knowledge of the disclosures, influenced the deciding official's decision to remove the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if imputed knowledge were established, however, the timing of the <span id="Page_4050"></span>action, which was proposed on May 17, 1996, and effected on August 2, 1996, is not such that a reasonable person would immediately conclude that the disclosures, which were made six to eight years earlier in 1988-90, were a contributing factor in the removal. Although the appellant alleges that he did not come under the supervision of the eventual New York section chief until 1993, the notice of proposed removal would still have been issued approximately three years after the section chief had an opportunity to retaliate. While the appellant may yet be able to establish on the merits, the contributing factor element of his case, we find that he has not shown at this stage a substantial likelihood that he will prevail on this issue<span class="Italic">. See Jones,</span> 74 MSPR at 677-78 (the "<span class="Italic">per se</span>" knowledge/timing test did not apply where, among other things, two years had elapsed between the time the appellant made his protected disclosures and his disputed performance appraisal); <span class="Italic">McDaid v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 422-23 (1990) (where the appellant's disclosure occurred in February 1988, and his suspension occurred in December 1989, the Board held that a reasonable person would not be likely to conclude that the disclosure was a factor in the decision to suspend), <span class="Italic">disagreed with on other grounds by Clark v. Department of the Army</span>, 997 F.2d 1466 (1993), <span class="Italic">overruled by statute as</span> <span class="Italic">stated in Horton v. Department of the Navy,</span> 66 F.3d 279, 284 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the appellant demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the contributing factor issue, under 5 USC &#x00A7; 1221(e)(2), the Board may not order corrective action "if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure." In making this determination, the Board generally considers the strength of the agency's evidence in support of its personnel action; the existence and strength of any motive to retaliate on the part of the agency officials involved in the decision; and any evidence that the agency takes similar actions against employees who are not whistleblowers but who are otherwise similarly situated. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott,</span> 69 MSPR at 240.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency has already presented ample documentary evidence in support of its charges of insubordination. Such misconduct, if sustained, is serious. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Jackson v. Small Business Administration</span>, 40 MSPR 137, 146 (1989) (insubordination is a serious offense which undermines the capacity of management to maintain employee efficiency and discipline). The agency had previously suspended the appellant for ten days based on similar misconduct, thus providing some justification for a more severe penalty if a second offense is proven (the agency's table of penalties calls for a five-day suspension to removal for a second offense of insubordination). Moreover, we discern no motive on the part of the New York section chief to retaliate against the appellant, and the appellant has not suggested any such motive. The section chief was not the subject of the appellant's whistleblowing. Rather, the disclosures related to apparent wrongdoing on the part of those in charge of the sewage barges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, while the appellant has presented argument in support of his whistleblower defense, he has not shown a substantial likelihood that he will prevail.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Stays requested by OSC are discussed below. The statutory authority for a stay at the behest of OSC is 5 USC 1214(b), requiring that the Board grant a stay for 45 days unless the Board, acting through one of its members, determines that a stay would not be appropriate. OSC normally receives a stay when it requests one. Most agencies agree to an initial stay requested by OSC on the assumption that if the stay is not given, OSC will obtain the stay from the Board. For appellants seeking stays on their own behalf under 5 USC 1221(c), the Board allows a stay, following a response by the agency, but there is no statutory, presumptive grant. Stay applications by individuals are essentially mini-adjudications conducted in a compressed timeframe. The system is administered in a way that makes it much easier for OSC to obtain a stay than for an individual to obtain a stay.</p>
