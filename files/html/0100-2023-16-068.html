<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-67"><span class="space">f.</span> Impossibility of Improvement; Unreasonable Expectations</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The PIP may be structured so rigidly that an employee cannot improve his or her performance, particularly if but one error results in failure with no possibility of improvement. This is somewhat similar to the use of an absolute performance standard, although it is not the standard that is challenged, but the ability to improve under the standard as it is applied during the PIP. The facts described in <span class="Italic">Carrion v. VA</span>, SF-0432-13-1460-I-1 (NP 12/29/2014), resulted in the agency's loss of the performance action:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that, as an EES, the appellant conducted fact finding inquiries into EEO allegations, serving as an EEO counselor (counselor). Specifically, once an individual initiates the EEO complaint process by contacting a counselor, the complaint is assigned to an individual counselor who advises the individual of his or her right to pursue the EEO allegations, including, as applicable, the right to timely file a mixed case with the Board. The counselor then attempts to resolve the complaint through alternative dispute resolution (ADR) or other options. If the individual opts to file a formal EEO complaint, then the EES must accurately identify the claims raised by the individual, identify the responding management officials, summarize and document any resolution attempts, and assemble the counselor's report. Timeliness and accurate documentation are paramount throughout the process because the agency and its EES employees must comply with the timelines set forth in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) regulations as well as the EEOC Management Directive (MD). Inaccurate or incomplete reports will delay the processing of the complaint and/or cause the EEO office to incorrectly dismiss or accept issues, hindering the individual's ability to pursue his or her claim through the EEO process.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the PIP memorandum notified the appellant that he had performed unacceptably in two Critical Elements (CE) of the EES position, specifically in Counseling (CE-1) and in Administrative File (CE-2). The memorandum addressed the appellant's performance in the following sub-elements: quality of the counseling and report; quality for ADR participation; timeliness of initial contacts; properly maintaining administrative files; and accurately populating the Complaint Automated Trading System (CATS) entries with data and documents. The rating system applicable to the appellant's EES position was three-tiered, rating each CE as Exceptional, Fully Successful, or Less Than Fully Successful, with Fully Successful being the minimally acceptable level of performance. The PIP notice informed the appellant that, in order to achieve a Fully Successful rating for CE-1, no more than 4 percent of reviewed cases should involve instances where the written reports do not accurately reflect the claimed bases and management responses; ADR participation should be within 9 percent of the field office or the Office of Resolution Management average; and 90 percent of initial interviews must be conducted within 2 business days of the initial contact. As to CE-2, no more than 4 percent of reviewed files should be incomplete or different in content compared to the CATS data entries.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency issued the appellant a notice of proposed removal on June 28, 2013, stating that he had failed to meet the counseling and administrative file elements of the PIP. The notice specified that under CE-1, three of the reports, 1207, 2083, and 2298, "required substantial review and were returned" to the appellant. The proposal notice stated that 1207 was returned for clarification of the EEO basis; 2083 was returned twice for further identification of the EEO basis and "to ensure that data was accurately reflected in" the appellant's CATS entry; and 2298 required further review to capture a second claim. The proposal notice explained that no more than 4 percent of reviewed reports should have had issues with articulation of claims, bases, and management responses; however, 20 percent of the reviewed reports did not accurately reflect an appropriate articulation of the claims or bases. Regarding CE-2 and citing Note 5, the proposal notice explained that the appellant twice failed to enter the notice of right to file dates into CATS for reports; as a consequence, approximately 13 percent of his "cases contained data that was incomplete or different than the content in CATS." The proposal notice stated that the appellant had been advised through Note 3 "to pay closer attention to CATS" data entry.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's response to the proposal notice did not dispute that he had made the errors, but he argued that he was not counseled during the PIP for any serious performance issues, and that he was given "verbal passes" by Ms. Strub at all evaluation points within the PIP. The agency sustained the proposed removal. On appeal, the appellant did not dispute the factual assertions. However, he asserted that his PIP reviews did not sufficiently note any CE failures and he stated that he had been told that he had passed the PIP.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that, on their face, the performance standards for the CEs are both realistic and attainable, and that the appellant committed the errors as set forth in the proposal notice. However, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to show that the appellant was given a reasonable opportunity to improve. Specifically, the administrative judge considered the PIP review notes and found that the record did not show that the PIP directly assisted the appellant in improving the subordinate elements of the CEs identified by the agency in its proposal notice or that he was given regular assistance with identifying and addressing his deficiencies. The administrative judge found further that, based on the application of the 4 percent error formula to the 15 reports the appellant submitted, the appellant could not demonstrate improvement when a single error had already exceeded the 4 percent margin of error. Thus, the administrative judge did not sustain the charge of unacceptable performance....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In performance-based actions taken under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4303, the <span id="Page_2937"></span>opportunity to improve is a substantive right. The agency must prove by substantial evidence that such an opportunity was afforded. <span class="Italic">Adorador v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 38 M.S.P.R. 461, 464 (1988). Further, in <span class="Italic">Zang v. Defense Investigative Service</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 155, 157 (1985), the Board noted that an employee's right to a meaningful opportunity to improve is one of the most important substantive rights in the entire chapter 43 performance appraisal framework.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency reasserts that the appellant was counseled about his performance during the PIP and that it provided him with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. For instance, the agency asserts that the appellant was informed that "he should pay closer attention to updating CATS[,] specifically the dates the aggrieved [party] accepts or declines [ADR], [as] both of these elements are monitored." The agency also asserts that the appellant was informed that one counselor report that he submitted to management was being returned to him for more information so that a "third party can understand the document without additional context."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the agency's arguments on review concerning the administrative judge's weighing of the evidence; however, the applicable law and the record evidence support the administrative judge's findings that the agency failed to show by preponderant evidence that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance for CE-1 and CE-2. Thus, we discern no reason to reweigh the evidence or substitute our assessment of the record evidence for that of the administrative judge. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997) (finding no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings when the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions); <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987) (same).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Specifically, the administrative judge thoroughly analyzed the PIP notes and found that, while the proposal notice identifies that several reports were returned for corrections, the record fails to reflect that the PIP focused on these mistakes and provided any assistance or direction, even while the appellant provided one report for a third submission. For instance, the administrative judge noted that, while one report states that the appellant should pay closer attention to initial interview dates in CATS, it specified that none of the submitted reports required any major modifications and that all were timely submitted. The administrative judge found that the first three PIP meeting notes did not indicate that the appellant was failing to capture the claims or bases for the EEO complaints, nor did they state that the appellant might exceed the maximum rate for incomplete or differing CATS entries as specified in the proposal notice. The administrative judge found further that Note 4 specifically states that the appellant was continuing to take timely actions in his work and it did not raise any quality concerns, adding that the appellant showed marked improvement. The administrative judge found that, while Note 5 states that report 1207 was returned for more information and two other unspecified reports were returned because the notice of right to file dates were not captured in CATS, no other specific data entry concerns were raised and Ms. Strub noted the appellant's otherwise marked improvements and fully successful performance. Finally, regarding Note 6, the administrative judge found that, while it indicated that report 2083 was returned twice for more information and correction of the basis, it too states that the appellant's work was timely and that he was otherwise continuing to improve. In addition, the administrative judge found that, while Notes 5 and 6 indicated that reports 1207 and 2083 were returned for corrections and the appellant was provided the opportunity to resubmit the reports, there is nothing in the record to describe the agency's efforts to address and assist the appellant with identifying and correcting the deficiencies in those reports. Thus, while the agency's proposal notice relied on reports 1207 and 2083 as evidence of the appellant's unacceptable performance in CE-1, the administrative judge found little evidence that the appellant was assisted with these deficiencies during the PIP period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative judge found that, once the errors in reports 1207 and 2083 were identified and returned, it was unclear how the appellant could have demonstrated improved performance because the acceptable error rates were already exceeded. Specifically, the administrative judge found that CE-1 of the PIP was based on 4 percent of the number of cases the appellant submitted, and, by the time the appellant learned of his first report deficiency as specified in Note 5, he already would have exceeded the 4 percent standard set forth under CE-1 for quality based solely on the fact that the identification of this first error alone would have caused the appellant to fail the first CE with a 6.67 percent error rate. Thus, based on the aggregate count of the cases evaluated, the appellant would have exceeded the 4 percent margin for error with a single error even if he made no similar errors. The administrative judge concluded that, under the reasoning and the method of the PIP involving 15 reports, it was unclear how the appellant was afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance with respect to the relevant quality sub-element within CE-1 when the first identification of an error resulted in the failure of this CE. Thus, the administrative judge found that the agency failed to show by substantial evidence that it afforded the appellant a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance for CE-1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the administrative judge found that, concerning CE-2, by the time the appellant was first informed that a notice of right-to-file field in CATS was not properly entered, he had had already exceeded the 4 percent standard set forth under CE-2 for quality. The identification of this first error alone would have caused the appellant to fail the CE-2 with a 6.67 percent incomplete rate, even if he made no other similar errors.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the agency challenges the administrative judge's determination that, by the time the appellant's errors were first identified, the acceptable rates were exceeded. The agency argues that the appellant knew that his error rates were based on the number of case counselor reports he submitted and that the agency could not control his error rate "other than to extend his PIP period until he submitted at least 26 counselor reports" which, as the administrative judge found, was a number that would allow the appellant room to make an error in a case without failing his PIP. The agency argues that, because the only controlling factor was the number of counselor reports that the appellant submitted during the PIP, the appellant could have made more than one error if he had submitted more counselor reports during the PIP period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the Performance Plan for the position of EES, GS-9, explicitly states that, "[a]t the entry level, counselor trainees may be assigned and expected to manage a monthly inventory of 6 to 8 counseling events. One mediation session will be credited as a counseling episode." The counseling quality element does not specify or require an EES, GS-9, non-counselor trainee to submit a specific number of cases monthly, nor does it identify the monthly inventory. Thus, even if the appellant, who had been in the EES GS-9 position for roughly 6 months when placed on a PIP, had submitted the high end of the expected number of monthly inventory for a counselor trainee, i.e., 8 counseling events, he still would not have submitted enough cases to allow him room to make more than one error. Thus, we find no merit to the agency's argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, while the agency contends that the administrative judge implied that the agency's standards were absolute because a single incident of poor performance would result in an unsatisfactory rating on a critical element, we disagree. Rather, the administrative judge found that, while "on its face the performance standards for the CEs are both realistic and attainable," here, the application of the 4 percent margin of error to 15 counseling events during a 90-day period precluded the appellant from being afforded a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate acceptable performance. While the agency disagrees with the administrative judge's findings in this regard, we find that the administrative judge thoroughly addressed the record evidence, as well as the hearing testimony, which support his findings. Thus, because the agency has failed to prove by substantial evidence that the appellant received the statutorily required meaningful opportunity to improve, we conclude that the administrative judge correctly reversed the appellant's removal. <span class="Italic">Cf. Zang</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. at 157 (chapter 43 demotion could not be sustained for the agency's failure to give the employee sufficient opportunity to improve, in light of evidence that counseling sessions given to the employee by her supervisor were often disparaging in nature, did not produce guidance or advice on how to improve, and were not used to warn her of the possibility of an impending performance-based action).</p>
