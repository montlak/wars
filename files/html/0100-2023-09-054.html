<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-53"><span class="space">2.</span> Waiver of Time Limit for Appeal; <span class="Italic"><span class="Bold">Alonzo</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">We start with 5 CFR 1201.12 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Revocation, amendment, or waiver of rules</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may revoke, amend, or waive any of these regulations. A judge may, for good cause shown, waive a Board regulation unless a statute requires application of the regulation. The judge must give notice of the waiver to all parties, but is not required to give the parties an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next, under 5 CFR 1201.22 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Timeliness of appeals</span>. If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's deadline for filing an adverse or performance-based action appeal is regulatory, not statutory. Other actions, e.g. VEOA, IRA, may have statutory appellate deadlines. The underlying action must be traced to any associated statute to determine if the appeal to the Board is governed by a statutory or regulatory time period.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board advised litigants in <span class="Italic">Speker v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 380, 385 (1990), that grounds for waiver of deadlines are limited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are only three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or administrative regulation. First, the statute or regulation may itself specify certain circumstances in which the time limit will be waived. E.g., 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.114(f) (the Board will waive the time limit for filing a petition for review for good cause shown)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude it from enforcing an otherwise applicable rule under the doctrine of equitable estoppel. <span class="Italic">See Richmond v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 862 F.2d 294, 299-300 (Fed. Cir. 1988), cert. granted, __ U.S. __, 110 S. Ct. 46, 107 L. Ed.2d 15 (1989). That doctrine has no applicability here, since the appellant has not alleged that OPM affirmatively misled her as to the filing deadline, only that OPM failed to notify her of her right to elect an alternative annuity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, an agency's failure to provide a notice of election rights and the filing deadline as required by statute or regulation may warrant a waiver of the filing deadline. <span class="Italic">See Harris v. Office of</span> <span class="Italic">Personnel Management,</span> 888 F.2d 121, 124 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (waiving the one-year time limit for electing a survivor annuity); <span class="Italic">Davies v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 5 MSPB 251, 5 MSPR 199, 203 (1981) (same)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wutke v. OPM</span>, 67 MSPR 523, 528 (1995), updated <span class="Italic">Speker</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are three bases for waiving a filing deadline prescribed by statute or regulation: (i) The statute or regulation may provide for a waiver under specified circumstances; (ii) an agency's affirmative misconduct may preclude enforcement of the deadline under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, at least where such estoppel would not result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute; and (iii) an agency's failure to provide a notice of rights and the applicable filing deadline may warrant a waiver of the deadline, if statute or regulation requires that such notice be given. <span class="Italic">See Speker v. OPM</span>, 45 MSPR 380, 385 (1990) (setting forth the three bases), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 928 F.2d 410 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (Table); <span class="Italic">see also Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond</span>, 496 U.S. 414, 110 S. Ct. 2465, 110 L. Ed.2d 387 (1990) (the government cannot be equitably estopped from enforcing a statutory requirement if such estoppel would result in the expenditure of appropriated funds in contravention of statute); <span class="Italic">Fox v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's seminal case on good cause for waiver of the regulatory appeal period was issued in 1980, <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALONZO_DA075209013_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253126.pdf">4 MSPR 180</a>, 184 &#x0026; n.1, 4 MSPB 262 (1980), involving what was then a 20-day period for an appeal. Balancing what the Board believed to be strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and the need for finality in personnel actions, the Board listed various factors material to a determination of whether the appeal period should be waived: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the appellant's notification, or other awareness, of the time limit; (3) the existence of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant affecting his ability to comply with the time limits; (4) the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent; (5) circumstances showing that any neglect involved was excusable neglect, considering the conduct of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances; (6) a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune (that could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence or human prudence or foresight); and (7) the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency resulting from waiver of the time limit (whether the agency's ability to defend the case has been impaired considering the document disposal schedules, the availability of employees with knowledge of the action, or other management considerations mitigating against the adjudication the agency reasonably has considered closed). The Board determined that without a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing, an employee's reasonable excuse for the delay should be accepted by the AJ; the appellant need not show an utter impossibility to timely appeal. It is sufficient to show that the delay was excusable in light of the particular facts and attending circumstances if diligence or ordinary prudence was exercised:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Excusable neglect must be based on more than mere forgetfulness. It may be shown if the neglectful behavior is such as might be expected on the part of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 MSPR at 183-85:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board must consider the competing interests involved in deciding when the 20-day time limit should be extended. There are strong policy considerations that employees be given a hearing on the merits of their cases and that they be ensured a fair opportunity to secure from the Board an independent review of agency action. On the other hand, the Board also recognizes that there is a need for finality in personnel actions. In its analysis of the changes in appeals procedures created by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Senate observed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The changes protect the right of employees, recognized by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Arnett v. Kennedy,</span> 416 U.S. 134, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 40 L. Ed.2d 15 (1974), to a full and fair consideration of their case. At the same time, they are intended to give agencies greater ability to remove or discipline expeditiously employees who engage in misconduct, or whose work performance is unacceptable. (S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 51 (1978)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with OPM (which filed a brief as intervenor) that the time limit affords a system that expedites the administrative resolution of employee appeals and ensures basic fairness. In short, "good cause" is an elastic concept, <span class="Italic">see Dinko v. Wall,</span> 531 F.2d 68 at 75 (2nd Cir. 1976). It entitles the employee to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations include no specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown for waiving the time limitation on the filing of an appeal. Section 1201.12 of the Board's regulations gives the presiding official wide discretion in determining whether a sufficient basis has been shown by an appellant which warrants a waiver of the time limitation. The presiding official must exercise his judgment in determining whether there has been an articulation or presentation of facts reasonably excusing the failure to file a timely appeal. The particular circumstances of each case must govern the determination of the presiding official. Nonetheless, factors for consideration by a presiding official in deciding whether to waive the 20-day limitation should include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: the length of the delay; whether appellant was notified of the time limit or was otherwise aware of it; the existence of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant which affected his ability to comply with the time limits; the degree to <span id="Page_931"></span>which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent; circumstances which show that any neglect involved is excusable neglect;[1] a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune;[2] and the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency which would result from waiver of the time limit.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Excusable neglect must be based on more than mere forgetfulness. It may be shown if the neglectful behavior is such as might be expected on the part of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;This can be defined as that which could not have been prevented by the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence or human prudence or foresight.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The presiding official should take into account whether the agency's ability to defend its action has been impaired by the failure of the appellant to appeal in a timely fashion. Such matters as the disposal schedule for pertinent documentation and the availability of employees with knowledge of the action are factors to be considered. Likewise, there may be legitimate management considerations mitigating against undertaking the adjudication of a case which the agency reasonably has considered closed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay, such excuse should be accepted by the presiding official, absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing. The appellant need not show an utter impossibility, but only that the delay was excusable in light of the particular facts and attending circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence has been exercised.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying the aforementioned factors and the varying circumstances of each case to be weighed by the presiding official, we shall now consider the explanations offered by the appellants.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Generally, we believe that in cases such as these, any doubt about whether good cause has been shown should be resolved in favor of an appellant. In determining whether the agency was unduly prejudiced by the delay, we have balanced the equities involved, weighing the difficulties of the agency against the benefit to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See Shiffler v. Schlesinger,</span> 548 F.2d 96 (3rd Cir. 1977); <span class="Italic">Organizations United for Ecology v. Bell,</span> 446 F. Supp. 535 (1978). In the cases of Alonzo and Russell, the scale is tipped in their favor; the delays were excusable in light of their brevity and extenuating circumstances. On the other hand, the evidence in the Coefield case simply does not support a finding that for three months appellant was unable to file an appeal. The Board is unable to find that the presiding official abused his discretion in not finding "good cause" to waive the filing deadline in that case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Alonzo</span> was in large part approved by the Federal Circuit in <span class="italic">Walls v. MSPB</span>, 29 F.3d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1994), involving an appeal dismissed as late because the Board concluded that Mr. Walls unjustifiably interpreted as "working" rather than "calendar" days the notice from his agency of his right to appeal his removal within twenty days. The court decided that the Board incorrectly failed to waive the deadline for the appeal. Part of the discussion related to the ambiguity in the reference to "days," and part of the decision relied on other circumstances advanced by Walls to support waiver and the lack of evidence by the agency of prejudice incurred through acceptance of the appeal, if it was belated, by the Board. <span class="italic">Walls</span> noted earlier Federal Circuit decisions that accepted or relied on the Board's <span class="italic">Alonzo</span> analysis, 29 F.3d at 1582-84:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has acknowledged that its "regulations include no specific criteria for determining when good cause has been shown for waiving the time limitation on the filing of an appeal." <span class="italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). Furthermore, the Board has also noted that policy considerations counsel against dismissals for untimely filing and militate for providing employees with a hearing on the merits of their appeals, <span class="italic">id</span>., 4 M.S.P.R. at 183 (citing S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 24, 51 (1978), <span class="italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2746, 2773), and that "broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience" should be applied in good cause determinations, <span class="italic">id</span>. 4 M.S.P.R. at 184. "If the employee gives a reasonable excuse for the delay, such excuse should be accepted by the presiding official, absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing." <span class="italic">Id</span>. Finally, the Board has identified the following factors, not necessarily all-inclusive, that should be considered by the AJ in determining whether a good cause waiver of the filing deadline should be granted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the length of the delay; whether appellant was notified of the time limit or was otherwise aware of it; the existence of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant which affected his ability to comply with the time limits; the degree to which negligence by the appellant has been shown to be present or absent; circumstances which show that any neglect involved is excusable neglect; a showing of unavoidable casualty or misfortune; and the extent and nature of the prejudice to the agency which would result from waiver of the time limit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="italic">Id</span>. (footnotes omitted). "Excusable neglect" is neglect that a reasonably prudent person might manifest under the circumstances. <span class="italic">Id</span>. n.1. "Unavoidable casualty or misfortune" is not preventable by "the exercise of reasonable skill and diligence or human prudence or foresight." <span class="italic">Id</span>. n.2. "Prejudice to the agency" relates to the agency's inability to adequately and effectively defend its action because of appellant's untimely filing. <span class="italic">Id</span>. n.3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We previously have recognized the efficacy of the <span class="italic">Alonzo</span> factors in good cause determinations by the Board. <span class="italic">See Yuni v. Merit Systems Protection Bd</span>., 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (holding that good cause waiver was appropriate because petitioner demonstrated due diligence in filing within twenty days of a dispositive Board decision in a related case); <span class="italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 813-14 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (holding that good cause waiver was appropriate because the agency's "threat of retaliation by criminal prosecution for the exercise of petitioner's legal right to appeal was a reasonable excuse for not meeting the regulatory time limit."). Therefore, we will utilize these factors in analyzing the AJ's denial of the good cause waiver in the case before us.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In rendering the Board's initial decision, the AJ truncated his analysis of the "length of delay" factor by asserting that "regardless of how minimal the delay, [the Board] will not waive its timeliness regulations in the absence of a showing that there is good cause for the appeal being filed untimely." No further discussion of the minimal nature--only two days--of Walls's filing delay is found. Both <span class="italic">Alonzo</span> and our precedent instruct that the AJ should consider "length of delay" in every good cause determination, not that the AJ should summarily dismiss the minimal nature of the delay in his preliminary inquiry leading to that determination. In <span class="italic">Anderson v. Department of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532 (Fed. Cir. 1993), we concluded that "[r]elevant to th[e good cause] determination is...the length of delay." <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 534. Furthermore, we held that, "[i]n view of the minimal [one-day] delay," among other considerations, a good cause waiver of the subsection 1201.22(b) filing deadline was warranted. <span class="italic">Id</span>. at 535. Similarly, in this case, we find that the minimal nature of Walls's filing delay is a consideration in his favor; it indicates not only an absence of negligence on part of petitioner but also that he demonstrated due diligence and ordinary prudence in filing the appeal within the regulatory time period as construed by him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response to the AJ's finding that the Agency provided adequate notice to petitioner of the time limits for appealing to the Board, petitioner asserts that the "within twenty (20) days" notice provided in the Agency's decision letter was not effective notice--notwithstanding inclusion of a sample filing period calculation within the Board regulations attached to the letter--because "days," absent further qualification, is subject to reasonable misinterpretation and because petitioner, proceeding <span class="italic">pro se</span>, was not directed to the sample calculation amidst twenty-six pages of rules and regulations "[a]ttached for [petitioner's] reference." We agree. In filing his appeal of an agency removal action, we do "not expect a <span class="italic">pro se</span> litigant to be made to jump through a confusing array of procedural hoops." <span class="italic">Mendoza</span>, 966 F.2d at 653. Furthermore, we note that the Board itself, ostensibly in an effort to provide unambiguous notice of the applicable filing period for appeals of its initial decisions as set forth in 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.114(d) (1993), requires that the "date upon which the decision will become final" be contained in the initial decision rather than a mere reference to the thirty-five day filing period. <span class="italic">Id</span>. Sec. 1201.111(b)(5). Also, final decisions of the Board notify appellants that they have "30 calendar days" to appeal the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A number of civil service agencies have followed the Board's lead in providing unambiguous notice, in decision letters to petitioners, of "twenty calendar days" as the time period for appealing agency actions to the Board. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Anderson v. Department of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532, 533 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Federal Bureau of Prisons); <span class="italic">Miller v. Department of the Army</span>, 987 F.2d 1552, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (U.S. Army Reserve); <span class="italic">Huey v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Servs</span>., 782 F.2d 1575, 1576 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (Social Security Administration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon petitioner's showing of good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal, waiver of the filing deadline is appropriate, <span class="italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184; 5 C.F.R. Secs. 1201.12, .22(c) (1993), "absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay in filing," <span class="italic">Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184; <span class="italic">see Ceja</span>, 710 F.2d at 814. Because petitioner has shown good cause for his untimely filing and because the Agency has made no showing of substantial prejudice flowing from the two-day filing delay, we hold that the AJ abused his discretion by not waiving the filing deadline for good cause.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Walls</span> cited <span class="italic">Yuni v. MSPB</span>, 784 F.2d 381, 384 (Fed. Cir. 1986), also approving the <span class="italic">Alonzo</span> analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Once more we seek to apply the wisdom expressed by the MSPB in <span class="italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 MSPB 262, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 183-84 (1980): "'good cause' is an elastic concept...[which] entitles the employee <span id="Page_932"></span>to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience." In <span class="italic">Ceja v. United States</span>, 710 F.2d 812, 814 (Fed.

Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Sec. 1201.12, "[a] presiding official may waive a Board regulation in an individual case for good cause shown if application of the regulation is not required by statute."</p>

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Moorman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 68 MSPR 60 (1995), summarized <span class="italic">Walls and clarified Alonzo</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In weighing whether the appellant has shown good cause for the untimely filing of his appeal pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c), we look first to <span class="italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980), which stated that the time limits therein should serve both to expedite the administrative resolution of employee appeals and to ensure basic fairness. "Good cause" is an elastic concept, the Board stated in <span class="italic">Alonzo</span>, which "entitles the employee to the application of the broad equitable principles of justice and good conscience." <span class="italic">id</span>. at 18. In light of <span class="italic">Walls</span>, we now clarify some of the boundaries of good cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instructed by <span class="italic">Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582, we note that the administrative judge should consider length of delay in every good cause determination.[2] We then look to the reasonableness of the appellant's excuse and his showing of due diligence. <span class="italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184. Finally, we look to see whether the appellant is proceeding <span class="italic">pro se</span>, <span class="italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control which affected his ability to comply with the time limits, <span class="italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 184, or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to file a timely petition for appeal. <span class="italic">See id</span>.; <span class="italic">See also Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1583. Only then, if good cause has been demonstrated, do we determine whether the agency has shown that it would be prejudiced by a waiver of the time limit. <span class="italic">Womack v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 798 F.2d 453, 456 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;We note that the court focused on the "truncated analysis" of the "length of delay" factor, by citing the administrative judge's assertion that "regardless of how minimal the delay, [the Board] will not waive its timeliness regulations in the absence of a showing that there is good cause for the appeal being filed untimely." <span class="italic">See Walls</span>, 29 F.3d at 1582.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's appeal was untimely by three days. The excuses he proffered do not demonstrate good cause for three days' delay, in light of the notice provided by the FAD, and absent any other reasons.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;We note, in addition, that the appellant was represented by counsel (an attorney) in this matter.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Alonzo</span> and its descendants were summarized, with reference to the significance (or lack of significance) of involvement of appellant's counsel in a timeliness determination, in <span class="italic">Watson v. GSA</span>, DC-0752-16-0549-I-1 (NP 6/13/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As described in the initial decision, the appellant was removed from his Building Manager position for medical inability to perform the duties of his position, effective March 29, 2016. On March 25, 2016, the agency delivered a copy of its decision letter to the rehabilitation facility where the appellant was living.[3] The appellant filed a Board appeal of his removal on April 29, 2016.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The agency also attempted to deliver copies of its decision letter to the appellant's address of record and his attorney's address on March 25, 2016. However, the appellant's attorney did not receive the decision letter until March 30, 2016, when the agency emailed her a copy.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely filed. The administrative judge issued a timeliness order informing the appellant that his appeal may be untimely filed, apprising him of his burden regarding timeliness, and ordering him to file evidence and argument on the timeliness issue. The appellant, through his attorney, responded that his appeal was timely filed because he did not receive notice of his removal until March 30, 2016, when his attorney informed him of the agency's decision. The appellant explained that, although the decision letter was delivered on March 25, 2016, he did not "actually receive" it because he is blind and delivery was made only to the reception desk of the rehabilitation facility where he was living. He further argued that his limited ability to receive, open, and read mailings due to his blindness constitutes good cause for any delay in filing. To support his arguments, the appellant submitted an affidavit of his attorney, copies of a billing form and receipt for a mailing, the agency's email message to his attorney, and an unopened envelope that was mailed to the appellant by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without holding the requested hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision dismissing the appeal as untimely filed without good cause shown. Specifically, the administrative judge found that the appellant's appeal was filed 1-day late because he received the agency's decision on March 25, 2016, his removal was effective March 29, 2016, and he filed his appeal on April 29, 2016. The administrative judge further found that the appellant did not establish good cause to waive the filing time limit because his refusal to collect and open his mail failed to demonstrate ordinary prudence or due diligence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed above, the administrative judge found that the appellant's appeal was filed 1-day late. For the following reasons, we find that, even assuming that the appellant's appeal was untimely filed, the preponderance of the evidence shows that there is good cause to waive the filing time limit under the particular circumstances of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board may waive the time limit for filing an appeal if the appellant has shown good cause for the delay. <span class="italic">Smith</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 527, &#x00B6; 6; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(c). To establish good cause for the untimely filing of an appeal, a party must show that he exercised due diligence or ordinary prudence under the particular circumstances of the case. <span class="italic">Alonzo v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. 180, 184 (1980). To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his appeal. <span class="italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, we find that the fact that the appellant is represented by an attorney is outweighed by the other <span class="italic">Moorman</span> factors. In particular, the length of the 1-day delay is minimal; the appellant reasonably claimed as a blind individual that the reception desk received, but did not promptly forward to him, the agency's decision letter; and the record contains medical evidence of his permanent blindness, which impaired his ability to collect, open, and read the agency's decision letter. <span class="italic">See Adams v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 541, &#x00B6; 12 (2005) (finding that the appellant's submission of medical evidence showing that she suffered from depression and anxiety, and the minimal length of the 1-day delay in filing her petition for review, were factors in favor of finding good cause for the delay); <span class="italic">Coleman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 266, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (2001) (finding that the appellant's claim of stress-related depression, substantiated in part by medical evidence, and the minimal length of the 1-day delay in filing her appeal, were factors in favor of finding good cause for the delay); <span class="italic">see also Lacy v. Department of the Navy</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 434, 437 (1998) (establishing that the Board will find good cause to waive its filing time limits when a party demonstrates that he suffered from an illness that affected his ability to file on time by identifying the time period during which he suffered from the illness, submitting medical evidence showing that he suffered from the alleged illness during that time period, and explaining how the illness prevented him from timely filing his appeal or a request for an extension of time). Thus, we find that, under the particular circumstances of this case, the appellant exercised due diligence in filing his appeal and the principles of justice and good conscience weigh in favor of finding good cause for waiving the filing time limit. <span class="italic">See Alonzo</span>, 4 M.S.P.R. at 183-84 (explaining that "good cause" is an elastic concept that entitles an employee to the application of broad equitable principles).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency has presented no evidence or argument suggesting that it would be prejudiced by a waiver of the filing time limit. <span class="italic">See Moorman</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. at 63 (explaining that, once good cause has been demonstrated, the Board must determine whether the agency has shown that it would be prejudiced by a waiver of the time limit).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we reverse the initial decision and waive the filing time limit for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Good cause for waving the time to file an appeal may exist if enforcement of the regulation is impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. The strict enforcement of a procedural regulation may be waived if the procedural violation is minor and the other party has not shown harm by the failure to follow the regulation in question. <span class="Italic">Frazier v. DMA</span>, 4 MSPR 202, 4 MSPB 281 (1980). <span class="Italic">Frazier</span> waived a filing a day late. The appellant stated she had not received documents she felt were necessary to prosecute her appeal; the agency could show no prejudice through the short delay. The Board excused an appeal that was untimely by four days when "[t]he agency has not alleged, nor does the record reflect, that it was prejudiced by the short delay in filing." <span class="Italic">Alonzo v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/ALONZO_DA075209013_OPINION_AND_ORDER_253126.pdf">4 MSPR 180</a>, 185, 4 MSPB 262 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ceja v.
