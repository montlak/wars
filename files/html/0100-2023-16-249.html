<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-249"><span class="space">4.</span> Removal of Officers, Members</h4>
<p class="noindent">Internal union discipline was explored in <span class="Italic">AFGE and Hanlon</span>, 29 FLRA 1359, 1363-66 (1987). Mr. Hanlon was accused by AFGE of defecting from AFGE and organizing on behalf of NTEU. AFGE filed internal charges against him and amended those charges to state that Hanlon filed ULP charges against agencies to facilitate his ability to organize on for NTEU. After Mr. Hanlon's AFGE membership was suspended, he filed ULP charges against AFGE. Sustaining the resulting complaint, FLRA determined that the membership suspension was, in part, a result of Hanlon's resort to ULP procedures:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that under section 7116(c) of the Statute, a labor organization may discipline its members pursuant to procedures contained in its constitution or bylaws. In most cases, that discipline is not and should not be reviewed by the Authority. Contrary to the Union's position, however, the Union's ability to enforce discipline is not unlimited. Indeed, section 7116(c) itself recognizes that a union's actions must be consistent with the Statute. Accordingly, the Union's assertions that its actions were necessary to defend against "treasonous activity" are not dispositive of this case. Rather, our inquiry here is whether the proposal concerning Hanlon's filing of unfair labor practice charges resulted in unlawful restraint, interference or coercion....&#8197;We do not here pass on any of the other allegations of disloyalty contained in the Union's charges, nor will we review the final Union action in relation to the other charges.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well established that the filing of unfair labor practice charges is a protected right of employees under section 7102 of the Statute and that a union may not threaten or discipline a member because the member has filed unfair labor practice charges....&#8197;To threaten to discipline a member for the exercise of a right the member has under section 7102 is inconsistent with section 7102 and, therefore, beyond the legitimate interests of a union to regulate its internal affairs.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that it was not Hanlon's filing of the charges <span class="Italic">per se</span> which formed a basis for its disciplinary action against him, but, rather, the disloyal conduct that was disclosed by the filing. The Union asserts that its Vice President was not questioning Hanlon's right to file charges, but was trying to show that Hanlon was filing charges to facilitate his goal of ousting AFGE and replacing it with NTEU, an act that allegedly was inconsistent with his membership in the Union. However, we find that whatever the Union's subjective reasons or motivation may have been for including Hanlon's filing of unfair labor practices as a basis for the disciplinary action, such reasons or motives are not controlling or significant in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...We...disagree with the Judge's conclusion that the Union's threat to expel Hanlon for filing unfair labor practice charges was an appropriate defense measure under the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The <span class="Italic">Tawas Tube</span> doctrine [151 NLRB 46 (1965)] provides that a union may expel a member for filing a decertification petition because such a petition represents an attack on the very existence of the union....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n the private sector the <span class="Italic">Tawas Tube</span> doctrine is strictly limited to decertification petition situations and does not permit union discipline of members for filing ULP charges, even where a charge reasonably may be interpreted as a threat to the existence of the union. <span class="Italic">Cannery Workers Union (Van Camp Sea Food Co.</span>), 159 NLRB 843 (1966).</p>
<p class="noindent">As to FLRA's jurisdiction over aspects of internal union discipline, alluded to in <span class="Italic">Hanlon</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the FLRA ALJ’s opinion reviewed the Statute and the NLRA. Reference was made to the jurisdiction of FLRA and the Department of Labor over standards of conduct cases in <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-66 and Confer</span>, 17 FLRA 796, 813-14 (1985) (ALJ Decision):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Pursuant to &#x00A7; 20 of the Statute, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Management Relations has exclusive jurisdiction over Standards of Conduct, including safeguards against improper disciplinary actions and proceedings for enforcement of standards of conduct, except where the action does not concern an internal union matter but touches a part of the public domain covered by the Statute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Where, as here, union discipline is imposed, in whole or in part, because a member has invoked the procedures of the Statute, it does not concern an internal union matter, subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Assistant Secretary, but touches a part of the public domain covered by the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">Before the <span class="Italic">Hanlon</span> litigation, FLRA determined that although a union may not remove one of its stewards for testifying on behalf of management in a ULP hearing, it may remove the steward for attempting to solicit representation by a rival union--activity inconsistent with the steward's representative role and unprotected under the Act. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1920 and DOD, Dept. of Army, Hq. III Corps</span>, 16 FLRA 464, 477-78 (1984) (ALJ Decision). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 and VAMC, Salisbury</span>, 19 FLRA 520 (1985), <span class="Italic">rev'd and remanded,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 v. FLRA</span>, 806 F.2d 1105 (D.C. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">on remand,</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1738 and VAMC, Salisbury</span>, 29 FLRA 178 (1987) (discussed in preceding section as to effect of internal union discipline that may affect employee's ability to perform agency work).</p>
<p class="noindent">A union violates &#x00A7; 7116(b)(1) by expelling a member because he filed or caused other employees to file ULP charges against the union. Reinstatement in the union and rescission of a trial board decision ordering expulsion was directed as a remedy. <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R5-66 and Confer</span>, 17 FLRA 796, 796 (1985); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R1-32 and Bouchard</span>, 54 FLRA 349, 353 (1998) (ALJ Decision) (union commits ULP by suspending union officer who filed ULP charge). In <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1857 and Crawford</span>, 44 FLRA 959, 966-67 (1992), the union removed a steward who was believed to have caused another employee to file a duty of fair representation ULP charge against the union. FLRA, determining that the union committed a ULP by removing the steward, ordered her reinstated. Although the union had another reason for removing the steward, part of a package of charges leading to removal of the steward, FLRA concluded that testimony as to what action "would" have been taken if a separate vote had been conducted on each charge was "speculative and irrelevant."</p>
<p class="noindent">Synthesizing the law as to discipline of union members, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2419 and Powers</span>, 53 FLRA 835, 841-47 (1997), resolved that: a union may discipline an employee when an employee's actions threaten or attack the union's existence as an institution; a union may not discipline an employee for merely filing unfair labor practice charges; the union may not take actions against an employee that affect his or her status as an employee; and without a threat to its continued existence, a union may not discipline an employee for criticism of its management or policies:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint in this case charged Local 2419 with disciplining Powers for exercising his section 7102 rights.&#x2003;As a result, the Judge correctly concluded that the Authority properly exercises jurisdiction over the allegation that Local 2419 committed a ULP. The Judge's determination in this regard is in accord with the wording of the Statute and with Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The authority of a labor organization to enforce discipline is subject to the requirement that the discipline be "consistent with the provisions of this chapter." 5 USC 7116(c). When a complaint alleges that disciplinary action is inconsistent with a provision of Chapter 71, in this case section 7102, and no other provision of law is alleged to supersede the Statute, then the Authority has jurisdiction, pursuant to section 7116(b)(1) and (8), to resolve the matter.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has previously exercised jurisdiction where a labor organization disciplined an employee for engaging in activity alleged to be protected under Section 7102. <span class="Italic">See AFGE</span>, <span class="Italic">AFL-CIO</span>, 29 FLRA at 1363. On the other hand, the Authority has specifically recognized that the ASLMR has "exclusive jurisdiction over Standards of Conduct, including safeguards against improper disciplinary actions" involving internal union matters. <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R5-66</span>, 17 FLRA 796, 813 (1985) (<span class="Italic">Local R5-66</span>). As a result, where a complaint wholly involved internal union affairs,[9] the Authority has declined to exercise jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Local 2000</span>, 17 FLRA at 738-39.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Local 2000</span>, the employee was expelled from union membership for, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, being insubordinate at union meetings, failing to perform her duties as Secretary-Treasurer, failing to refund certain dues to members, etc. 8 FLRA at 736-37.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the complaint alleges a violation of section 7102 rights and the Authority properly exercises jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel is incorrect in asserting that a union may not deny membership for any reason other than those stated in section 7116(c)(1) and (2). Such a construction is at odds with the wording of section 7116(c) and with Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The General Counsel's interpretation--that a union may not deny membership for any reason other than the two noted in section 7116(c)(1) and (2)--ignores the final proviso in the section: "[t]his subsection does not preclude any labor organization from enforcing discipline in accordance with procedures under its constitution or bylaws [.]" If, as the General Counsel argues, the only bases for denying membership are failing to meet occupational standards and failing to tender dues, the proviso, which permits a labor organization to "enforce discipline," would be rendered meaningless. Discipline, in this context can only be interpreted to encompass denying membership or expulsion, as no other potential union disciplinary action (e.g. removal from a steward position) is even remotely threatened by the limitations on denying membership established in the subsection. Indeed, the proviso rebuts the very argument that the General Counsel makes in this case. Thus, a union can enforce discipline that denies membership for reasons unrelated to occupational standards and dues.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1516"></span>Moreover, the Authority has previously affirmed a Judge's decision recognizing "that a labor organization may impose discipline, <span class="Italic">including expulsion</span>, for reasons other than the failure to tender dues, when internal affairs of the union plainly are involved." <span class="Italic">Local R5-66</span>, 17 FLRA at 813 (emphasis supplied). <span class="Italic">See also Warner Robbins</span>, 46 FLRA 1048; <span class="Italic">Local 2344</span>, 45 FLRA at 1011.[11]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[11]&#x2003;Additionally, in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 98 and Nedra Bradley</span>, 53 FLRA 364 (1997), the Authority dismissed a complaint alleging, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a violation of section 7116(c) where a union's discipline of an employee included a five year suspension from membership. In that case, however, it was not asserted, as it is here, that section 7116(c) precludes a union from expelling a member except for the specific reasons set out in the section.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue in this case is the question of when a union may discipline an employee, pursuant to section 7116(c), for words or actions that are asserted to be both protected and potentially detrimental to an exclusive representative's status. Given the General Counsel's contention that the Judge improperly relied on certain Authority precedent addressing this issue, and because this case pits important individual rights against significant union institutional interests, we take this opportunity to review how the Statute deals with an employee's right to engage in protected activity <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> a union's right to enforce discipline against its members.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In examining this question, we begin our analysis with the wording of the Statute. Thereafter, we examine comparable provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) similarly assuring employees the right to engage in protected activity and unions the right to discipline. After considering how these provisions of the NLRA have been interpreted, we examine how similar provisions of the Statute have been construed by the Authority. We then briefly review the interrelationship under the Statute between employee protected activity, on the one hand, and the union right to enforce discipline, on the other. Finally, we consider whether the union's disciplinary action in this case violated the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Various provisions in the Statute recognize an employee's right to engage in certain activities and assure that employees will be protected in this regard. Specifically, section 7102 of the Statute recognizes an employee's "right to form, join, or assist any labor organization, or to refrain from any such activity, freely and without fear of penalty or reprisal, and each employee shall be protected in the exercise of such right." Additionally, the Statute prohibits both agencies and unions from interfering with this right, via sections 7116(a)(1) and (b)(1), respectively.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he Statute also recognizes the right of a labor organization to enforce discipline. However, pursuant to section 7116(c), this right must be exercised consistently with other provisions of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provisions in the NLRA, securing an employee's right to engage in protected activity and to be free from restraint in this respect, mirror analogous provisions in the Statute. Specifically, the NLRA's section 7 employee rights to "form, join, or assist labor organizations...and [to] refrain from any or all of such activities" parallel similar rights in section 7102. Section 8(b)(1) of the NLRA, which bans restraint or coercion of employees exercising section 7 rights, is analogous to a similar prohibition in section 7116(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Both laws also grant a union the right to enforce discipline against its members.&#x2003;The NLRA acknowledges this right via the proviso to section 8(b)(1) which recognizes "the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition and retention of membership." As noted above, the Statute confirms this prerogative through section 7116(c)'s notation that a labor organization can enforce discipline.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the similarity between the relevant provisions in the Statute and the NLRA, we briefly review how both laws have been interpreted. Because the NLRA predates the Statute, and its relevant provisions on this issue have been subjected to notable judicial review, we began by examining precedent interpreting the NLRA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The United States Supreme Court and the National Labor Relations Board (Board) have long recognized a union's right, under certain circumstances, to discipline members who engage in activities that are asserted to be protected under section 7 of the NLRA. For example, in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing</span>. <span class="Italic">Co.</span>, 388 U.S. 175 (1967), the Court upheld the Board's determination that a union did not violate the NLRA by imposing fines on members for crossing picket lines. Recognizing that under a literal reading of the NLRA the fined employees were being restrained or coerced for exercising their right to refrain from protected activity, the Court nevertheless concluded that an incumbent union needs the power to "protect against erosion [of] its status...through reasonable discipline of members who violate rules and regulations governing membership<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 187. Similarly, the Board has concluded that it was not unlawful for a union to expel members who filed a decertification petition, reasoning that such actions "attack the very existence of the union as an institution[.]" <span class="Italic">Tawas Tube Products, Inc.</span>, 151 NLRB 46, 48 (1965) (<span class="Italic">Tawas Tube</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the other hand, a union's right to discipline for activity asserted to be protected is not boundless. For example, a union may not expel a member for filing an unfair labor practice charge with the Board. <span class="Italic">Local 138, International Union</span> <span class="Italic">of Operating Engineers, (Charles S. Skura</span>), 148 NLRB 679 (1964); <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America</span>, 391 U.S. 418 (1968). Nor may a union discipline for statements critical of union leadership if an employee is not attempting to destroy or threaten the existence of the union<span class="Italic">. Black v. Ryder/P.I.E. Nationwide, Inc.</span>, 970 F.2d 1461, 1469 (6th Cir. 1992). Additionally, the Board has noted that even where disciplinary action is permissible, it must be limited to the employee's membership status and not affect the employee's job interests or employment relationship. <span class="Italic">Tawas Tube</span>, 151 NLRB at 47; <span class="Italic">Boilermakers</span>, 312 NLRB 218 (1993). Assuming no impairment of the employee's status as an employee, the Board does not pass judgment on the penalties a union imposes. <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Boeing Co.</span>, 412 U.S. 67, 76, 77 (1973), <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Local 283, UAW</span>, 145 NLRB 1097, 1104 (1964).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has also recognized that certain activities, asserted to be protected, can be the subject of union discipline under the Statute. In <span class="Italic">Local 1920</span>, a union steward was found note to have been engaged in protected activity when he discussed bringing in another labor organization with the agency's personnel office and with other employees. As a result, the union had a right to enforce discipline against the individual, 16 FLRA at 477-78. In addition, the Authority has expressed its agreement with the NLRB that a labor organization is entitled to "expel a member for filing a decertification petition because it represents an attack on the very existence of the union." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 29 FLRA at 1361, citing <span class="Italic">Tawas Tube</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Like the NLRB, however, the Authority has acknowledged that a "[u]nion's ability to enforce discipline is not unlimited" and "a union may not threaten or discipline a member because the member has filed unfair labor practice charges." <span class="Italic">AFGE, AFL-CIO</span>, 29 FLRA at 1363, citing <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees R5-66</span>, 17 FLRA 796 (1985) and <span class="Italic">Overseas Education Association</span>, 15 FLRA 488 (1984); <span class="Italic">see also AFGE, Local 1857</span>, 44 FLRA at 968 (union violated Statute by disciplining a steward who assisted another employee in filing a ULP charge against the union). Also in accord with the NLRB, the Authority has found a violation of the Statute where employee words or actions amounted to mere criticism of union officials and the discipline for engaging in protected activity affected the employee's status as an employee<span class="Italic">. Local 3475</span>, 45 FLRA at 549-51 (union violated Statute by attempting to have agency discipline an employee for allegedly using non-work time to prepare and distribute materials critical of local officials); <span class="Italic">OEA</span>, 11 FLRA at 378, 387 (union violated Statute by requesting agency to discipline an employee for distributing an open letter critical of the local president).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we find that the Authority, NLRB, and judicial precedent, interpreting an employee's right to engage in protected activity and a union's right to discipline, is harmonious and consistent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For clarification purposes, we articulate, in the context of this case, the principles that guide our interpretation of these provisions of the Statute. A union may discipline an employee when an employee's actions threaten or attack the union's existence as an institution. However, in accordance with previous Authority precedent: (1) a union may neither discipline an employee for merely filing unfair labor practice charges, nor (2) take actions against an employee that affect his or her status as an employee; additionally, (3) absent a threat to its continued existence, a union may not discipline an employee for mere criticism of its management or policies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having examined the arguments raised by the parties in this case, we see no reason to deviate from established precedent interpreting these provisions of the Statute. We emphasize, however, that in light of the inherent tension between these important individual and institutional statutory rights, future cases will be evaluated on their specific facts and the arguments presented by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On consideration of the employee's actions in this case, we conclude that Local 2419's discipline did not violate the Statute. Powers attended a meeting of bargaining unit employees held for the purpose of discussing the dissolution of Local 2419. Powers publicly announced at the meeting that he favored getting rid of Local 2419, asserted that he would favor another union over Local 2419, and signed a paper reflecting his dissatisfaction with Local 2419. These actions went beyond mere criticism of Local 2419 or its officials and threatened Local 2419's <span id="page_1517"></span>existence as an institution. As a result, Local 2419 properly exercised its statutory right to discipline Powers in a manner that did not affect his status as an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that Powers actions fell short of the filing of a decertification petition.&#x2003;However, we agree with the NLRB's determination "that there is no significant distinction between conduct directed toward decertifying a union and conduct directed toward replacing the incumbent union with another union; the difference being only one of form." <span class="Italic">Tri-Rivers Marine Engineers</span> <span class="Italic">Union</span>, 189 NLRB 838, 839 (1971).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the General Counsel's arguments, we find no inconsistency between the Judge's determination in this case and prior Authority precedent. The <span class="Italic">OEA</span> and <span class="Italic">Local 1920</span> cases involved unions attempting to have the agency discipline employees for mere criticism of the union and the discipline involved would have affected the individuals' employment status. The potential chilling effect on other employees, which served as a basis for the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1857</span>, involved union discipline of an employee for filing ULP charges. None of these circumstances are present in the case before us. Finding that Local 2419's actions did not affect Power's status as an employee, we do not pass judgment on the penalty of expulsion imposed by Local 2419 in this case.</p>
