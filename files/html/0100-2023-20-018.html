<h5 class="h5" id="sec13-19"><span class="space">f.</span> Disclosure Made During Normal Course of Duties</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2012 Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act amendments changed the degree of protection for otherwise covered disclosures made in the course of an employee's normal duties. 5 USC 2302 was amended to state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(f)(1) A disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) because--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(A)&#x2003; the disclosure was made to a supervisor or to a person who participated in an activity that the employee or applicant reasonably believed to be covered by subsection (b)(8)(A)(i) and (ii);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(B)&#x2003; the disclosure revealed information that had been previously disclosed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(C)&#x2003; of the employee's or applicant's motive for making the disclosure;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(D)&#x2003; the disclosure was not made in writing;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(E)&#x2003; the disclosure was made while the employee was off duty;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(F)&#x2003; the disclosure was made before the date on which the individual was appointed or applied for appointment to a position; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(G)&#x2003; of the amount of time which has passed since the occurrence of the events described in the disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(2)&#x2003;If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the principal job function of whom is to regularly investigate and disclose wrongdoing (referred to in this paragraph as the "disclosing employee"), the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) if the disclosing employee demonstrates that an employee who has the authority to take, direct other individuals to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to the disclosing employee in reprisal for the disclosure made by the disclosing employee.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Addressing the retroactive effect of portions of the WPEA, <span class="Italic">Day v. DHS</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/DAY_THOMAS_F_DC_1221_12_0528_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_WITH_CONCURRING_AND_DISSENTING_OPINION_836324.pdf">119 MSPR 589</a>, 2013 MSPB 49 (2013) (Member Robbins concurring in part and dissenting in part), concluded that this expanded definition of the term "disclosure" properly applied to cases pending at the time of the WPEA's enactment. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Schoenig v. DOJ</span>, 120 MSPR 318, 2013 MSPB 85 (2013) (following the result in <span class="Italic">Day</span>); <span class="Italic">Coulter v. Dept. of Navy</span>, SF-1221-12-0271-W-1 (NP 8/21/2013) ("The Board has found that these provisions constituted a clarification of existing law and applied retroactively. <span class="Italic">Day</span>, 2013 MSPB 49, &#x00B6; 26. Therefore, the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's safety disclosures were not protected because they were made in the course of the appellant's normal duties and through normal channels, although consistent with Federal Circuit precedent at the time of the initial decision, is no longer viable."). [Refer to Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-061.html#sec17-59">Retroactivity</a>," for <span class="Italic">Day</span>.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Benton-Flores v. DOD</span>, 121 MSPR 428, 436-37 &#x00B6; 15, 2014 MSPB 60 (2014), mentioned the evidentiary burden on appellants whose complaint of reprisal results from disclosures in the normal course of their duties, although <span class="Italic">Flores</span> did not provide a structured analysis of how that burden differed from the ordinary evidentiary burden on a whistleblower:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we note that the appellant's disclosures likely were made within the course of her normal duties. Thus, another issue that the administrative judge may need to address on remand is the altered evidentiary burden for appellants who have made disclosures in the normal course of duties. Specifically, Congress stated in the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465, that disclosures made in the normal course of duties are not excluded from protection under section 2302(b)(8), which prohibits retaliation "because of" any protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). However, Congress also added the following language:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If a disclosure is made during the normal course of duties of an employee, the disclosure shall not be excluded from subsection (b)(8) if any employee who has authority to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any personnel action with respect to the employee making the disclosure, took, failed to take, or threatened to take or fail to take a personnel action with respect to that employee <span class="Italic">in reprisal for the disclosure</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(f)(2) (emphasis added). In explaining this new provision in the Act, the Senate Report stated that disclosures made in the course of one's duties are protected only if the employee also proves that the agency took the personnel action with an improper retaliatory motive. S. Rep. No. 112-155, 5-6, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 2012 U.S.C.C.A.N. 589, 593-94. Accordingly, when an appellant has made a protected disclosure in the normal course of her duties, the statute now requires her to prove that the personnel action taken was in retaliation for the disclosure. On remand, the administrative judge should determine whether this additional evidentiary burden is applicable because the appellant made the disclosures during the normal course of her duties.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Described below is the law that evolved before the 2012 amendments.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3647"></span><span class="Italic">In re Tariela</span>, 1 MSPR 119, 1 MSPB 116 (1979), considered a petition by OSC to stop the reassignment of two VA employees who reported waste and mismanagement to officials within the VA and also to a U.S. Senator. The Board raised but did not decide whether an employee who makes disclosures of waste or mismanagement within the chain of command can be considered a whistleblower within the meaning of 5 USC 2302(b)(8). The legislative history of the 1994 amendments to the Whistleblower Protection Act made it clear that internal disclosures were protected. S. Rep. 103-358, 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3558-59, explained of Pub. L. 103-424:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Committee has heard allegations that OSC has taken the position that statements criticizing agency practices through normal agency channels or within the chain of command are not "protected disclosures" under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Office of Special Counsel expressly denied those allegations in response to pre-hearing questions from Senator Levin, stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The OSC does not take the position that an otherwise protected disclosure of information loses that protection because the disclosure was made through normal agency channels or within the chain of command.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Committee applauds this statement and reaffirms the plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act, which covers, by its terms "any disclosure," of violations of law, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for "any disclosure," regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was subsequently decided that although information gained and disclosed through ordinary work channels may not be entitled to protection, disclosure of that information, although consistent with the appellant's duties, qualifies for protection if the disclosure is outside normal supervisory channels, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (remanding for further consideration, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. OPM</span>, 92 MSPR 429 (2002)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The government argues that reports of misconduct by petitioner here were part of his normal duties. The government relies principally on <span class="Italic">Willis [Willis v. USDA</span>, 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998)], where the employee made several claims of protected disclosures. As for the first alleged disclosure in <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, as noted above, we held that a complaint made to the employee's supervisor about the supervisor's own conduct could not be a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1143. Willis also alleged that his finding that several farms were out of compliance with Department of Agriculture approved conservation plans was a protected disclosure under the WPA. As for this alleged disclosure, we held that Willis's mere performance of his "required everyday job responsibilities" was not a protected disclosure under the WPA, because Willis "cannot be said to have risked his personal job security by merely performing his required duties." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1144. We noted that all government employees are expected to perform their required everyday job responsibilities "pursuant to the fiduciary obligation which every employee owes to his employer." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly our jurisprudence on the normal duties question has not always been clear, and it is possible to find conflicting statements in <span class="Italic">dictum</span> concerning the normal duties issue.[3] However, in <span class="Italic">Willis</span> we specifically held that an employee who makes disclosures as part of his normal duties cannot claim the protection of the WPA. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1144.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;In addition to <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, <span class="Italic">see Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (holding that disclosures "made as part of an employee's duties," may be protected by the Act, but stating that "the employee may nevertheless be disciplined for violating agency policy") and <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (stating that "[t]he WPA...applies to the situation where a government employee discusses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is important, however, to distinguish three quite different situations. First, there is the situation in which the employee has, as part of his normal duties, been assigned the task of investigating and reporting wrongdoing by government employees and, in fact, reports that wrongdoing through normal channels. A law enforcement officer whose duties include the investigation of crime by government employees and reporting the results of an assigned investigation to his immediate supervisor is a quintessential example. Employees of an inspector general's office may be in a similar position. <span class="Italic">Willis</span> holds that reporting in connection with assigned normal duties is not a protected disclosure covered by the Act. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. While the language of the Act is ambiguous as to whether normal duties reports are covered, the core purposes of the WPA are simply not implicated by such reporting. Extending the WPA's protections to such situations would be inconsistent with the WPA's recognition of the importance of fostering the performance of normal work obligations and subjecting employees to normal, non-retaliatory discipline.[4] <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 15 (1988) ("The Committee does not intend that employees who are poor performers escape sanction by manufacturing a claim of whistleblowing..."); S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 8, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730-31 ("Nor would the bill protect employees who claim to be whistle blowers in order to avoid adverse action based on inadequate performance."). While dictionary definitions of the term "disclosure" obviously provide little assistance in determining whether Congress intended normal duties to be covered by the WPA, it is appropriate for us to interpret the statute in light of its central purpose. <span class="Italic">See Crandon v. United States</span>, 494 U.S. 152, 158 (1990) (holding that, in order to fully understand the meaning of a statute, it is proper to look "not only to the particular statutory language, but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy"); <span class="Italic">Massachusetts v. Morash</span>, 490 U.S. 107, 115 (1989) (noting that "in expounding a statute, we [are] not...guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy") (brackets and ellipses in original) (quoting <span class="Italic">Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux</span>, 481 U.S. 41, 51 (1987)); <span class="Italic">Doyon Ltd. v. United States</span>, 214 F.3d 1309, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The framework established by the legislature for an employee to demonstrate that a disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel decision further supports our decision. Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221(e)(1), as amended in 1994, an "employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that--(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure; and (B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action." In a situation where the normal duties of the employee include investigation and reporting, the employer would by the very nature of the employment know of the report, because the employee reports to his employer, and, if there were a time proximity (the second factor), a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case would automatically be proven. Any discipline would be presumptively illegal under the WPA. We find it highly unlikely that Congress intended this result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no clear evidence in the legislative history of the WPA, apart from the history of the 1994 amendment discussed below, that the WPA was designed to trigger protection for performance of normal duties. The WPA was established to protect employees who go above and beyond the call of duty and report infractions of law that are hidden. The situations which Congress specifically covered in 1978 and 1989 were disclosures to the press or to Congress itself. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 12-13 (1988) (discussing disclosures to the media and Congress); S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-1272, at 131-132 (1978) (discussing disclosures to Congress); 95 Cong. Rec. H8473 (daily ed. Aug. 11, 1978) (statement of Rep. Schroeder) (discussing statements made to a congressional committee). As we previously stated in Willis, "the WPA is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good by disclosing abuses by government personnel." <span class="Italic">Willis</span>, 141 F.3d at 1144.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The Senate Report on the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 points out the difficulty in exposing government illegality, waste, and corruption unless someone speaks up, stating that: "[i]n the vast Federal bureaucracy it is not difficult to conceal wrongdoing provided no one summons the courage to disclose the truth." S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 8 (1978), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 USCCAN 2723, 2730.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner points to statements about the normal duties issue made during consideration of the 1994 amendments to the WPA. For example, the 1994 Senate Committee Report stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In response to post-hearing questions from Senator Pryor, OSC indicated that some administrative judges of the Merit Systems Protection Board may still not understand the law on this point. The OSC letter states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">I assume that this question is concerned with whether or not an employee can be considered a whistleblower when the employee, in the course of doing his job, passes along certain information to his regular supervisors; for example, a government auditor whose report shows a waste of funds turns in his report to his supervisor, who accepts it for routine processing. In this example the law is unclear whether the employee has made a protected disclosure. At least two administrative judges of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) have ruled that such activity is not protected whistleblowing. Nonetheless, the MSPB to the best of our knowledge has not yet issued a final decision on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">As indicated above, the plain language of the Whistleblower Protection Act extends to retaliation for "any disclosure," regardless of the setting of the disclosure, the form of the disclosure, or the person to whom the disclosure is made.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">S. Rep. No. 103-358, at 11 (1994), <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1994 USCCAN 3549, 3559.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, on the floor Representative McCloskey stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3648"></span><span class="Italic">A protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's job duties</span>, may concern policy or individual misconduct, and may be oral or written and to any audience inside or outside the agency, without restriction to time, place, motive, or context.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">140 Cong. Rec. H29353 (daily ed. Oct. 7, 1994) (statement of Rep. McCloskey) (emphasis added). But, as we have noted above, in 1994 the disclosure provisions were not amended. These post-enactment statements made in the legislative history of the 1994 amendment have no bearing on our determination of the legislative intent of the drafters of the 1978 and 1989 legislation. It is well-established that "the view of a later Congress cannot control the interpretation of an earlier enacted statute." <span class="Italic">O'Gilvie v. United States</span>, 519 U.S. 79, 90 (1996); <span class="Italic">United States v. Price</span>, 361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960) ("[t]he views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one."). The Supreme Court has specifically held that statements made in the context of a later amendment to a statute that does not amend the portion of the statute at issue in the case, "are in no sense part of the legislative history." <span class="Italic">Oscar Mayer &#x0026; Co. v. Evans</span>, 441 U.S. 750, 758 (1979) (stating that "[i]t is the intent of the Congress that enacted [the section] ...that controls") (brackets and ellipses in original) (<span class="Italic">quoting Teamsters v. United States</span>, 431 U.S. 324, 354 n.39 (1977)). Indeed, it could be viewed as significant that Congress in 1994 did not amend the language of section 2302 to address this issue, thus leaving the matter for judicial resolution under the existing language of the Act. Under the circumstances, we are convinced that <span class="Italic">Willis</span> was correctly decided on the issue of normal duties; and we turn to the other relevant categories.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, there is the situation in which an employee with such assigned investigatory responsibilities reports the wrongdoing outside of normal channels. An example is a law enforcement officer who is responsible for investigating crime by government employees who, feeling that the normal chain of command is unresponsive, reports wrongdoing outside of normal channels. This is clearly a disclosure protected by the Act, and the Act's core purposes are served by such a disclosure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, there is the situation in which the employee is obligated to report the wrongdoing, but such a report is not part of the employee's normal duties or the employee has not been assigned those duties.[6] The government argues here that the petitioner was obliged here to report all wrongdoing, without regard to his responsibility to investigate it, and that his reports of wrongdoing are not protected disclosures. We cannot accept the government's contention. A report may be a disclosure protected by the Act, though the employee can also be disciplined for failure to make the report. This is the holding of <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1995).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;For example, the regulations, 5 CFR &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(11), specifically require all employees to "disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear from the Board's decision whether the reports of May 22, 1998, and June 18, 1998, concerning the conduct of other employees fall into the first, second, or third categories. We remand to the Board for consideration of this issue under the appropriate standard, which we have articulated above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Noted in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> were several decisions of the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">Horton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 66 F.3d 279 (Fed. Cir. 1995), involved an appeal by an individual who claimed that reprisal caused his termination during probation and his nonselection for a position. Mr. Horton made comments to his supervisor that were critical of Mr. Horton's coworkers as well as of his supervisor. The court addressed whether disclosures to individuals involved in wrongdoing could constitute whistleblowing, but the court did not discuss in <span class="Italic">Horton</span> the question of whether disclosures were protected that were made as part of an employee's normal duties. The court's rationale was that criticism directed to wrongdoers does not further the purpose of the WPA to encourage disclosures to persons who may be in a position to act to remedy the wrongdoing, either directly through managerial authority, or indirectly through press disclosures. <span class="Italic">Horton</span> did not undercut the notion that whistleblowing could arise out of disclosures made in the course of one's duties if those disclosures were directed to individuals who could remedy the wrongdoing disclosed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Also mentioned in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> was <span class="Italic">Willis v. USDA</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1998), involving an employee who complained that adverse personnel actions occurred when he protested within the agency that program decisions he made as part of his job were improperly set aside upon higher-level agency review. Citing <span class="Italic">Horton's</span> conclusion that criticism directed to the wrongdoers themselves is not ordinarily considered whistleblowing, the court decided that complaints by Willis to his supervisors constituted no more than dissatisfaction with his superiors' decisions, a normal disagreement with supervisors over job-related activities. Willis, it was concluded, took no action to bring the issue to the attention of authorities in a position to correct fraudulent or illegal activity, and the disclosures by Willis did not lead his supervisors to believe that they might be subjected to discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he WPA is intended to protect government employees who risk their own personal job security for the advancement of the public good by disclosing abuses by government personnel. Part of Willis's job duties as a DC was to review the conservation compliance of farms within his area. In reporting some of them as being out of compliance, he did no more than carry out his required everyday job responsibilities. This is expected of all government employees pursuant to the fiduciary obligation which every employee owes to his employer. Willis cannot be said to have risked his personal job security by merely performing his required duties. Determining whether or not farms were out of compliance was part of his job performance and in no way did it place Willis at personal risk for the benefit of the public good and cannot itself constitute a protected disclosure under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The discussion in <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> 263 F.2d at 1352 &#x0026; n.3, concentrated on defining what disclosures would be considered to be part of an employee's normal duties and, therefore, unprotected by the WPA. Cited in footnote 3 of <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> was <span class="Italic">Watson v. DOJ</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1527-28, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1995), involving a border patrol agent who reported the misconduct of a coworker and of himself, who was disciplined as a result, and who, the court found, proved an undisputed affirmative defense of reprisal. The report of misconduct followed agency regulations requiring that the conduct be reported through supervisory channels. The question before the court was whether the agency proved that it would have taken the same action against Watson in the absence of whistleblowing reprisal. Whether a disclosure required as a part of an employee's duties could be protected under the WPA was not an issue identified or resolved by the court.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Footnote 3 of the <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> opinion referred to <span class="Italic">Marano v. DOJ</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (Fed. Cir. 1993). <span class="Italic">Marano</span> involved a challenge to a reassignment by an employee who reported poor management practices within his office, and who, as a result of the report, found himself and those reported geographically reassigned following investigation of the reported mismanagement. Although the question before the court was whether Marano's disclosure caused his reassignment, and not whether Marano's disclosure was part of his duties, the court recognized that employees may be under an obligation to report misconduct and that if a report is made it deserves WPA analysis:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA, however, also applies to the situation where a government employee discloses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities, such that structuring a remedy to the situation revealed in the disclosure could foreseeably affect the whistleblower. In the situation where the information disclosed is closely related to the whistleblower's duties, as evidenced by the facts of the present case, a tension exists between the WPA's protection of the individual and the government's need to act on the basis of the information revealed to remedy the disclosed wrongdoing. This tension is most troublesome when the government's corrective action would ensnare the whistleblower allegedly for reasons independent of the simple fact that the employee was the initial source of the information. In some of such cases, reasoning that the personnel action was grounded on bases "independent" of the actual protected disclosure could easily be used as a ruse to eviscerate the WPA's protection. In all such cases, the whistleblower who has done no wrong would have no incentive to improve government by making a protected disclosure. Indeed, if the whistleblowing employee who has done no wrong can be disciplined for having disclosed misgovernment of which he is not part, the employee surely will have no incentive to reveal his knowledge.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The question remained under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> of what constitutes "normal duties" for the purpose of distinguishing what <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> characterized as the unprotected report of the employee who, as part of his normal duties is assigned the investigation and reporting of wrongdoing by governmental employees and who reports that wrongdoing through normal channels and the apparently protected report of wrongdoing by an employee when that report is not part of the employee's normal duties or the employee has not been assigned those duties. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1352, 1354.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The first post-<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> decision concerning disclosures in the course of job duties was <span class="Italic">Comito v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge found that the appellant's disclosures were not protected because she was merely carrying out her job responsibilities when she reported her disclosures, the Board, as well as our reviewing court, have recognized that protected disclosures may be made as part of an employees duties. <span class="Italic">See Czarkowski v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 107 &#x00B6; 15 (2000); <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In this case, the record evidence shows that the appellant became aware of the problems in the Pacific Nations Programs and the billing irregularities associated with therapeutic radiology in the course of performing her responsibilities as the Supervisory Financial Administrator. However, the record further shows that reporting such problems and irregularities was not part of her normal duties, nor was she assigned such duties. <span class="Italic">See Huffman</span>, at 1350....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3649"></span><span class="Italic">Comito</span> was followed by <span class="Italic">Laberge v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 91 MSPR 585, 587-89 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-8 (2002), defining duties by reference to a position description:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essentially, the appellant alleged that his protected disclosures involved communications with the Command at Cutler regarding environmental compliance issues related to a project to strip and re-paint radio towers. Specifically, he alleged that his disclosures included the following: (1) informing the Command that it should have notified the Maine Department of Environmental Protection that it had discovered polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the soil surrounding the project site at which paint had been stripped from radio towers; (2) informing the Command that it should conduct further Environmental Assessments on the project's impact, after it discovered that the contractor performing the project could not fully contain the PCBs; and (3) suggesting that the Northern Division, Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) should conduct an Environmental Assessment of the project.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reports made as part of an employee's assigned normal job responsibilities, when made through normal channels, are not covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act. <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1351-55 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Here, although the appellant may have reasonably believed that he was disclosing violations of environmental laws or regulations, his actions were within the duties described in his position description. The appellant's position description stated, "The incumbent serves as the environmental and natural resources program manager to ensure NCTS Cutler's compliance with all Navy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Maine Department of Environmental Protection laws and regulations." The appellant's major duties and responsibilities included providing "authoritative guidance to the NCTS Cutler commanding officer, departments and remote activities on...the interpretation of environmental laws, regulations, standards, policies and directive concerning same." Under Factors 6 and 7 in his position description, the appellant's contacts included "other environmental engineers/specialists, government environmental officials, procurement personnel, subject matter experts, officials, activity commanding officers, [and] officials in the [Environmental Protection Agency] and high command authority." The purpose of those contacts was to explain the function of Cutler's environmental protection program "so as to be in compliance with all respective federal, state, local and inter-agency regulations, codes and permits...."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Admittedly, the Board has found protected a Supervisory Financial Administrator's disclosures of cost overruns in an agency program and unauthorized billing practices, even though the Administrator became aware of the problems while performing her responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Comito v. Department of the Army</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 58 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 3, 10 (2001). But in that case, reporting the problems was not part of her normal duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 10. Unlike the record in <span class="Italic">Comito</span>, the record here shows that reporting the type of problems that the appellant brought to the agency's attention was part of his normal, assigned duties. Thus, by advising the Command and NAVFAC of his concerns regarding the agency's compliance with federal and state environmental statutes and regulations in implementing the project to re-paint the radio towers, the appellant was merely performing his normal duties. That is, he was investigating and reporting wrongdoing as part of his normal duties through normal channels. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1352; <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139, 1144 (Fed. Cir. 1998).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Next decided was <span class="Italic">Poster v. VA</span>, 92 MSPR 501, 504 n.* (2002), an opinion characterized by the Board as nonprecedential, involving a VA psychiatrist who reported inadequate patient care and inefficiencies in the association between a medical center and its paired medical school. Of the aspect of the case involving the appellant's disclosures as part of his duties, the Board focused on assigned duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge did not address the parties arguments concerning whether the appellant's disclosures were protected under <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (an employee who does no more than carry out his everyday job responsibilities has not made protected disclosures). The question of whether an employee's disclosures that are part of or related to his job responsibilities may constitute protected whistleblowing was recently addressed in <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Assuming that the appellant was obligated to report any substandard medical care he observed, as the agency asserted below, we find that he made nonfrivolous allegations that his disclosures were nevertheless protected under the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>. Specifically, he asserted that he had never been assigned any responsibilities for reporting inadequate care for nursing home patients and that he also pursued this issue beyond his supervisory chain to higher-level officials. <span class="Italic">See Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1354 (a disclosure by an employee with assigned investigatory responsibilities outside normal channels is protected, and a disclosure by an employee who has an obligation to report wrongdoing, but not as part of their normal job duties, is also protected).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A position description was also relied on by the Board in <span class="Italic">Farrington v. Dept. of Transp</span>., <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/FARRINGTON_KIM_ANNE_AT_1221_09_0543_W_2_OPINION_AND_ORDER_736583.pdf">118 MSPR 331</a>, 336-37 &#x00B6; 9, 2012 MSPB 85 (2012), determining to be significant the assignment of duties rather than their frequency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge erroneously interpreted "normal duties" to include duties performed on a sporadic basis. The appellant contends that "normal duties" are duties performed on a day-to-day basis--not those duties performed sporadically or on a one-time occasion. We disagree. The Board and the court have consistently relied upon position descriptions to determine whether disclosures were made as part of an employee's normal duties. <span class="Italic">See Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 618 F.3d 1306, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2010); <span class="Italic">Sutton v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 4, &#x00B6; 11 n.6 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 97 Fed. Appx. 322 (2004); <span class="Italic">Comito v.

In making this determination, the frequency with which an employee is called upon to perform a stated duty has not been identified as a relevant consideration. Here, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's disclosures to the NTSB fall squarely within the her normal job duties; the appellant's position description states that aviation safety inspectors participate in cabin-safety-related investigations and accident investigations, and therefore, clearly contemplates her reporting investigative findings to the NTSB. Thus, the appellant's disclosures to the NTSB were made within her normal job duties within the normal channels of reporting, and therefore are not protected.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Grimes v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 96 MSPR 595, 597-99 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-11 (2004), implied that a position description is significant, but not determinative, when there is a dispute over what duties are considered normal, and therefore unprotected, disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant was employed as a Supervisory Police Chief, GS-12, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard (PNS) in New Hampshire. The agency suspended the appellant for 1 workday for the unauthorized distribution of government property. Additionally, the appellant was reassigned to a Property Disposal Specialist position with the Facilities Maintenance Department at PNS.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging that he was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, suspended for 1 workday, and reassigned because of his whistleblowing activity. After exhausting his administrative remedies with the OSC, the appellant filed an IRA appeal with the Board, again claiming that he was placed on administrative leave, suspended, and reassigned in retaliation for his whistleblower activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Without conducting a hearing as requested by the appellant, the administrative judge (AJ) dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Applying the test for Board IRA jurisdiction under<span class="Italic"> Sutton v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 4 &#x00B6; 6 (2003), citing <span class="Italic">Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and <span class="Italic">Rusin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12 (2002), the AJ found that the appellant had shown that he had exhausted his remedies before the OSC. Nevertheless, citing <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the AJ found that the appellant's alleged disclosure was made as part of his normal job duties and, therefore, it was not a disclosure protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review (PFR), the appellant challenges the AJ's dismissal of his IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The agency filed a response in opposition to the appellant's PFR. The appellant also filed a memorandum in support of his PFR. The agency filed a response in opposition to the appellant's memorandum.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC and makes non-frivolous allegations that he engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take, or threaten to take or fail to take, a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12; <span class="Italic">see also Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371-72. If an appellant establishes Board jurisdiction over an IRA appeal by exhausting his administrative remedies before the OSC and making the requisite non-frivolous allegations, he has a right to a hearing on the merits of his claim. <span class="Italic">Spencer v. Department of the Navy</span>, 327 F.3d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2003).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Applying this analysis, we find that the appellant has established the first element of the jurisdictional showing. As the AJ found, the appellant has exhausted his administrative remedies before the OSC. The next issue is whether the appellant has made non-frivolous allegations that his disclosure was protected under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). <span class="Italic">Rusin</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 298 &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA), disclosures made by employees in the normal performance of their duties cannot constitute <span id="Page_3650"></span>protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1352. The <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> court refined the parameters of the "normal duties" rule by setting forth three categories: (1) disclosures an employee makes as part of his normal duties through normal channels; (2) disclosures an employee makes as part of his normal assigned duties but outside of normal channels; and (3) disclosures an employee makes that are not part of his assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1352-54. The court held that categories 2 and 3 would constitute protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1354.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant explained in his OSC complaint that he received a briefing from Captain Shawn Burns of the PNS Police Department indicating that an agency employee, Nelson Hanson, was accepting gratuities and paying unauthorized overtime to workers under his supervision. Burns also reported that Hanson was being abusive to new employees by threatening that, if they crossed him, he would have their badges pulled. The appellant discussed the matter with the Security Director, Tom Marshall, and Marshall agreed that the matter should be taken outside of the police department because the criminal investigators who would normally handle such matters were personal friends of Hanson. At the appellant's request, PNS Legal Counsel James Fender initiated an investigation into the allegations against Hanson. Citing to <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, the AJ dismissed the appellant's appeal for lack for jurisdiction without providing him with a hearing, reasoning that the appellant's investigation was made as part of his normal job duties and, thus, did not amount to a protected disclosure. On PFR, the appellant argues that the fact that another department had to conduct the investigation was a change in the nature of his duties and responsibilities that specifically caused him to make a disclosure outside of normal channels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the appellant's position description, he was responsible for, among other things, supervising the conduct of initial and/or complete investigations of motor vehicle accidents involving both government and privately owned vehicles, as well as investigations of crimes committed within the Shipyard, tenant activities, and other patrolled areas. He also evaluated reports of police officers regarding violations of regulations, federal and state laws, etc., and he took action as was necessary to ensure that complete, accurate, comprehensive, and professional reports were forwarded to the appropriate personnel for disposition.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To avoid a conflict of interest, the appellant referred a report of employee misconduct to the agency's legal counsel for further inquiry. While the AJ concluded that the appellant was merely doing his job by referring the report to legal counsel, given the language of his position description, it is unclear whether such referral amounted to a disclosure outside of normal job channels. We deem it sufficient to raise a question of material fact that remains to be decided.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. USDA</span>, 97 MSPR 181, 185-86 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14 (2004), discounted the primacy of a position description. Evidence of duties would be weighed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As argued by the appellant, PFR at 4-7, <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001), does not preclude the Board from finding that he made a non-frivolous allegation. The AJ relied significantly on <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> and the appellant's position description in finding that the appellant's disclosures were not protected because they were made in the normal performance of his duties. As the AJ acknowledged, however, the appellant alleged that he reported wrongdoing outside of the normal channels and that such reporting was not part of his normal duties. For example, the appellant submitted a September 10, 2001 letter from the Department of the Treasury's Deputy Assistant Secretary William Schuerch to AID's PPC Assistant Administrator Patrick Cronin. The letter stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that the appellant's draft report to Congress--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;goes well beyond the reporting requirement, which calls upon AID to report on the implementation of its early warning system; (2) advances positions on sensitive issues that delve into areas well beyond AID's purview; and (3) makes unilateral policy recommendations, some of which could be quite controversial, that should not be presented in a public document without full U.S. Government approval and clearance by the new Administration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant submitted evidence that he had provided a copy of the draft report to NGOs. Under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, disclosures outside of normal channels and duties may constitute protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">see also Sutton v. Department of Justice</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 4 &#x00B6; 11 n.6 (2003).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 93 MSPR 38 (2002), postdated <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> and resulted from a remand decision from the pre-<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> decision, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. DHHS</span>, 87 MSPR 204 (2000), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that resolved disclosures by a facilities technical specialist to be protected even though they arose in the course of his duties. In the post-<span class="Italic">Huffman</span> decision, the Board again found the disclosures protected, but the Board considered the manner of disclosure to be determinative. Although the disclosures originated through the appellant's duties, the disclosures were ultimately made to the agency Inspector General, that is, outside the ordinary chain of command, 93 MSPR at 44-45 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-14:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether these disclosures are protected, however, it is also necessary to examine the context in which they were made, considering that the appellant's duties as a Facilities Technical Specialist required him to report suspected contract irregularities to agency authorities. In <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sought to clarify its position as to whether reports of misconduct are covered by the WPA if the disclosures are part of the employee's normal duties<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1352. The court found that, if an employee who is responsible for reporting wrongdoing goes outside of the chain of command because he feels that those officials are "unresponsive," his disclosures are protected<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1354. As an example of a disclosure "clearly" protected by the WPA, the court described a law enforcement officer responsible for investigating crime by government employees who, "feeling that the normal chain of command is unresponsive, reports wrongdoing outside of normal channels." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this regard, the court did not state or suggest that there was any requirement of an objective showing that a reasonable person would have believed it was necessary to proceed in such a fashion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, as noted, the appellant was obligated to report suspected contract irregularities. In fact, in the letter of admonishment the agency issued to him on May 15, 1995, the Branch Chief acknowledged the appellant's obligation to report activity violative of the law, but faulted him for not following proper reporting procedures. Specifically, the Branch Chief stated that the appellant had improperly shared information of alleged wrongdoing with the Inspector General (IG) rather than first sharing such information with his immediate supervisor and the Contracting Officer. Moreover, the record supports the appellant's claim that he made numerous complaints to his superiors, which he believed were ignored, before he went to the IG. Under the circumstances, we find that the appellant's action of filing complaints with the IG was analogous to the situation described above in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, and that, therefore, his disclosures were protected....</p>

Department of Commerce</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 204, &#x00B6; 5 n.1 (2010). As such, the appellant's claims cannot be fairly read as "conceding" that he was simply engaging in his duties as timekeeper in making the disclosures. On the contrary, the appellant stated that he was compelled to report the misconduct as a matter of his personal integrity, that he believed his supervisor's actions violated the agency's regulations and code of conduct (not the timekeeping procedures), and that the agency code of conduct required him to act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, the appellant's position description and the agency's memorandum regarding timekeeping responsibilities and procedures (guide) suggest that the timekeeper's role is generally ministerial. Indeed, the appellant's most arguably relevant duty is in section (j), which provides that the timekeeper will: "Monitor, in cooperation with certifying officials, the Pay Period Exceptions and Prior Pay Period Exceptions listing to ensure that all exceptions are resolved within two pay periods." However, on the current record, the purported misconduct the appellant reported--violations of the agency leave/attendance regulations and code of conduct and abusing authority to get paid for time not worked--cannot be fairly deemed mere clerical "exceptions" in the payroll system. <span class="Italic">See generally Herman v. Department of Justice</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 386, &#x00B6; 12 (2011) (the appellant's duties did not include reporting the illegal abuse of authority by supervisors); <span class="Italic">Lane v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 342, &#x00B6; 22 (2010) (there was no basis for concluding that the appellant's duties included reporting ethical violations).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The absence of a reporting duty in a position description, and the agency's position that the appellant, as part of his ordinary duties, had a responsibility to report wrongdoing in the course of an agency undercover operation, led the Federal Circuit to remand a case so the appellant could have a hearing in <span class="Italic">Kahn v. DOJ</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 1340-44 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (following remand, decision by the AJ and another appeal to the court, <span class="Italic">Kahn v. DOJ</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20100907158">618 F.3d 1306</a> (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ acknowledged that Mr. Kahn's job description confirmed that investigating the professional misconduct of Task Force agents, such as TFA Annis, did not form part of his normal duties. The AJ concluded, however, that Mr. Kahn's reports concerning Annis's use of the confidential source did not fall outside of his normal duties. The AJ reasoned that, in discussing Annis's use of the confidential source with his superiors, Mr. Kahn was engaged in the core purpose of his position as a Criminal Investigator GS-13, as set forth in his position description: "to plan and conduct highly complex criminal investigations primarily involving major violators in large-scale drug trafficking networks operating throughout several regions of the United States, nationwide or internationally." The AJ determined that Mr. Kahn's reports concerning Annis's activities with the confidential source related to an ongoing drug investigation. "This drug operation, and not any independent investigation into Mr. Annis'[s] professional misconduct, was the focus of [the] back and forth communications" between Mr. Kahn and his superiors, the AJ stated. For this reason, the AJ ruled that Mr. Kahn had failed to make non-frivolous allegations that he made a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). He therefore held that the Board lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Kahn's IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As already noted, the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal if the appellant has exhausted his or her administrative remedies before the OSC and makes non-frivolous allegations that (1) he or she engaged in whistleblowing activity by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) and (2) the disclosure was a contributing factor in the agency's decision to take or fail to take a personnel action as defined by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a). The standard for determining whether non-frivolous disclosures exist "is analogous to that for summary judgment." <span class="Italic">Dorrall v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 301 F.3d 1375, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2002), <span class="Italic">overruled on other grounds by Garcia v. Dep't of Homeland Sec.</span>, 437 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2006). "[t]he petitioner must show the existence of a material fact issue...to support Board jurisdiction. Non-frivolous allegations cannot be supported by unsubstantiated speculation in a pleading submitted by petitioner." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The determination of whether an allegation of jurisdiction is non-frivolous is made based entirely on the written record, and a hearing with respect to the existence of jurisdiction is unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Francisco v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 295 F.3d 1310, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 2002). If the employee successfully makes nonfrivolous allegations of jurisdiction, the Board then conducts a hearing on the merits. <span class="Italic">Yunus</span>, 242 F.3d at 1371; <span class="Italic">Spruill v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 978 F.2d 679, 687-88 (Fed. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The basis for the AJ's conclusion that Mr. Kahn had failed to make non-frivolous allegations that he had made protected disclosures under the WPA was his determination that Mr. Kahn's reports to his superiors were not outside of his normal job duties. According to the AJ, this was because, although it was not part of Mr. Kahn's duties to report wrongdoing of others, it was part of his duties to plan and conduct drug investigations, and it was in that context that he reported to his superiors about TFA Annis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We addressed the issue presented by this appeal in <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, we outlined three categories into which a disclosure may fall, only the latter two of which constitute disclosures that are protected under the WPA: (1) disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels, (2) disclosures as part of normal duties outside of normal channels, and (3) disclosures outside of normal duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1353-54. On appeal, Mr. Kahn contends that his reports concerning TFA Annis's use of the individual he (Annis) recruited as a confidential source fell into the third <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category. We explained in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> that this category involves the situation "in which the employee is obligated to report the wrongdoing, but such report is not part of the employee's normal duties or the employee has not been assigned those duties." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354. In making this statement, we noted: "For example, the regulations, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2635.101(b)(11), specifically require all employees to 'disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.'" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354 n.6. In other words, a disclosure comes within the third category of <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> if, although the employee, like all agency employees, is generally required to report wrongdoing that he or she sees, the disclosure is not part of the employee's assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3652"></span>Mr. Kahn argues that he made non-frivolous allegations that the reports he made to his superiors concerning TFA Annis came within <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category 3. In advancing this argument, Mr. Kahn relies primarily upon his December 6, 2006 affidavit. In his affidavit, Mr. Kahn outlined the chain of command at the Beaufort Office. In that regard, he stated that all of the agents in Beaufort reported directly to RAC Mitchell and that he (Mr. Kahn) and SA Meehan were co-equals in the office. Mr. Kahn stated that the ultimate decision to register a confidential source was made by either RAC Mitchell or ASAC Ozaluk. Mr. Kahn continued that he was not directly involved in the process of registering the confidential source at issue and that SA Meehan and TFA Annis did all of the paperwork to register the confidential source and then passed the paperwork to RAC Mitchell without any review or participation by him (Kahn). Thus, Mr. Kahn stated, "TFA Annis would have supervised [the confidential source] and controlled his undercover efforts." Mr. Kahn recounted that the confidential source "had been 'fronted' an ounce of crack cocaine by a target trafficker." Mr. Kahn stated that he told Annis that "neither he nor anyone else associated with DEA could properly take custody of such drugs because [the confidential source] had not yet been documented as a [confidential source by DEA]." After setting forth the ways in which Annis violated DEA regulations in his dealings with the confidential source, Mr. Kahn told of his reports to his superiors, RAC Mitchell and ASAC Ozaluk. He then stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although I believe that I, like all DEA Special Agents, am obligated to report misconduct if I am aware of it, that is not part of my normal duties with DEA. I have carefully reviewed the job description of the Special Agent position, and I see no reference to the reporting of misconduct committed by other agents or Task Force Officers. Rather, my job is to enforce the federal narcotics laws under Title 21 of the United States Code.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kahn contends that, because he made non-frivolous allegations of protected disclosures, the Board should have granted him a hearing on the merits of his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government responds that it was part of Mr. Kahn's assigned duties to report TFA Annis's alleged violations of DEA rules and regulations. The government notes that Mr. Kahn's duties explicitly included "[d]etermin[ing] the most effective manner for developing and carrying out investigations." In addition, the government points to the December 6, 2006 declaration of RAC Mitchell that was submitted to the Board. In his declaration, RAC Mitchell stated that "[b]ecause SA Kahn was the most senior Agent in such a small office, I designated him to report to me daily regarding administrative matters and ongoing law enforcement operations in...Beaufort.... SA Kahn called me every day to report what the office was doing administratively and operationally." RAC Mitchell noted that, during 2002, section 6622 of the DEA Special Agent's manual required that "'[e]ach undercover buy will be thoroughly planned by the immediate supervisor and all participating personnel'" and that "'[a]s much as possible, this planning will encompass all potential developments that could occur.'" Finally, RAC Mitchell stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Pursuant to the Special Agent's Manual requirements in effect in 2002, as well as the more general instructions I gave to SA Kahn to report daily administrative matters and operational activities of the Beaufort [Office] to me, SA Kahn was required, as part of his assigned job duties, to notify me at least verbally of TFO Annis'[s] proposed use of a confidential source...to purchase crack cocaine or for DEA to provide Official Authorized Funds to a target in a DEA Organized Crime Enforcement Task Force...investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the government maintains that the AJ did not err in his determination that Mr. Kahn's reporting of TFA Annis's activities relating to the confidential source did not fall outside of his normal duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The narrow issue before us is whether Mr. Kahn made non-frivolous allegations that his reports concerning TFA Annis's activities were not part of his normal duties, so that they came within <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category 3. The evidence of record on this point consists of Mr. Kahn's position description and two competing statements, Mr. Kahn's affidavit and RAC Mitchell's declaration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the Board, Mr. Kahn submitted an affidavit in which he alleged facts indicating that his reports concerning TFA Annis were not part of his normal duties. Specifically, Mr. Kahn acknowledged that, like all DEA agents, he was required to report wrongdoing of which he became aware. At the same time, however, he stated that the reporting of Annis's alleged violation of DEA rules and regulations was not part of his normal duties. He asserted that doing so went beyond his job responsibilities, contending that he had no supervisory responsibility over Annis, no involvement in the recruitment of the individual who became Annis's confidential source, and no specific job duty to ferret out and report misconduct of co-employees. The government relies upon the declaration of RAC Mitchell. In his declaration, RAC Mitchell stated that he designated Mr. Kahn to report to him daily regarding administrative matters and law enforcement operations at the Beaufort Office. Presumably, such reporting would have included Mr. Kahn's communications concerning Annis, thereby bringing those communications within the scope of Mr. Kahn's normal duties. In our view, although this is a close case, the combination of Mr. Kahn's job description and the competing sworn statements of Mr. Kahn and RAC Mitchell places the evidence on the question of Mr. Kahn's normal duties in equipoise. In short, there is a genuine issue of material fact on the question. Under these circumstances, we think that Mr. Kahn has presented non-frivolous allegations that his reports concerning Annis were not part of his normal duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Before the Board, Mr. Kahn will have the burden of establishing his WPA claim by a preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 518 F.3d 905, 909 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Specifically, he will be required to demonstrate that his reports to his superiors concerning TFA Annis constituted protected disclosures under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), that the reports were not part of his normal duties, and that the reports were a contributing factor in the DEA's decision to transfer him to Atlanta. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> At this point, however, Mr. Kahn has made non-frivolous allegations sufficient to establish Board jurisdiction. On appeal, the government does not dispute the AJ's assumption that Mr. Kahn's reports constituted disclosures of violations of DEA rules and regulations. At the same time, we have held that Mr. Kahn made non-frivolous allegations that his reports concerning Annis were not part of his normal duties. Finally, we think that Mr. Kahn's affidavit and the documentary material before the Board concerning the events that took place after his reports and the removal of Annis from the Task Force raised non-frivolous allegations that Mr. Kahn's reports concerning Annis were a contributing factor in the DEA's decision to transfer Mr. Kahn to Atlanta. If Mr. Kahn establishes a prohibited personnel practice by a preponderance of the evidence, the burden will shift to the DEA to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that it would have transferred him to Atlanta even in the absence of his protected disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1141 (Fed. Cir. 1993). If the DEA fails to carry that burden, the Board will then have occasion to fashion such corrective action as it considers appropriate. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Following remand, hearing, an unfavorable decision on the merits by the administrative judge, and another appeal by Mr. Kahn to the court, <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 618 F.3d 1306, 1312-15 (Fed. Cir. 2010), found that the disclosures asserted, involving problems in the handling of a confidential informant, were unprotected because they were within the scope of his normal duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A protected disclosure is, in relevant part, "any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences...a violation of any law, rule, or regulation." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). We have interpreted this statutory definition to cover an employee communication (1) that discloses unknown information, (2) that an employee would reasonably believe is unlawful, and (3) that is outside the scope of the employee's normal duties or communicated outside of normal channels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, we have interpreted the term "disclosure" broadly to reflect the WPA's legislative history. <span class="Italic">See Huffman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.,</span> 263 F.3d 1341, 1347-48 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In 1989, Congress enacted the WPA in part to broaden the disclosures protected under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, 1116. Specifically, Congress changed the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) from "<span class="Italic">a</span> disclosure" to "<span class="Italic">any</span> disclosure." Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, &#x00A7; 4(a)(3), 103 Stat. 16, 32 (emphases added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though the WPA covers a broad swath of communications, the communication must still be a "disclosure" to qualify for protection. We have generally defined the term "disclosure" to mean "to reveal something that was hidden and not known." <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1350. Moreover, "the disclosure must pertain to the underlying conduct, rather than to the asserted fact of its unlawfulness or impropriety." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1350 n.2. Thus an employee who reports to a wrongdoer that his conduct is unlawful or improper has not made a protected disclosure if the wrongdoer already knew of his conduct. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the petitioner must establish that "a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by the employee [would] reasonably conclude that the actions of the government evidence [a violation of any law, rule, or regulation]." <span class="Italic">Lachance,</span> 174 F.3d at 1381 (alterations added). While analyzing purely subjective beliefs is insufficient, <span class="Italic">id.,</span> a petitioner's motive for making disclosures is relevant to the merits of the whistleblower claim in as much as it is evidence of reasonable belief, <span class="Italic">Johnston v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 518 F.3d 905, 911 (Fed. Cir. 2008). The petitioner need not prove an actual violation of law, rule, or regulation. "The test is not whether [the petitioner] was able to prove [a violation], but rather could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by [the petitioner] reasonably conclude...that a violation <span id="Page_3653"></span>did occur." <span class="Italic">Drake v. Agency for Int'l Dev.,</span> 543 F.3d 1377, 1382 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (alterations added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, an employee must communicate the information either outside the scope of his normal duties or outside of normal channels to qualify as a protected disclosure. In <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, we outlined three categories into which an employee's communications may fall, including (a) disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels, (b) disclosures made as part of normal duties outside of normal channels, and (c) disclosures made outside of normal or assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1352-54; <span class="Italic">see also Fields v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 452 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A communication can only qualify as a protected disclosure if it falls within the latter two categories. <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1341; <span class="Italic">Fields,</span> 452 F.3d at 1305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge did not err in finding that Kahn's communications with Mitchell were not protected disclosures because Kahn reported Annis's conduct to Mitchell as part of normal duties through normal channels. <span class="Italic">See Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1352. According to Kahn's official job description, a Special Agent Criminal Investigator "plan[s] and conduct[s] highly complex criminal investigations primarily involving major violators in large-scale drug trafficking networks operating throughout several regions of the United States." J.A. 1178 (alterations added). Kahn's position included "initiat[ing], plan[ning], and coordinat[ing] investigations and enforcement operations," "recruit[ing], develop[ing], debrief[ing], document[ing], and/or coordinat[ing] program[s] on confidential sources," and "ensur[ing] investigative and other administrative files are up-to-date and in compliance with DEA policies and procedures." J.A. 7 (alterations in the original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition to this basic job description, the administrative judge credited Mitchell and Ozaluk's testimony that Kahn was the DEA Beaufort Office's "lead agent" and that he would have been responsible for reviewing the operational plan and the use of any confidential source in Annis's investigation--even if Meehan was working with Annis as Kahn claimed. The administrative judge found that Kahn "functioned as the 'lead agent' in the Beaufort office, the single point of contact through which operational details of all ongoing investigations were submitted up the supervisory chain for review and approval."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even though Kahn argues on appeal that his role as lead agent only required him to review reports for grammar and DEA format, Mitchell and Ozaluk's testimony support the administrative judge's finding that Kahn's informal responsibilities included reporting to Mitchell on ongoing investigations assigned to other agents, including reports on confidential sources. The administrative judge appears to have credited Mitchell and Ozaluk's testimony over Kahn's. We have held that "an evaluation of witness credibility is within the discretion of the Board and that, in general, such evaluations are 'virtually unreviewable' on appeal." <span class="Italic">King v. Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs.,</span> 133 F.3d 1450, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dep't of Army,</span> 997 F.2d 1466, 1473 (Fed. Cir. 1993)). Giving deference to the Board's credibility determinations, we conclude that Kahn's communications with Mitchell fall under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category one as disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels. <span class="Italic">See</span> 263 F.3d at 1352. Accordingly, we affirm the administrative judge's finding that Kahn's communications with Mitchell were not protected disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to Kahn's communications with Mitchell, we must also consider his communications with Ozaluk. The government asserts that Kahn has not argued on appeal that the administrative judge erred in finding that his communications with Ozaluk were not protected. ...Since his initial complaint to OSC, however, Kahn has alleged that both his reports to Mitchell <span class="Italic">and</span> Ozaluk constituted protected disclosures. On appeal, Kahn maintains that he "verbally told...Mitchell and...Ozaluk of...Annis'[s] violations of DEA's rules and regulations." Because Kahn has consistently maintained that his communications with Ozaluk were protected disclosures, he has not waived an argument as to those communications on appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the merits, however, Kahn's communications with Ozaluk do not qualify as disclosures under our precedent. <span class="Italic">See Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1350. Although the administrative judge failed to separately analyze Kahn's communications with Ozaluk, Kahn's own account demonstrates that his communications with Ozaluk were not disclosures. According to Kahn, he communicated all of his interactions with Annis to Mitchell <span class="Italic">before</span> his lunch meeting with Ozaluk. Consequently, the DEA was aware of Annis's conduct before Ozaluk met Kahn for lunch at the end of May or beginning of June 2002. As Ozaluk testified, "[Kahn] was advising...Mitchell on everything that was happening in that office, Task Force Officer Annis, and other administrative functions and operational issues." Although Ozaluk testified that he was unsure as to which information on Annis's conduct came from Kahn and which information came from Mitchell, Ozaluk undisputedly knew that Kahn and Annis had a disagreement over the informant before he met with Kahn for lunch and requested that Kahn "explain what was going on with...Annis," Therefore, Kahn's report to Ozaluk was not a disclosure because Kahn did not "reveal something that was hidden and not known" to the DEA. <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1350.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To be sure, we have interpreted the term "disclosure" broadly to include any disclosure. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 147-48. Congress inserted the word "any" into &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) to protect at least some employees who report information that agency members already knew when the employees' disclosures satisfy the other statutory requirements. <span class="Italic">See</span> S. Rep. No. 100-413, at 13 (1988) ("It is inappropriate for disclosures to be protected only if they are made for certain purposes or to certain employees or only if the employee is the first to raise the issue."). We accounted for this legislative history when we defined disclosure and outlined the three disclosure categories in <span class="Italic">Huffman.</span> <span class="Italic">See</span> 263 F.3d at 1347-54. We noted that <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category two includes "a law enforcement officer who is responsible for investigating crime by government employees who, feeling that the normal chain of command is unresponsive, reports wrongdoing outside of normal channels." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1354. The WPA thus recognizes an employee's report of wrongdoing as a disclosure when his first-line supervisor ignores the report and the employee is forced to communicate the wrongdoing outside the chain of command. But there is no evidence that Mitchell, Kahn's first-line supervisor, disregarded Kahn's reports on Annis's conduct. Instead, Mitchell worked closely with Kahn in an attempt to register the informant as a confidential source and relayed at least some of Kahn's reports on Annis to Ozaluk.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although we affirm the Board's judgment, we note that the administrative judge erroneously stressed that Annis did not violate DEA rules. The administrative judge credited Mitchell's testimony that Annis was "'trying to take of [sic] his hat, I believe, as a task force officer and put it on as a Beaufort County deputy."' According to the administrative judge, Tanner's after-the-fact, one-time authorization to purchase the cocaine for Annis's informant technically avoided violating DEA rules. Even if Annis avoided violating DEA rules, the administrative judge failed to analyze Annis's conduct from a disinterested observer's perspective. Instead, the administrative judge appears to have "erroneously required [Kahn] to prove that an actual violation occurred," which is directly contrary to our precedent. <span class="Italic">Drake</span>, 543 F.3d at 1382 (alteration added). Moreover, the administrative judge failed to analyze whether a disinterested observer at the time Kahn spoke with Ozaluk would have reasonably believed he was reporting misconduct. According to the administrative judge, "prior to his conversations with...Mitchell, [Kahn] did not himself know whether, in fact,...Annis'[s] activities were in violation of agency guidelines." But that says nothing about the knowledge a reasonable observer in Kahn's position would have had <span class="Italic">after</span> speaking with Mitchell about the guidelines. Despite these legal errors, we affirm the Board's decision on other grounds as explained above. We reiterate, however, that "[t]he test is not whether [the petitioner] was able to prove [a violation], but rather could a disinterested observer with knowledge of the essential facts known to and readily ascertainable by [the petitioner] reasonably conclude...that a violation did occur." <span class="Italic">Drake,</span> 543 F.3d at 1382 (alterations added).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Layton v. Dept. of Army</span>, 112 MSPR 549, 550-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-17, 2009 MSPB 221 (2009) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Layton v. MSPB</span>, 392 Fed. Appx. 875 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), <span class="Italic">post</span>), upheld dismissal of an IRA appeal by an attorney who asserted that he made a protected disclosure through his report on environmental problems encountered during a construction project. The work product was not a protected disclosure under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> because the attorney performed the work as part of an assignment that was consistent with his expertise as an environmental attorney, even thought he was not normally an agency investigator. The Board relied on <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> and distinguished <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant serves as an Attorney for the U.S. Army Garrison Alaska, specializing in environmental law. He filed an IRA appeal alleging that the agency retaliated against him for making protected disclosures in a report he prepared regarding environmental problems encountered during the Taku construction project. The appellant stated that in 2005, the agency began construction on the Taku project, but soon discovered that hazardous substances had contaminated the soil throughout the construction site, causing construction delays. The garrison commander directed the Pacific Region Chief of Staff to conduct an investigation into the Taku project delay, and he ultimately submitted a report regarding this matter.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further claimed that agency management was not convinced that this initial report accurately assessed the Taku situation, and appointed the appellant to ensure the accuracy of the initial findings and to review operating procedures to determine what changes were needed to prevent a future similar event. Specifically, the agency tasked the appellant with conducting a comprehensive audit of the Taku site selection and waste management practices associated with the construction activities, and directed him to focus on verifying that all pre-construction environmental site assessment actions conformed to applicable regulations and requirements, verifying that all waste management practices during construction conformed to regulations and requirements, and determining whether the agency's oversight and management of construction contracting in regard to site assessment <span id="Page_3654"></span>and waste management should be improved and, if so, to recommend management practices to achieve that purpose. The agency further directed the appellant to review records related to the environmental site assessment and waste management, and to interview agency and contractor personnel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During the course of the appellant's investigation and preparation of his report, he met with agency officials to discuss his progress and prepared short information papers. Further, before submitting his final report, he submitted drafts and supporting documents to his two immediate superiors for review, and both of them offered recommendations and editorial corrections. The appellant's report reiterated many of the concerns discussed in the initial report, in concluding that there were various errors and wrongdoing associated with the Taku construction. In the report, the appellant identified himself as an agency attorney who prepared the report for the purpose of providing legal advice to agency officials. In addition to preparing the report, the appellant also briefed agency officials regarding the report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant later claimed that the agency retaliated against him because of the report, and he filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) alleging whistleblower retaliation. After OSC terminated its investigation into his complaint, the appellant filed this IRA appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argued...that his disclosures in the report were protected under <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice,</span> 528 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008). There, the appellant was a special agent who conducted an investigation that revealed improper activities with respect to a confidential source and disclosed that information to his superiors. 528 F.3d at 1337-39. He later claimed that the agency retaliated against him for making the disclosure, and the agency argued that the Board lacked jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> because the appellant made the disclosures as part of the appellant's assigned duties to report the alleged violations of agency rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1342-43. The appellant, however, claimed that the particular misconduct that he reported was beyond the scope of his normal duties with the agency.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held that the appellant presented a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure entitling him to a hearing on the merits of his IRA appeal because a genuine issue of material fact existed regarding whether the appellant's disclosures were part of his normal duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343-44. Specifically, the court noted that the appellant submitted an affidavit alleging that the reports were not part of his normal duties because he had no supervisory responsibility over the wrong-doing employee and no specific job duty to ferret out and report misconduct of co-employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1343. It further found that the agency presented evidence that it tasked the appellant with reporting on administrative matters and law enforcement operations at the office, and that such reports would have included the appellant's communications regarding the wrong-doing employee, thereby bringing those communications within the scope of the appellant's normal duties.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> The court found that these positions and evidence constituted a genuine issue of material fact and that the appellant, therefore, presented a nonfrivolous allegation that the report was not part of his normal duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant argued that performing investigations like the Taku project was not part of his normal attorney duties, and that he was assigned this task "by default" because of his knowledge of environmental matters. He, therefore, asserted that, under <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> he presented a nonfrivolous claim that he made his disclosures outside of his normal duties, thereby establishing jurisdiction and entitling him to a hearing on the merits.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, this case turns on whether the appellant's disclosures are excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act's (WPA) coverage under<span class="Italic"> Huffman,</span> or whether the circumstances are more like <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> where the court found the appellant presented a nonfrivolous allegation that his work-related disclosures were protected and that he was entitled to a hearing on the merits. For the following reasons, we believe that the administrative judge correctly distinguished<span class="Italic"> Kahn</span> in concluding that the appellant did not present a nonfrivolous allegation of a protected disclosure and dismissing the appeal for lack of jurisdiction without holding a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> the court described three categories into which a disclosure may fall, and explained that only the latter two categories describe disclosures that are protected under the WPA. 263 F.3d at 1353-54. These categories are disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels, disclosures as part of normal duties outside of normal channels, and disclosures outside of normal duties.<span class="Italic"> Id.; see also Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1341. The court has explained that the third category, disclosures outside of normal duties, involves the situation "in which the employee is obligated to report the wrongdoing, but such report is not part of the employee's normal duties or the employee has not been assigned those duties." <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1354; <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1341-42. The court has further noted that a disclosure falls within the third category if, although the employee, like all agency employees, is generally required to report wrongdoing that he sees, the disclosure is not part of the employee's assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1342.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no dispute that the agency assigned the appellant with the duty to investigate and report on the Taku construction project. Under a plain reading of <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> disclosures made while performing this assigned duty would not be protected. 263 F.3d at 1354;<span class="Italic"> Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1341-42.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant, however, argues that his disclosures of wrongdoing were not part of the Taku project. Specifically, he claims that the project had specific areas of inquiry and that his investigation pursuant to the original mandate led him to avenues beyond the scope of the assigned duty and that his disclosures of wrongdoing pertained to the areas beyond the project's assigned scope. He further asserts that his disagreement with the agency regarding whether his disclosures fall within the parameters of his assigned task constitutes a nonfrivolous allegation under <span class="Italic">Kahn</span> that warrants a finding of jurisdiction and a hearing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge stated, however, it is undisputed that the appellant conducted his assigned investigation and prepared his report while keeping his supervisors abreast of his progress. Specifically, he exchanged ideas with them and received their input regarding the project, thereby distinguishing the appellant's circumstances from <span class="Italic">Kahn.</span> Thus, to the extent that the appellant's ultimate final report differed from the scope of his initial assignment, that scope changed due to both his investigation and the feedback he received from his supervisors while performing the assigned duty. We, therefore, believe that the appellant has not presented a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> and <span class="Italic">Kahn.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to the court's decisions in <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998), and <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> disclosures made as part of an employee's duties, or that closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities, could be deemed to be protected under the WPA. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of Justice,</span> 64 F.3d 1524, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1995); <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993); <span class="Italic">see also Huffman,</span> 263 F.3d at 1352 n.3. As the court recognized, however, <span class="Italic">Willis</span> and <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> changed the law with respect to these types of disclosures. <span class="Italic">See Morgan v. Department of Energy,</span> 424 F.3d 1271, 1273-74 &#x0026; n.1 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Because both the court and the Board have consistently applied <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> to determine whether a disclosure is excluded from protection because the appellant made it while performing normal or assigned duties, we are constrained to follow that practice here.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Kahn,</span> 528 F.3d at 1341-43; <span class="Italic">Fields v. Department of Justice,</span> 452 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Sinko v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 116, &#x00B6; 13 (2006); <span class="Italic">Miller v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the appellant's claim that he would have produced additional evidence showing jurisdiction had the administrative judge afforded him a hearing is also unavailing. As the court explained in <span class="Italic">Kahn,</span> the appellant must present a nonfrivolous allegation to establish jurisdiction. 528 F.3d at 1341. This requires the appellant to show the existence of a material fact issue, and the determination of whether the appellant has made this showing is based entirely on the written record.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> Thus, the appellant's claim that he could have shown jurisdiction had he received his requested hearing is without merit. We, therefore, conclude that the appellant has failed to present a nonfrivolous allegation that he made a protected disclosure and must dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal, the Federal Circuit affirmed the reasoning and result, <span class="Italic">Layton v. MSPB</span>, 392 Fed. Appx. 875, 879-80 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Layton argues that the disclosures in his report identifying wrongdoing by Army personnel and contractors were protected disclosures under the WPA. He argues that the disclosures were not made as part of his normal duties because his assignment to audit the Taku project did not cover investigating the misconduct of Army officials. Mr. Layton also argues that he did not disclose his findings of misconduct through normal channels because his findings were communicated to officials outside Col. Shutt's chain of command and without Col. Shutt's permission.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that Mr. Layton's disclosures of misconduct were within the scope of his normal, assigned duties. Substantial evidence supports this finding. There is no dispute that Mr. Layton performed his investigation of the Taku project pursuant to direct orders, as set forth in Col. Shutt's memorandum. The memorandum broadly tasked Mr. Layton with conducting "a comprehensive audit" of the Taku project's site selection and waste management practices. It specifically instructed Mr. Layton to verify that all actions related to site assessment and waste management conformed to all applicable rules and regulations and to articulate any ways in which Army's management practices with respect <span id="Page_3655"></span>to site assessment and waste management should be improved. After performing his investigation of the Taku project, Mr. Layton identified certain Army officials who had potentially violated laws and regulations through improperly handling contaminants and misleading Army officials regarding the contamination. These findings of misconduct, which Mr. Layton discussed in his report, plainly fall within the scope of Mr. Layton's duties to verify compliance with applicable regulations and to identify ways to improve Army's management of site assessment and waste management issues. Further, Mr. Layton conferred with Col. Shutt and his OSJA supervisor regarding his progress on the audit and provided his OSJA supervisors with drafts of the report containing the findings of misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Layton next argues that the audit was not intended to encompass an investigation into possible misconduct by Army employees or contractors. To support this contention, Mr. Layton asserts that Col. Shutt's memorandum fails to comply with the requirements of Army Regulation (AR) 15-6, the regulation that controls formal investigations of Army officials. However, the Board did not find and Army did not claim that Mr. Layton's audit assignment was an investigation pursuant to AR 15-6. Rather, the purpose of the audit was to comprehensively review the site selection and waste management practices associated with the Taku project, to verify that all such practices complied with the applicable laws and regulations, and to identify ways to improve these practices. Mr. Layton's findings related to Army officials' potential violation of applicable rules and regulations during construction were relevant to these purposes and thus within the scope of Mr. Layton's assigned duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Layton also argues that his disclosures were made outside of normal channels. He asserts that the findings in his audit report were provided to the U.S. Army Alaska commander and to officials within Alaska District Corps of Engineers, all of whom were outside of Col. Shutt's chain of command. However, Mr. Layton did not disclose the findings in his report to these individuals; rather, Mr. Layton's superiors in OSJA forwarded his findings to the U.S. Army Alaska commander and officials in the Corps of Engineers. The record contains no evidence that Mr. Layton disclosed his findings to anyone other than his superiors in OSJA and to Col. Shutt, the official who initially tasked Mr. Layton with the audit assignment. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the Board's finding that Mr. Layton did not make the disclosures outside of normal channels.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because substantial evidence supports the Board's findings that Mr. Layton made the disclosures of potential misconduct by Army officials as part of his assigned duties and through normal channels, these disclosures were not "protected disclosures" under the WPA. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1344. Therefore, the Board correctly determined that Mr. Layton failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disclosure by an investigator was protected when the work assignment to the investigator was outside the scope of the type of investigations normally assigned to him, <span class="Italic">Rios v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, NY-1221-10-0261-W-2 (NP 6/14/2013):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The WPA makes it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action because of any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences: (1) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (2) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A); <span class="Italic">Farrington v. Department of Transportation</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 5 (2012). In <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1352-54 (Fed. Cir. 2001), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, while noting that the definition of "any disclosure" under the WPA is broad, held that an employee's disclosure must communicate information either outside the scope of his normal duties or outside of normal channels to qualify as a protected disclosure. In particular, the court outlined three categories into which an employee's communications may fall: (1) disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels; (2) disclosures made as part of normal duties outside of normal channels; and (3) disclosures made outside of normal or assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Id.; see also Fields v. Department of Justice</span>, 452 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A communication can qualify as a protected disclosure under the WPA only if it falls within the latter two categories. <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Fields</span>, 452 F.3d at 1305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge here found that, although the appellant had never before been assigned to investigate a claim of an assault on a federal officer, the disclosures resulting from that investigation were made in the normal course of his duties. The administrative judge found that the appellant was a trained investigator, the agency had at one point in the unspecified past conducted an assault investigation, and it was expedient to have the appellant perform the investigation rather than another agent or the FBI. The agency has the right to assign work as it sees fit, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(b), and the agency had the discretion to assign this investigation to the appellant regardless of whether it was efficient or expedient to do so. However, neither the agency's reasons for assigning this investigation to the appellant nor the fact that he was qualified to perform the assignment are relevant to whether the appellant made his disclosures in the normal course of his duties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that this appeal is similar to the Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>, 528 F.3d at 1343, the court found that the appellant made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosures fell under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category 3. Mr. Kahn was a Special Agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) who was assigned to work on a task force along with other federal agents and some local law enforcement officers. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1339. During the course of that assignment, the appellant discovered and reported alleged misconduct on the part of one of the local law enforcement officers on the task force. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court weighed the description of the job duties contained in Mr. Kahn's position description and Mr. Kahn's statement that his normal duties did not include investigating misconduct committed by other agents, against the agency's statement that Mr. Kahn's disclosures fell within the scope of the requirement that Mr. Kahn keep the agency abreast of developments in the task force's operations. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1342-43. The court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to find that Mr. Kahn made a nonfrivolous allegation that his disclosure was not made within the course of his normal duties. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1343.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like Mr. Kahn, the appellant is a federal agent with a specialized, rather than general, area of responsibility. Mr. Kahn, as a DEA agent, investigated drug-related crimes; the appellant, as an NMFS agent, investigates civil and criminal violations of various statutes associated with marine fisheries. Both Mr. Kahn and the appellant received a specific job assignment from their supervisors, and both discovered and reported to their supervisors that a fellow law enforcement officer committed alleged misconduct of a type outside Mr. Kahn's and the appellant's usual bailiwick. Mr. Kahn's disclosure did not involve a drug crime; the appellant's disclosure did not involve a fisheries violation. Mr. Kahn's disclosure occurred in the context of his official participation in a task force convened to investigate drug crimes (i.e., a work assignment clearly within the scope of his ordinary duties), although the disclosure itself did not involve a drug crime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the appellant's disclosure occurred in the context of an unusual assignment to investigate an alleged assault on a federal officer, a type of investigation that neither the appellant nor his supervisors had been called to perform for the agency. Radonski testified that the appellant had no prior experience investigating assault on federal officers. He also testified that he himself had never investigated an assault on a federal officer in a 27-year career. Similarly, Deputy Special Agent in Charge Tracy Dunn, the appellant's second line supervisor, had not investigated an assault at any point during his 22-year career. Although the administrative judge relied on Radonski's general testimony that the agency had investigated "other assault issues" as support for the agency's claim that investigating assaults on federal officers was a normal part of the appellant's duties, there is no evidence as to when these investigations might have taken place or under what circumstances. Moreover, both Radonski's and Dunn's testimony about prior assault investigations involved incidents with crew and observers aboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) ships, not an assault on a federal officer. Dunn explicitly testified that "[i]nvestigating an assault on a federal officer, no, is definitely not in [the appellant's] normal course of duties." This testimony is substantiated by the appellant's position description, which nowhere mentions any variety of violent crime in connection with the position's "Principal Objective." <span class="Italic">See Farrington</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 9 (the Board and the court have consistently relied upon position descriptions to determine whether disclosures were made as part of an employee's normal duties), citing <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>, 618 F.3d at 1313.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consistent with <span class="Italic">Kahn</span>, we find that the disclosures that the appellant made in connection with the investigation into the alleged assault on a federal officer did not fall within the scope of his normal job duties and are protected under <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> category 3. <span class="Italic">See Kahn</span>, 528 F.3d at 1342-43; <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1353-54. We further find that the appellant has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that he reasonably believed that his disclosure evidenced a violation of law, rule, or regulation, he was affected by two personnel actions that occurred within six months of his disclosures, and the agency managers responsible for the personnel actions knew of the disclosures. Thus, the appellant has shown that he made protected disclosures that were a contributing factor in a personnel action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The burden of proof now shifts to the agency to show by clear and convincing evidence that it would have rated the appellant in the same manner and not selected the appellant for a promotion in the absence of any whistleblowing. <span class="Italic">See Mithen v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 215, &#x00B6; 11 (2013). The administrative judge in her initial decision did not make any findings as to whether the agency has met this burden. Because resolution of this issue may involve resolving conflicting evidence and testimony based on the demeanor of witnesses, the administrative judge is in the best position to resolve such questions. <span class="Italic">See Durr v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 195, &#x00B6; 15 (2013). <span id="Page_3656"></span>Accordingly, we vacate the initial decision and remand the appeal for further adjudication consistent with this Opinion and Order.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant's April 24, 2008 purchase card disclosure to Armes appears to have been in direct response to Armes's April 9, 2008 instruction. Thus, the disclosure was within the normal performance of the appellant's duties and in accordance with management's instructions. As such, it was not protected under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also made the purchase card disclosure to OIG on October 10 and 14, 2008, and to OSC on December 29, 2008, all of which were outside of his normal job duties. These disclosures are therefore protected.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Disclosures to higher management could take the communications outside of normal channels, an approach applied in <span class="Italic">Ontivero v. DHS</span>, 117 MSPR 600, 606 &#x00B6; 17, 2012 MSPB 45 (2012):</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) makes it a prohibited personnel practice to take or fail to take a personnel action because of "any disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A). In <span class="Italic">Huffman,</span> the court, while noting that the definition of "any disclosure" under the WPA is broad, held that an employee must communicate information either outside the scope of his normal duties or outside of normal channels to qualify as a protected disclosure. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1352-54. In particular, the court outlined three categories into which an employee's communications may fall: (1) Disclosures made as part of normal duties through normal channels; (2) disclosures made as part of normal duties outside of normal channels, and (3) disclosures made outside of normal or assigned duties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also Fields v. Department of Justice</span>, 452 F.3d 1297, 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006). A communication can qualify as a protected disclosure under the Whistleblower Protection Act only if it falls within the latter two categories. <span class="Italic">Kahn v. Department of Justice</span>, 528 F.3d 1336, 341 (Fed. Cir. 2008); <span class="Italic">Fields</span>, 452 F.3d at 1305.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the second category, the court stated that this category may include a situation in which an employee with assigned investigatory responsibilities reports wrongdoing outside of normal channels. <span class="Italic">Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1354. For example, the court found that a law enforcement officer who is responsible for investigating crimes by government employees who, feeling that the normal chain of command is unresponsive, may make a protected disclosure by reporting wrongdoing outside of normal channels. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court has not explicitly defined the term "normal channels." However, consistent with the court's use of the term in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> and subsequent decisions, we believe that the term "normal channels" should be given its commonly understood meaning, i.e., the employee conveyed duty-related information to a recipient, who in the course of his or her duties, customarily receives the same type of information from the employee and from other employees at the same or similar level in the organization as the employee. Some of the factors relevant to this determination are: whether the communication complies with the formal and informal customs and practices in the employee's workplace for conveying such information up the chain of command; whether the organization enforces a strict hierarchical chain of command requiring that communications must go through lower level supervisors before being elevated to higher management; and whether the information was conveyed to the recipient in the organization's commonly accepted manner or method for presenting such information for management consideration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant contends that the administrative judge improperly expanded <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> to hold that if the officials receiving the disclosures have sufficient "subject-matter expertise" to understand the disclosures, then the disclosures are made within normal channels of reporting and that she "convolute[d] the <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> 'normal duties through normal reporting channels' exclusion into a rule that no disclosure is protected anywhere up the chain of command...." We agree. Nothing in <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> or any other published decision issued by the Board or the court expressly or implicitly supports the interpretation that subject matter expertise of the official receiving a disclosure is determinative of whether the disclosure was made within normal channels. <span class="Italic">See Huffman</span>, 263 F.3d at 1352-54. Therefore, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's disclosures to Walker were within normal channels because he had sufficient expertise to understand them.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, we find that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that her disclosures to Walker were made outside of normal channels of communication in her organization. It is undisputed that Walker was the appellant's fourth or fifth level supervisor, and that his office and the appellant's office were located in different states. Below, the appellant alleged that she requested to meet with Walker only after her supervisor had been unresponsive to her pleas that flight attendants at Air Tran could not get travelers safely out of the emergency exit of a particular model of aircraft. Further, in the appellant's deposition transcript, which was submitted to the administrative judge, she testified that she normally reported safety matters only to her first level supervisor, that she had always worked only at the local level, that she was not authorized to report matters directly to Walker, and that she had never previously taken a work-related matter to him, nor even spoken with him, prior to making her first disclosure to him in May 2003. Although the agency provided evidence below that Walker played a role in resolving internal staff disputes on safety related issues, we find that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's disclosures to Walker were not protected because a material dispute of fact exists regarding whether the appellant's communications with Walker followed the typical customs and practices in the workplace for conveying regulatory and safety issues to higher level management.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board decided several cases before the 2001 <span class="Italic">Huffman</span> decision involving personnel who claimed they were the victims of reprisal following disclosures that were a component of their jobs. On the theory that a messenger should not suffer for conveying the content of the message, individuals who served as conduits of whistleblowing allegations, i.e., employees who as a regular duty passed along allegations made by others to investigative units within their agencies, shared the same protection from reprisal as those employees whose allegations they passed along. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Shively v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 531, 537 (1993) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-20-033.html#sec13-33">Individual Serving as Conduit of Information; Internal Disclosure").</a></p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Garrett v. DOD</span>, 62 MSPR 666, 671 (1994), an auditor was protected by the WPA for disclosures to supervisors about the irregular activities of a contractor audited by the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The definition of a "protected disclosure" includes, in pertinent part: <span class="Italic">Any</span> disclosure of information by an employee or applicant which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences--(i) a violation of any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8)(A) (emphasis supplied).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge simply concluded, without offering any support, that the above definition did not include disclosures made by employees as part of the performance of their duties. On its face, however, the statutory definition imposes no such limitation on whistleblowing. The plain language of a statute controls absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary. There is no expression of legislative intention to the contrary here, and we decline to read such an exception into the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, judicial and Board decisions reveal that the focus in determining whether an employee has made a protected disclosure is not on the position of the employee making the disclosure, but on the nature of the disclosure itself. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Marano v. Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1142-43 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (one whose disclosures are made in the performance of his job duties must carry only the same burden of proof before the Board as the more "typical" whistleblower); <span class="Italic">McDaid v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 420-21 (1990), (an employee must prove only that a <span class="Italic">disclosure described</span> in 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action taken against him, and the WPA protects <span class="Italic">disclosures</span> that an employee makes). Thus, we find that the administrative judge's reason for finding that the appellant's November 1989 reporting of his preliminary findings in Golder to Cox was not a protected disclosure was unwarranted and, accordingly, that he erred in dismissing the appellant's whistleblowing allegations on that basis.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Frederick v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 563, 570 (1994), announced that WPA protection against reprisal encompassed an appellant's reports, as a supervisor, of timekeeping infractions of his subordinates.

NRC</span>, 64 MSPR 28, 32 (1994), the Board held, relying upon <span class="Italic">Garrett</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, that "[a]n employee is protected from retaliation for disclosures made in the performance of his or her job" as to the appellant, Director, Office of Inspector and Auditor of NRC, <span id="Page_3657"></span>whose disclosures of wrongdoing allegedly caused a reprimand to be issued to her. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bump v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he appellant could have performed his job duties with impunity without disclosing his belief that the accounting practices were illegal. The appellant, however, balked at using the accounting practices, and when ordered to do so, he disclosed his belief, placing his personal job security at risk. Thus, his disclosure, although closely related to his duties, was not merely carrying out his job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">See Marano v. Department of Justice,</span> 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (the WPA also applies to the situation where a government employee discloses information that is closely related to the employee's day-to-day responsibilities).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant reasserts that her reports about the Sysmex amounted to whistleblowing because her everyday job duties as a dayshift supervisor, did not include reporting operational problems and design defects with the Sysmex. The administrative judge found otherwise, stating "[i]t is glaringly apparent in this case that [the] appellant was merely carrying out her day-to-day responsibilities when she made various reports to agency supervisors...concerning the malfunctions of the Sysmex. As a supervisor in charge of the Hematology and Blood Bank Departments, it was [the] appellant's fundamental responsibility to report problems, however serious, to agency officials." In reaching this finding, the administrative judge appears to have relied only on the appellant's performance appraisal without making specific references to the language in the appraisal that supports his finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nonetheless, this omission is of no consequence here. The administrative judge erred in concluding that the appellant's disclosure is not protected if not made outside of her required job duties. Specifically, the administrative judge relied upon <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of Agriculture,</span> 141 <span id="Page_3658"></span>F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998), to find that the appellant's negative reports to agency officials about the Sysmex were not protected disclosures under the WPA inasmuch as such reporting was the appellant's "fundamental responsibility." To the contrary, <span class="Italic">Willis</span> does not stand for the broad proposition set forth in the initial decision. We recently clarified this misinterpretation of <span class="Italic">Willis</span> in <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 87 MSPR 204 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-15 (2000), and <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 87 MSPR 107 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (2000), noting there that the Board has long held that the definition of a "protected disclosure" includes disclosures made by employees as part of the performance of their duties. Further, we emphasized that <span class="Italic">Willis</span> did not overrule or even question this Board precedent and that even our reviewing court has recognized that protected disclosures may be made as part of an employee's duties. <span class="Italic">Johnson</span>, 87 MSPR 204 &#x00B6; 14; <span class="Italic">Czarkowski</span>, 87 MSPR 107 &#x00B6; 15. Thus, as set forth above, we hold that the appellant has made a nonfrivolous allegation that she engaged in whistleblowing by making a protected disclosure under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8), when she reported problems with the Sysmex to second-line supervisors Wolf and Baird.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Willis</span> was distinguished in <span class="Italic">Askew v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 674, 678-80 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-16 (2001), concluding that an employee secured protection by reporting violations of accounting rules to the IG, taking herself outside the normal scope of her duties:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the appellant disclosed a violation of rule, TACOM Operating Instruction 725-03, &#x00A7; 2.2(g), when she reported to the IG that DVD transactions were being closed out with no verification that field activities had received the supplies ordered. Contrary to the initial decision, the fact that the appellant could not present a specific example showing a particular dollar loss to the government is not fatal. The question is whether the appellant reasonably believed that receipt of the supplies was not being recorded properly. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Considering that TACOM management itself found that this was occurring, and considering that the appellant's working knowledge of the DVD system developed while performing reconciliation functions, she did have a reasonable belief that transactions were being closed out in the absence of verification of receipt. <span class="Italic">See Perry v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 81 MSPR 298 &#x00B6; 9 (1999) (a disclosure based not on scanty or unreliable information, but rather, on a reasonable interpretation of events considering information available to the appellant when he made his disclosure, is protected). The appellant's disclosure was not based on a "purely subjective" belief so as to fall outside the coverage of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See LaChance v. White,</span> 174 F.3d 1378, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 1999), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1157, 145 L. Ed.2d 1069 (2000). Rather, as stated in the IG report, TACOM management itself had detected the very problem identified by the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In concluding that the appellant's disclosure was not protected, the AJ relied on <span class="Italic">Willis v. Department of Agriculture,</span> 141 F.3d 1139 (Fed. Cir. 1998), which he interpreted as having held that a disclosure of information in the course of an employee's performance of her regular duties is not protected whistleblowing. The appellant contends on review that her disclosure was protected, notwithstanding <span class="Italic">Willis.</span> As explained below, we agree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We begin by cautioning, as we did in <span class="Italic">Czarkowski v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 MSPR 107 &#x00B6; 13 (2000), that <span class="Italic">Willis</span> should not be cited for broad propositions, nor should isolated statements from <span class="Italic">Willis</span> be posited as general rules. Rather, the unique facts of <span class="Italic">Willis</span> limit its usefulness in determining whether a disclosure was protected whistleblowing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Willis, a District Conservationist, was responsible for monitoring farms' compliance with Department of Agriculture conservation plans. After inspecting 77 farms, he found 16 farms to be out of compliance. Six farmers successfully appealed Mr. Willis's determination to higher-level agency officials. 141 F.3d at 1141. Mr. Willis complained to his supervisors about having his findings overturned. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1143. He later sought corrective action for subsequent personnel actions that he claimed were taken in retaliation for his complaints.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court held that Mr. Willis's objections to having his findings overturned was not protected whistleblowing, emphasizing that "[d]iscussion and even disagreement with supervisors over job related activities is a normal part of most occupations." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court characterized Mr. Willis's complaints as nothing more than "voic[ing] his dissatisfaction with his superiors' decision," and noted that it was not until he retired that Mr. Willis brought his concerns to "higher authorit[ies]" who could have taken action to correct any impropriety in the ultimate finding by agency officials that the six farms in question were in compliance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court stressed that these postretirement disclosures did not put Mr. Willis's job security at risk, whereas the purpose of the whistleblower protection statute is to provide a remedy for those who risk their jobs by disclosing wrongdoing. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Turning to the question of whether Mr. Willis's original determination that 16 farms were out of compliance was protected whistleblowing, the court found that Mr. Willis had done "no more than carry out his everyday job responsibilities." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1144. Here too, the court found that the findings of non-compliance did not put Mr. Willis's job security at risk. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The present case is very different from <span class="Italic">Willis</span>. The appellant did not merely complain to or express disagreement with her supervisors; she reported violations of accounting rules to the IG. Unlike Mr. Willis, the appellant did not wait until after she left the agency to bring her concerns to the IG. Furthermore, it would be grossly inaccurate to say that the appellant, a Supply Technician whose duties included reconciling DVD books, was doing "no more than carry[ing] out [her] everyday job responsibilities" when she reported violations of accounting rules to the IG. Moreover, and in any event, <span class="Italic">Willis</span> did not hold that a disclosure of information in the course of an employee's performance of her normal duties cannot be protected whistleblowing<span class="Italic">. Czarkowski,</span> 87 MSPR 107 &#x00B6; 13; <span class="Italic">see also Watson v. Department of Justice</span>, 64 F.3d 1524, 1530 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (a protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's duties). There is also no basis for concluding that the appellant took no risk in going to the IG. In sum, when the entire factual picture of <span class="Italic">Willis</span> is considered alongside the facts of this case, we are persuaded that the AJ erred in relying on <span class="Italic">Willis</span> to find that the appellant's disclosure to the IG was not protected whistleblowing.</p>
