<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-20"><span class="space">b.</span> Firefighters</h5>
<p class="noindent">5 USC 7103(a)(17) defines "firefighter" to mean "any employee engaged in the performance of work directly connected with the control and extinguishment of fires or the maintenance and use of firefighting apparatus and equipment." Section 7103(a)(10), defining "supervisor," contains a proviso that, as to any unit including firefighters or nurses, he term "supervisor" includes only those individuals who "devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising such [supervisory] authority." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nat'l Park Serv., Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, Agoura Hills, Cal. and Laborers Int'l Union</span>, 50 FLRA 164, 170-71 (1995). <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Parks Reserve Training Ctr. and IAF Local F-305</span>, 61 FLRA 537, 541-44 (2006), elaborated on the criteria for firefighter supervisory status:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute defines a supervisor as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">"supervisor" means an individual employed by an agency having authority in the interest of the agency to hire, direct, assign, promote, reward, transfer, furlough, layoff, recall, suspend, discipline, or remove employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend such action, if the exercise of the authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment, <span class="Italic">except that, with respect to any unit which includes firefighters or nurses, the term "supervisor" includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising such authority</span>[.]</p>
<p class="noindent-1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_25"></span>Thus, with respect to firefighters and nurses, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) provides that "only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising" supervisory authority will be found to be supervisors. <span class="Italic">See Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station, Keyport, Wa.</span>, 7 FLRA 526 (1981). The "preponderance of time test is more restrictive" than the principal test for supervisors under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 527. Neither the Statute, nor its legislative history, defines "a preponderance of their employment time" as that term is used in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 527-29.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The application for review alleges that there is an absence of precedent concerning the proper interpretation of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. Specifically, the application asserts that the Authority "has not specifically defined 'preponderance' or 'employment time' in relation to &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute and the Statute itself does not define these terms." Application for Review at 1 (quoting RD's Decision at 8-9).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We address each of these assertions below.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;"Preponderance"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>, the Authority adopted an administrative law judge's finding that the term "preponderance" of a nurse's or a firefighter's employment time, under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10), means "a majority" of the nurse's or firefighter's employment time. <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>, 8 FLRA at 660. Specifically, the judge stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The fact that a head nurse may have round-the-clock "responsibility" for her unit does not eliminate the necessity for carrying out the statutory mandate to determine whether a preponderance of her employment time is engaged in "exercising" supervisory authority. There [are]...some nurses and firefighters [who] may have supervisory authority but who, for the most part, are rank-and-file employees. The question really is whether a head nurse is primarily a supervisor or primarily a rank-and-file employee <span class="Italic">during a majority of her employment time.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (emphasis added). Consequently, as the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span> adopted the judge's finding that "preponderance," as applied to nurses and firefighters under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute, means "a majority," there is not an absence of precedent with regard to the meaning of "preponderance" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, this claim does not establish that review of the RD's decision is warranted under &#x00A7; 2422.31 of the Regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;"Employment Time"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, the RD concluded that irrespective of whether "employment time" is viewed as "the entire shift in which the employees are in a paid duty status[,]" or whether it excludes "time spent sleeping or engaging in non-work activity[,]" the Captains do not spend a preponderance of their employment time exercising supervisory authority. Stated otherwise, the RD found that the maximum two to three hours per day that the Captains spend exercising supervisory authority does not satisfy the statutory definition of supervisor because the Captains do not spend a majority of their employment time--whether defined broadly as the entire time for which they are being paid, or narrowly as only the time they are actively working--exercising supervisory authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the Authority should grant its application for review because the RD erred in interpreting the Captains' "employment time" as their entire shift, rather than just their active duty time. However, the Activity fails to acknowledge that the RD expressly applied the "active duty time" period favored by the Activity and concluded that "even if time spent sleeping or engaging in non-work activity is excluded, the Captains still do not spend a preponderance of their employment time exercising supervisory authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, the RD specifically found that the Captains do not meet the statutory definition of supervisor, whether "employment time" is defined broadly as the entire time for which they are being paid, or narrowly as only the time they are actively working. Moreover, in addition to failing to acknowledge that the RD expressly applied the standard that the Activity asserts is the correct standard, the Activity fails to demonstrate that the RD misapplied that standard. As such, the Activity's claim fails to establish that review of the RD's decision is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Authority has applied the term "employment time" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) in several decisions involving firefighters or nurses. For example, with regard to firefighters, in determining whether assistant fire chiefs who worked 24-hour shifts were supervisors under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute, the Authority has held that "employment time" means their "active duty time[.]" <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, 8 FLRA at 278. In addition, where fire captains worked 24-hour shifts composed of 8 hours active duty, 8 hours standby, and 8 hours sleep, the Authority interpreted "employment time" to mean "workday[.]" <span class="Italic">Phila. Naval Shipyard</span>, 4 FLRA at 484. In determining whether fire captains who worked 24-hour shifts were supervisors within the meaning of the Statute, the Authority described "employment time" as "their overall employment time" and found that the employees were not supervisors because "their overall employment time is spent in either routinely administering [a]ctivity directives, performing routine and clerical duties, or waiting to respond to an alarm call." <span class="Italic">Newport</span>, 3 FLRA at 327. With regard to nurses, to whom the term "employment time" also applies, the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span> adopted the judge's determination that a head nurse's "'employment time' is the 8 hour day shift which she works and for which she is being compensated." <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>, 8 FLRA at 665.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">These decisions demonstrate that, for firefighters and nurses, the term "employment time" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) reflects work time as determined by the record in a particular case. The facts and circumstances presented in each case determine what activities and period of time should be considered in determining work time for the individuals at issue. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Nat'l Park Serv., Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, Agoura Hills, Cal.</span>, 50 FLRA 164, 171 (1995) (in remanding a case to a Regional Director to determine whether a firefighter devotes a preponderance of his employment time to exercising supervisory authority, the Authority directed the Regional Director to take into account "only [the individual's] duties during the fire season while [the individual] is in charge of seasonal employees").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, we need not resolve the precise period of time that constitutes "employment time" for the Captains, because the RD expressly found that the Captains do not exercise supervisory authority for a preponderance of their employment time irrespective of whether employment time is defined as the amount of time the firefighters are actively working or as the entire time the firefighters are in a paid duty status. The Activity has not established that the RD erred in making this determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the Activity's allegation does not establish that review is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The RD did not fail to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;The RD did not apply the wrong legal standard in interpreting &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Activity's assertion that the RD "misread" the statutory definition of supervisor and erroneously required the Activity to demonstrate that the Captains spend a preponderance of their employment time "not just exercising supervisory authority[,] but also consistently exercising their independent judgment" in order to establish that they are supervisors.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Activity's assertion, in applying &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10), the Authority has consistently applied the standard set forth by the RD, requiring that the employee: (1) engage in supervisory authority that requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment; and (2) spend a preponderance of their employment time exercising such authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Camp Pendleton</span>, 8 FLRA at 278 (assistant fire chiefs were found to be supervisors where "they spent a preponderance of their active duty time in the exercise of supervisory authority requiring the consistent use of independent judgment"). <span class="Italic">See also, Veterans Admin., Wash., D.C. and Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Salisbury, N.C.</span>, 11 FLRA 176, 178 (1983) (nurses found to be supervisors where they "devote[d] a preponderance of their employment time to the exercise of such supervisory authority which is not merely routine or clerical in nature, but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Activity's claim fails to establish that review is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;The RD did not fail to apply <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>, the Authority adopted the judge's rejection of the intervenor's argument that time spent "thinking about...supervisory responsibilities"--rather than actually doing them--should not be counted toward the amount of time a nurse exercises supervisory authority. <span class="Italic">Fayetteville</span>, 8 FLRA at 662 (internal quotations omitted). Specifically, the judge stated:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">I am constrained to address [i]ntervenor's argument that when a supervisor is "thinking" about her supervisory responsibilities, the time spent should be placed in the nonsupervisory category on the theory that thinking is not "doing." Frankly, the notion that "thinking" is some sort of mental downtime strikes me as too far fetched to deserve any serious or extended discussion. I reject this contention.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts that the RD failed to apply this holding--that time spent thinking about supervisory activities constitutes time spent exercising supervisory authority--and instead found that employees must spend a majority of their 24-hour day engaging in supervisory activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the RD, we find that the Activity has not presented any evidence demonstrating that the Captains spend a significant amount of time thinking about supervisory duties. The only argument the Activity appears to assert in support of this contention is that one of the Captains testified that his evaluation of the performance of his firefighters is not <span id="Page_26"></span>just done when he meets with a firefighter to discuss performance, but it also involves his daily observances of the firefighter. However, the Activity's assertion is not supported by any evidence or argument that the Captain's daily observation of firefighters constitutes the exercise of supervisory authority, that such authority is not merely routine or clerical nature, and that such authority requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment. Moreover, the Activity has not offered any estimation with regard to how much time the Captains actually spend observing firefighters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Activity's assertion does not establish that review is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">3.&#x2003;The RD did not fail to apply <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Activity asserts that the RD failed to apply <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, in which the Authority found that assistant fire chiefs who spent a preponderance of their "active duty time" exercising supervisory authority were supervisors. The Activity also alleges that activities found to be supervisory in that case were found by the RD in the present case to be routine and administrative in nature.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Activity's claim challenges the RD's application of the term "employment time" to the Captains' entire 24-hour shift--as opposed to their "active duty time"--as set forth above, the RD found that under either standard, the Captains do not spend a preponderance of their employment time engaged in supervisory authority. Accordingly, the Activity's claim does not establish that review is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent the Activity asserts that the Captains engaged in the same type of activities that were found to be supervisory in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, we reject this assertion. In this regard, the Authority found that the assistant fire chiefs in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span> were supervisors because they spent a preponderance of their employment time engaged in the exercise of supervisory authority. Such authority included assigning and temporarily transferring personnel from one engine company to another and frequently visiting fire stations to assure implementation, maintenance, and upkeep of fire equipment. Here, the Activity has presented no evidence that the Captains engage in such activities.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this respect, the activities that the Captains in the present case engage in are more similar to those of the fire captains in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>who the Authority found were not supervisors. In this regard, in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, as here, the captains had the authority to direct and assign firefighting personnel in certain situations, but the evidence demonstrated that the exercise of such authority was routine or clerical in nature and did not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, as in the present case, the captains had no authority to hire, discharge, layoff, transfer, or furlough employees. Also, while the captains in <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span> had the authority "effectively to recommend" actions with respect to promotions, discipline, and awards, the captains' authority was subject to two higher levels of review. <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, 8 FLRA at 278. In the present case, the RD found that the amount of time the Captains spent performing duties related to performance appraisals, discipline, and hiring has amounted to less than 20 hours in the 8 months since the positions were filled. The RD also found that the Captains "do not effectively recommend awards." Further, the RD found that there have been no grievances, promotions, transfers, furloughs, layoffs, recalls, suspensions, or removals since the Captain positions were filled.[9]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[9]&#x2003;Although not specifically raised here, we note that the Authority has consistently held that unit determinations are based on the duties actually assigned to employees at the time of the representation hearing, rather than on plans to assign duties sometime in the future. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Agric., Food Safety &#x0026; Inspection Serv.</span>, 61 FLRA 397, 400 (2005). Future duties may be considered only where it is established that there are "definite and imminent changes planned by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Contract Mgmt. Command, Def. Contract Mgmt. Dist., N. Cent. Def. Plant Representative Office-Thiokol, Brigham City, Utah</span>, 41 FLRA 316, 327 (1991)).</p>
<p class="noindent">Other analysis of the unit status of supervisory firefighters, referred to as station chiefs, is provided by <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Lee and IAF Local F-287</span>, 63 FLRA 145, 145-46, 148 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is the certified exclusive representative of a unit of non-supervisory firefighters within the Agency's Fire Department. The Fire Department consists of two stations and operates twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week. With the exception of the Fire Chief, who heads the department, all Fire Department personnel work a 72-hour tour of duty. Each 24-hour shift runs from 7:30 <span class="small-d">A.M.</span> to 7:30 <span class="small-d">P.M.</span> the next day and consists of eight hours of active work time and sixteen hours of personal stand-by time. Each tour is normally staffed with an Assistant Chief, a Station Chief, two Captains, and seven firefighters. The Captains and the firefighters report to the Station Chief; the Station Chief reports to the Assistant Chief; and the Assistant Chief reports to the Fire Chief. The Captains and the Firefighters are included in the bargaining unit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Station Chief position was a new position created under the National Security Personnel System that had been filled for the first time approximately six months prior to the hearing in this case. The two incumbents of the position had both previously been Captains. The Union filed a petition seeking to clarify the bargaining unit status of the Station Chief position, arguing that the Agency had removed the two incumbents of that position from the bargaining unit and the General Schedule pay system even though they are not supervisors under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. The parties agreed that the testimony of one of the Station Chiefs would be representative of the duties performed by both employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Station Chiefs are responsible for ensuring that the firefighters perform their duties correctly. The Station Chiefs assign the Captains to ensure that the firefighters carry out the "daily detail," which entails cleaning the station and verifying that the fire apparatus are in working order. The Station Chiefs "check up" on the firefighters to make sure that the work is being accomplished, but do not assist in carrying out these functions. The Station Chief testified that he spends "probably at least 5 to 10 percent of [his] day...walking the floor, making sure [that] things are getting accomplished, redirecting people, and counseling them on why things need to be done, why things need to happen."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Station Chiefs are also responsible for preparing and making adjustments to work schedules in order to maintain the minimum staffing requirements of thirteen firefighters per shift. For example, if an employee were to call in sick, then the Station Chief would be required to "juggle the crews," which may entail assigning an employee to work overtime and/or assigning another employee to work the empty position. Further, the Station Chiefs oversee time and attendance and approve leave requests. The Station Chiefs have the authority to deny leave based on staffing needs. They may also recall personnel in emergencies to maintain staffing levels. The Station Chiefs are also charged with ensuring that all firefighters receive necessary training. Based on their independent judgment and assessment, the Station Chiefs assign duties to a specific firefighter based on that firefighter's knowledge or expertise. For example, the Station Chief testified that, on a weekly basis, he assigns a particular firefighter to check the fire tower based on that firefighter's knowledge and expertise of the fire tower.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Station Chiefs are the performance rating officials for a total of approximately seven firefighters and Captains. As such, they meet with the employees at the beginning of the performance year, conduct a six-month progress review of each employee, and evaluate each employee at the end of the performance year. Because the Station Chief who testified had only held his position for approximately six months at the time of the hearing, he had only had the opportunity to perform the initial performance year meetings with employees. The Station Chief testified that he had spent approximately twenty-one hours to prepare for and conduct those meetings. The Station Chiefs can also recommend employees for awards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Station Chiefs also have the authority to discipline employees. In this regard, the Station Chief testified that he had spent a maximum of three hours preparing and issuing two counselings in the six months prior to the hearing. The Station Chiefs also have the authority to hear and resolve Step 1 grievances. At the time of the hearing, the Station Chiefs had not resolved any grievances. In addition, the Station Chiefs have the authority to sit on hiring panels and make hiring recommendations to the Fire Chief. At the time of the hearing, the Station Chiefs had not participated in any hiring panels. The Station Chiefs do not have the authority to discharge, layoff, transfer, or furlough employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the RD, the Station Chiefs perform duties that are directly related to fire safety and unrelated to their supervision of other employees. In this regard, the Station Chiefs are responsible for the vehicle maintenance program and the hazardous material program. In carrying out these responsibilities, the Station Chiefs ensure that all apparatus and equipment are operational at all times and coordinates maintenance activities. They ensure that all hazardous material response equipment and vehicles are operational at all times and oversee the design and implementation of an improved response unit. In addition, the Station Chiefs respond to emergency calls and "assume responsibility for operations at the scene until the Assistant Chief arrives."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth above, with respect to firefighters, &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) provides that "only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising" supervisory authority will be found to be supervisors." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10). The Agency claims that <span class="Italic">Parks Reserve</span>, 61 FLRA 537, warrants reconsideration because the Authority did not clarify in that case whether the term "employment time" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) means an employee's 24-hour shift or an employee's active duty time. For the reasons that follow, we reject the Agency's claim.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Parks Reserve</span>, the Authority held that the term "employment time" in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) means "work time as determined by the record in a <span id="Page_27"></span>particular case." 61 FLRA at 542. Applying this precedent here, the RD found, and the parties agree, that only the Station Chief's active duty time was, and should have been, considered in determining whether he devotes a preponderance of his employment time to supervisory duties. In these circumstances, we conclude, for purposes of this decision, that "employment time" means the Station Chiefs' active work time. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, Cal.</span>, 8 FLRA 276, 278 (1982) (for firefighters working a 24-hour shift, "employment time" means their "active duty time"); <span class="Italic">Phila. Naval Shipyard</span>, 4 FLRA 484, 485, 487 (1980) (interpreting "employment time" for firefighters working 24-hour shifts composed of 8 hours active duty, 8 hours standby, and 8 hours sleep time as "workday"). Accordingly, we find that Authority precedent does not warrant reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that the Station Chief "estimated that he spent about 25 percent of his time on supervisory duties[.]" As argued by the Agency, the Station Chief actually testified that his supervisory duties "have increased at least 25 percent[.]" Thus, the RD erroneously stated that the Station Chief testified that "he spent about 25 percent of his time on supervisory duties[,]"...when, in fact, the Station Chief testified that his supervisory duties "have increased at least 25 percent[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In finding that the Station Chief does not devote a preponderance of his employment time to supervisory duties, the RD also rejected the Station Chief's testimony that "at least 50 percent" of his day is in supervision. In so doing, the RD failed to note the Station Chief's testimony that "at least 50 percent of [his day] is [in] supervision...and the other portion of it is either spent [in] administrative duties or in support of those supervisory tasks...." Accordingly, the RD erred in basing his decision, in part, on the Station Chief's testimony that he spends "at least 50 percent" of his day in "supervision" without also including the testimony that "the other portion of the day is either spent [in] administrative duties or in support of those supervisory tasks...."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the RD's errors, particularly the latter one, support a conclusion that, contrary to the RD's ultimate conclusion, the Station Chiefs do, in fact, spend a preponderance of their active duty time performing supervisory duties, these factual errors demonstrate that review is warranted. On review, as the evidence demonstrates that the Station Chiefs perform supervisory duties a preponderance of the time, the Station Chiefs should be excluded from the bargaining unit as supervisors under &#x00A7; 7112(b)(1) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Air Force Materiel Command and IAF</span>, 67 FLRA 117, 120-21 (2013), excluded some firefighters as either supervisors or confidential employees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Firefighters are supervisors when: (1) they have the authority to engage in any of the supervisory functions listed in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10); (2) their exercise of such authority is not merely routine or clerical in nature but requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment; and (3) they spend a preponderance of their employment time exercising that authority.[36] The RD found that the Wright-Patterson station chiefs satisfy all three of these criteria, and the Union argues this finding is contrary to law for several reasons.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[36]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Offutt Air Force Base, Neb</span>., 66 FLRA 616, 620 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Offutt</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">First, the Union contends that the RD erred by relying on Authority decisions concerning supervisors who were not firefighters. In that regard, the Union correctly observes that only firefighters and nurses must devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising the supervisory authorities listed in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) to be supervisors. But other than the preponderance requirement, the remainder of the Statute's definition of "supervisor" applies to both firefighters and non-firefighters. As the RD relied on decisions involving firefighters and nurses when applying the preponderance requirement, and only relied on decisions involving employees in other occupations when applying &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10)'s remaining criteria, there is no basis to find that the RD's reliance on particular decisions was inconsistent with established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Second, the Union argues that several of the duties that the RD attributes to the Wright-Patterson station chiefs are "work[-]leader" responsibilities rather than supervisory responsibilities, and if the RD had recognized that distinction, then he would have found that the station chiefs are not supervisors. But even if the RD had attached a "work[-]leader" label to the station chiefs' duties, there is no basis for finding that he would have reached a different conclusion on their supervisory status.[38] In this regard, an "employee is classified based on the actual duties he or she performs, not on how he or she is labeled."[39] Thus, the RD's decision not to characterize certain duties as work-leader functions does not establish a failure to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[38]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Energy, W. Area Power Admin., Lakewood, Colo</span>., 60 FLRA 6, 8-9 (2004) ("team leaders" excluded from unit as supervisors); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army, Army Aviation Sys. Command</span>, 36 FLRA 587, 592-94 (1990) (whether "team leaders" are supervisors depends on applying &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) criteria to facts of each case); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army, Office of the Project Manager, Patriot Air Def. Missile Sys., DARCOM Redstone Arsenal, Ala</span>., 11 FLRA 166, 167-68 (1983) ("[t]eam [l]eaders" and "[g]roup [l]eaders" excluded from unit as supervisors (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[39]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Offutt</span>, 66 FLRA at 623 (citing <span class="Italic">VA Med. Ctr., Prescott, Ariz</span>., 29 FLRA 1313, 1315 (1987)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Third, the Union contends that the Wright-Patterson station chiefs are not supervisors because they "do not devote a preponderance of their employment time [to] exercising" supervisory authorities. However, the RD credited testimony to the contrary, and the Authority has held that a party's challenge to the weight an RD affords to certain evidence is insufficient to demonstrate an error in the RD's unit-determination analysis. Thus, this contention provides no basis for finding the RD's decision deficient.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Fourth, the Union challenges the RD's finding that certain duties of the Wright-Patterson station chiefs are supervisory even though they are "subject to revision and review by at least two higher levels of authority." The text of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) itself contemplates that supervisory authority may be exercised subject to review because among the supervisory indicia listed there is the "authority...to <span class="Italic">effectively recommend</span>" that others exercise supervisory authority.[44] And in fact, the Union concedes that the station chiefs have "authority effectively to recommend" promotions, discipline, and awards. Moreover, an "employee need exercise only one of the responsibilities set forth in &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) in conjunction with independent judgment in order to be found a supervisor,"[46] and the RD's determination that the Wright-Patterson station chiefs are supervisors relied on several supervisory authorities exercised without higher-level approval, such as issuing reprimands and granting on-the-spot awards. For these reasons, the Union's challenge does not establish a deficiency in the RD's decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[44]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) (emphasis added); <span class="Italic">see U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area Office, Gallup, N.M.,</span> 45 FLRA 646, 650-56 (1992).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Fifth, the Union objects to the RD's treatment of "incident[-]commander" duties as supervisory. According to the Union, "serving as an incident commander is a functional[,] occupationally specific matter not related at all to supervisory duties." But the Union's objection does not undermine the RD's finding that "incident commander[s]...direct" employees, which is a supervisory function.[50] And although the Union also argues that non-supervisors may serve as incident commanders, the RD found that when a lower level employee does so, the station chief continues to exercise his authority through "contact with th[at] employee by radio." Thus, the Union's objection does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Section 7103(a)(13) of the Statute defines "confidential employee[s]" as those who act "in a confidential capacity with respect to an individual who formulates or effectuates management policies in the field of labor-management relations." The Authority has held that an individual is a confidential employee when: (1) there is evidence of a confidential working relationship between the employee and an agency representative; and (2) that agency representative is significantly involved in labor-management relations.[53] Moreover, an employee who "actually formulates or effectuates" management's labor-relations policies would also be "confidential."[54]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Applying the foregoing standards, the RD found that the Wright-Patterson training chief negotiates aspects of the training plan with the Union before it is submitted to the Wright-Patterson fire chief, and that the fire chief is significantly involved in labor-management relations. Thus, the RD found that the Wright-Patterson training chief has a confidential working relationship with an agency representative who is significantly involved in labor-management relations. With regard to the Tinker station chiefs, the RD found that they obtain advance knowledge of management's positions on labor-relations matters when they attend regular management meetings, indicating that they have a confidential working relationship with the Tinker fire chief, who is significantly involved in labor-management relations. Accordingly, the RD found that these three firefighters should be excluded from the Union's bargaining unit as confidential employees, under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Wright-Patterson training chief is not a confidential employee because he "has never been involved in negotiations," although he "coordinates," "consult[s]," and exchanges information with the Union "on changes to the [training] schedule or programming." Notwithstanding this attempt to characterize the training chief's interactions with the Union as something other than "negotiations," the Union does not contest the RD's factual finding that the training chief and Union must "<span class="Italic">agree</span> to a [training] plan" "before it is ever submitted to the [f]ire [c]hief for his approval." That finding supports the RD's conclusion that the training chief negotiates aspects of the training plan.[63] Moreover, the Authority has previously found that a training manager was a confidential employee based, in part, on her interactions "with the Union in a collaborative process to draft an operating instruction...regarding training."[64] This precedent provides additional support for the RD's determination.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[63]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See GSA, Nat'l Archives &#x0026; Records Serv., Wash., D.C.</span>, 8 FLRA 333, 335 (1982) (employee who negotiated with union on management's behalf excluded from unit as confidential employee).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that the Wright-Patterson training chief is not a confidential employee because he is not "'significantly involved' in matters of labor relations." Section 7103(a)(13) requires that a confidential employee have a working relationship with an <span class="Italic">agency representative</span> "significantly involved in labor-management relations,"[66] but does not require that the alleged confidential employee also be significantly involved in labor-management relations. The Union does not challenge the RD's determination that the Wright-Patterson fire chief is significantly involved in labor-management relations, which supports the RD's conclusion that the training chief has a confidential working relationship with an agency representative (the fire chief) who is significantly involved in labor-management relations. Thus, the Union's argument does not demonstrate that the RD failed to apply established law in this regard.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[66]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">NASA</span>, 57 FLRA at 573.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Tinker station chiefs, the Union challenges their exclusion as confidential employees because "mere attendance at meetings with managers does not illustrate that the station chiefs are significantly involved in matters regarding labor relations." But as stated above, an employee need not be significantly involved in labor-management relations to be a confidential employee under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13). To the extent that the Union is arguing that the Tinker station chiefs do not spend enough time working in a confidential capacity to be excluded under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13), the Authority has held that the frequency and amount of time that an employee spends performing in such a capacity "may be relevant," but is "not controlling."[69] We note, in this regard, that &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13)'s definition of "confidential employee"--unlike &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10)'s definition of supervisor--does not contain a requirement that a confidential employee perform confidential work for a "preponderance" of his work time. Therefore, these arguments do not support a finding that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[69]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See DOL, Arlington</span>, 37 FLRA at 1382.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also questions why the RD discussed the Tinker fire chief's involvement in labor-management relations, inasmuch as the fire chief's "inclusion or exclusion" from the bargaining unit was not at issue. The RD addressed that issue because the standards for applying &#x00A7; 7103(a)(13) required a determination of whether the station chiefs have a confidential working relationship with an agency representative who is significantly involved in labor-management relations. Thus, the RD's decision to address the fire chief's duties was appropriate.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, at several points in its application, often relying on prior Authority decisions for support, the Union challenges the exclusion of the eight firefighters at issue here with the argument that, in other instances, firefighters with identical job titles or seemingly identical position descriptions were included in bargaining units. However, bargaining-unit-eligibility determinations are not based on evidence such as written position descriptions, because such evidence might not reflect the employee's actual duties.[74] In addition, the RDs and the Authority resolve unit-eligibility questions on a case-by-case basis by applying the statutory criteria to the record developed in each case,[75] and the Union has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply the pertinent statutory eligibility criteria to the particular employees at issue here. For example, the RD found that the Wright-Patterson station chiefs spend a preponderance of their employment time exercising supervisory authority, which distinguishes this case from several of the Authority decisions that the Union cites. And the RD also found that the Wright-Patterson station chiefs' supervisory duties require them to consistently exercise independent judgment, which distinguishes this case from the remaining Authority decisions that the Union cites. Consequently, the Union has not demonstrated that the RD failed to apply established law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factual matters</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity contends that the RD's conclusion that Station Chiefs do not devote a preponderance of their time to supervisory duties is based on "numerous erroneous mistakes of fact." The Activity claims primarily that the RD did not credit properly Station Chief F's testimony with respect to the amount of time he spends on certain supervisory duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., id. </span>at 54 (asserting that RD "summarily dismissed" Station Chief F's claim that he spends 51 percent of his employment time performing supervisory duties); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 54-55 (averring that RD did not give "full credit" to Station Chief's testimony regarding amount of time spent on supervisory duties); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 56 (RD's conclusions regarding time Station Chief F spent assigning work to subordinates was "short-sighted"); <span class="Italic">id. </span>at 61 (claiming that RD diminished Station Chief's role in averting disciplinary problems). These assertions challenge the weight that the RD attributed to certain evidence and do not provide a basis for concluding that the RD committed clear errors in making factual findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, N. Cal. Health Care Sys., Martinez, Cal.</span>, 66 FLRA 522, 525 (2012) (<span class="Italic">Martinez</span>) (Member Beck dissenting on other grounds) (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also contends that the RD erroneously concluded that Station Chiefs do not perform any joint duties or make joint decisions with higher-ranking officers. However, the Activity does not dispute that the RD found that Station Chiefs perform "coordinate[d]" duties with the Assistant Chief, such as creating daily schedules. The Activity does not explain how the RD's classification of these duties as coordinated duties rather than as joint duties establishes that his conclusion regarding how much time is devoted to them is erroneous. The Activity also claims that the RD did not consider the Station Chief's participation in roll call. Contrary to the Activity's claim, the RD <span class="Italic">did </span>consider this participation. <span class="Italic">See </span>RD's Decision at 5 (noting that a senior official or Station Chief F "conducts roll call"); <span class="Italic">id</span>. (noting that Station Chief F "may or may not conduct roll call"); <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 20 (noting that there was no record evidence regarding Station Chiefs' duties during roll call). Moreover, the Activity does not dispute the RD's finding that the record does not establish how much time Station Chiefs actually spend on roll call duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Activity has not established that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.&#x2003;</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Established law </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity claims that the RD's conclusion that Station Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute is based on a misapplication of established law. We find that, contrary to the Activity's arguments, the RD's conclusion is consistent with Authority precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As stated above, in assessing whether a firefighter is a supervisor within <span id="Page_29"></span>the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute, the Authority examines whether that employee: (1) engages in supervisory authority that requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment; and (2) spends a preponderance of his or her employment time exercising that authority. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Army, Parks Reserve Training Ctr., Dublin, Cal.,</span> 61 FLRA 537, 543 (2006) (<span class="Italic">Parks Reserve</span>) (Chairman Cabaniss concurring) (citation omitted). Although the Activity challenges the RD's determination that Station Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10), it does not dispute the RD's conclusion that they engage in supervisory authority that requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment. Thus, we solely examine whether Station Chiefs devote a preponderance of their employment time exercising that authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has stated that "preponderance" refers to the "majority" of an employee's employment time. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Seagoville, Tex.</span>, 65 FLRA 239, 241 (2010) (citations omitted). Thus, the Authority will find that a firefighter may be included in a bargaining unit if he or she does not spend a majority of his or her employment time performing supervisory duties. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parks Reserve</span>, 61 FLRA at 543-44 (firefighters were not supervisors because record established that they did not spend preponderance of time on supervisory duties); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, Cal.</span>, 8 FLRA 276, 278 (1982) (<span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>) (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Relying on this framework, the RD reviewed the time Station Chiefs spend on supervisory duties per year and concluded that they do not spend a preponderance of their time on those duties. Specifically, the RD found that they spend 20 hours per year supervising firefighters during emergency calls, 30 hours per year preparing performance appraisals and awards, and less than 90 hours per year creating work schedules for employees. The RD also found that Station Chiefs spend a minimal amount of time granting leave and overtime requests, resolving disciplinary matters, and participating in hiring boards. Additionally, he found that the daily administrative oversight Station Chiefs provide does not require the consistent exercise of independent judgment. Moreover, the RD determined that Station Chief F's claim that he spends more than 51 percent of each day performing supervisory duties was not supported by the record. As discussed above, the Activity has not established that the RD's factual findings are erroneous. Thus, the RD's findings support his conclusion that Station Chiefs do not devote a preponderance of their employment time performing supervisory duties. As a result, the RD concluded properly that, under established law, Station Chiefs do not meet the definition of "supervisor" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parks Reserve</span>, 61 FLRA at 541 (finding regional director applied established law by concluding that firefighters were not supervisors because preponderance of their time was not devoted to supervisory duties); <span class="Italic">Camp Pendleton</span>, 8 FLRA at 278 (same).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also asserts that this matter is analogous to the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Fort Lee</span>. Application at 58-59. In <span class="Italic">Fort Lee</span>, the Authority determined that a regional director's conclusion regarding how much time a supervisory firefighter devoted to supervisory duties was based on substantial factual errors. <span class="Italic">See Fort Lee</span>, 63 FLRA at 148. Unlike the circumstances in <span class="Italic">Fort Lee</span>, the Activity has not established that the RD made any factual errors. Thus, the Activity's reliance on <span class="Italic">Fort Lee </span>is misplaced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the RD's conclusion that Station Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute is not based on a misapplication of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial errors concerning <span id="Page_30"></span>substantial factual matters and did not fail to apply established law with respect to the Crew Chiefs.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factual matters</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity asserts that the RD's determination that Crew Chiefs do not spend a preponderance of their time performing supervisory duties is based on substantial factual errors. As with the Station Chiefs, the Activity primarily challenges the weight the RD attributed to certain evidence. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Application at 67 (accusing RD of "summarily dismiss[ing]" Crew Chief B's testimony regarding how much time he spent performing supervisory duties during emergency calls in favor of another employee's testimony); 73 (challenging RD's conclusions regarding how much time Crew Chief spends away from subordinates receiving CPR and emergency training); 79, 82 (averring that RD inappropriately "diminished" time Crew Chief spent preparing appraisals and performance awards). As stated above, these challenges do not provide a basis for concluding that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Martinez</span>, 66 FLRA at 525.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also argues that the RD erred by concluding that Crew Chiefs have no official role during roll call and do not supervise firefighters directly during this time. However, the RD found that Crew Chiefs participate in roll call and may supervise an employee directly if a problem arises during that time. The Activity also contends that the RD erroneously concluded that Crew Chiefs do not assign cleaning duties or supervise firefighters during morning cleaning duties. The RD found that cleaning duties are "pre-assigned" by Station Chiefs, but that Crew Chiefs act as "team leader" during the cleaning period and that each firefighter knows what to do without any "direct supervision." The Activity offers no evidence concerning how much time Crew Chiefs actually devote to making cleaning assignments. Moreover, although the Activity offers evidence that Crew Chiefs may assign some cleaning duties, it offers no evidence that Crew Chiefs supervise employees directly while they perform these duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity further avers that the RD inappropriately included as part of the Crew Chiefs' workday their one hour of daily physical training. According to the Activity, this inclusion incorrectly increases the Crew Chiefs' workday from six hours to seven. This assertion is without merit. The RD specifically considered this issue, noting that a Crew Chief's duty day lasts "six hours or seven hours." RD's Decision at 18; <span class="Italic">see also id. </span>at 18 n.16 (noting that parties disagreed whether the hour of daily physical training made the duty day six or seven hours). Further, the RD stated that his conclusion that Crew Chiefs do not spend more than 50 percent of their "active duty day" on supervisor duties was based on his determination that Crew Chiefs have "<span class="Italic">six hours </span>of active duty per day."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Activity has not established that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Established law </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity contends that the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute was based on a misapplication of law. As with the Station Chiefs, although the Activity challenges the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) of the Statute, it does not dispute the RD's conclusion that that they engage in supervisory authority that requires the consistent exercise of independent judgment. Thus, we solely examine whether Crew Chiefs devote a preponderance of their employment time exercising that authority. We find that the RD's conclusion is consistent with established law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD found that Crew Chiefs work 1,080 hours per year, but that no more than 400 of those hours are devoted to supervisory duties. The RD reached this conclusion by examining the record and finding that Crew Chiefs spend approximately 20 hours per year supervising firefighters during emergency calls, 38 hours per year preparing performance evaluations and awards, 3 hours per year preparing workers' compensation paperwork, and 315 hours per year directly supervising firefighters during daily training. The RD also found that Crew Chiefs spend "little or no time in directing the work of...subordinates," or addressing disciplinary matters. He also found that they serve on only one hiring board per year.<span class="Italic"> </span>Moreover, the RD rejected Crew Chief's B testimony that he spent 100 percent of his time "thinking and acting" as a supervisor. The Activity has not established that the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs do not spend a preponderance of their duty time performing supervisory duties was based on substantial factual errors. The record therefore supports the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs do not devote a preponderance of their employment time to supervisory duties. Thus, the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) is consistent with law. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Parks Reserve</span>, 61 FLRA at 541.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also asserts that this matter is analogous to <span class="Italic">Fort Lee</span>. However, for the reasons discussed above, the Activity's reliance on <span class="Italic">Fort Lee </span>is misplaced.[7]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;Relying on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, the Activity also argues that the RD should have considered the time Crew Chiefs spent performing duties with subordinate firefighters as time spent performing supervisory duties. <span class="Italic">See </span>Application at 67-69 (citing <span class="Italic">VAMC</span>, 8 FLRA at 664-65). The record contains no indication that the Activity presented this argument to the RD. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, Activity's Post-Hearing Brief at 20-22, 24-27 (setting forth arguments as to why Activity believed Crew Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of the Statute). Under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations, "[t]he Authority will not consider any...arguments...that could have been, but were not, presented in the proceedings before the [RD]." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.5. <span class="Italic">See also </span>5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2422.31(b) (an application for review of an RD's decision "may not raise any issue...not timely presented to the...[RD]").

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the RD's conclusion that Crew Chiefs are not supervisors within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(10) is not based on a misapplication of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The RD did not commit clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters and did not fail to apply established law with respect to the Assistant Training Chief.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">1.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Factual matters </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity claims that the RD's conclusion regarding the Assistant Training Chief is based on substantial factual errors. However, unlike its claims regarding the Station Chiefs and Crew Chiefs, the Activity does not cite any factual errors that the RD made. Rather, it challenges solely the legal conclusion that the RD reached based on the record. We therefore find that the Activity has not established that the RD committed clear and prejudicial errors concerning substantial factual matters. <span class="Italic">Cf. Martinez</span>, 66 FLRA at 525.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Established law </span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the RD failed to apply established law when he concluded that the Assistant Training Chief is not a management official within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11) of the Statute. Although the Activity discusses the legal framework for exclusion under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11) of the Statute, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>at 48-52 (citations omitted), it does not explain how the RD's decision conflicts with any of this precedent, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>at 88-101.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD's conclusion that the Assistant Training Chief is not a management official within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11) is consistent with Authority precedent. As the RD stated, an employee is a management official within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11) of the Statute if he or she formulates, determines, or influences an activity's policies. However, that employee is not a management official if he or she merely implements activity policies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, Wash., D.C.</span>, 60 FLRA 749, 751 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Veterans Affairs</span>); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Credit Union Admin.</span>, 59 FLRA 858, 861-62 (2004) (<span class="Italic">NCUA</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity argues that the Assistant Training Chief is a management official because he effectuates Activity policy by developing "various training scenarios resulting in [the] formulation/reformulation of the [Activity's] training program." However, as the RD found, the Assistant Training Chief actually does not create Activity policies; rather, he merely drafts training schedules and materials that implement pre-existing policies and rules. Specifically, he generally implements policies and guidelines that have "already been developed" nationally by the Air Force or local sources, such as the Coast Guard. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 14-15, 21; <span class="Italic">see also </span>Application at 99 (acknowledging that seventy percent of Assistant Training Chief's training is "prescribed by [the] Air Force while the other [thirty] percent is local"). Moreover, although the Assistant Training Chief may conduct training drills and exercises based on the guidelines and materials he creates, those drills also are based on policies that were created by the Air Force and local sources. Accordingly, the RD properly concluded that the Assistant Training Chief is not responsible for creating Activity policies. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 FLRA at 751 (employee that drafted documents that implemented activity policies was not a management official); <span class="Italic">NCUA</span>, 59 FLRA at 861-62.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Activity also avers that the Assistant Training Chief is a management official because an Air Force instruction classifies him as "management staff." However, an employee is classified based on the actual duties he or she performs, not on how he or she is labeled by an activity or activity documents. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Veterans Admin. Med. Ctr., Prescott, Ariz.</span>, 29 FLRA 1313, 1315 (1987) (citations omitted). Thus, the Activity's reliance on the description set forth in the instruction is unavailing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the RD's conclusion that the Assistant Training Chief is not a management official within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7103(a)(11) of the Statute is not based on a misapplication of law.</p>

Although the fire captains were senior employees, assigned full-time to fire stations and responsible for coordinating administrative matters with assistant fire chiefs, the captains did not hire, promote, suspend, remove, transfer, furlough, layoff, or recall employees. The captains had the authority to issue oral and written reprimands, they could issue performance evaluations, and they assigned tasks to firefighters. Fire captains also directed activities before the assistant fire chief arrived; however, the activities conducted before the assistant chief appeared were routine, established in drills and pre-fire programs. Under the specific provisions of the statutory definition of supervisor, although certain portions of the captains' job functions were supervisory, their overall employment time was spent in routine administration, performing routine and clerical duties or waiting to respond to an alarm. The captains, not being statutory supervisors, were within a unit with firefighters. In <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Armor Ctr., Ft. Knox, Ky. and AFGE Local 2302</span>, 4 FLRA 116, 119-20 (1980), GS-6 Fire Crew Chiefs were not supervisors. They worked alongside firefighters, had limited authority to direct firefighting operations, did not effectively hire or recommend hiring, did not reward or discipline employees, and did not adjust grievances or attend supervisory meetings. They performed some training and assigned some work, but those functions were routine, nonsupervisory.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fire captains were not supervisors in <span class="Italic">Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters, Local F-61</span>, 4 FLRA 484, 485-86 (1980). Captains were responsible for routine tasks performed by their companies, they performed some training and, under the supervision of an assistant fire chief, the captains could direct portions of firefighting efforts. But the captains did not hire, promote, suspend, remove, transfer, recall, or layoff employees. The captains had authority to issue letters of caution and reprimand, and to impose suspensions of up to two days. Although the captains had some supervisory authority, including the ability to adjust some grievances and to impose some discipline, the preponderance of their workday did not involve the exercise of supervisory authority, but instead was spent performing routine administrative and clerical duties and performing other work pertaining to firefighting. Because they did not devote a preponderance of their time to supervisory activities, they were in the bargaining unit. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fire Dept.

<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 7103(a)(10), "supervisor" is defined to require the consistent exercise of independent judgment that is not merely routine or clerical in nature, "except that, with respect to any unit which includes firefighters or nurses, the term 'supervisor' includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising such authority." An issue arose concerning whether the limitation extended to any unit, no matter how composed, that happened to include firefighters or nurses, or whether the limitation applied only to firefighters and nurses within units. Interpreting legislative history and seeking to avoid inconsistent holdings regarding supervisory status depending only on the chance event that a unit might or might not include firefighters or nurses, FLRA determined that the limitation in the definition of supervisor applied only to firefighters and nurses and not to all persons who might be included in the unit and who might exercise some supervisory authority, regardless of job titles. <span class="Italic">Naval Undersea Warfare Eng'g Station, Keyport, Wash. and AFGE Local 48</span>, 7 FLRA 526, 528-29 (1981).
