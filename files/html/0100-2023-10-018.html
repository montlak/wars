<p class="Body-Text">Assuming the appellant requests a hearing, if the appellant did not receive notice of the hearing, the hearing was not effectively waived. If regular mail is used to mail the hearing notice and a party files an affidavit stating that the notice was not received, remand is appropriate on PFR so that the hearing can be provided to the employee or agency that failed to receive the notice. <span class="Italic">Brock v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 263, 264 (1984) (three agency officials filed affidavits stating they received no hearing notice). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Clark v. USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 315, 316 (1985) (the assertion in a PFR that the appellant was not aware that the hearing was rescheduled was not evidence that the appellant did not receive the Board's rescheduling order; alternatively, "it would not be reasonable for the appellant to assume that the agency's motion requesting a postponement would be granted"). One appeal was remanded for a hearing after the agency submitted a list of witnesses; the hearing order was sent by regular mail; the agency failed to appear at the hearing; and the agency later submitted an affidavit stating it did not get the hearing notice. The passage of three months between the agency reply and the issuance of an initial decision did not establish that the agency abandoned interest in the hearing. <span class="Italic">Gregory v. USPS</span>, 20 MSPR 14, 15 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an appellant failed to receive notice of a hearing because of problems in getting mail to her, the AJ erred in canceling the hearing and issuing an initial decision without providing the appellant an opportunity to show good cause why a renewed request for a hearing should be granted. <span class="Italic">Bastian v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 7 MSPR 283, 285, 7 MSPB 179 (1981). In <span class="Italic">Lynn v. Bureau of Indian <span id="Page_1319"></span>Affairs</span>, 1 MSPR 342, 344-45, 1 MSPB 331 (1980), the employee who filed the appeal was out of town for a month and, upon his return, discovered that his post office box was closed for failure to pay a rental fee. All mail sent to the box during that time was returned to senders, including the Board's hearing notice. The AJ convened a hearing that the appellant did not attend, took a statement from the agency representative and closed the record, later to affirm the adverse action. On appeal, it was first noted that waiver of a right should be demonstrated through a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of the party showing such a purpose or amounting to an estoppel. Although the appellant placed himself where he could not, for a period of time, receive the hearing notice, the circumstances were not sufficient to establish a waiver. A relatively short-term unavailability, unattended by unusual circumstances, is not an act sufficiently clear, unequivocal, and decisive to establish waiver of an important legal right, particularly if the intent to exercise that right was stated through a hearing request in the initial appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Board's current regulations, service of a hearing notice on the appellant's representative constitutes constructive service of the notice on the appellant, <span class="Italic">Smallwood v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 302, 304-05 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A review of the record in this case indicates that the appellant was not served with the July 26, 1982 notice of hearing, although appellant's representative was served, and did appear, and did not object to proceeding without the appellant. Since the applicable regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(1)[5] provides for service on the parties or their designated representatives, we find no error in the presiding official's failure to serve the hearing notice on the appellant. In considering the issue of whether service upon an appellant's designated representative was sufficient to start the running of the thirty-day period specified in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(b)(1), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that "the board does not appear to be obligated by its own regulations to serve anyone other than an appellant's representative if one has been properly designated and such designation has not been revoked." <span class="Italic">Gragg v. United States</span>, 717 F.2d 1343, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1983). That court further held that a party's designation of a representative is binding on the designating party for service purposes unless and until expressly changed in writing by that party<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. In light of the fact that the appellant in the instant case designated a representative and did not revoke that designation, we find that service of the hearing notice on the appellant's representative was binding on the appellant.[6] Accordingly, we find no merit in the appellant's contention that the presiding official's failure to serve him with the hearing notice deprived him of his right to a hearing and therefore constituted harmful adjudicatory error warranting reversal of the initial decision.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;Appellant's petition for appeal was dated January 8, 1982, and the Board new regulations at 5 C.F.R. Part 1201 were effective December 22, 1981. 46 Fed. Reg. 62045 (1981), as amended at 47 Fed. Reg. 36801 (1982); <span class="Italic">see</span> also 47 Fed. Reg. 54419 (1982). The interim version of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.26(b)(1) applicable to this appeal and published at 46 Fed. Reg. 62045 (1981) provided that: "The Board will serve copies of the petition for appeal or petition for review upon the parties to the proceeding by mail. In doing so, the Board will attach a service list indicating the address of the appellant (or designated representative) and the address of the agency."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Page v. Federal Aviation Administration</span>, 3 MSPB 295 (1980), the Board a found that service of the hearing notice on the appellant's representative was not binding on the appellant. This decision does not govern the instant case, however, since it was based on the Board's prior regulations, not applicable to this appeal, which the Board interpreted as requiring service on both the appellant and his designated representative.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lamb v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 41 MSPR 79, 82-83 (1989), took the same approach as <span class="Italic">Smallwood</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that she did not receive notice of the hearing date. She states that she received no communication from her attorney or the Regional Office until June 13, 1988, when she called the Regional Office and was informed that the hearing was scheduled for the next day, June 14, 1988. She asserts that her former attorney failed to respond to the hearing notice and to send her a copy of the notice, which was mailed to her in care of him. The record shows that the appellant's attorney filed all the submissions to the Regional Office on her behalf. By order dated May 23, 1988, the administrative judge notified the parties, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, of the hearing date and of a scheduled prehearing conference on June 1, 1988. As the appellant asserts, one copy of the Order was sent to her, in care of her attorney, and one to her attorney. In a memorandum describing a telephone conference of June 13, 1988, between the appellant, the agency representative and the administrative judge, the administrative judge stated that the appellant reported that she had difficulty contacting her attorney's law firm and that the attorney signed to her case was no longer with the law firm. He also stated that the attorney could not prepare for the hearing because he was involved in another proceeding on the same day. He therefore gave the parties until June 17, 1988, to submit additional evidence and argument.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant is responsible for the actions of his or her chosen representative<span class="Italic">. See Andrez v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 27 M.S.P.R. 145, 148, <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 785 F.2d 326 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (unpub.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 476 U.S. 1173, 106 S. Ct. 2901, 90 L. Ed.2d 986 (1986); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. United States Postal Service</span>, 695 F.2d 1389, 1391 (1982). There is no indication that the appellant's attorney did not receive a copy of the hearing notice. He did not respond to the notice or inform the appellant of the hearing date. Neither the fact that the attorney was no longer with the law firm nor his involvement in another proceeding at the same time the hearing was scheduled excused him from notifying the appellant of the hearing and timely requesting a continuance. Therefore, the administrative judge acted properly within his authority under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.41 in canceling the hearing and deciding the appeal on the basis of the written submissions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under an earlier version of the Board's regulations, the appellant was entitled to his or her own copy of the hearing notice, irrespective of service of that notice upon the appellant's representative. Under that regulation, <span class="Italic">Page v. FAA</span>, 3 MSPR 196, 197-98, 3 MSPB 295 (1980), resolved that if the appellant's representative receives a hearing notice, but the appellant does not, the hearing is not waived unless there is "clear evidence that the appellant had knowledge of the hearing date." Under law predating current regulations requiring an affirmative election of the right to a hearing, to ensure that a waiver of a hearing was desired, it was necessary for notice of the right to a hearing to be properly sent to the appellant and his representative; reasonable steps were to be taken by the regional office to ensure that the notice was, in fact, received. <span class="Italic">Burton v. USPS</span>, 3 MSPR 301, 303, 3 MSPB 387 (1980).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant who claims lack of notice of a hearing must act with dispatch after he learns that he missed the hearing. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 21 MSPR 204, 206 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Brown</span>, an AJ sent out a hearing notice; the agency sent a witness list to the appellant; and the appellant failed to attend the hearing. The AJ then sent out a posthearing notice, and an initial decision was issued. All of this occurred over the course of several months. Later, a month after the initial decision, the appellant protested that did not receive the hearing notice and claimed he was deprived of a hearing. The Board disagreed. Although it conceded that the appellant may not have received the hearing notice, the Board noted that the appellant did not deny receipt of the other documents that either pertained to the hearing or indicated that a hearing was held. By delaying his protest until a month after the initial decision, the appellant knowingly waived a hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the AJ fails to inform the appellant of the hearing site, the hearing right is negated and the AJ commits adjudicative error. <span class="Italic">Hankins v. TVA</span>, 20 MSPR 69, 71 (1984). An AJ should not place the burden on the employee to determine the location of the hearing if the employee was told that the AJ or someone else would give him information about the hearing site. <span class="Italic">Sapp v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 16 MSPR 255, 257 (1983); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Mizzell v. OPM</span>, 19 MSPR 362, 363-64 (1984) (agency failed to demonstrate that the appellant was properly served, as ordered by the AJ, by certified mail with a notice of hearing location). If the AJ sends out hearing notices with different dates, the appellant should sort out the confusion by contacting the AJ. <span class="Italic">Coleman v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 155, 157 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under current law, if without justification neither the appellant nor his representative shows up at the hearing, the AJ should adjudicate the case on the record and not dismiss the case for lack of prosecution. <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 748 F.2d 1556 (Fed. Cir. 1984); <span class="Italic">Roberson v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 489, 491 (1985). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Callahan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 28 MSPR 41, 42 (1985) (remand following the court's decision: the Board granted a <span class="Italic">Callahan</span> hearing for the resolution of critical disputed facts; the Board noted that the court explained in its decision that it did not "prohibit the Board from setting a new hearing if the Board and the employee both so desire"). [Refer to sanctions relative to this situation in Chapter 2, "<a href="0100-2023-09-303.html#sec2-300">Failure to Attend Hearing</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The practice of adjudicating the case on the record if the appellant does not show up at a hearing assumes adequate notice of the hearing and assurance of reasonable arrangements to take testimony by alternate means if the hearing is held at a site far remote from the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Apiado v. OPM</span>, 58 MSPR 33 (1993), a hearing was rescheduled to convene in Hawaii rather than the Philippines because of disruptions in that country. When the appellant did not confirm that she would appear in Hawaii, the AJ concluded that the appellant withdrew her hearing request and decided the case on the record. The Board concluded that the AJ should have informed the appellant of the Board's ability to conduct a hearing by telephone. The appeal was remanded to provide the appellant with the opportunity for a hearing. The Board also determined that it was immaterial that the appellant did not timely respond to the AJ's order rescheduling the hearing: "[T]he fact that the order was deficient necessitates the remand of this case."</p>
