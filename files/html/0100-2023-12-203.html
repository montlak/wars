<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-202"><span class="space">1.</span> Allowable Submissions; Length, Format</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Ordinarily, there are three submissions that the Board allows during the PFR process: the PFR, the response to the PFR, and the reply to the response. Only the PFR is required to initiate Board review of an initial decision. On occasion the PFR is filed and the other party does not favor the PFR with a response. The Board adjudicates the PFR with or without the response. If a cross-PFR is involved, the pleadings multiply. Refer to 5 CFR 1201.114(a, e) (2022), 5 CFR 1201.115 (2022) for cross-PFRs. [Refer to "<a href="0100-2023-12-038.html#sec5-39">Cross-PFR</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The regulation provides, 5 CFR 1201.114 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pleadings allowed</span>. Pleadings allowed on review include a petition for review, a cross petition for review, a response to a petition for review, a response to a cross petition for review, and a reply to a response to a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A petition for review is a pleading in which a party contends that an initial decision was incorrectly decided in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A cross petition for review has the same meaning as a petition for review but is used to describe a pleading that is filed by a party when another party has already filed a timely petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A response to a petition for review and a cross petition for review may be contained in a single pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to the factual and legal issues raised by another party in the response to the petition for review. It may not raise new allegations of error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;No pleading other than the ones described in this paragraph will be accepted unless the party files a motion with and obtains leave from the Clerk of the Board. The motion must describe the nature of and need for the pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Contents of petition or cross petition for review</span>. A petition or cross petition for review states a party's objections to the initial decision, including all of the party's legal and factual arguments, and must be supported by references to applicable laws or regulations and by specific references to the record. Any petition or cross petition for review that contains new evidence or argument must include an explanation of why the evidence or argument was not presented before the record below closed (see &#x00A7; 1201.58 of this part [now &#x00A7; 1201.59]). A petition or cross petition for review should not include documents that were part of the record below, as the entire administrative record will be available to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">PFRs may be informal documents. But formal or informal, they should be reasonably brief and include margins and, unless handwritten, comply with regulatory requirements established in 2012 to avoid extremely bulky or serial pleadings at the PFR stage. The regulation provides, 5 CFR 1201.114 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(h)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Length limitations</span>. A petition for review, a cross petition for review, or a response to a petition for review, whether computer generated, typed, or handwritten, is limited to 30 pages or 7500 words, whichever is less. A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to 15 pages or 3750 words, whichever is less. Computer generated and typed pleadings must use no less than 12 point typeface and 1-inch margins and must be double spaced and only use one side of a page. The length limitation is exclusive of any table of contents, table of authorities, attachments, and certificate of service. A request for leave to file a pleading that exceeds the limitations prescribed in this paragraph must be received by the Clerk of the Board at least 3 days before the filing deadline. Such requests must give the reasons for a waiver as well as the desired length of the pleading and are granted only in exceptional circumstances. The page and word limits set forth above are maximum limits. Parties are not expected or required to submit pleadings of the maximum length. Typically, a well-written petition for review is between 5 and 10 pages long.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted that a reply brief exceeded the page limitations, but it was considered nonetheless in <span class="Italic">Schwalbach v. USDA</span>, SF-0752-13-0223-I-1 (NP 2/14/2014); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Sabio v. VA</span>, 124 MSPR 161, 2017 MSPB 4, 12, (2017) ("Although the agency's response, which is single spaced, does not technically comply with the Board's regulations, it substantially complies with them because it does not exceed the 7,500-word limit. Thus, we deny the appellant's request to file a motion to strike the agency's response."). But the Board, having rejected several PFRs that considerably exceeded the regulatory word limit, including the placement of legal discussion in what were described as tables, dismissed a PFR with prejudice, <span class="Italic">Morris v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MORRIS_DEREK_J_SF_0752_13_1476_I_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_1351634.pdf">123 MSPR 662</a>, 667-69 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-14, 2016 MSPB 37 (2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted, the Board's regulations provide that a petition for review is <span id="Page_1794"></span>limited to 30 pages or 7,500 words, whichever is less, and that the length limitation is exclusive of any table of contents, table of authorities, attachments, and certificate of service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(h). The regulations also provide that a request for leave to file a pleading that exceeds the limitations must be received by the Clerk of the Board at least 3 days before the filing deadline and must give the reasons for a waiver as well as the desired length of the pleading, and that waivers are granted only in exceptional circumstances. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When considering the challenges to the agency action and the initial decision contained in the various sections of the appellant's pleadings, the appellant's initial pleading far exceeded the 30-page limit for a petition for review, as did his subsequent submissions, and at no time did he file a request for leave to file a petition that exceeded 30 pages.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulations do not specifically provide what sanctions the Board may impose for a party's failure to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(h), but they do, at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43, provide that administrative judges may impose sanctions upon the parties as necessary to serve the ends of justice. The regulation provides a nonexhaustive list of the types of sanctions available to an administrative judge, and we look to that regulatory provision and to those sanctions, as appropriate, for guidance in this case. Addressing a party's failure to provide information as required, the regulation provides that, if a party fails to comply with an order, the administrative judge may impose one of several lesser sanctions, including drawing an inference in favor of the requesting party, prohibiting the offending party from introducing evidence concerning the information sought or from otherwise relying on testimony related to that information, permitting the requesting party to introduce secondary evidence concerning the information sought, and eliminating from consideration any appropriate part of the pleadings or other submissions of the party that fails to comply with the order. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(a)(1)-(4). The regulation further provides, however, that, if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal, the administrative judge may dismiss the appeal with prejudice or rule in favor of the appellant. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In looking to this regulation for guidance, we note that the Board's interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to great deference. <span class="Italic">In re Maisto</span>, 28 M.S.P.R. 436, 441 (1985). We also are aware that the sanction of dismissal with prejudice is a severe sanction, and the Board has held that it is only appropriate when necessary to serve the ends of justice and should only be imposed when: (1) a party has failed to exercise due diligence in complying with Board orders; or (2) a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to comply. <span class="Italic">Williams v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 377, &#x00B6; 7 (2011) (citing <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Navy</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 369, &#x00B6; 6 (2000)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Litigants before the Board are expected to comply with all orders issued by the Board and to comply with the Board's regulations. <span class="Italic">See Mendoza v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 966 F.2d 650, 653 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>); <span class="Italic">Heckman v. Department of the Interior</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 16 (2007). Further, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Federal Circuit) has long held that dismissal for failure to prosecute, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b), is appropriate when a party fails to comply with the Board's orders on more than one occasion. <span class="Italic">McDavis v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 464 Fed. Appx. 864, 865-66 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (nonprecedential); <span class="Italic">Ahlberg v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 804 F.2d 1238, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant here did not simply fail to comply with "an order" of the Clerk of the Board or with the Board's regulations. Instead, although notified in the initial decision of the 30-page regulatory limit, the appellant filed a nonconforming petition for review and then on three occasions failed to perfect his petition. By repeatedly failing to comply with the Board's regulations and the clear directions provided by the Clerk's Office, the appellant failed to exercise due diligence. Moreover, he has been noncompliant in a substantial way, on four occasions exceeding the regulatory page limit by approximately 200 pages, thereby demonstrating that his failure to comply has not been accidental, but rather defiant. In addition, the continual misogynistic invective he has used in describing his dealings with the Board's female staff in the Clerk's Office not only goes beyond argument, but is inappropriately dismissive and shows bad faith. By his actions, we find that the appellant has failed to prosecute his petition for review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.43(b); <span class="Italic">see Heckman</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 210, &#x00B6; 16 (finding that an administrative judge did not abuse her discretion when she dismissed an appeal for failure to prosecute based on the appellant's repeated failure to comply with her orders).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board accepted a PFR consisting of penned notations on an initial decision noting the appellant's disagreements with the AJ's findings. <span class="Italic">Becklund v. Dept. of Army</span>, 3 MSPR 5, 7, 3 MSPB 127 (1980). Although the PFR may be simply stated, it must contain sufficient specifics to enable the Board to decide the issue presented. <span class="Italic">Grayblas v. OPM</span>, 32 MSPR 369, 371 (1987). Summary petitions for review are unacceptable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Frink v. USDA,</span> AT-0752-11-0535-I-1 (NP 2/24/2012) ("Although the appellant informed the Board of her intent to file a petition for review, she failed to make any specific allegation of error by the administrative judge in the initial decision....Because the appellant failed to supplement her initial petition for review, there was neither evidence nor argument demonstrating error by the administrative judge. As a result, the appellant's petition for review does not meet the Board's criteria for review."); <span class="Italic">King v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 435, 437 &#x00B6; 3 (1999) (restating the necessity for sufficient specificity); <span class="Italic">House v. USPS</span>, 80 MSPR 138, 139-40 &#x00B6; 3 (1998) (PFR was insufficiently specific that contended the "AJ 'picked and chose' the evidence that would sustain the agency's action, while ignoring evidence that supported [appellant's] contentions. He did not, however, describe the evidence that the AJ ignored, or how it would have supported a contrary conclusion."); <span class="Italic">Di Pompo v. VA</span>, 62 MSPR 44, 47 (1994) ("The appellant's mere request that the Board review the initial decision does not comply with the Board's criteria for review."); <span class="Italic">Ray v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 60 MSPR 624, 627-28 (1994) (inadequate was a letter simply requesting review followed by a legal memo filed after the close of the record on the PFR); <span class="Italic">Tines v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 90, 92 (1992) (PFR did not meet format requirements where it "merely object[ed] to the administrative judge's dismissal of his appeal based on 'a trumped up and false technicality'"); <span class="Italic">Mack v. USPS</span>, 48 MSPR 617, 618 n.1 (1991) ("The appellant's [PFR] merely requests that the Board review the initial decision. A [PFR] must contain sufficient specificity to enable the Board to ascertain whether there is a serious evidentiary challenge justifying a complete review of the record.... Here, the petition contains neither argument nor evidence demonstrating error by the administrative judge and, therefore, does not meet the criteria for Board review."); <span class="Italic">Bell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 48 MSPR 86, 90 (1991) (PFR must contain sufficient specificity for the Board to ascertain if there is a serious evidentiary challenge justifying a complete record review); <span class="Italic">Goldberg v. DOD</span>, 39 MSPR 515, 518 (1989) (short PFR that was to have been followed by a later brief, rejected by the Board as untimely, did not provide the specifics necessary for review). Because one basis for a PFR is an error in law, it helps to cite the law. To that end, the petitioner need only cite Board cases; it is not necessary to copy and attach to the PFR cases the petitioner wants the Board to consider. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Parker v. USPS</span>, 59 MSPR 603, 607 n.2 (1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The PFR should be a complete document, referencing the initial decision and stating specifically the objections to factual or legal findings or adjudication errors. A PFR will not be considered if it is no more than a copy of the brief submitted to the AJ prior to the issuance of the initial decision. One agency found this out after it submitted as a PFR the brief it submitted to the AJ, only to have the Board reject the PFR as inconsequential and affirm the award of counsel fees directed by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Hagan v. USPS</span>, 25 MSPR 64, 64 n.* (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Special Counsel v. Coffman</span>, 124 MSPR 130, ___n.6, 2017 MSPB 3 (2017) ("Attempts to incorporate briefs that were filed below are insufficient to meet the Board's standards, and a petition for review must identify any procedural or adjudicatory errors and explain how they affected the outcome of the initial decision. <span class="Italic">Hulett v. Department of the Navy</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 54, &#x00B6; 5 n.2 (2013)."); <span class="Italic">Wyse v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 39 MSPR 85, 92 n.3 (1988) (declining to consider the brief submitted to the AJ that the appellant sought to incorporate into his PFR--the brief did not address the errors of the AJ); <span class="Italic">Marques v.

Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 102, 104 n.3 (1983) (attempt to incorporate a brief filed with the AJ by reference into the PFR failed to meet the Board's review criteria). The resubmission of documents filed with the AJ does not meet the PFR criteria because the submission specifies no error in the AJ's analysis. <span class="Italic">Mawson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 48 MSPR 318, 321 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bivens v.

<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board, in the interest of justice, fairly reviews appellants' petitions for review and will not technically construe Board procedural requirements, the Board cannot and will not act as an attorney for either party by considering PFRs from attorneys that do not present a recognizable attempt to meet the announced review criteria of the Board. <span class="Italic">Neely v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 3 MSPR 338, 340, 3 MSPB 420 (1980). If, however, an AJ failed to frame issues properly and ensure that a record provided a sufficient basis for review of a case, the Board may remand a case for further adjudication and issuance of an initial decision that conforms to Board requirements. <span class="Italic">Dorsett v. USPS</span>, 75 MSPR 345, 349 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies and appellants occasionally load their PFRs and responses with irrelevant argument, gratuitous statements, invective, and other unhelpful comments. It is an uncivil, irritating practice the Board will not stop. <span class="Italic">Baker v. DHHS</span>, 41 MSPR 363, 364 n.1 (1989), advised that "The Board's regulations do not provide for striking portions of statements set forth in the parties' pleadings on review. Accordingly, we deny the appellant's motion. The Board, however, will find such statements to have merit only to the extent that they are supported by record evidence and are relevant to the issues on review."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">PFRs present excellent opportunities to advance policy arguments to the Board. The more reasonable the argument, the more even the tone, the more likely the PFR will receive reasoned consideration by the Office of Appeals Counsel and the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The PFR process is a paperwork exchange. Except in extraordinary circumstances or in an appeal presenting an extraordinarily important legal issue (and then only after a Federal Register notice inviting <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs and oral argument), the Board does not receive oral arguments on PFRs. <span class="Italic">See,</span> <span class="Italic">e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Helman v. Dept. of Army</span>, 23 MSPR 164, 167 n.3 (1984) ("While appellant has both a statutory and regulatory right to a hearing on his initial appeal to the Board, appellant has no right to oral presentation on review.").</p>
