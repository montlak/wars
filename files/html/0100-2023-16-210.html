<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-210"><span class="space">c.</span> EEO Proceedings: Precomplaint Informal Adjustments</h5>
<p class="noindent">Is a meeting called to facilitate settlement of an EEO charge, attended by the EEO counselor, the employee, and the employee's representative, a formal discussion entitling the employee to union representation? FLRA decided that the complaint of discrimination was within the definition of "grievance" under &#x00A7; 7103(a)(9). The union was entitled to be present and was entitled to prior notice of the meeting. That an employee was present who happened to be a steward did not excuse the failure to provide notice. <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. and NTEU</span>, 7 FLRA 371, 376 (1981). <span class="Italic">Fresno Serv. Ctr.</span> did not fare well in the appellate court. EEO meetings occurring at the informal precomplaint counseling stage are not formal discussions within the meaning of the Statute. In <span class="Italic">IRS, Fresno Serv. Ctr. v. FLRA</span>, 706 F.2d 1019, 1023-25 (9th Cir. 1983), a result since followed by FLRA (<span class="Italic">SSA and Chauvin</span>, 16 FLRA 1021 (1984) (ALJ Decision)), the Ninth Circuit determined:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.213(a) prohibits an EEO counselor from revealing the identity of a person consulting him before the person files a formal complaint of discrimination....&#8197;Requiring such confidentiality during early stages of an employment discrimination claim serves to facilitate informal resolution of disputes and to encourage employees with discrimination complaints to pursue and explore their claims without fear of retribution.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union representation requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) do not apply to an EEO precomplaint conciliation conference...unless there is to be a "formal discussion."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The meeting [&#8197;] convened...under the EEOC procedure...by which an EEO counselor seeks to resolve discrimination charges in the precomplaint stage on an "informal basis"...was informal rather than formal.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]t was not yet a formal complaint in the sense meant by EEOC procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority erred in applying 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) to the precomplaint conciliation conference because the meeting did not concern a "grievance."...&#8197;[T]he EEOC procedures involved in this case are not controlled by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) because they are discrete and separate from the grievance process to which 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103 and 7114 are directed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The union is granted representation rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114 because of its status as exclusive bargaining representative. As exclusive representative, the union has responsibility for administering the collective bargaining agreement and has an obvious interest in being present when a dispute governed by the grievance procedure it negotiated is discussed or resolved. However, the EEOC procedure is unrelated to and separate from the contractual grievance process. In fact, the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the IRS explicitly excludes claims of discrimination from the grievance procedure....</p>
<p class="noindent">Informal attempts initiated by an employee to settle an EEO complaint are not formal discussions requiring union notification and involvement, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Energy, Rocky Flats Field Office and AFGE Local 1103</span>, 57 FLRA 754, 755-56 (2002):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute, a union has the right to be represented at a formal discussion between one or more agency representatives and one or more unit employees or their representatives concerning a grievance, personnel policy or practices, or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of</span> <span class="Italic">Justice, Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv., N.Y. Office</span> <span class="Italic">of Asylum, Rosedale, N.Y</span>., 55 FLRA 1032, 1034 (1999). For the &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) right to attach, there must be: (1) a discussion; (2) that is formal; (3) between an agency representative and a unit employee or the employee's representative; (4) concerning any grievance or any personnel policy or practice or other general condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Gen. Servs. Admin., </span>48 FLRA 1348, 1354 (1994) <span class="Italic">(GSA).</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">There is no dispute that there were discussions between an Agency representative and a unit employee.&#x2003;The Respondent challenges, among other things, the Judge's finding that the discussions were formal.

<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the totality of the circumstances presented in this case demonstrates that the discussions were not formal.&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we find it significant that the discussions were not initiated by management, but by the employee, who visited the EEO Representative in an impromptu manner. In this connection, the Judge found that the employee's "just stopping by" the EEO Representative's office was "consistent with [the employee's] relationship with [the EEO Representative]." Because the discussions were impromptu and employee-initiated, management did not establish when or where those discussions would take place, or what those discussions would concern. Consequently, as a practical matter, the Respondent could not provide the Charging Party with advance notice that the discussions would take place. We note that the Authority has not previously found such impromptu, employee-initiated discussions to constitute formal discussions within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Servs., Soc. Sec. Admin. &#x0026;</span> <span class="Italic">Soc. Sec Admin. Field Operations, Region II, </span>29 FLRA 1205, 1208-09 (1987) ("spontaneity" and "employee-initiated aspects of the meeting" considered in finding meeting informal). <span class="Italic">Cf. United States Dept of Justice,</span> <span class="Italic">Bur. of Prisons, Fed. Corr. Inst., Bastrop, Tex.,</span> 51 FLRA 1339, 1343 (1996) (meeting scheduled in advance by management representative found formal). Further, we note that: the discussions involved only one representative of the Respondent, who was not the employee's supervisor or in his management chain of command; there were no agendas for the discussions; and no minutes of the discussions were subsequently prepared.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that some of the Judge's findings--that the discussions took place in the EEO Representative's office, lasted approximately thirty minutes, and concerned settlement of an EEO complaint--indicate formality. However, discussions are not necessarily "formal" within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute simply because they have some indicia of formality. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Harry S. Truman Mem'l Veterans Hosp.,</span> <span class="Italic">Columbia, Mo., </span>16 FLRA 1049, 1051 (1984). Further, although the purpose of discussions may be considered in determining whether discussions are formal, <span class="Italic">see GSA,</span> 48 FLRA at 1355-56, the fact that discussions have a formal purpose does not, by itself, demonstrate that the discussions were formal. For example, discussions have been found informal even where the purpose of the discussions was to settle an EEO complaint. <span class="Italic">See Social Sec.</span> <span class="Italic">Admin. &#x0026; Soc. Sec. Admin., Field Operations, N.Y</span>. <span class="Italic">Region, </span>16 FLRA 1021, 1033-34 (1984). Thus, the fact that the disputed discussions concerned settlement of an EEO complaint does not compel a conclusion that the discussions were formal.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Rocky Flats </span>was followed in <span class="Italic">VA Healthcare Prescott and AFGE Local 2401</span>, 61 FLRA 181, 185-86 (2005). An employee's initiative to settle an EEO complaint with the EEO manager, through brief meetings not involving supervisors, did not rise to the level of a formal meeting requiring notice to the union and the right to union presence during the meetings, even though the result of the settlement initiatives was creation of a position for the employee:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The determination as to whether a discussion is formal is based on the <span id="page_1459"></span>totality of the facts and circumstances presented.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Cheyenne, Wyo.</span>, 52 FLRA 149, 155-57 (1996) (<span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>). In making that determination, the Authority has stated that a number of factors are relevant: (1) the status of the individual who held the discussions; (2) whether any other management representatives attended; (3) the site of the discussions; (4) how the meetings for the discussions were called; (5) how long the discussions lasted; (6) whether a formal agenda was established for the discussions; and (7) the manner in which the discussions were conducted. <span class="Italic">See GSA</span>, 48 FLRA at 1355. In some cases, the Authority has considered an eighth factor, namely, whether attendance by the bargaining unit employee was mandatory. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Admin. and Mgmt., Chi., Ill.</span>, 32 FLRA 465, 470 (1988).<span class="Italic"> </span>However, these factors are illustrative, and other factors may be identified and applied as appropriate. <span class="Italic">F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 157.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the facts and circumstances of this case establish that the October 10th meeting was not a formal discussion within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute. In this regard, the parties stipulated that attendance at the meeting was voluntary. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin. and Soc. Sec. Admin., Field Operations, N.Y. Region</span>, 16 FLRA 1021, 1033-34 (1984) (voluntary attendance suggests informality). The meeting was attended only by the employee and the EEO manager, and there is no indication in the record that the EEO manager is the employee's supervisor or is otherwise in the employee's chain of command. <span class="Italic">Cf. F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 158 n.8 (meeting was formal where held by high level management officials). Further, the parties stipulated that no other management official attended the meeting. Indeed, the Agency official responsible for executing the signed agreement was not even present at the meeting. The meeting was of a short duration, lasting only about 15 minutes, during which, no notes were taken and no confidentiality agreement was signed. <span class="Italic">Cf. Dover</span>, 57 FLRA at 307 (signing confidentiality agreement evidences formal nature of meeting). Finally, there is no evidence in the record that there was a formal agenda prepared in advance of the meeting. The GC's claim otherwise is based solely on the fact that the meeting had a specific purpose, namely, to execute the settlement agreement. However, under Authority precedent, the existence of an agenda and the established purpose of a meeting are separate and distinct factors for assessing formality, and the existence of one does not establish the existence of the other. <span class="Italic">See Rocky Flats</span>, 57 FLRA at 755-56 (finding no formal discussion where meeting had formal purpose, but no agenda); <span class="Italic">see also F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 158-59 (distinguishing purpose from agenda).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In concluding that the meeting was not formal, we consider significant the fact that all the settlement discussions leading up to the final meeting in which the settlement agreement was executed were initiated by the employee. In this connection, as the Respondent points out, this case is "strikingly similar" to <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, in which the Authority found that a meeting was not a formal discussion because, among other things, the meeting was "impromptu and employee-initiated[.]" <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, 57 FLRA at 755. Other Authority precedent confirms the importance of considering the nature of a meeting in view of the circumstances in which it arose when assessing whether a meeting is formal within the meaning of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., F.E. Warren</span>, 52 FLRA at 156 (Authority examines the nature of the discussions).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the meeting was a follow-up to two prior meetings between the EEO manager and the employee, during which the employee, in an impromptu fashion, initiated settlement discussions concerning his formal EEO complaint. There is no dispute that the employee initiated these settlement discussions and requested that the EEO manager type a proposed settlement agreement. In fact, the GC expressly acknowledges that the "genesis" of the meeting "was an October 2nd discussion, which ended with [the employee] requesting that [the EEO manager] prepare the final EEO [s]ettlement [a]greement for the parties['] execution." When the employee requested additional changes to the first draft of the settlement agreement, which the EEO manager incorporated into the final settlement agreement, the EEO manager contacted the employee to execute the agreement. Consequently, this meeting was held in direct response to the employee's request for changes to a written settlement agreement resulting from settlement discussions that he himself initiated. As such, this case is distinguishable from decisions in which formal discussions were found based largely on management's initiation of the discussions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 18 FLRA 249, 250 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The GC's argument that the EEO manager set the date, time, and location of the meeting does not undermine the "impromptu and employee-initiated" aspects of the meeting. In this regard, the entire stipulation on the matter provides that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">On October 10, 2003, [the EEO manager] telephoned [the employee] and asked him to come over to her office. The purpose of this meeting was for Respondent to present [the employee] with a final settlement proposal regarding his EEO matter. Respondent coordinated the date and time of the settlement session and made the location arrangements."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the EEO manager's "coordination" of the date, time and location of the meeting consisted simply and solely of telephoning the employee and asking him to come to her office. This level of planning falls far short of the level of "extensive involvement" that occurred in <span class="Italic">Dover</span>, where the Authority found that a meeting was formal because the meeting was called by the respondent. <span class="Italic">See Dover</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>57 FLRA at 307. In particular, the Authority found in <span class="Italic">Dover </span>that the respondent coordinated available dates, scheduled the meeting at least a week in advance, and arranged for the session to take place at a local hotel. Such advance planning did not occur here. Moreover, even if, as the GC claims, the EEO manager had time to notify the Charging Party of the meeting, that fact would not compel a conclusion that under <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, the meeting was a formal discussion. In this regard, although the lack of time to notify the charging party was noted "as a practical matter" in <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, the Authority did not indicate that the mere opportunity to notify a charging party of a meeting transforms an otherwise informal meeting into a formal one. <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, 57 FLRA at 755.<span class="Italic"> </span>Finally, the GC's reliance on Authority precedent finding that meetings held to mediate EEO complaints are formal in nature is misplaced. In this regard, there is no dispute that the meeting at issue here was not a mediation, as no third party neutral was in attendance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recognize that there are some indicia of formality present in this case.&#x2003;For instance, the meeting was held outside of the employee's immediate work area, which suggests formality under Authority precedent, and the meeting had a formal purpose, namely to execute a settlement agreement. However, as the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>,<span class="Italic"> </span>"discussions are not necessarily 'formal' within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute simply because they have some indicia of formality." <span class="Italic">Rocky Flats</span>, 57 FLRA at 756 (citing <span class="Italic">Harry S. Truman Mem'l Veterans Hosp., Columbia, Mo.</span>, 16 FLRA 1049, 1051 (1984)). Rather, we consider these factors in view of the totality of the circumstances. In doing so, we find that the factors indicating that the meeting was not formal in nature outweigh these two factors suggesting formality. Therefore, based on the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the meeting was not a formal discussion under &#x00A7; 7114(a)(2)(A) of the Statute.</p>
