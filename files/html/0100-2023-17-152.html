<p class="noindent">The arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing. Although <span id="page_1926"></span>an award may be deficient upon "fair hearing grounds" when it is established that the arbitrator's refusal to hear material evidence, or other actions in conducting the proceeding, prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceedings as a whole, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1917</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-153.html">60 FLRA 813</a>, 816 (2005), an award is not deficient only because the arbitrator conducted the hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable. <span class="Italic">Library of Congress and AFSCME Local 2910</span>, 32 FLRA 330, 332-33 (1988); <span class="Italic">see NAGE Local R3-32 and Dept. of Air Force, Willow Grove ARS</span>, 59 FLRA 458, 460 (2003) ("The Authority has held that the fact that an arbitrator makes statements critical of a party does not establish bias."); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3342 and SSA</span>, 58 FLRA 448, 450 (2003) (reciting rule); <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Indian Head Div. and AFGE Local 1923</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v56/56-141.html">56 FLRA 848</a>, 851 (2000) (agency failed to demonstrate that it did not receive fair hearing when arbitrator opened the proceedings to public and press and allowed himself to be photographed with union representatives); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 22 and Dept. of Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 51 FLRA 1496, 1498 (1996) ("the liberal admission of testimony and evidence by an arbitrator is a permissible practice").</p>
<p class="noindent">The arbitrator's refusal to delay a hearing does not vitiate the award. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 34 FLRA 850, 853 (1990) (considerable latitude in conduct of a hearing). If the allegation is that the arbitrator received testimony while the grievant and the union representative were absent from the hearing room, record evidence should support the assertion for FLRA to act on it. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1757 and Dept. of Air Force, Brooks AFB</span>, 58 FLRA 505, 507 (2003). Denial of a postponement for a hearing and bifurcation of a hearing did not warrant interference with the ensuing award, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2006 and SSA</span>, 65 FLRA 465, 467-68 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Arbitrator erred in: (1) denying the Union's motion to postpone the hearing and (2) bifurcating the proceeding. We construe these arguments as claims that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 171, Council of Prison Locals 33</span>, 61 FLRA 661, 663 (2006).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award will be found deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing where a party demonstrates that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995). It is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing and the fact that an arbitrator conducts a hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable does not, by itself, provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 22</span>, 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by failing to grant its motion to postpone the hearing.&#x2003;The Union argues that it was prejudiced because it was under the impression that an informal mediation would be taking place, and only received notice that it would be an arbitration hearing twelve days beforehand. However, the Union has not provided any evidence that it had a reasonable belief there would be an informal mediation or that twelve days' notice was inadequate. The Union further argues that the Arbitrator's denial was prejudicial because of the failure to receive the requested documents. However, as discussed below, the Union was not entitled to the information pursuant to &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4). Therefore, as the Union has not shown how the alleged lack of notice prejudiced the Union and because the Arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing, we deny this exception. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1917</span>, 52 FLRA 658, 662 (1996) (finding that denial of a thirty-day postponement did not deny the union a fair hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Union argues that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing because he bifurcated the proceeding into separate hearings on liability and damages. The Union contends that bifurcation must be agreed to by both parties, relying solely on the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>. However, <span class="Italic">DHHS </span>provides no support for this contention. In that decision, the Authority merely noted that the arbitrator had decided not to bifurcate the proceedings because the parties had not agreed to bifurcation, a decision which the Authority did not review or discuss further. <span class="Italic">DHHS</span>, 33 FLRA at 341. The Arbitrator here exercised his considerable latitude in concluding that it was appropriate to bifurcate the proceedings, and the Union has not shown that the decision prejudiced the hearing as a whole. <span class="Italic">See NAGE, Fed. Union of Scientists &#x0026; Eng'rs, Local R12-198</span>, 63 FLRA 7, 7 n.* (2008) (denying an exception arguing that the arbitrator improperly bifurcated the proceedings). Therefore, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1917 and DOJ, INS</span>, 52 FLRA 658, 662 (1996) (without substantial showing of prejudice, award would not be set aside when union complained arbitrator refused to grant continuance of hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent">Limitations on the amount of time available to a party do not, without more, suggest unfairness of a hearing. <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA and AFGE Local 547</span>, 24 FLRA 959, 961-62 (1986), determined a challenge to an award that was issued by an arbitrator who allowed the union two hours to present its evidence, an allocation the union felt precluded it from submitting relevant evidence:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Authority in cases involving a question as to the fairness of a hearing has recognized that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in the conduct of the hearing....&#8197;The fact that the arbitrator conducted the hearing in a manner which one party finds objectionable does not support a contention that the arbitrator denied that party a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1917, AFL-CIO and U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service</span>, 13 FLRA 68 (1983). Moreover, the cases cited by the Union do not stand for the proposition that a mere assertion that an arbitrator excluded testimony or documents dictates a finding that an arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing and that an award is, therefore, deficient. Rather,...Federal courts find arbitration awards deficient as denying a fair hearing primarily when an arbitrator's challenged rulings had precluded consideration of all pertinent and material evidence. In this case, the specific instances cited by the Union where the Arbitrator limited the number of witnesses heard or the documentation entered into the record reveal nothing more than an attempt by the arbitrator to control the conduct of the hearing by insuring that such testimony as was offered by witnesses or documentation entered into the record was relevant and material to the resolution of the issues before him and not unduly repetitive.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Hill AFB and AFGE Local 1592</span>, 39 FLRA 103, 105-08 (1991), set aside an award when the arbitrator improperly limited evidentiary presentation because of the arbitrator's belief that the arbitration was to be expedited:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find an award deficient when it is established that the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to consider pertinent and material evidence.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">For example, National Border Patrol Council and National Immigration and Naturalization Service Council and United States Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service,</span> 3 FLRA 401, 404 (1980) (<span class="Italic">INS</span>). Although the Authority has recognized this ground, the Authority has never found an arbitration award deficient because the arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing by refusing to consider pertinent and material evidence. However, cases cited by the Authority in <span class="Italic">INS</span> discuss the standards commonly applied by Federal courts to determine whether an award is deficient when an arbitrator has refused to consider evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Among the cases cited by the Authority in <span class="Italic">INS</span> were <span class="Italic">Harvey Aluminum v. United Steelworkers of America,</span> 263 F. Supp. 488 (C.D. Calif. 1967) (<span class="Italic">Harvey Aluminum</span>) and <span class="Italic">Newark Stereotypers' Union No. 18 v. Newark Morning Ledger Co.,</span> 397 F.2d 594 (3d Cir.), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 393 U.S. 954 (1968) (<span class="Italic">Newark Morning Ledger</span>). In <span class="Italic">Harvey Aluminum</span> the court framed the issue to be decided as whether the arbitrator considered all pertinent and relevant evidence offered in arriving at his award and whether from an overall perspective the hearing was fair to both parties. 263 F. Supp. at 494. The arbitrator had refused to consider pertinent and material testimony on the basis that the testimony was not proper rebuttal under the rules of evidence. The court held that the refusal denied the company a fair hearing. The court noted that arbitration proceedings are informal in nature and that the liberal admission of evidence and testimony is the customary practice in arbitration. Thus, the court ruled that the arbitrator was not justified in refusing to hear the testimony because the parties were not on notice that the rules of evidence would be applied by the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Newark Morning Ledger</span> the court held that in order to be deficient, the refusal to consider pertinent and material evidence must affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. 397 F.2d at 600. In <span class="Italic">Hoteles Condado Beach v. Union De Tronquistas Local 901,</span> 763 F.2d 34, 40 (1st Cir. 1985) (<span class="Italic">Hoteles Condado Beach</span>), the court similarly held that a court may vacate an award because of an arbitrator's refusal to hear pertinent and material evidence only when the refusal prejudices the rights of a party to the proceeding. In <span class="Italic">Hoteles Condado Beach,</span> the arbitrator accepted into evidence the transcript of criminal proceedings concerning an event that was in dispute in the arbitration, but refused to give any weight to the evidence. The court found that the evidence the arbitrator failed to consider was both "central and decisive" to the company's position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the court vacated the award because the refusal was destructive of the company's right to present its case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we conclude that under these standards commonly applied by Federal courts in private sector labor relations cases, the award is deficient because the Arbitrator denied the Union a fair hearing. We find that the Arbitrator refused to consider evidence that was pertinent and material to the issue of whether the suspension of the grievant was for just cause. We also find that the refusal prejudiced the right of the Union to fully and completely present its case and affected the fairness of the arbitration. In our view, the prejudicial effect on the fairness of the proceedings is confirmed by the Arbitrator's statement that the Union's position with respect to one of the two issues that he refused to consider appeared to have "enough merit to...warrant serious consideration of it. To have denied the Union the serious consideration its position warranted denied the Union a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Furthermore, we find no justification for the Arbitrator's refusal to consider these matters. We agree with the Union that the fact that <span id="page_1927"></span>the case would have no precedential value in no manner justified the Arbitrator's refusal to permit the Union to fully present its position that the suspension was not for just cause.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also reject the Arbitrator's justification that he believed he only had the "mandate under [Section] 7.08 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement" to consider the simple question of whether the grievant failed to perform his work in a timely manner. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. To the extent that the Arbitrator based his refusal on his interpretation and application of the agreement, we find that his justification fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. We will find that an award fails to draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement when the award: (1) cannot in any rational way be derived from the agreement; (2) is so unconnected with the wording and purposes of the agreement as to "manifest an infidelity to the obligation of the arbitrator"; (3) evidences a manifest disregard of the agreement; or (4) does not represent a plausible interpretation of the agreement. <span class="Italic">For example, U.S. Department of the Air Force, Air Force Logistics Command, Hill Air Force Base, Utah and American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1592,</span> 38 FLRA 337, 339 (1990). Section 7.08(d), pertaining to the conduct of the hearing, provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Either party may use up to five witnesses unless it is determined by mutual agreement or the arbitrator that more are necessary and may present evidence and exhibits in support of their respective positions....&#8197;The arbitrator must render a written award postmarked not later than three workdays after the conclusion of the hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement unequivocally provides for the right of the parties to fully and completely present evidence and exhibits in support of their respective positions. The sole limitation of the agreement on the presentation of their cases is that more than five witnesses cannot be called without the agreement of the other party or without the permission of the arbitrator. In our view, the Arbitrator's determination that Section 7.08 permits his refusal to have considered the Union's position on the grievant's performance standards and the propriety of the Agency's action based on <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> fails to draw its essence from the agreement. We conclude that the determination cannot in any rational way be derived from Section 7.08 and manifestly disregards its provisions. <span class="Italic">See Overseas Education Association and Office of Dependents Schools, Department of Defense,</span> 4 FLRA 98, 102-03 (1980) (arbitrator's remedy disregarded the terms of the agreement and had no rational basis in the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As noted by the Union, the Arbitrator never sought to withdraw or renegotiate the terms of expedited arbitration once he found out about the complexities of the case. Consequently, we need not address whether the award would have been justified if the Arbitrator had requested a waiver of the time limit for issuing a decision and the parties would not mutually agree to the waiver.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we will vacate the award denying the grievance. We will remand this case to the parties for submission to an arbitrator of their choice to consider, in accordance with Section 7.08 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the Union's position on the grievant's performance standards and the applicability of <span class="Italic">Lovshin</span> to this matter. <span class="Italic">See Panama Canal Commission and International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots Marine Division ILA, AFL-CIO, Panama Canal Pilots Branch,</span> 34 FLRA 740, 744 (1990) (because certain issues were not addressed by the arbitrator, it was unnecessary for the Authority to direct the parties to return to a specific arbitrator on remand).</p>
<p class="noindent">Arbitrators need not govern their hearings by the Federal Rules applicable to district courts. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3615 and DHHS, SSA, Office of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 44 FLRA 806, 816 (1992); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2004 and DLA</span>, 55 FLRA 6, 10 (1998) ("The Federal Rules were designed to govern procedures in the United States district courts and do not purport to be applicable in administrative proceedings."). Outside of the contract there are not many firm conventions governing an arbitration proceeding. Denial of a party's request to have an observer present is not a denial of a fair hearing when the arbitrator honored a practice through a series of hearings that precluded the attendance of observers. <span class="Italic">AFGE and SSA</span>, 25 FLRA 173, 175 (1987).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Antilles Consol. Educ. Assn. and DODEA</span>, 64 FLRA 675, 677 (2010), summed up FLRA's approach on objections to admission or exclusion of testimony or witnesses by arbitrators:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In connection with its nonfact exception, <span class="Italic">supra</span> Part IV.A, the Union also alleges that the Arbitrator violated due process by permitting an Agency witness to testify about her conversation with another person who did not testify at the hearing. The Authority has addressed similar arguments using a fair-hearing analysis. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., US. Dep't of Def, Def. Mapping Agency, Hydrographic/Topographic Ctr., </span>44 FLRA 103, 108-09 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Def. Mapping Agency</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award will be found deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing where a party demonstrates that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1668,</span> 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995) (<span class="Italic">citing U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, </span>39 FLRA 103, 105-07 (1991)). It is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing, and the fact that an arbitrator conducts a hearing in a manner that a party finds objectionable does not, by itself, provide a basis for finding an award deficient. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 22,</span> 51 FLRA 1496, 1497-98 (1996) (citing<span class="Italic"> Nat'l Air Traffic Controllers Ass'n, Local NKT,</span> 49 FLRA 499, 505 (1994)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has long held that the "liberal admission by arbitrators of testimony and evidence is a permissible practice." <span class="Italic">Def. Mapping Agency, </span>44 FLRA at 109 (citing<span class="Italic"> Veterans Admin. &#x0026; VA Med. Ctr. Register Office, </span>34 FLRA 734, 738 (1990)). <span class="Italic">See also Nat'l Border Patrol Council &#x0026; Nat'l Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Serv. Council, </span>3 FLRA 401, 404-05 (1980) (explaining that the liberal admission of testimony and evidence is the "usual practice" in arbitration). In addition, the Authority has stated that disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and testimony, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence, provides no basis for finding the award deficient. <span class="Italic">E.g., AFGE, Local 3295, </span>51 FLRA 27, 32 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2128,</span> 47 FLRA 962, 966 (1993) (<span class="Italic">Local 3295</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither the Arbitrator's "liberal admission" of testimony from an Agency witness, <span class="Italic">Def. Mapping Agency, </span>44 FLRA at 109, nor the Union's disagreement with the Arbitrator's reference to this testimony, <span class="Italic">Local 3295,</span> 51 FLRA at 32, supports finding the award deficient. Accordingly, we deny the exception.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3911 and EPA</span>, 68 FLRA 564, 571-72 (2015) ("In conducting a hearing, arbitrators have considerable latitude, and nothing prevents an arbitrator from avoiding repetitious testimony or suggesting that the proceeding progress expeditiously.").</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA declined to find that the agency was denied a fair hearing when the arbitrator declined to consider evidence on arbitrability but instead relied only on the contract, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Transp., FAA and NATCA</span>, 65 FLRA 320, 323 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority will find that an arbitrator denied a fair hearing when it is demonstrated that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent or material evidence or conducted the proceedings in a manner that so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceedings as a whole.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of Commerce, PTO, Arlington, Va., </span>60 FLRA 869, 879 (2005) (<span class="Italic">PTO</span>). However, the Authority has consistently held that arbitrators have considerable latitude in the conduct of hearings and that a party's objection to the manner in which the arbitrator conducted the hearing does not alone provide a basis for finding the award deficient. In particular, an arbitrator's exclusion of testimony alone does not establish that the arbitrator denied a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of HHS, SSA</span>, 24 FLRA 959, 961 (1986) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>). Arbitrators are required only to grant a fundamentally fair hearing, which provides adequate notice, a hearing on the evidence, and an impartial decision by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">PTO, </span>60 FLRA at 879.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator's refusal to allow it to call Union witnesses on the issue of arbitrability denied it a fair hearing and demonstrated bias against the Agency. In this regard, the Arbitrator stated to the Agency that he would decide the issue of arbitrability on the basis of the collective bargaining agreement and that the disputed testimony was not necessary to resolve the issue of arbitrability. The Agency's assertions of the relevance of the testimony to the issues on the merits fail to demonstrate that the Arbitrator's refusal was not within his latitude to control the conduct of the hearing by ensuring that testimony was relevant and material to the resolution of the arbitrability issue. Consequently, the assertions provide no basis for finding that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">See PTO, </span>60 FLRA at 879; <span class="Italic">SSA, </span>24 FLRA at 961-62. Accordingly, we deny the exception contending that the Arbitrator denied a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Authority denies a party's fair hearing exception, and the party's bias exception is based on the asserted denial of a fair hearing, the Authority also denies the bias exception. <span class="Italic">PTO</span>, 60 FLRA at 879. Consistent with this precedent, as the Agency's bias exception is based on its fair hearing exception, which we have denied, we also deny the bias exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">An objection to the arbitrator's conduct of the hearing should be made during the hearing, or FLRA will not consider a challenge to the same conduct through an exception to the award. Resolving exceptions based on several concerns expressed by the union as to an arbitrator's conduct during the hearing, FLRA determined, <span class="Italic">Bremerton Metal Trades Council and Dept. of Navy, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v59/59-104.html">59 FLRA 583</a>, 587-88 (2004):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To begin, the Union claims that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing because he fell asleep during the Union's cross-examination of an Agency witness on the second day of the hearing. In this respect, the Union claims that it was denied due process and, thus, that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing. Exceptions at 35 (citing<span class="Italic"> Burdine v. Johnson</span>, 262 F.3d 336 (5th Cir. 2001) (case involving due process in a criminal matter)). After review of the record, however, we conclude that the actions of the Arbitrator do not amount to a denial of a fair hearing.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">According to the transcript, the Arbitrator stated that he had "an involuntary moment of dozing" while the Union was cross-examining <span id="page_1928"></span>an Agency witness. The Arbitrator offered to remedy the situation by having the court reporter read the last three questions and answers of the witness. That was done, and the Arbitrator turned the questioning back over to Union counsel. At this point, counsel made no objections, either to the sufficiency of the steps taken by the Arbitrator to remedy his momentary sleep, or a motion to recuse based on what counsel now claims to be a deprivation of a fair hearing. Instead, counsel merely stated, "[n]o further questions." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Accordingly, under these circumstances, we conclude that the Union has failed to demonstrate how it was prejudiced.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the Union's next three contentions, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that the Arbitrator could not hear testimony, that he was unable to comprehend the matter presented to him and was incompetent, and that at times he treated Union witnesses in a harsher manner than Agency witnesses, we again do not find that the hearing was so prejudiced as to deny the Union a fair hearing. Turning to the first contention, even if the Arbitrator did have difficulty hearing, we find that requiring witnesses or counsel to speak in a louder tone than normal does not show prejudice against the Union. Moreover, after reviewing the Arbitrator's award we conclude that the Union has failed to demonstrate how it exhibits any manifest incompetence as argued by the Union or that the Arbitrator was unable to comprehend the issues or evidence presented in this matter. Lastly, the Union has not pointed to any specific examples in the record of how its witnesses were unfairly treated. However, even if it had, an arbitrator has considerable latitude in the conduct of a hearing and we will not find an award deficient merely because a party finds that conduct objectionable.<span class="Italic"> See United States Dep't of the Air Force, San Antonio Air Logistics Ctr., Kelly Air Force Base, Tex.</span>, 45 FLRA 797, 801 (1992) (Union claim that witnesses weren't afforded the same courtesy that management's witnesses were afforded was not enough to show that the award was deficient).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, although our decision in <span class="Italic">Indian Head</span> dealt with personal bias, the principles recognized in that precedent and originally set forth in <span class="Italic">Veterans Admin., Reg'l Office</span>, 5 FLRA 463, 470-71 (1981) (<span class="Italic">Veterans</span>) apply equally in cases involving allegations of an unfair hearing. As was stated in <span class="Italic">Veterans</span>, "unless parties are bound by the records made before the arbitrators, the piecemeal or staggered submission of evidence would be likely to erode the effectiveness of arbitration as a speedy and efficient forum for resolving labor disputes." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 471 (quoting <span class="Italic">Washington-Baltimore Newspaper Guild, Local 35 v. Washington Post Co.</span>, 442 F.2d 1234, 1238 (D.C. Cir. 1971)). Therefore, we caution parties that absent extraordinary circumstances, issues involving arbitrator conduct at the hearing should be raised at the hearing. When they could have been, but were not raised before the arbitrator, such issues will not be considered for the first time on review of the award unless extraordinary circumstances are present<span class="Italic">. See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Indian Head</span>, 57 FLRA at 422; <span class="Italic">Food and Drug Admin., Cincinnati Dist. Office</span>, 34 FLRA 533, 535-36 (1990).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the Arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing.&#x2003;An award will be found deficient on the ground that an arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing where a party demonstrates that the arbitrator refused to hear or consider pertinent and material evidence, or that other actions in conducting the proceeding so prejudiced a party as to affect the fairness of the proceeding as a whole. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1668</span>, 50 FLRA 124, 126 (1995). It is well established that an arbitrator has considerable latitude in conducting a hearing and an arbitrator's limitation on the submission of evidence does not, by itself, demonstrate that the arbitrator failed to provide a fair hearing. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Commerce, Patent &#x0026; Trademark Office, Arlington, Va.</span>, 60 FLRA 869, 879 (2005). In addition, the Authority has held that "absent extraordinary circumstances, issues involving arbitrator conduct at the hearing should be raised at the hearing." <span class="Italic">Bremerton Metal Trades Council</span>, 59 FLRA 583, 588 (2004) (<span class="Italic">Bremerton</span>). Thus, when such issues "could have been, but were not raised before the arbitrator, [they] will not be considered for the first time on review of the award unless extraordinary circumstances are present." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Further, disagreement with an arbitrator's evaluation of evidence and testimony, including the determination of the weight to be accorded such evidence, provides no basis for finding an award deficient on fair-hearing grounds. <span class="Italic">See Antilles Consol. Educ. Ass'n</span>, 64 FLRA 675, 678 (2010) (<span class="Italic">Antilles</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency's fair-hearing exception challenges the Arbitrator's decision to limit the supervisors' testimony to affirming that their written statements were true and accurate, and his negative credibility determinations regarding both statements. With regard to the Arbitrator's decision to limit the supervisors' testimony, the Arbitrator made this decision because the Director confirmed under oath that he based the suspension exclusively on these written statements. The Agency does not claim, and there is no indication from the record before the Authority, that, at the arbitration hearing, the Agency objected to the Arbitrator's decision to limit the supervisors' testimony. Further, the Agency does not allege that there are extraordinary circumstances that excuse its failure to object before the Arbitrator. Therefore, the Agency has not established that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing in this respect. <span class="Italic">See Bremerton</span>, 59 FLRA at 588.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With regard to the Arbitrator's negative credibility determinations concerning the supervisors' statements and testimony, as stated above, disagreement with an arbitrator's determination of the weight to be accorded evidence does not provide a basis for setting aside an arbitration award on fair-hearing grounds. <span class="Italic">Antilles</span>, 64 FLRA at 678. Therefore, the Agency has not shown that the Arbitrator failed to conduct a fair hearing in this respect.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award in favor of the union following its evidence, in the nature of a "directed verdict," does not mean that the hearing is unfair, unless there is evidence that the agency's submissions could have changed the facts leading to the arbitrator's decision. <span class="Italic">HCFA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 26 FLRA 860, 863 (1987).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between the Arbitrator and the Agency concerned administrative matters about how and when the award would issue.
