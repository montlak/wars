<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Roy v.

Smithsonian Inst.</span>, 15 MSPR 194, 196 (1983) (VRA appointee; four-year break in service from one position to the other); <span class="Italic">Viloria v. USPS</span>, 1 MSPR 697, 698, 2 MSPB 107 (1980) (appellant's service as a preference eligible serving a trial period may have been similar in the prior agency, but it was not continuous since the previous appointment ended on May 19 and the appointment in the gaining agency began on June 4). [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-086.html#sec1-85">Tacking of Prior Service: Competitive Service Probation</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of the current continuous service requirement for excepted service preference eligible appointees is provided by <span class="Italic">Martin v. MSPB</span>, 211 Fed. Appx. 972 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal civilian employees may generally appeal to the Board from adverse agency actions, such as removals, if they meet the requirements set forth in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1).<span class="Italic"> See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7513(d), 7512(1). For a preference eligible employee in the excepted service, such as Mr. Martin, section 7511(a)(1)(B) requires the employee to have completed one year of current continuous service in the same or a similar position. "Current continuous service" is defined by regulation as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action in the same or similar positions without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before his removal, Mr. Martin was continuously employed in his position from July 17 to November 18, 2005, a period of four months. Accordingly, the Board has jurisdiction over his appeal only if he was continuously employed in a similar government position for the eight months ending on the workday immediately prior to July 17, 2005. The only allegations Mr. Martin advanced as to his prior government service relate to his employment as a supply clerk from January 1984 to July 1986. Even assuming that position was "similar" to the one from which he was removed, it is clear that there was a break of more than one workday between Mr. Martin's service in the 1980s and his service in 2005. Mr. Martin's allegations thus do not support a claim of current continuous service in the same or similar position, and the Board therefore had no jurisdiction to address the merits of the appeal. For that reason, we affirm the Board's decision dismissing Mr. Martin's appeal.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...To establish the Board's jurisdiction over a disciplinary removal action, a Postal Service employee must show that: (1) He was a preference eligible, a management or supervisory employee, or an employee engaged in personnel work in other than a purely nonconfidential clerical capacity; and (2) he completed one year of current, continuous service in the same or a similar position. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B); 39 USC &#x00A7; 1005(a); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Reedy v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows, and it is undisputed, that the appellant is a preference eligible. Regarding the issue of whether he completed one year of current, continuous service in the same or a similar position at the time he was removed, the agency's removal decision notice shows, and the appellant has not disputed, that he was previously removed from a position at the agency on February 5, 1998, and was reemployed by the agency on July 18, 1998, before being removed again effective June 4, 1999. Thus, there was a break in service from February 5 to July 18, 1998, when he was reemployed at the agency, and he had less than one year of current, continuous service after being reemployed, before being removed again on June 4, 1999. <span class="Italic">See Francis v.

<p class="Body-Text">The term "break" was defined, <span class="Italic">Williams v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-15-0530-M-1 (NP 1/4/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 does not define "break," when construing a regulation, we first examine the regulatory language itself to determine its plain meaning, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, the inquiry ends with the plain meaning. <span class="Italic">See Roberto v. Department of the Navy</span>, 440 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2006). The Board may refer to dictionary definitions to determine the ordinary meaning of an undefined regulatory term. <span class="Italic">American Express Co. v. U.S.</span>, 262 F.3d 1376, 1381 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary defines "break" as "an interruption in continuity." Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 140 (10th ed. 2002). Similarly, Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary defines "break" as "a disruption in continuity or regularity." Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 199 (1984). Thus, the ordinary meaning of the term "break" in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 clearly encompasses the 5-day interruption in the appellant's employment with the agency pursuant to the "required break" under the applicable collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For a time there was flexibility. The requirement was met for an excepted service structural ironworker who held a series of five excepted service consecutive appointments covering nearly four years, interrupted by breaks of less than two weeks. The agency essentially entered into a continuing employment contract with the appellant, reflecting what was truly nontemporary employment in a continuing position in circumstances of continuous employment, as the term is used in 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B), despite brief interruptions. There was no evidence that appellant's work involved temporary projects or a changing and unpredictable workload. As a result, the employee had adverse action appeal rights; the dismissal was reversed. <span class="Italic">Roden v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A preference eligible in the Postal Service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions is an "employee" who is entitled to appeal certain agency adverse actions to the Board. 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B); <span class="Italic">Santiago v. USPS</span>, 62 MSPR 41, 43 (1994). In his response to the agency's motion and in his petition for review, the appellant asserts that his appeal should be governed by <span class="Italic">Roden v. TVA</span>, 25 MSPR 363 (1984), in which the Board found that the appellant, who had received a series of temporary appointments to a Structural Ironworker Welder position, was an employee under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) and had a right to appeal his separation to the Board. He distinguishes <span class="Italic">Hayes</span> [<span class="Italic">v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 622 (1988)], in which the Board found that it lacked jurisdiction over the appellant's appeal of his removal, on the basis that Hayes involved a 3-day break in service due to a voluntary resignation period.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, the Board noted that the preference eligible appellant's five appointments covered a period of nearly 4 years and were interrupted only by periods of less than 2 weeks, that almost 2 years elapsed between the appellant's fourth appointment and the appellant's final separation, and that the break in service between the end of the fourth appointment and the beginning of the fifth appointment was only 2 workdays. The Board further noted that there was no evidence that the agency employed the appellant under temporary appointments because of a changing or unpredictable workload or a project expected to last only a limited period of time. It found that absent such evidence, and considering the nature and length of the appellant's appointments, the agency had effectively entered into a continuing employment contract with the appellant. Therefore, it concluded that the appellant's service, despite brief interruptions, was "continuous" under the statute. 25 MSPR at 364, 367-68.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, the preference eligible appellant had worked for the agency for almost 2 years when he was indefinitely suspended on October 20, 1986, for alleged off-duty misconduct. Pursuant to a settlement agreement in which he agreed to voluntarily resign on May 20, 1987, the agency agreed to reinstate him 3 days later. Less than a year after his reinstatement, the agency removed him for alleged misconduct. The Board distinguished <span class="Italic">Roden</span> on the basis that the appellant failed to show that the agency had entered into a continuing employment contract with him. Specifically, it noted that the appellant's break in service occurred as a result of the agreement to settle a dispute regarding the appellant's indefinite suspension. It concluded that the appellant had failed to establish that the true nature of his employment was anything other than two appointments, separated under an agreement that was properly designed to interrupt his service. 36 MSPR at 623, 625.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, the appellant received five temporary appointments as follows: December 13, 1993 to December 25, 1993; January 3, 1994 to March 26, 1994; April 2, 1994 to June 21, 1994; June 28, 1994 to October 15, 1994; and October 17, 1994 to November 30, 1994, when he was terminated for alleged misconduct. The appellant received his final appointment on March 4, 1995, pursuant to a settlement agreement, and was terminated effective March 22, 1995. We find that the appellant's situation here is more comparable to that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Hayes</span> than to that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Roden</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's total service with the agency, counting periods between appointments, spanned only a little over 15 months. Not counting the periods between appointments, the appellant's total service spanned less than 1 year. Moreover, the appellant's last term of service, which was proceeded by a 3-month break, was only 18 days. Contrary to the appellant's assertion in his petition for review, this most recent break in service--from November 30, 1994, to March 4, 1995--was hardly "brief, consisting of only a few days." In addition, the appellant's service is not comparable to that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, who served for nearly 4 years and whose last two appointments totalled nearly 2 years with only a 2-day break. Moreover, as in <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, the appellant here was terminated from his next to last appointment for alleged misconduct, and was given a new appointment only as the result of a settlement agreement. Thus, we find that the agency did not effectively enter into a continuing employment contract with the appellant, but that his latest appointment was a separate appointment effected under an agreement reached after a 3-month break in service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant in the present case, as in <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, is not an employee under 5 USC 7511(a)(1)(B) entitled to appeal his termination to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">How did <span class="Italic">Roden</span> and its kin square with the definition in 5 CFR 752.402 allowing no more than one day break in service? The analysis in <span class="Italic">Roden</span> was more equitable than statutory, 25 MSPR at 367-68 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our opinion, the absence of any such evidence, along with the fact that the appellant received five of these appointments, that he was separated from each of the first four only when the appointment had expired, and that he was reappointed shortly after each expiration, that the agency effectively entered into a continuing employment contract with the appellant. We therefore find that, although these appointments purportedly constituted only temporary employment, they in fact reflected the appellant's nontemporary employment in a continuing position or positions; and that his service under these appointments, despite brief interruptions* was "continuous" as that term is used in section 7511 (a) (1) (B). In view of the fact that this employment continued for nearly four years, we find further that the appellant had more than the one year of current continuous service required for coverage under section 7513 and that he therefore was entitled to the rights provided to employees under that section.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The equitable persuasive value of <span class="Italic">Roden</span> ceased when it was overruled by <span class="Italic">Winns v. USPS</span>, 124 MSPR 113, 2017 MSPB 1, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-18, (2017) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">sub nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Williams v.

Cir. 2018), <span class="Italic">post</span>), relying on an OPM regulation issued post-<span class="Italic">Roden</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency employed the preference-eligible appellant in a series of four temporary, time-limited appointments, beginning on December 3, 2011. Each appointment was for less than a year, and they were separated by a break in service of at least several days. Most recently, on February 6, 2014, following a 5-day break in service, the agency appointed the appellant to a temporary Postal Support Employee position. Approximately 9 months later, before that appointment expired, the agency terminated the appellant's employment for alleged misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant filed a Board appeal challenging his termination, and alleged, among other things, that he was terminated in retaliation for whistleblowing. He did not request a hearing. Based on the written record, the administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appeal because the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation that he had completed 1 year of current continuous service at the time that he was terminated. He further found that the Board lacks jurisdiction over the appellant's claims of whistleblower retaliation because U.S. Postal Service employees are not entitled to seek corrective action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_47"></span>Only an "employee," as defined under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, can appeal an adverse action to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(a)(1), 7513(d); <span class="Italic">Mathis v.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B), which concerns preference-eligible employees in the excepted service, an employee with the right to appeal to the Board includes a preference-eligible U.S. Postal Service employee who has completed "1 year of current, continuous service" in the same or similar positions. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511(b)(8); <span class="Italic">Mathis</span>, 865 F.2d at 232-33. We agree with the administrative judge that the dispositive issue in the instant appeal is whether the appellant completed 1 year of "current continuous service" at the time of his termination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 does not define "current continuous service." In <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, the Board found that a preference-eligible employee who held a series of five temporary appointments to the same position, separated by short breaks in service, established jurisdiction over his termination appeal, even though he held the appointment from which he was terminated for less than a year. <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 364, 367-68. The Board found that, even assuming that section 7511(a)(1)(B) generally excluded service that was interrupted by a break in service of 2 workdays, it was obligated to look beyond the form of statutory and other provisions, and to determine the purpose which these provisions were intended to serve. <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 367. The Board found that, under the circumstances at issue, the agency had effectively entered into a continuing employment contract with the employee, and therefore, despite several breaks, his service was "continuous" within the meaning of section 7511(a)(1)(B). <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 368. Having resolved the appeal on other grounds, the Board declined to address whether guidance in versions of OPM's Federal Personnel Manual (FPM) in effect at the time interpreted the "current continuous service" requirement in section 7511(a)(1)(B) as precluding breaks in service of a workday.[6] <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 365 n.3, 367.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The relevant versions of the FPM contained seemingly conflicting guidance regarding this issue. In pertinent part, the 1980 version of the FPM stated, "[c]urrent continuous employment in a position outside the competitive service may be either employment in one position without a break of a workday or employment in more than one position in the same line of work without a break of a workday." <span class="Italic">Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 365 n.3. However, the same section also stated that "employment is credited for this purpose in the same manner that it is credited toward completion of a probationary period," which would permit a break in service of up to 30 days. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 365 &#x0026; n.3.

Although 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 refers to "current continuous employment," rather than "current continuous service," the appellant does not dispute that the regulation was enacted to implement 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, and applies to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B).[7] <span class="Italic">See also Wilder</span>, 675 F.3d at 1322 n.1; Other Than Full-Time Career Employment and Adverse Actions, 52 Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote2">was superseded by [5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402[ ] which became effective on July 11, 1988.

However, this error is of no consequence because the pertinent inquiry is OPM's interpretation of section 7511(a)(1)(B), the relevant statute, not OPM's interpretation of the Board's rationale for its decision in <span class="Italic">Roden</span>.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The fact that title 5 does not define "current continuous service," standing alone, does not necessarily render the statute silent or ambiguous. <span class="Italic">See Gardner v. Brown</span>, 5 F.3d 1456, 1459 (Fed.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), which enacted 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, does not preclude the Board from interpreting the phrase "current continuous service" in section 7511(a)(1)(B) according to its plain meaning. <span class="Italic">See</span> S.

S. Rep. No. 95-969, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2723, 2770. At the time that the CSRA was enacted, although the civil service regulations themselves did not define "current continuous service," the meaning of that phrase, as used in those regulations, was set forth in the 1978 version of the FPM, which provided:</p>

Thus, interpreting the "current continuous service" requirement in section 7511(a)(1)(B) in accordance with the plain meaning of the term "continuous" appears consistent with the intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if we were to find that Congress had not expressed its intent on this matter, however, or that its purpose and intent is unclear, we would find that OPM's interpretation in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 is based on a permissible construction of the statute and afford <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference to it.[10] As the agency charged with promulgating regulations to implement 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, OPM's interpretation of a statutory term governs if it is a reasonable interpretation of the statute--not necessarily the only possible interpretation, nor even the interpretation deemed most reasonable by the Board. <span class="Italic">See Entergy Corporation v.

Here, because OPM's definition of "current continuous service" is in accordance with the plain meaning of "continuous" and the legislative history of the CSRA, we find that it is both reasonable and consistent with the statute.[11] .</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;In contrast, OPM's FPM guidance in effect during the time period at issue in <span class="Italic">Roden</span> was not subject to notice and comment rulemaking, and would not be afforded <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference. <span class="Italic">See Knapp v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;We have considered the appellant's argument that the definition of current continuous employment in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 is unreasonable because it differs from the 30-day break in service permitted for purposes of tacking on prior service to complete a probationary or trial period. We find this argument unpersuasive. The Board has held that the 30-day rule applicable to tacking service to determine whether an individual has completed a trial or probationary period does not apply when determining whether prior service may be counted toward the applicable current continuous service requirement under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1). <span class="Italic">Maibaum v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We start with the Board's interpretation of "current continuous service." Section 7511 defines "employee" for the provisions that give the Board jurisdiction over appeals by federal employees. <span class="Italic">Wilder v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 675 F.3d 1319, 1321 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The statute states that "'employee' means...a preference eligible in the excepted service who has completed 1 year of current continuous service in the same or similar positions...in the United States Postal Service...." &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(B)(ii). OPM's regulation in turn defines "current continuous employment" as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402.[1] We conclude that OPM's regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statute, and that the Board correctly applied OPM's regulation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The statute uses the term "service," whereas OPM's regulation uses the term "employment." Despite this difference in terminology, we have treated OPM's regulation as interpreting the statutory term "current continuous service." <span class="Italic">Wilder</span>, 675 F.3d at 1321-22. Neither party argues that the difference in terminology has any legal significance here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress authorized OPM to "prescribe regulations to carry out the purpose of th[e] subchapter" of the Civil Service Reform Act that includes &#x00A7; 7511. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7514; <span class="Italic">accord Wilder</span>, 675 F.3d at 1322. And OPM relied on notice-and-comment rulemaking to promulgate its regulation defining "current continuous service." Adverse Actions, 53 Fed. Reg. 21,619-01, 21,623 (June 9, 1988). Thus, we apply the two-step framework of <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc</span>., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), to determine whether OPM's regulation is permissible. At <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step one, we consider whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 842-43. If Congress left no statutory ambiguity, then we must give effect to congressional intent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But if the statute is silent or ambiguous, then, at step two, we determine whether the agency's regulation is permissible, and we must defer to the agency's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 843.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step one, we find that Congress did not speak directly to whether a series of temporary appointments, with short breaks in between, can count as "continuous service" under &#x00A7; 7511. There is no definition of "current continuous service" in the statute. Nor are we aware of any legislative history that tells us whether Congress intended the statute to cover an individual who was employed through a series of temporary appointments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, Mr. Williams contends the statute is clear that employment is "continuous" where both parties intend the employee to continue working from position to position, even if there are short breaks in between. To support this reading of the statute, Mr. Williams cites to Board decisions finding that a series of temporary appointments counts as "continuous service" under the "continuing employment contract" theory. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Roden</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. at 368; <span class="Italic">Melvin v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 79 M.S.P.R. 372, 379 (1998). The Board's decisions, however, do not show that <span class="Italic">Congress</span> intended "continuous service" to cover a series of temporary appointments. At best, these decisions show the <span class="Italic">Board</span> has changed its interpretation of &#x00A7; 7511. But supposedly inconsistent Board decisions are not relevant here for purposes of determining congressional intent, nor was the Board charged with promulgating regulations to carry out the statute at issue. OPM is the agency so charged and it was OPM that promulgated 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402, which further defined "continuous service." And it was OPM's regulatory definition that ultimately resulted in the Board's overruling of its "continuing employment contract" theory.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> step two, we find that OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7511 is a permissible construction of the statute. OPM's regulation defines "current continuous employment" as "a period of employment or service immediately preceding an adverse action without a break in Federal civilian employment of a workday." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402. As the Board noted in reviewing the regulation, the ordinary meaning of "continuous" is "uninterrupted," "unbroken," or "marked by uninterrupted extension in space, time, or sequence." <span class="Italic">Winns</span>, 124 M.S.P.R. at 119. Thus, OPM's definition is consistent with the common understanding of "continuous." We are unaware of any legislative intent to depart from the plain meaning of the statutory text.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Williams further asserts that OPM's interpretation of &#x00A7; 7511 is not entitled to deference because it merely parrots the statute. It is true that "[a]n agency does not acquire special authority to interpret its own words when, instead of using its expertise and experience to formulate a regulation, it has elected merely to paraphrase the statutory language." <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Oregon</span>, 546 U.S. 243, 257 (2006). This is commonly known as the anti-parroting canon. Mr. Williams's reliance on this doctrine, however, is misplaced because OPM's regulation does more than paraphrase the statute. Section 7511 uses the term "continuous employment" without clarification. OPM's regulation defines the term as "without a break...<span class="Italic">of a workday</span>." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 752.402 (emphasis added). Mr. Williams argues the regulation is parroting because "without a break" and "continuous" are synonymous. But OPM's regulation does more than paraphrase--it also establishes the <span class="Italic">break duration</span> that cuts off "continuous employment." Thus, &#x00A7; 752.402 clarifies an otherwise ambiguous statutory term.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also did not err in applying &#x00A7; 752.402 to the appeals of Mr. Williams and Mr. Winns. It is undisputed that Mr. Williams took a five-day break between his RCA and CCA positions. Likewise, Mr. Winns started as a Postal Support Employee after a five-day break from a previous appointment. Neither Mr. Williams nor Mr. Winns qualified as an employee under OPM's regulation because they had a break in service of at least one workday. Thus, the Board was correct in finding that Mr. Williams and Mr. Winns did not meet the requirement of "current continuous service," as the term is defined by OPM.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">In the alternative, the appellant argues that as a disability retiree he remained in federal service for the duration of his retirement and so, at the time of the adverse action, he had more than a year of current continuous service without a break of a workday and, therefore, was an "employee" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511(a)(1)(A)(ii).

Moreover, the Board has held that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 315.802(c), the provision permitting the crediting of absences due to compensable injuries, does not affect the computation of an employee's current continuous service. <span class="Italic">See Gadsden v.
