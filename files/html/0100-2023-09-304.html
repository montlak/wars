<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-301"><span class="space">b.</span> Inadvertent or Isolated Failure to Obey Judge's Orders</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Wright v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 53 MSPR 244, 249-50 (1992), explained that efforts by <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants falling short of full compliance with Board administrative orders should not warrant dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In determining whether the imposition of sanctions is proper, the Board has held that good faith efforts falling short of full compliance should be considered in determining whether dismissal is an appropriate sanction....&#8197;The Board has also held that sanctions are unwarranted where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant appears to be confused by Board proceedings, or where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant made incomplete responses to Board orders, but evidenced no intent to abandon the appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon applying these considerations to the present case, we find that dismissal for failure to prosecute is not warranted. First, the above procedural history indicates that, although the administrative judge made a substantial effort to assist the <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant, she was still confused about various aspects of the appeals procedure, including the difference between her petition for appeal and her prehearing statement, and the requirement that she produce documents even though she disagreed with their relevance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The procedural history...[also]reveals that the appellant filed timely motions, objections and responses to the administrative judge's procedural rulings and show cause order. Indeed, just 8 days prior to issuance of the initial decision dismissing her appeal for failure to prosecute, the appellant wrote a letter to the administrative judge, stating that personal problems prevented her from giving her appeal undivided attention, but that her situation had stabilized so she could address her appeal in a more effective manner. Moreover, as the administrative judge found, the appellant agreed to have her appeal decided on the basis of the written record in order to facilitate its adjudication.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The failure to prosecute an appeal must be realistically appraised. An appeal ought not be dismissed if the orders issued by the AJ are not specific enough to inform a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant that his appeal will be dismissed if he fails to respond. The AJ's orders should warn the appellant that his failure to respond to orders will result in dismissal of the appeal or should require the appellant to show cause why his appeal should not be dismissed for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">Fox v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 29, 31 (1992). "[A]n employee's reasonable excuse for a delay in adhering to the time limits for filing a pleading should be accepted absent a showing of substantial prejudice to the agency caused by the delay, and when the delay was excusable in light of the particular facts and attending circumstances where diligence or ordinary prudence has been exercised." <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 597, 599 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board looks for good faith efforts short of full compliance before applying the sanction of dismissal. <span class="Italic">Simmons v. OPM</span>, 20 MSPR 225, 227 (1984) (failure to sign an appeal did not to warrant dismissal after the appellant made a good faith effort and sent the signed document to the agency rather than to the Board); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 87 MSPR 369, 372-73 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (dismissal was improper when the appellant failed to timely respond to the AJ's order to provide a current address; the appellant responded belatedly and attempted, through voice mail messages, to respond to agency inquiries concerning outstanding discovery requests; "severe sanction of dismissal with prejudice for failure to prosecute an appeal should not be imposed when a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant has made incomplete response to the Board's orders but has not exhibited bad faith or evidenced any intent to abandon his appeal, and appears to be confused by Board procedures"); <span class="Italic">Gumper v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 394, 397 (1991) (dismissal was improper when, after the AJ asked for the appellant to notify him whether the appellant wished to pursue an appeal, the appellant submitted a designation of representative form, construed by the Board as an indication that the appellant wished to pursue the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1288"></span>Dismissal was improper when the appellant made clear her intent to prosecute the appeal, explained that she was trying to get counsel, and the AJ set a deadline that, given an intervening weekend and federal holiday, was too short to permit a timely response from the appellant. <span class="Italic">Holland v.

DHHS,</span> DC-1221-11-0762-W-1 (NP 7/12/2012) ("Moreover, although the response time to the Show Cause Order set by the administrative judge was too short, the appellant made no effort to respond or otherwise contact the administrative judge upon receipt of that Order, which may have evidenced good faith or at least an intent to proceed, upon learning that dismissal of her appeal was imminent. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Holland v. Department of Labor</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 599, &#x00B6; 10-12 (2008) (where the administrative judge did not allow sufficient time for response, and dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute, the Board reversed noting the appellant responded shortly after the deadline had passed in an effort to proceed with the appeal)."). The Board was not inclined to dismiss a USERRA appeal when the appellant failed to respond to a show cause order but she was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> and the evidence did not indicate she exhibited bad faith or intended to abandon her appeal. <span class="Italic">Lubert v.

<p class="Body-Text">An AJ should not dismiss an appeal for lack of prosecution if the appellant is hospitalized or is in an inpatient program during the period that he fails to respond to an AJ's orders, <span class="Italic">Slaughter v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 10, 12-13 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Anderson v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 999 F.2d 532, 533-34 (Fed. Cir. 1993), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit addressed an appellant's claim that his 1-day delay in filing a Board appeal resulted from his hospitalization in an alcohol and drug abuse treatment program until 7 days before the filing deadline and his subsequent difficulty in obtaining legal representation. The court found that the time limit should be waived for good cause shown and stated, with respect to the hospitalization, that "[o]ne who is hospitalized is entitled to give primary consideration to recovery of his health without being considered to lack diligence" if he fails to take steps towards filing his appeal during his hospitalization. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> 999 F.2d at 534. Similarly, we find that the appellant in this case should not be faulted for failing to prosecute his appeal while hospitalized because it is no easier to prosecute an appeal while hospitalized than it is to file an appeal while hospitalized. We therefore find that the appellant, by failing to respond to the administrative judge's prior orders while participating in the Cenikor program, did not exhibit bad faith or an intent to abandon his appeal so as to warrant dismissal of his appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Board may be more solicitous of <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants' efforts that do not fully meet the requirements of AJs' procedural orders, and although <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellants may be the most frequent objects of sanctions, it is a rule of general application that good faith efforts falling short of full compliance should be considered in determining whether a sanction, e.g., dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute, is appropriate. <span class="Italic">Morris v. OPM</span>, 37 MSPR 401, 405 (1988) (counsel made good faith efforts to supply a designation of representative).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reversed the Board when an AJ unreasonably dismissed an appeal, despite the intention to move ahead with the case, for a single arguable failure to abide by an acknowledgment order. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Williamson v. MSPB</span>, 334 F.3d 1058, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing <span class="Italic">Hamilton v. MSPB</span>, 75 F.3d 639, 646, 647 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). The failure to comply with an isolated order of an AJ does not constitute a failure to prosecute, authorizing dismissal of the appeal. Sanctions should be used only for repeated failures to comply with an AJ's order. <span class="Italic">In re Bohannon</span>, 1 MSPR 15, 16, 1 MSPB 15 (1979). The <span class="Italic">Bohannon</span> rule was followed in <span class="Italic">Beachum and VA</span>, 1 MSPR 115, 116, 1 MSPB 111 (1979): the appellant was given no opportunity to explain why she was late in complying with an AJ's order to provide certain information about her appeal. The AJ erred in dismissing an appeal for failure to prosecute after an employee failed to respond to an order requiring her to state where she was employed. <span class="Italic">Luciano v. OPM</span>, 21 MSPR 413, 415 (1984) (although the appellant did not indicate the date of OPM reconsideration in correspondence with the Board office, it was improper to dismiss the appeal for the appellant's failure to respond to a single order); <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Army</span>, 21 MSPR 51, 52 (1984) ("Inasmuch as Ms. Washington failed to respond to only one order, dismissal was improper as a sanction and did not serve the ends of justice."). The appellant's failure to include the Board's regional office in the service of a response to the Board's order to show cause on a jurisdictional issue should not have caused his appeal to be dismissed. The appellant served everyone else and there was no prejudice. Good cause was demonstrated to waive the time limit for the response. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. USPS</span>, 27 MSPR 597, 600 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It was error for an AJ to dismiss a disability retirement appeal for failure to prosecute when, after OPM failed to respond to the appeal, the appellant failed to respond to the AJ's invitation to submit additional evidence. OPM was the cause of the problem concerning the state of the record. The appellant could reasonably conclude that if he failed to respond to the AJ's inquiry, the case would be adjudicated on the existing record. <span class="Italic">Apog v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 15, 16 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. OPM</span>, 79 MSPR 437, 440 &#x00B6; 7 (1998) (some problems attributed to the appellant's prosecution of the appeal resulted from OPM's failure to respond to the AJ's acknowledgment order by submitting a copy of its file); <span class="Italic">Amoncio v.

OPM</span>, 24 MSPR 446, 448 (1984):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the Regional Office made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain appellant's retirement file from OPM. It then notified appellant that OPM had failed to furnish the file, and it asked appellant to furnish copies of any relevant documents in his possession. When appellant did not respond to this request, the Regional Office dismissed his appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 CFR &#x00A7; 772.303 (1978) states, in pertinent part, that an appeal may be closed for failure to prosecute if an appellant does not furnish required information and duly proceed with the advancement of his appeal. Instead of dismissing for failure to prosecute, however, the Regional Office may adjudicate the appeal if sufficient information is available in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is clear that OPM's failure to respond with the retirement file limited the information which was available to the Regional Office for purposes of adjudicating the appeal. Thus, it was reasonable for the Regional Office to advise appellant of the problem, and ask him to provide any additional evidence he might have of his claim. Appellant's failure to respond with such evidence, however, cannot be a basis for dismissing the appeal for failure to prosecute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record suggests that appellant failed to prosecute his appeal. To the contrary, it was the failure of OPM to respond with requested information which necessitated the letter to appellant. Appellant was specifically advised in the letter that, if he did not respond, the case would be adjudicated on the basis of the existing record. If appellant did not have any of the types of documents requested in the letter, he reasonably could have concluded that he need not respond and his case would be adjudicated. The Regional Office's decision dismissing the appeal due to his failure to respond was therefore erroneous.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Instructions from the AJ must be clear if an appeal is to be dismissed for failure to prosecute when those instructions are not followed. In <span class="Italic">Sisko v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 16 MSPR 561, 563 (1983), the appeal was reinstated after dismissal when the AJ's orders did not clearly state whether attendance at a prehearing conference was required or only strongly encouraged. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wallace v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 18 MSPR 208, 210 (1983) (failure to attend hearing was not grounds for dismissal when appellant never received notice that he was required to attend his hearing).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ cannot dismiss an appeal because of an appellant's failure to take an action by a deadline unknown to the appellant prior to the required action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Land v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 270, 271, 2 MSPB 434 (1980); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Sepillo v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 416, 419 (1988) (it was improper to dismiss an appeal after the appellant failed to respond to an order to show cause that he did not receive prior to the issuance of the initial decision). Dismissal for failure to prosecute was improper as to a counsel fee motion. The appellant's address was in the record and the AJ failed to serve the appellant with inquiries concerning the fee motion after counsel of record did not respond to those inquiries. The AJ should not have dismissed the fee petition without notifying the appellant of the need for additional evidence and providing an opportunity to respond. <span class="Italic">McGuire v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 54, 56, 5 MSPB 130 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Dismissal was unwarranted when some confusion existed concerning the appellant's proper address. The appeal should not have been dismissed when the appellant's failure to respond to the AJ's orders (because he did not receive some of them) was partially attributable to the AJ's errors. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 48 MSPR 283, 286 (1991). There was adjudicatory error when an appeal was dismissed for failure to prosecute despite the appellant's repeated notifications to the Board of changes in address. Had the changes been noted by the regional office, the appellant could have followed the proceedings in his case rather than remaining uninformed of developments and then having the appeal dismissed after he failed to participate. <span class="Italic">Almida v. FAA</span>, 16 MSPR 299, 301 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant makes some effort to comply with a prehearing order, the appeal ought not to be dismissed for failure to prosecute, even though the compliance is both less than complete and otherwise unexplained by the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Diaz v. DHHS</span>, 57 MSPR 325, 329 (1993) (although ordered by the AJ to contact the AJ, the appellant contacted the agency representative rather than the AJ; the AJ's order was construed as ambiguous); <span class="Italic">Bieker v. VA</span>, 22 MSPR 217, 219 (1984) (appeal should not have been dismissed for failure to prosecute when the appellant did not respond to the AJ's order that was ambiguous and that did not necessarily require a response; the appellant responded to a subsequent order that clearly required a response). An appeal was not to be dismissed when the appellant, who was semi-literate, had difficulty responding to the prehearing order but attempted to do so. The appellant made known his interest in having a hearing. Sanctions were unwarranted when a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant appeared to be confused by Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">Branch v. DOD</span>, 51 MSPR 537, 541 (1991) (semi-literate appellant made attempts to proceed with an appeal; his appeal should not have been dismissed for lack of prosecution).</p>

The Board noted that the prehearing conference was conducted and concluded, and that the AJ had all the information needed to conduct the hearing; no sanctions were necessary:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge may impose sanctions against a party for failure to follow the Board's regulations or failure to respond to the administrative judge's orders. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1201.43; <span class="Italic">Carrier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 54, 56 (1994). However, an administrative judge should not resort to the imposition of sanctions unless necessary to serve the ends of justice<span class="Italic">. See Toombs v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 78, 81 (1995); <span class="Italic">Carrier,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 57. The imposition of sanctions are unwarranted where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant appears to be confused by Board proceedings, or where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant has made incomplete responses to Board orders, but evidenced no intent to abandon the appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sullivan v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 117 &#x00B6; 6 (2000). Furthermore, the Board has stated that dismissal for failure to prosecute is an extreme sanction that should not be imposed against a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant who has not exhibited bad faith or evidenced any intent to abandon his appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Chandler v. Department of the Navy,</span> 87 M.S.P.R. 369 &#x00B6; 6 (2000); <span class="Italic">Toombs,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. at 81. The Board has also stated that failure to obey a single order does not ordinarily justify the sanction of dismissal for failure to prosecute. <span class="Italic">See Lynch</span> <span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 437, 439 (1998); <span class="Italic">Toombs</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. at 81; <span class="Italic">Murdock,</span> 38 M.S.P.R. at 299; <span class="Italic">Clower</span>, 15 M.S.P.R. at 475. Nevertheless, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, the Board will not reverse an administrative judge's determination regarding sanctions. <span class="Italic">See Montgomery v.</span> <span class="Italic">Department of the Army,</span> 80 M.S.P.R. 435 &#x00B6; 17 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge found that the appellant failed to respond to two orders, namely, the June 19, 2002, order to file prehearing submissions and the July 16, 2002, order to appear for a deposition scheduled for July 31, 2002. Yet, while the appellant may not have complied with the letter of the order to file prehearing submissions, we find that the appellant made a good faith effort to comply with this order and that the imposition of sanctions on the basis of the appellant's failure to comply with this order did not serve the ends of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The June 19, 2002, order required the parties to file the following on or before July 12, 2002: (1) a statement of facts and issues, including any and all defenses the appellant intended to raise; (2) a list of all agreed upon material facts; (3) a list of witnesses with a brief summary of the expected testimony of each witness; and (4) a copy of exhibits accompanied by an index identifying the documents. However, the order advised the parties that documents previously submitted to the Board by either party were already a part of the record and were not to be offered as exhibits. The certificate of service attached to this order indicated that it was served on the parties by regular mail on June 20, 2002.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As discussed previously, the regional office received a packet from the appellant on June 24, 2002, which contained the appellant's response to the agency's discovery request, including a copy of the agency's request for admission of facts, its request for the production of documents, and its interrogatories. Although the appellant did not indicate that he admitted to any of the facts set forth in the agency's request for admission of facts, the appellant included several documents in response to the agency's request to produce documents, and the appellant submitted written responses to the interrogatories. The certificate of service attached to the appellant's packet indicated that the appellant had mailed the packet on June 19, 2002, the date of the administrative judge's order regarding prehearing submissions. In addition, the appellant attached several documents as exhibits to his appeal form. Thus, to the extent that the appellant believed that the relevant documents were already in the record, which included the exhibits he submitted with his appeal form, the documents he submitted in response to the agency's discovery requests, and the exhibits included in the agency's response file, the appellant may not have filed additional exhibits in response to the administrative judge's order regarding prehearing submissions because the order stated that it was unnecessary to resubmit documents that were already part of the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The other matters addressed in the order regarding prehearing submissions were resolved during the July 16, 2002, telephonic prehearing conference. For example, in the summary of this conference, the administrative noted that the appellant did not raise any affirmative defenses. With respect to the list of all agreed upon material facts, the administrative judge noted that the appellant admitted the first fact in the agency's request for admission of facts, i.e., that the appellant was at work on the date in question. However, the administrative judge indicated that the appellant believed that his union had not properly pursued the removal action against him, and that the appellant denied the remainder of the facts set forth in the agency's request. With respect to the witnesses, the administrative judge noted that the appellant did not request any witnesses but that he would be allowed to testify on his own behalf. Finally, the administrative judge noted that the issues to be decided in the appeal were whether the appellant had committed the misconduct as charged by the agency, and whether, if the charges were sustained, the appellant's removal was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, at the conclusion of the July 16, 2002, prehearing conference, the substance of the matters that were to be addressed in the parties' prehearing submissions had been resolved; that is, the parties knew that the appellant did not intend to raise any affirmative defenses, the parties had considered the material facts to which they would agree, the witnesses for each party had been approved, and the file contained copies of the exhibits on which the parties intended to rely. While the appellant failed to submit a complete and timely response to the administrative judge's order concerning prehearing submissions, we find that the appellant's submission of his responses to the agency's discovery requests, as well as his participation in the prehearing conference, constituted a good faith effort on the part of this <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant to comply with the order regarding prehearing submissions and evidenced the appellant's intent to not abandon his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Sullivan,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 117 &#x00B6; 7. In addition, the administrative judge never notified the appellant that his response to the order concerning prehearing submissions was defective. <span class="Italic">See Carrier,</span> 65 M.S.P.R. at 57 (the imposition of sanctions without notification to the appellant that his appeal was procedurally defective was not necessary to serve the ends of justice). Accordingly, we find that sanctions were unwarranted for the appellant's failure to comply with the administrative judge's order regarding the filing of prehearing submissions. <span class="Italic">See Wright v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 53 M.S.P.R. 244, 249 (1992) (sanctions are unwarranted where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant appears to be confused by Board proceedings, or where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant made incomplete responses to Board orders, but evidenced no intent to abandon the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an order directs that information be provided that is already plainly in the record, violation of that order does support action against a party, <span class="Italic">Felton v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 106 MSPR 198, 201 &#x00B6; 8, 2007 MSPB 170 (2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we note that the appellant did not respond to the acknowledgment order, we find that dismissing the appeal on the basis of that failure is not warranted. On his appeal form, the appellant provided all of the information required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.153(a) for an appeal alleging discrimination. The Board's regulation specifically states, "An appellant may comply with paragraph (a) of this section by completing MSPB Form 185." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.153(b). This is what the appellant did, and the acknowledgment order did not clearly alert him that his submission was insufficient to establish that he had filed a timely formal complaint. The administrative judge noted the absence of a copy of the formal complaint, but did not order the appellant to submit it. The agency's motion to dismiss the appeal disputed the accuracy of the appellant's statement, but the administrative judge did not advise the appellant that, unless he provided evidence to establish that he filed a timely formal complaint, his appeal would be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ must consider both the purpose of sanctions and an appellant's ability and efforts to comply with Board orders. In <span class="Italic">Macon v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 46 MSPR 410, 413, 415 (1990), the appeal was dismissed because the AJ felt the appellant failed properly to respond to prehearing requirements. The Board disagreed with that approach and result:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative judge is authorized to impose the sanction of dismissal for failure to prosecute if a party fails to prosecute or defend an appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 1201.43(b). The imposition of sanctions, however, must be utilized only when necessary to serve the ends of justice. Sanctions should be imposed only when a party has failed to exercise basic due diligence expected of it in complying with any order, or when a party has exhibited negligence or bad faith in its efforts to so comply....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's reliance upon <span class="Italic">Murdock v. GPO</span>, 38 MSPR 297 (1988), in dismissing the appeal for failure to prosecute is misplaced. In that case, the appellant completely failed to respond to or comply with any of the administrative judge's orders. He stated that he was attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and attempting to locate a representative. As detailed above, however, while the appellant here was attempting to locate a representative, and this alone would not excuse a failure to completely respond to Board orders, the appellant had made some efforts to comply with the orders of the Board when he submitted a response to the acknowledgment order, called the Regional Office on June 26th, visited the Office on June 27th, and appeared in the Office on July 9th. Good faith efforts falling short of full compliance should be considered in determining whether dismissal is an appropriate sanction....&#8197;Further, the Board has found sanctions unwarranted where a <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant appears to be confused by Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Santiago v. EEOC</span>, 26 MSPR 633, 638-39 (1985) (appellant's failure to appear at a deposition of a witness he requested and failure to respond to the agency's first set of interrogatories does not warrant sanctions where appellant appeared to be confused). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Hoyt v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 19 MSPR 21, 23 (1984) (sanction of dismissal found not to serve the ends of justice where <span class="Italic">pro se</span> appellant made incomplete response to Board orders, but evidenced no intent to abandon the appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ erred in dismissing an appeal for failure to prosecute when the AJ could not contact the appellant because of a clerical error made by the appellant <span id="Page_1290"></span>in her telephone number and when, on the date of a telephonic hearing, the appellant did not call a conference number set up for the hearing but instead unsuccessfully attempted to reach the AJ at the Board's regional office telephone number. It could not be said that the appellant failed to exercise basic due diligence or exhibited negligence or bad faith in her efforts to comply with the AJ's orders. <span class="Italic">Whittington v.
