<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-334"><span class="space">I.</span> SETTLEMENT</h3>
<p class="noindent">FLRA commends settlement efforts, <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, AFGE</span>, 22 FLRA 586, 591 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We strongly encourage parties engaged in Federal labor-management relations to take the initiative in settling unfair labor practice disputes at any stage. When settlement efforts are postponed, until charges are filed or the General Counsel decides whether a complaint should issue, timely solutions to the problem which gave rise to the dispute may be lost. Recognizing this, parties often lose the incentive to seek their own solutions and concentrate their efforts on litigation. A failure by the parties to attempt at every stage to resolve disputes voluntarily undermines the bilateralism which the Statute and the Authority are committed to fostering.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Far too many disputes are taken to litigation because the parties do not talk with each other and seek mutually satisfactory resolutions of their differences.&#x2003;The best resolutions of differences are the resolutions the parties work out themselves. Many unfair labor practice disputes appear to be susceptible to resolution by the parties themselves if they would initiate contact with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute and approach such discussions with the thought that their differences can and should be resolved.</p>
<p class="noindent">The statistics reflect considerable success in the settlement of ULP cases. The Authority's 2017 Congressional Budget Justification reports for FY 2015, "OGC resolved over 96 percent of the ULP cases in which merit was found and 95 percent of the representation cases in which the parties agreed to use the OGC's ADR services," and that "in FY 2015, in over 87 percent of cases in which the parties participated in the Settlement Judge Program, they reached agreement and fully resolved their dispute." That's pretty good. It puts the <span class="Italic">FLRA Guide</span> on a diet.</p>
<p class="noindent">On whether the FLRA General Counsel may unilaterally engage in the informal settlement of a ULP, FLRA stated in a <span class="Italic">Decision on a Request for a General Statement of Policy</span>, 23 FLRA 342, 344-45 (1986):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7104(f)(2) of the Statute defines the duties and responsibilities of the General Counsel. Specifically, that section empowers the General Counsel to "investigate alleged unfair labor practices...file and prosecute complaints,...and exercise such other powers of the Authority as the Authority may prescribe." Among these "other powers" is the "full and final authority and responsibility, on behalf of the Authority...to enter into and approve the informal settlement of charges" as set forth in Appendix B of our Rules and Regulations. Where, upon investigation of an unfair labor practice charge, the General Counsel issues a complaint but subsequently determines that it will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute to settle the matter, the General Counsel may then decide to cease prosecuting the complaint and enter into an informal settlement agreement. Such agreement may be either bilateral or unilateral depending on whether or not the charging party to the complaint is also a party to the settlement agreement. Once the General Counsel enters into an informal settlement agreement, Authority approval of that agreement is not required. The determination by the General Counsel to cease prosecuting a complaint and enter into an informal settlement <span id="page_1596"></span>agreement is thus fully within his authority as expressed by Congress in enacting section 7104(f)(2) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In exercising its leadership role under the Statute, the Authority has long maintained a policy of encouraging the informal resolution of unfair labor practice charges. This policy, expressed in sections 2423.2 and 2423.11 of the Rules and Regulations, extends to any phase of an unfair labor practice proceeding where the purposes and policies of the Statute will be effectuated. The settlement policy was designed to foster constructive and cooperative labor-management relations by encouraging parties involved in a labor-management dispute to communicate with one another in an attempt to resolve the matter and, hopefully, to forestall the occurrence of future disputes. It was also designed to resolve disputes expeditiously without resort to possibly lengthy and costly litigation and, generally, to promote harmony at the workplace. No limitation on the "full and final authority and responsibility" of the General Counsel to effect informal settlements as expressed in Appendix B and elsewhere in the Authority's Rules and Regulations was stated or intended.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]he General Counsel, through his regional directors, clearly possesses the authority to informally settle all allegations of unfair labor practices where the offered settlement will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent">The parties do not have a unilateral and unfettered right to withdraw charges through settlements among themselves. Under 5 CFR 2423.10 and 2423.11 (2022), the regional director must approve requests to withdraw charges, or otherwise settle pending ULP charges. A pending unapproved settlement agreement that, if approved, would eliminate the basis for the pending charge or estop the charging party from its prosecution, is no defense to a pending ULP charge. <span class="Italic">NRC and NTEU</span>, 20 FLRA 324, 345 (1985) (ALJ Decision). If a case is settled, unless there is timely notice to the respondent that charges have been withdrawn (for later refiling) before the settlement, the settlement covers the charges encompassed in the complaint. Without timely, effective notice of withdrawal of certain aspects of a complaint, the respondent is not required to bear the burden of defending itself against charges that it reasonably believes have already been settled. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow and AFGE Local 1485</span>, 33 FLRA 626, 635 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA encourages informal resolution of ULP charges. When settlements are accomplished, especially with full concurrence of FLRA agents, they must be honored unless there are overriding circumstances. To permit agreements entered into and relied on in good faith to be repudiated at will by any party would impair the successful resolution of informal resolutions and undermine FLRA policy. A regional director's issuance of complaint after a settlement was entered that he approved resulted in FLRA granting the respondent's motion to dismiss the complaint. <span class="Italic">Norfolk Naval Shipyard and Tidewater Virginia FEMTC</span>, 10 FLRA 641, 642 (1982). The same rule applies to settlement discussions in FLRA proceedings as applies in civil litigation: evidence pertaining to settlement discussions may not be used to prove the truth or falsity of allegations set out in a complaint. <span class="Italic">56th Combat Support Group, MacDill AFB and NFFE Local 153</span>, 44 FLRA 1098, 1103 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent">Settlement may be reached and approved by FLRA late in the game--even after an ALJ has issues a recommended decision and FLRA is considering exceptions. FLRA explained in <span class="Italic">USDA, FSIS and AFGE Nat'l Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals</span>, 49 FLRA 431, 433-38 (1994), its views on the timing, substance, and implementation of a "private settlement" reached between the charging party and the respondent:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The joint submission by the Respondent and the Charging Party constitutes a private settlement agreement and, for the following reasons, we will give that agreement effect. The Statute provides that "the statutory protection of the right[s] of employees...facilitates and encourages the amicable settlements of disputes between employees and their employers involving conditions of employment...." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a)(1)(C). Section 2423.2 of the Authority's Rules and Regulations encourages attempts to resolve unfair labor practice allegations prior to the filing of charges with the Authority. Further, section 2423.11 of the Rules and Regulations provides specific procedures for the formal or informal settlement of unfair labor practice charges at various stages prior to the issuance of a decision by an Administrative Law Judge. <span class="Italic">See also Decision on Request for</span> <span class="Italic">General Statement of Policy or Guidance</span>, 23 FLRA 342 (1986). However, our Regulations are silent as to settlement, either with the Authority as a party, or as a private settlement proposal, after a case has come before the Authority on exceptions to a Judge's decision. We have not previously been requested to give consideration to a private settlement proposal at such a late stage in an unfair labor practice proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Having considered the matter, we conclude that our policy of encouraging informal resolution of charges in unfair labor practice proceedings should extend to any phase of those proceedings where it is shown that the purposes and policies of the Statute will be effectuated by allowing such resolution. We emphasize, however, that the import of our established policy has been to encourage <span class="Italic">early</span> resolution of disputes. In reaching this decision, we have considered the established policy of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regarding such agreements. In the NLRB's view, the purpose of considering such settlements is to end labor disputes in a peaceful, nonlitigious manner and, insofar as is possible, to prevent a repetition of the practices that gave rise to those disputes. <span class="Italic">See Independent Stave Co., Inc.</span>, 287 NLRB 740, 741 (1987) (<span class="Italic">Independent</span> <span class="Italic">Stave);</span> and <span class="Italic">Wallace</span> <span class="Italic">Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 323 U.S. 248, 253-54 (1944). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Longshoremen ILA Local 1814 (Amstar Sugar</span>), 301 NLRB 764 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Amstar Sugar</span>). We agree with the NLRB that, "while there is a 'public interest in the vindication of statutory rights'[;] there is an 'equally important public interest in encouraging the parties' achievement of a mutually agreeable settlement without litigation.'" <span class="Italic">Amstar Sugar</span>, 301 NLRB at 764-65 (citations omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in this and future cases, when one or more of the parties requests that we give effect to a settlement agreement in lieu of further proceedings upon a complaint, the Authority will determine whether it will effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute to give effect to that settlement agreement. In making this determination, the Authority will examine all of the circumstances surrounding the case including, but not limited to: (1) whether the charging party, the respondent, and any of the individual discriminatees have agreed to be bound by the settlement, and the position of the General Counsel regarding the settlement; (2) whether the settlement is reasonable, in light of the nature of the violations alleged in the complaint, the risks inherent in continued litigation, and the stage of the litigation; (3) whether there has been any fraud, coercion, or duress by any of the parties in reaching the settlement; and (4) whether the respondent has a history of engaging in violations of the Statute, has breached previous settlement agreements resolving unfair labor practice disputes, or has failed or refused to honor previous orders of the Authority<span class="Italic">. See Independent Stave</span>, 287 NLRB at 743.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notwithstanding our decision to allow the private settlement of unfair labor practice charges at all stages of the unfair labor practice process, we will not automatically give effect to settlements reached by the parties and proposed to the Authority for approval. In addition to examining the factors set forth above, we will also consider our statutory mandate and not approve any settlement that conflicts with the Statute or the Authority's policies. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 741. We will consider the terms of the proposed settlement in each case in view of all of the circumstances and will carefully consider any objections filed by the General Counsel.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that the Authority is not a party to a private settlement.&#x2003;The parties to a private settlement must recognize that each is voluntarily foregoing the possibility of prevailing in a proceeding before the Authority. On the other hand, if the Authority rejects a proposed settlement, even though that settlement would effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute, the parties would be compelled to take the very risks they have decided to avoid. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 743.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When the Authority finds an unfair labor practice and issues an order, the Authority may seek court enforcement of its order. When the Authority is a party to a settlement, a finding of an unfair labor practice cannot be based on presettlement conduct unless there has been a failure to comply with the settlement agreement or subsequent unfair labor practices have been committed. <span class="Italic">See Quinn Co.</span>, 273 NLRB 795, 799 (1984); and <span class="Italic">Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel</span>, 235 NLRB 1397 (1978). On the other hand, when the Authority allows a private settlement agreement to which it is not a party, the Authority cannot seek court enforcement of that settlement. The fact that the Authority allows such a settlement does not preclude either the General Counsel from issuing a complaint based on subsequent charges alleging the same conduct or the Authority from finding a violation concerning such charges<span class="Italic">. See Aratex Services</span>, 300 NLRB 115, 117 (1989); and <span class="Italic">Quinn Co</span>. Such charges must be timely filed under section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute. Further, an alleged violation of the Statute by a failure to comply with a private settlement agreement must be viewed independently of earlier allegations that are time-barred by section 7118(a)(4) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have examined all of the circumstances surrounding this case within the framework set forth above and have decided to give effect to the settlement agreement.&#x2003;The Respondent and the Charging Party have agreed to be bound by the terms of their January 28, 1993 memorandum of understanding, and we have given consideration to the position of the General Counsel and the Southern and Mid-Atlantic Councils on this matter. We find that the settlement is reasonable, in light of the nature of the violations alleged in the complaint, the risks inherent in continued litigation, and the stage of the litigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleged that the Respondent unlawfully refused to implement an RBO agreement reached by the Respondent and the Charging Party.&#x2003;The agreement of January 28, 1993, is a mutual plan for labor-management cooperation in the administration of matters affecting employees, conditions of employment. The Respondent and the Charging Party state their view that the agreement effectively resolves the issues presented by the complaint and ruled on by the Judge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_1597"></span>The Southern and Mid-Atlantic Councils have expressed concern that the Respondent will not honor the agreement with AFGE. However, we find no basis in the record to conclude at this time that the Respondent will not honor the agreement with AFGE. Additionally, we note that AFGE, as a party to the agreement, was acting as the Joint Council's representative of record and has accepted the Respondent's pledge to abide by the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have also considered the General Counsel's view that a notice to employees is needed as an appropriate remedy, particularly because of the alleged outside influence that motivated the Respondent's actions and because the Judge found that those actions constituted an unfair labor practice. We note that the parties to a private settlement may provide for some form of notice to employees, but the parties in this case have not done so. We find, however, that lack of a notice alone does not generally constitute a sufficient reason to reject a proposed private settlement. <span class="Italic">See Independent Stave</span>, 287 NLRB at 742. Rather, the effects of the settlement on the rights of employees must be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have considered the rights of the employees in light of the circumstances of this case, including the nature of the Respondent's actions. As noted above, several training sessions have been conducted to acquaint the Charging Party's local presidents with the goals and objectives of the mutual plan that forms the basis of the settlement. Thus, it appears that the local presidents are prepared to administer the terms of the mutual plan and will inform bargaining unit employees of the terms of the settlement. For this reason, we find that administration of the parties' plan will itself serve the same purposes as a specific notice to employees. Accordingly, we find that no separate notice to employees is necessary in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, no one alleges, and there is no evidence of, fraud, coercion, or duress by the Respondent or the Charging Party in reaching their agreement. Further, no one alleges, and there is no evidence, that the Respondent has a history of violation of the Statute, or has breached previous settlement agreements resolving unfair labor practice disputes, or has failed or refused to honor previous orders of the Authority.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This proposed settlement has reached us at a late stage in the decisional process, following a Judge's decision and recommendation that a violation of the Statute be found. Although the public interest and the parties would have been better served by an earlier settlement, that fact, by itself, does not present a sufficient basis for us to refuse to accept the parties' settlement. <span class="Italic">See Amstar Sugar</span> (the NLRB's approval of a private settlement followed a Judge's decision and recommendation that a violation of the National Labor Relations Act be found and the NLRB's General Counsel opposed the settlement). Nonetheless, we again emphasize the importance of <span class="Italic">early</span> resolution of charges in unfair labor practice proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have examined all of the circumstances of this case and have found that: (1) the Respondent and the Charging Party have agreed to be bound by their proposed settlement; (2) the settlement is reasonable in light of the nature of the violations alleged in the complaint; and (3) there is no evidence of fraud, coercion, or duress in reaching the settlement. We find that, despite the lateness of the proposed settlement, these circumstances militate in favor of accepting the proposed settlement. <span class="Italic">See Amstar Sugar</span>, 301 NLRB at 765. Accordingly, we find that allowing the Charging Party to withdraw its charge in light of the agreement between the Respondent and the Charging Party will best serve the public interest in this case and will best effectuate the purposes and policies of the Statute. Therefore, we will give effect to that agreement and will permit the Respondent and the Charging Party to withdraw, respectively, the exceptions and the charge.</p>

<p class="noindent">If a settlement is reduced to a memorandum of understanding, the settlement will be construed under principles of contract law. In <span class="Italic">Bureau of Indian Affairs, Phoenix and NFFE</span>, 32 FLRA 903, 909 (1988), the issue was whether a MOU waived the union's right to obtain the names and home addresses of unit employees from the employer. FLRA announced that the principles to determine whether the ULP settlement agreement constitutes a waiver also apply when a waiver is contained in a contract provision.
