<h6 class="h6" id="sec8-24"><span class="space">v.</span> Examples of "Covered By" Decisions</h6>
<p class="noindent">Proposal 6 was nonnegotiable under the "covered by" doctrine in <span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 66 FLRA 213, 218 (2011):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 6 would require the Agency to notify the Union prior to taking an action against an employee for an egregious OE or OD identified by data obtained from a random audit or a radar replay.&#x2003;Article 64 addresses in great detail the role of Union representatives during OE and OD investigations and specifically provides, in Section 4: "In the event of any operational error/deviation, the Principal Union Representative...shall be notified promptly." In this regard, the Union concedes that Article 64 addresses "in great detail the representative role of facility representatives during OE or OD investigations." Because Article 64 addresses in great detail the role of Union representatives during OE or OD investigations and expressly obligates the Agency to notify the Union in the event of an OE or OD, a reasonable reader would conclude that Article 64 settles the matter of notification to the Union concerning OEs and ODs. Accordingly, we find that the subject matter of Proposal 6 is "expressly contained in," and thus is "covered by," Article 64. <span class="Italic">See NATCA, AFL-CIO</span>, 62 FLRA at 177.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we find that Proposal 6 is covered by the CBA and that the Agency is therefore not obligated to bargain over the proposal. Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review as to Proposal 6.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Fairton and AFGE Local 3975</span>, 62 FLRA 187 (2007) (impact negotiations were not required as to changes in work assignments of correctional personnel when contract contained clause permitting work assignments on same shift to be changed without notice; new work assignment policy was covered by agreement). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman and AFGE Local 506</span>, 69 FLRA 447 (2016) (Member Pizzella dissenting) (master and local agreement provisions concerning rotation of correctional officers within institution did not preclude, under "covered by" doctrine, negotiations over inter-institutional sick and annual relief rosters; at time of negotiation of master agreement, existence of multi-institutional facilities was rare and parties did not contemplate bargaining over those situations; local agreement covered only sick and annual relief at given institution), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCC Coleman v. FLRA</span>, 875 F.3d 667, 669-71, 673-77 (D.C. Cir. 2017) [discussed earlier in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-16-016.html#sec8-17">Midterm Bargaining Obligation and the 'Covered By' Doctrine: <span class="Italic">SSA</span></a>"]; <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 56 FLRA 798, 804-05 (2000) (applying and rejecting "covered by" doctrine to variety of proposals involving training, grade and pay retention, and seniority).</p>
<p class="noindent">When the agency head rejected contract language concerning a procedure affecting the process for filling vacancies, it could not be said that the matter was covered by the existing contract or inseparably bound up with other, arguably related provisions of the contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Navy, Naval Aviation Depot Jacksonville and IFPTE Local 22</span>, 63 FLRA 365, 369 (2009). In <span class="Italic">United Am. Nurses and VA Healthcare Network 5</span>, 64 FLRA 879, 882-83 (2010), at issue was the negotiability of a proposal that the union president have access to scheduling records of unit personnel. The technology allowing that access was new, and FLRA suggested that because it was new it could not be embraced by the "covered by" doctrine since it could not have been contemplated by the parties who drafted a contract that predated the technology:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our conclusion regarding the proposal's negotiability under the parties' national agreement is reinforced by facts concerning the parties' bargaining history. At the time the parties negotiated their national agreement, including Article 39, VAS was a technological development that neither party foresaw. Therefore, access to information on VAS was not an issue that the parties could have anticipated in concluding their national agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">SSA</span>, <span class="Italic">SSA Tucson Dist. Office and AFGE Council 147</span>, 47 FLRA 1067, 1071 (1993), an early decision applying <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Office Locals, Council 220</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), made short work of a midterm bargaining request:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying the <span class="Italic">SSA</span> test here, we find that the Union's mid-term proposals are clearly covered by the parties' master agreement. As previously noted, the proposals establish certain work breaks for service representatives. However, also as previously set forth, Article 10 of the parties' agreement specifically addresses and establishes work breaks for all unit employees, including service representatives. In addition, Article 38 of the agreement demonstrates that, during bargaining for the master agreement, the parties addressed and established additional work breaks for employees in particular work situations. Thus, the parties have bargained over the subject of work breaks for unit employees. There is no contention, in this regard, that the specific work breaks proposed by the Union respond to work situations which arose subsequent to bargaining over the master agreement or otherwise could not reasonably have been contemplated during such bargaining. Therefore, we conclude that the proposals are covered by the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The same analysis was applied to a case involving a ULP charge against an agency that unilaterally modified employment conditions by prohibiting the playing of radios on the job.&#x2003;The contract permitted the use of radios if that use did not disturb the productivity or safety of employees or others. The Authority determined that neither productivity nor safety had been compromised. There being no contractual basis for the employer's ban, the employer's action constituted an unprivileged unilateral change in working conditions. The employer's argument that the "agreement arguably privileged its action and that under Authority precedent, matters of contract interpretation should be resolved through the grievance/arbitration process," was rejected. <span class="Italic">Defense Distrib., Region W. and AFGE Local 1546</span>, 47 FLRA 1131, 1134 (1993). In quick succession followed the dismissal of a ULP complaint in <span class="Italic">Sacramento Air Logistics Ctr., McClellan AFB and AFGE Local 1857</span>, 47 FLRA 1161, 1165 (1993) (the contract language established a means for dealing with employees who did not elect to take leave during base closure; finding no statutory violation when the agency unilaterally changed the hours for base closure), and <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, 375th Combat Support Group, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 49 FLRA 1444, 1453 (1994) (a clause in the contract allowing reassignments to avoid a RIF foreclosed the need for further notice and bargaining concerning the reassignment of two employees as a result of changes in work methods and needs), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 50 FLRA 84 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">USDA, Forest Serv., Pac. NW Region and NFFE Forest Serv. Council, Region 6</span>, 48 FLRA 857, 858-61 (1993), determined that a negotiated provision concerning details of employees negated the agency's obligation to bargain over the impact of a substantial number of details for workload-related reasons:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The National Federation of Federal Employees, Forest Service Council (NFFE) is the exclusive representative of a nationwide consolidated bargaining unit of employees of the USDA Forest Service, including employees of the Respondent. The Charging Party is an agent of NFFE for representing the Respondent's unit employees.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 21, 1992, the Respondent notified the Union of its intention to implement voluntary and involuntary details of unit employees, under the provisions of Article 16.9 of the parties' Master Labor Agreement (MLA), to four National Forests in Eastern Oregon for workload-related reasons.[2]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;Article 16.9 of the MLA provides as follows, in pertinent part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">9.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Details:</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;A detail is the temporary assignment of an employee to a different position or to a different set of duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Detailers [sic] may be used to meet emergencies or situations occasioned by abnormal workload, changes in mission or organization, training, absences of personnel....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;For details within the Forest Service, the following mechanism will apply:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1248"></span>(1)&#x2003;Employees detailed to a higher graded position will be temporarily promoted....</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;When...there are two or more equally qualified employees, Management will rotate assignments unless cost or other legitimate job-related reasons require otherwise.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;The Rating Supervisor of the detail will give the employee a rating of record upon completion of the detail....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union requested to bargain over the implementation of the involuntary details and submitted proposals to the Respondent.&#x2003;The Respondent refused to bargain with the Union and began detailing unit employees. Ultimately, the Respondent detailed approximately 293 employees, from 1 week to 4 months.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties stipulated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">The [Respondent] has previously ordered/directed employees to report for a detail as a known past practice only where the employee was under investigation for misconduct and/or was disruptive in the workplace.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain over Union proposals related to the disputed details because, as discussed below, the proposals concerned matters that were contained in or covered by the parties' agreement. In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), we set forth a framework for determining whether proposals are covered by a provision in an existing agreement. We stated, as relevant here, that in determining whether a contract provision covers a matter in dispute, we will first look to whether the express language of the provision reasonably encompasses the subject matter. In this examination, we will not require "an exact congruence of language, but will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1018 (citation omitted). If the agreement provision does not expressly encompass the subject matter proposed for negotiations, we will then determine whether the subject matter is so commonly considered an aspect of the matter set forth in the agreement that the subject is "inseparably bound up with and...plainly an aspect of...a subject expressly covered by the contract." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). If so, we will conclude that the subject matter is covered by the agreement provision. In making these determinations, we will, "where possible or pertinent, examine all record evidence." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1019.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying <span class="Italic">SSA</span> here, we find that the Union's bargaining request involves matters which are covered by Article 16.9 of the parties' MLA, which addresses and establishes procedures for implementing, and appropriate arrangements for employees affected by, details. Among other things, the provision, which does not distinguish between voluntary and involuntary details, defines when details may be implemented, when an employee may be excused from a detail, what effect a detail will have on an employee's salary, and how a detailed employee's performance will be appraised. Based on the record, we find that the Respondent's involuntary details of unit employees is an aspect of, and is inseparably bound up with, the provisions of Article 16.9 of the MLA such that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain with the Union over the matter....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the record fails to establish the existence of a binding past practice modifying the terms of Article 16.9. To find the existence of such a past practice, there must be a showing that the practice was consistently exercised for an extended period of time, with the agency's knowledge and express or implied consent. <span class="Italic">For example</span>, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, Louisville District, Louisville, Kentucky</span>, 42 FLRA 137 (1991). As noted above, the parties stipulated that the Respondent has involuntarily detailed employees "only where the employee was under investigation for misconduct and/or was disruptive in the workplace." We conclude that this stipulation does not establish that, even if the Respondent used involuntary details only in certain situations, that fact leads to a conclusion that Article 16.9 does not apply to other involuntary details. Instead, we find it equally plausible that, as the Respondent argues, Article 16.9 was used only in connection with certain involuntary details because those were the only kind of involuntary details needed during the relevant period. We note, as discussed previously, that the wording of Article 16.9 is broad and, by its plain terms, applies to all details.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain with the Union over the involuntary details of unit employees because that subject is covered by the parties' MLA. As the Respondent had no obligation to bargain, it did not violate the Statute by refusing to do so. Therefore, we will dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another example of FLRA's application of <span class="Italic">SSA</span> is <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Base, Camp Lejeune and AFGE Local 2065</span>, 48 FLRA 1062, 1063-66 (1993). The contract required disagreements concerning designated smoking areas to be resolved through the grievance procedure. The employer's unilateral designation of a smoking area did not require substantive or impact bargaining:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union is the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit of all nonappropriated fund employees employed by the Respondent.&#x2003;The Respondent and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that was in effect at all times material to this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Prior to November 1, 1992, bargaining unit employees working in the Respondent's clothing sales warehouse, Building 1501, smoked tobacco throughout the entire warehouse with the knowledge of the Respondent. The Respondent ordered that, effective November 1, 1992, smoking in Building 1501 would cease and that the outdoor, covered loading dock of Building 1501 would be the designated smoking area for that building. The Respondent did not afford the Union notice or an opportunity to bargain over the substance or the impact and implementation of the Respondent's order.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The parties' agreement contains the following provision concerning smoking:</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">ARTICLE 28:&#x2003;HEALTH AND SAFETY</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">Section 10.&#x2003;Smoking</span></p>
<p class="noindent-2">a.&#x2003;A reasonably smoke-free working environment will be provided to those employees who do not wish to smoke while on the job.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">b.&#x2003;Smoking will not be permitted in common work areas shared by smokers and nonsmokers unless such areas are adequately ventilated, i.e., sufficiently ventilated as to provide a healthy work environment.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">c.&#x2003;The employer will give careful consideration to the smoking preferences of affected employees when establishing and/or modifying common work areas so as to accommodate, to the extent practicable, the preferences of both smokers and nonsmokers.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">d.&#x2003;Designated smoking areas will be identified by clearly displayed signs.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">e.&#x2003;Employees shall be allowed to smoke outdoors except in compliance with existing regulations.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">f.&#x2003;Conflicts over designated smoking areas and/or other issues which arise over smoking will be handled in accordance with the Negotiated Grievance Procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Maryland</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), we set forth a framework for determining when a matter is contained in or covered by a collective bargaining agreement so as to relieve an agency of the obligation to bargain over the matter. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">USDA Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Region, Portland, Oregon</span>, 48 FLRA 857 (1993); and <span class="Italic">Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan AFB, California</span>, 47 FLRA 1242, 1244-45 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, 47 FLRA at 1018-19, we held that to determine whether an agreement provision covers a matter in dispute, we will initially determine whether the matter is expressly contained in the collective bargaining agreement. We also noted that we will not require an exact congruence of language, but will find the requisite similarity if a reasonable reader would conclude that the provision settles the matter in dispute. If the collective bargaining agreement does not expressly encompass the matter, we will next determine whether the subject matter is so commonly considered to be an aspect of the matter set forth in the agreement that the subject is inseparably bound up with and plainly an aspect of a subject expressly covered by the contract. If so, we will conclude that the subject matter is covered by the agreement provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The dispute in this case involves smoking and the designation of smoking areas.&#x2003;The express language of the parties' agreement addresses smoking and the designation of smoking areas. Article 28, Section 10 of the agreement is entitled "Smoking." As set forth above, this section discusses smoking in the workplace, provides that the Respondent will give careful consideration to the smoking preferences of affected employees when establishing and/or modifying common work areas designated as smoking areas, and states that conflicts over designated smoking areas and/or other issues which arise over smoking will be handled in accordance with the parties' negotiated grievance procedure. No argument is made or apparent that Article 28, Section 10 does not apply in this case. The parties have bargained and reached agreement on the subject of smoking, including the designation of smoking areas. Therefore, we find that the matters at issue in this case are covered by the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, consistent with our decision in <span class="Italic">SSA</span>, we conclude that the Respondent was not obligated to bargain with the Union over the substance or the impact and implementation of its decision no longer to allow smoking in Building 1501 and to designate the outside loading dock of Building 1501 as the smoking area for the building, and did not violate the Statute by refusing to do so. We will dismiss the complaint.</p>
<p class="noindent">A contract provision for payment of travel expense reimbursements to follow <span id="Page_1249"></span>the Federal Travel Regulations did not preclude a ULP charging that the agency unilaterally altered the payment rate.

<p class="noindent">Before <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Nat'l Council of SSA Field Office Locals, Council 220</span>, 47 FLRA 1004 (1993) (<span class="Italic">SSA</span>), a negotiated agreement provision concerns a working condition did not demonstrate a waiver as to the right to bargain over impact and implementation of changes in that working condition. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, BATF and NTEU Chap. 88</span>, 16 FLRA 506, 522 (1984) (ALJ Decision) ("Article 10 merely defines details and describes the circumstances in which they may be utilized; it does not describe how such details are to be implemented (e.g. how employees are to be selected; how long details are to last, etc.) or how the adverse impact of such details on employees is to be minimized (e.g. the effect on employee career development of performing clerical and below grade tasks, etc). The implementation of the details and their impact on employees are matters about which NTEU is entitled to bargain unless NTEU has clearly and intentionally waived such rights."). That a collective bargaining agreement did not refer specifically to the practice of using the equipment at issue did not alone constitute a waiver of rights to continue an established past practice regarding the use of that equipment. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Cleveland and NTEU, Chap. 44</span>, 3 FLRA 656, 667 n.16 (1980) (ALJ Decision). A contract provision concerning official time did not waive the union's entitlement to, or right to negotiate over, official time needed due to management's proposed changes in working conditions. A waiver of the official time by the contract would only be construed if there was a specific preclusion of official time use for that purpose. <span class="Italic">Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hosp. and AFGE Local 3399</span>, 17 FLRA 408, 411 (1985). No waiver was recognized in a clause requiring the employer to notify the union and bargain over changes in employment conditions when the union sought a contract right to overtime pay. The existing clause of the contract was silent as to union-initiated proposals, and the clause did not state that it provided the exclusive conditions allowing or requiring midterm bargaining. <span class="Italic">DODDS, Mediterranean Region and Overseas Fed'n of Teachers</span>, 38 FLRA 755, 758 (1990).
