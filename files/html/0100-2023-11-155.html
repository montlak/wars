<h5 class="h5" id="sec4-156"><span class="space">b.</span> Compelled Testimony; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Kalkines</span></span> Warning</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Appeals presenting constitutional issues as to the admission of evidence generally arise when a party <span class="Italic">seek</span>s to exclude evidence secured during a search or interrogation allegedly conducted in violation of constitutional safeguards. The key to exclusion of statements on constitutional grounds may turn on an understanding of whether an employee may properly refuse to answer questions posed during an agency investigation if the charges under investigation could be criminally prosecuted. The Board and Federal Circuit case law is not altogether clear. A separate concern involves custodial interrogations, uncommon in federal personnel cases. A custodial interrogation may lead to a claim that evidence obtained during the interrogation is inadmissible unless the employee is advised of the right to counsel, i.e., given <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings. A noncustodial interrogation does not require <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Beckwith v. United States</span>, 425 U.S. 341 (1976) (IRS criminal tax investigation); <span class="Italic">Stickler v. DOD</span>, 264 Fed. Appx. 886, 888 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP) ("<span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warnings are necessary only in custodial interrogations").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Constitution prohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under the threat of removal from public office. <span class="Italic">See Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493 (1967), post. Conversely, answers of public officials may be compelled if there is immunity from federal and state use of compelled testimony or fruits of that testimony in proceedings against the person testifying. <span class="Italic">See Lefkowitz v. Turley</span>, 414 U.S. 70, 84 (1973) ("Although due regard for the Fifth Amendment forbids the State to compel incriminating answers from its employees and contractors that may be used against them in criminal proceedings, the Constitution permits that very testimony to be compelled if neither it nor its fruits are available for such use."); <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation</span>, 392 U.S. 280, 284 (1968) ("They were entitled to remain silent because it was clear that New York was seeking not merely an accounting of their use or abuse of their public trust, but testimony from their own lips which, despite the constitutional prohibition, could be used to prosecute them criminally."); <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick</span>, 392 U.S. 273, 278 (1968) ("If appellant, a policeman, had refused to answer questions specifically, directly, and narrowly relating to the performance of his official duties, without being required to waive his immunity with respect to the use of his answers or the fruits thereof in a criminal prosecution of himself, <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey, supra</span>, the privilege against self-incrimination would not have been a bar to his dismissal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Constitutional considerations do not come into play unless the testimony of the employee is compelled, i.e., the agency states that the employee must answer questions on the pain of disciplinary action if he refuses. If the employee is summoned to appear at a voluntary interview or if the employee volunteers facts, there is no compulsion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Terry v. United States</span>, 499 F.2d 695 (Ct. Cl. 1974).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board addressed the Fifth Amendment right against compelled testimony in <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 15 MSPR 72, 82 (1983), concerning Justice Department guidance. The Board's opinion did not make clear the underlying circumstances of the interviews conducted during the air traffic controllers' strike against the government. A challenge was raised, however, as to the application of an advisory memorandum from the Attorney General to the heads of agencies. The memo states in part, as quoted in <span class="Italic">Adams</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Most administrative misconduct hearings involve situations where, under agency regulations, an employee is merely provided an opportunity to respond to questions concerning job-related misconduct. However, on occasion the cooperation of an employee...is deemed essential enough that the employee should be required to answer questions concerning his job-related misconduct or face dismissal for not cooperating. In this latter situation, any statement which the employee provides concerning job-related misconduct would be considered "compelled" for Fifth Amendment purposes.... However, where an employee is merely afforded an opportunity to respond to a charge of misconduct, any statements made by him would not be "compelled" for Fifth Amendment purposes....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board determined that in responding to the charges against them, the employees were free to deny the charged activity and did not to do so. They were not compelled to answer within the meaning of the Attorney General's memorandum. Any admission made by the appellants without the benefit of advice concerning their constitutional right to remain silent would be excluded as evidence in any subsequent criminal proceeding. The Board considered the Attorney General's memo advisory and inapplicable to the administrative cases. Apparently, the immunity that would have followed improper questioning was sufficient, in the Board's estimation, to permit use of evidence (or silence) developed during the questioning.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The law is not clear as to whether immunity must be specifically granted when a Fifth Amendment challenge to a particular question is raised by an individual, whether immunity results as a matter of law without a specific guarantee of immunity or without a specific Fifth Amendment challenge, or whether a constitutional privacy interest might shield an individual against compelled disclosures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NFFE v. Greenberg</span>, 983 F.2d 286 (D.C. Cir. 1993).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If immunity is granted (and the most desirable, but not the only, form of the grant is through a letter from the U.S. Attorney stating that prosecution is waived in favor of administrative disposition of charges), the employee must answer questions. The immunity does not mean the employee cannot be prosecuted: it means that the employee's testimony (or the logical investigative extensions or results of it) cannot be used against him. To obtain as much information as possible without the mandatory participation of the employee and to avoid the immunity that nonvoluntary testimony from the employee may confer, investigators will often interview all known witnesses before the appellant is interviewed.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">What if immunity is not explicitly granted? <span class="Italic">Kalkines v. United States</span>, 473 F.2d 1391, 1393 (Ct. Cl. 1973), suggests that without an explicit waiver and warning of the possibility of removal for failure to respond, the employee may not be removed for refusing to answer questions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peden v. United States</span>, 512 F.2d 1099, 1102 (Ct. Cl. 1975) ("According to our <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> decision, a regulation of this Treasury type can be used to coerce information from a criminal suspect only if he is given adequate assurance that his responses will not be used against him in a criminal proceeding."). <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> declared:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is now settled that the individual cannot be discharged simply because he invokes his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in refusing to respond. <span class="Italic">Gardner v. Broderick</span>, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 20 L. Ed.2d 1082 (1968); <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation</span>, 392 U.S. 280, 88 S. Ct. 1917, 20 L. Ed.2d 1089 (1968). Conversely, a later prosecution cannot constitutionally use statements (or their fruits) coerced from the employee in an earlier disciplinary investigation or proceeding by a threat of removal from office if he fails to answer the question. <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey,</span> 385 U.S. 493, 87 S. Ct. 616, 17 L. Ed.2d 562 (1967). But a governmental employer is not wholly barred from insisting that relevant information be given it; the public servant can be removed for not replying if he is adequately informed both that he is subject to discharge for not answering and that his replies (and their fruits) cannot be employed against him in a criminal case. <span class="Italic">See Gardner v. Broderick</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 392 U.S. at 278, 88 S. Ct. 1913, 20 L. Ed.2d 1082; <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, considering interrogations that occurred in late 1967 and in 1968, determined that <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> was unclear in its scope at the time of the investigation, 473 F.2d at 1396:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Government suggests that Mr. Kalkines, or at least his lawyer, should have known that his answers (and their fruits) could not be used to his disadvantage, and therefore that the explicit caution mandated by <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men II</span> might be omitted. With respect to the plaintiff, <span id="Page_1596"></span>a frightened layman, this is certainly an unacceptable position; he could not be expected to know what lawyers and judges were even then arguing about. The case is hardly better for insisting that the attorney should have known, and should have been responsible, for alerting his client. <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 385 U.S. 493, was not decided until January 16, 1967, and its reach was uncertain for some years. <span class="Italic">Gardner</span> and <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men I</span> did not come down until June 10, 1968--after the last failure-to-respond charged against this plaintiff. <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation</span> <span class="Italic">Men II</span> was not decided until April 3, 1970 (the Supreme Court did not decline review until May 30, 1972). Many knowledgeable people believed that a specific immunity statute was necessary before anybody in the Federal Government could assure criminal immunity to individuals, including employees, being questioned in noncriminal proceedings. Perhaps, we may add, the law on the point is not yet wholly firm. At any rate, even the legendary Mr. Tutt, fictional legal genius of a generation or two ago, would have been hard put to know with any certainty, in the fall of 1967 and the spring of 1968, that this employee would be protected against prosecutorial use of his statements made to the customs agents.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Referenced in <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 494-99 (1967), involved an investigation of several police officers suspected of fixing traffic tickets. The Court described what happened and how a state could not use evidence in a criminal proceeding that was gained through a threat against the jobs of the police officers if they did not cooperate in the investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before being questioned, each appellant was warned (1) that anything he said might be used against him in any state criminal proceeding; (2) that he had the privilege to refuse to answer if the disclosure would tend to incriminate him; but (3) that if he refused to answer he would be subject to removal from office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants answered the questions. No immunity was granted, as there is no immunity statute applicable in these circumstances. Over their objections, some of the answers given were used in subsequent prosecutions for conspiracy to obstruct the administration of the traffic laws. Appellants were convicted and their convictions were sustained over their protests that their statements were coerced, by reason of the fact that, if they refused to answer, they could lose their positions with the police department....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The choice imposed on petitioners was one between self-incrimination or job forfeiture. Coercion that vitiates a confession under <span class="Italic">Chambers v. Florida</span>, 309 U. S. 227, and related cases can be "mental as well as physical"; "the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition." <span class="Italic">Blackburn v. Alabama</span>, 361 U. S. 199, 206. Subtle pressures (<span class="Italic">Leyra v. Denno</span>, 347 U. S. 556; <span class="Italic">Haynes v. Washington</span>, 373 U. S. 503) may be as telling as coarse and vulgar ones. The question is whether the accused was deprived of his "free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer." <span class="Italic">Lisenba v. California</span>, 314 U. S. 219, 241.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We adhere to <span class="Italic">Boyd v. United States</span>, 116 U. S. 616, a civil forfeiture action against property. A statute offered the owner an election between producing a document or forfeiture of the goods at issue in the proceeding. This was held to be a form of compulsion in violation of both the Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 634-635. It is that principle that we adhere to and apply in <span class="Italic">Spevack v. Klein</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, p. 511.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The choice given petitioners was either to forfeit their jobs or to incriminate themselves. The option to lose their means of livelihood or to pay the penalty of self-incrimination is the antithesis of free choice to speak out or to remain silent. That practice, like interrogation practices we reviewed in <span class="Italic">Miranda v. Arizona</span>, 384 U. S. 436, 464-465, is "likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from making a free and rational choice." We think the statements were infected by the coercion[5] inherent in this scheme of questioning and cannot be sustained as voluntary under our prior decisions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We held in <span class="Italic">Slochower v. Board of Education</span>, 350 U. S. 551, that a public school teacher could not be discharged merely because he had invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination when questioned by a congressional committee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury.... The privilege serves to protect the innocent who otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances." <span class="Italic">Id</span>., at 557-558.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that policemen, like teachers and lawyers, are not relegated to a watered-down version of constitutional rights.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are rights of constitutional stature whose exercise a State may not condition by the exaction of a price.... We now hold the protection of the individual under the Fourteenth Amendment against coerced statements prohibits use in subsequent criminal proceedings of statements obtained under threat of removal from office, and that it extends to all, whether they are policemen or other members of our body politic.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Garrity,</span> if immunity is not granted when an employee is compelled to testify, the immunity arises as a matter of law. The inference that could be drawn from all these cases is that, in theory, the public employee may be required, on the pain of dismissal, to respond to questions if he is not explicitly told he is immunized, as long as the result is that his testimony is then immunized by law from use in criminal proceedings. The lack of an explicit statement of this result in Supreme Court decisions is the reason for the resultant confusion in lower-level judicial and administrative decisions. It was originally the law that if an employee was involved in conduct with criminal as well as adverse action consequences, the employee was entitled to a warning before agency officials took his statement. The warning had to clearly advise him of his constitutional rights and warn that questions that must be answered might lead to disciplinary action. The Board referred agencies to the warning contained in <span class="Italic">Uniformed Sanitation Men Ass'n v. Commissioner of Sanitation</span>, 426 F.2d 619, 621 n.4 (2d Cir. 1970), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">denied</span>, 406 U.S. 961 (1972) ("I further advise you that the answers you may give to the questions propounded to you at this proceeding, or any information or evidence which is gained by reason of your answers, may not be used against you in a criminal proceeding except that you may be subject to criminal prosecution for any false answer that you may give under any applicable law [citing state statute]."). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Laursen v. VA</span>, 4 MSPR 66, 68, 4 MSPB 155 (1980). If a proper warning was not given, the production of the employee's statement would not support the adverse action under <span class="Italic">Laursen</span> if an objection was interposed. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Masino v. United States</span>, 589 F.2d 1048 (Ct. Cl. 1978) ("In <span class="Italic">Kalkines,</span> we held that an employee may be compelled to answer questions or be subject to dismissal, if the threat of future criminal prosecution is effectively negated.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board offered a summary of <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span> and <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> in <span class="Italic">Carey v. Dept. of State,</span> DC-0752-11-0195-I-1 (NP 11/17/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>, 385 U.S. at 497-500, the Court held that coerced statements obtained by a government employer during an investigation--statements made in response to threats of removal from employment pursuant to a New Jersey statute--cannot be used against an employee in a criminal proceeding. This appeal is not a criminal proceeding, nor is the agency <span class="Italic">seek</span>ing to introduce any allegedly coerced statements made by the appellant in the course of any investigation. In addition, the remedy at issue in <span class="Italic">Garrity</span>--the exclusion of the employee's statements from a criminal proceeding--is not at issue here. The court in <span class="Italic">Kalkines</span>, 473 F.2d at 1393-94, held that the government cannot discharge an employee on the basis of the employee's refusal to answer questions when the employee has not been informed that he would be granted immunity from criminal prosecution based on and as a result of the answers to such questions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board considered admissibility of self-incriminating statements in <span class="Italic">Ashford v. DOJ, Bureau of Prisons</span>, 6 MSPR 458, 467, 6 MSPB 389 (1981). [This decision is considered in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-155.html#sec8-154">Problems During Investigations; Lack of Cooperation; Interference; Self-Incrimination</a>."] The appellant was removed for sexual harassment and refusal to answer questions in the course of an agency investigation. The Board established several principles concerning evidence developed and rights of witnesses during those investigations: there is no right to be informed of charges during an administrative investigation; there is no right to refuse to answer questions during the investigation should the agency not inform the appellant of the charges. Under the Constitution, there is no right to counsel in an employer's investigation unless the investigation may lead to a criminal prosecution, and then only in the context of a custodial investigation. Since no right to counsel exists, there is no right to a <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> warning. The employee may, however, remain silent if he reasonably believes his statements may be used in a criminal proceeding. To then remove the employee for refusal to answer, the agency must first tell the employee that the refusal to answer may result in removal and, second, the agency should tell the employee that any statement he makes will not be used against him in a criminal proceeding. In the appellant's case, involving alleged sexual harassment, the Board saw no reasonable likelihood of a criminal case and it sustained the charge that the employee refused to cooperate by answering questions during the investigation. The Board noted that an employee may develop a reasonable apprehension of criminal proceedings in routine civil investigations even if criminal proceedings are not contemplated by the agency. The sexual harassment charge was dropped by the agency, and the Board viewed the investigative techniques of the Bureau of Prisons were a bit heavy-handed, making the refusal to cooperate rational, although not entirely excusable. The Board mitigated Ashford's penalty, reducing the removal to a 15-day suspension. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Scott v. United States</span>, 160 Ct. Cl. 152 (1963) (removal was set aside when it was based on the recanted admission of sexual misconduct; the admissions were obtained from a disabled employee through third-degree methods). [<span class="Italic">Refer to</span> <span class="Italic">Ashford</span> in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-155.html#sec8-154">Problems During Investigations; Lack of Cooperation; Interference; Self-Incrimination</a>" for analysis of protections that should be provided to the employee who is asked for information that may be incriminating].</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 14 MSPR 321, 323-24 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Weston v. DHUD</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 949 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (discussed in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-155.html#sec8-154">Problems During Investigations; Lack of Cooperation; Interference; Self-Incrimination</a>") suggests that the employee's refusal to answer questions is itself a basis for <span id="Page_1597"></span>adverse action when the employee reasonably believes the inquiry could lead to criminal charges, and the agency abates that concern by notifying the employee that his testimony will not be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Weston was an EEO specialist removed for refusing to cooperate in an agency investigation into her purchase and sale of DHUD-owned real estate, a violation of DHUD standards of conduct. Under the Board's <span class="Italic">Weston</span> decision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The privilege against self-incrimination may be asserted in an administrative investigation where the individual reasonably believes that his statements may be used against him in a criminal proceeding. <span class="Italic">Kastigar v. United States</span>, 406 U.S. 441, 444 (1972). In <span class="Italic">Garrity v. New Jersey</span>, 385 U.S. 493, 500 (1967), the court held that statements compelled under threat of removal from one's position are inadmissible in a criminal proceeding. However, once an individual has received immunity by operation of the <span class="Italic">Garrity</span> rule, he no longer has a right to remain silent and may be removed for failure to cooperate with an agency investigation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order to remove an employee for failure to answer potentially incriminating questions in an investigation, an agency must have advised the employee that: 1) his refusal to answer may result in removal, and 2) any statement he may make will not be used against him in a criminal proceeding....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded that the failure to cooperate warranted removal because the charges were serious: if they were proved, they could subject the appellant to civil and criminal penalties. Removal was also warranted because the appellant was notified of the charges against her, was represented by counsel, was allowed access to pertinent agency documents, and was advised of her immunity against criminal prosecution. Those factors, indicating to the Board fair treatment of the appellant, distinguished <span class="Italic">Ashford</span>, involving an employee not properly advised of his rights during an investigation deemed "heavy-handed." The Board concluded that given the serious nature of the failure to cooperate and the inability of the agency to secure other means of compliance through lesser penalties, Weston's removal was justified. To the extent that Weston relied on the erroneous advice of counsel, the Board stated that for legal error by counsel to mitigate an otherwise reasonable penalty would offer an employee who retained counsel an unnecessary advantage over one who did not.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is not clear on how and when an appellant is supposed to manifest a fear of criminal prosecution, <span class="Italic">Pope v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 63 MSPR 51, 53 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...An agency may not discipline an employee for refusing to answer questions about conduct that the employee reasonably believes could serve as the basis for criminal charges, unless the agency assures the employee that any answers given will not be used in a criminal prosecution, and warns the employee that a refusal to answer questions could lead to discipline. <span class="Italic">Weston v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 724 F.2d 943, 947-48 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Haine v. Department of the Navy,</span> 41 MSPR 462, 469 (1989).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues, as she did below, that she had the right not to provide information to agency investigators because she was never advised that any information she provided would not be used against her in a criminal prosecution, nor was she warned that she would be disciplined for not answering the questions posed to her. The administrative judge did not discuss the appellant's defense to charge (3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It appears that the appellant was suspected of having committed a "threat to assault," in violation of the California Penal Code. Still, the appellant has not identified any evidence in her petition for review, and our review of the record reveals no evidence, that would indicate that she actually feared criminal prosecution when she refused to cooperate with the investigation into her actions toward Kiel and Lee.</p>
