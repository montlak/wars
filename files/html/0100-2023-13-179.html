<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-175"><span class="space">3.</span> Constructive Action Against Judge: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Tunik</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Section 7521(b) of 5 USC describes what constitutes an "action" against an ALJ: removal, suspension, reduction in grade, reduction in pay, and furlough of 30 days or less. Specifically excluded as appealable actions are suspensions or removals under 5 USC 7532 (national security), RIFs, and actions resulting from cases brought by the Special Counsel. An ALJ may no more invoke Board jurisdiction over a matter not within its appellate jurisdiction than can a competitive service employee. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-08-312.html#sec1-305">Constructive Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through adjudication and then through regulatory revisions, the Board attempted to clarify, or curtail, its jurisdiction when ALJs assert that they have been constructively removed from the jobs because of actions taken against them by their employers that allegedly infringe upon their judicial independence. Until the date of the current regulation, June 14, 2006, the regulation governing Board jurisdiction over actions involving ALJs had been, at 5 CFR 1201.142 (2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative law judge who alleges that an agency has interfered with the judge's qualified decisional independence so as to constitute an unauthorized action under 5 U.S.C. 7521 may file a complaint with the Board under this subpart. The filing and service requirements of Sec. 1201.137 apply. Such complaints shall be adjudicated in the same manner as agency complaints under this subpart.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2006 the Board revised the regulation as a result of the litigation described below. The current regulation stating the Board's jurisdiction over actions involving ALJs, including actions against them by their employer and actions that the ALJs appeal as constructive adverse is 5 CFR 1201.142 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An administrative law judge who alleges a constructive removal or other action by an agency in violation of 5 U.S.C. 7521 may file a complaint with the Board under this subpart. The filing and service requirements of &#x00A7; 1201.137 of this part apply. Such complaints shall be adjudicated in the same manner as agency complaints under this subpart.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 2006 revision conditions an appeal by an ALJ under a constructive adverse action theory upon actual departure from an ALJ position, although it does not require complete separation from the civil service. The regulatory change resulted from a the Federal Circuit's <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> decision, <span class="Italic">post,</span> that required the Board to go through proper administrative procedures, rather than through revisions in its caselaw, to revise the pre-2006 regulation to restrict appeals from ALJs to actions that they alleged caused them to leave their ALJ jobs and to do so under conditions that were involuntary, i.e., constructively adverse. Under the 2006 regulation, the Board will not have jurisdiction over actions somehow impinging on judicial independence as long as the ALJ stays in his or her ALJ position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A rulemaking notice explained the intent of the what became the 2006 regulation [70 Fed. Reg. 48081 (Aug. 16, 2005)]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board added 5 CFR 1201.142 to its regulations governing actions against ALJs "to cover the situation in which a complaint is filed by an administrative law judge rather than an agency." 62 FR 48450 (Sept. 16, 1997). As promulgated, section 1201.142 provides that an ALJ "who alleges that an agency has interfered with the judge's qualified decisional independence so as to constitute an unauthorized action under 5 U.S.C. 7521 may file a complaint with the Board under this subpart." The regulation reflects the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 170 (1985), that an ALJ may be constructively removed for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 7521 by agency actions that interfere with the ALJ's qualified decisional independence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Social Security Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 482 (2003), the Board held that to establish a constructive removal on this basis the ALJ must also be separated from the position of ALJ. The Board based its decision on the ordinary meaning of "removal" and the need to read this term consistently with the interpretation given by the case law to the same term in 5 U.S.C. 7512. The <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> holding was followed by the Board in <span class="Italic">Dethloff v. Social Security Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 574 (2003), and <span class="Italic">Schloss v. Social Security Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 578 (2003). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the Board's <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> <span class="Italic">Dethloff,</span> and <span class="Italic">Schloss</span> decisions in a consolidated appeal, <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> Nos. 03-3286, -3330, -3331 (Fed. Cir. May 11, 2005). The court agreed with the Board's conclusion that the plain language of section 7521 reasonably can be read to apply only to cases of actual separation from employment as an ALJ. However, the court found that because 5 CFR 1201.142 was issued pursuant to the notice and comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, the Board lacked authority to overrule the regulation in an adjudication, outside the procedural requirements of section 553(b). The court reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded the case, finding that the regulation incorporating the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard applied to the petitioners whose claims were not moot. However, the court stated that its conclusion did not foreclose the Board from repealing the rule in accordance with section 553(b). Accordingly, the Board is proposing to revise section 1201.142 to delete the stated standard for establishing constructive removal of an ALJ and thereby to repeal the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> rule. The revised regulation will be retained solely to provide procedural guidance for an ALJ who wishes to file a complaint alleging constructive removal or other violation of section 7521. The standard for establishing a constructive removal claim is set forth in <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Social Security Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. at 493: the ALJ must establish "that his decision to leave the position of ALJ was involuntary under the test for involuntariness used for appeals implicating section 7512." Reference should be made to the Board's developing case law for further elaboration of this standard in connection with claims based on interference with an ALJ's qualified decisional independence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After receiving comments on the proposed regulatory change, the Board issued its regulation as a final rule with another notice concerning the intent of the rule [71 Fed. Reg. 34231-32 (June 14, 2006)]:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board added 5 CFR 1201.142 to its regulations governing actions under 5 U.S.C. 7521 to cover actions filed by an ALJ rather than an agency. As promulgated in 1997, the regulation codified the Board's holding in <span class="Italic">In re Doyle,</span> 29 M.S.P.R. 170 (1985), that a sitting ALJ may be constructively removed under 5 U.S.C. 7521 by agency actions that interfere with the ALJ's qualified decisional independence. In <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Social Security Administration,</span> 93 M.S.P.R. 482 (2003), the Board overruled <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> and held that to establish a constructive removal the ALJ must have left the position of ALJ and must show that the decision to leave was involuntary under the test for involuntariness used in appeals under 5 U.S.C. 7512. In a consolidated appeal reviewing <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> and cases following it, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit approved the Board's conclusion that the plain language of section 7521 can reasonably be read to apply only to cases of actual separation from employment as an ALJ. However, the court found that, because 5 CFR 1201.142 was issued pursuant to the notice-and-comment requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553, the Board lacked authority to overrule the regulation in an adjudication.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court stated that its conclusion did not foreclose the Board from repealing the rule in accordance with section 553(b). <span class="Italic">Tunik v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 407 F.3d 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board proposed this amendment to section 1201.142 and published it for comments at 70 FR 48081 (August 16, 2005). The time for comments was subsequently extended to November 25, 2005, at 70 FR 61750 (October 16, 2005). The Board has received comments from two associations, an agency and two individuals. After careful consideration of the comments received, the Board is adopting the rule as proposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Four of the commenters urged the Board to retain the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard permitting constructive removal actions by sitting ALJs as necessary to protect the their decisional independence and the due process rights of claimants before them. Two of the commenters argued more specifically that under the amended rule punitive actions could be taken against ALJs in order to intimidate them from taking actions or to get them to alter their decisions. The Board does not find this argument persuasive. Congress has protected the independence of ALJs by enacting the statutory requirement that there be an MSPB finding of good cause before a removal from the position of ALJ (or other specified adverse action) can be taken. Since the Board's case law precludes a finding of good cause under section 7521 for an action based on how an ALJ decides a case, this protection permits ALJs to resist the most serious agency pressures that could undermine their independence. The Board sees no justification for extending its jurisdiction to provide additional protection beyond what Congress has provided through the authority given to the Board in the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;One commenter suggested that the amended regulation is inconsistent with the definition of removal under section 7521 found in 5 CFR 930.202(f) because under that regulation of the Office of Personnel Management, the definition includes reassignment to a non-ALJ position. This suggestion is based on a mistake. The amended regulation requires involuntary separation from the position of ALJ, not separation from the civil service. Reassignment to a non-ALJ position is clearly covered by the new standard, which is therefore not inconsistent with the definition in Sec. 930.202(f).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;One commenter suggested that the amended rule is unnecessary because the Board's decisions applying the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard have not found a constructive removal in cases involving routine management actions. <span id="Page_2261"></span>This commenter suggested that the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard should be retained because it has deterred agency interference with ALJ independence. The commenter also suggested that under the new standard, sitting ALJs may, instead, challenge interference with their independence through actions based on the First Amendment in district court, with an adverse effect on judicial economy due to the loss of the Board's expertise in the decision of those cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds that the fact that its case law under the Doyle standard is largely made up of nonmeritorious cases is not a reason for retaining the old standard, nor does it show that the old standard has deterred improper agency actions. Moreover, in <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> the court approved the Board's determination that it was unlikely that in enacting section 7521 Congress intended to require agencies to obtain a good cause finding from the Board before taking such routine actions as assigning cases and implementing training requirements. <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> 407 F.3d at 1340. The Board finds that, to whatever extent the First Amendment rights of ALJs are actionable in district court, it has no bearing on the Board's interpretation of section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;One commenter suggested that the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard should be retained in order to permit sitting ALJs to claim constructive removal based on alleged violations of the case assignment rotation requirement in 5 U.S.C. 3105. The Board finds that this suggestion fails to state a persuasive objection to the amendment of its regulation since the revised standard would permit consideration of an ALJ's involuntary resignation claim that is based on the agency's improper interference with his decisionmaking by assigning cases out of rotation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5.&#x2003;One commenter supports the proposed amendment and urges the Board to provide upon issuance of the amended regulation that it will be applicable to pending cases. The Board finds that retroactive application of the amended regulation would be contrary to the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Tunik,</span> which held that the cases in that consolidated appeal were subject to the standard stated in the former regulation because it could not be repealed in an adjudication. Under <span class="Italic">Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital,</span> 488 U.S. 204 (1988), the Board must have express statutory authority to make a substantive rule retroactive, authority which the Board does not have. The amended regulation that the Board is issuing is such a rule because it repeals the substantive standard for constructive removal stated in the old regulation and makes effective the standard for such a removal now contained in the Board's case law.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Through 2003 it was the law that "[a]n ALJ who remains on the employment rolls may show that he has been constructively removed by proving that the agency has taken actions that impair the impartial exercise of his judicial functions and that have a pernicious effect on his judicial independence." <span class="Italic">White v. SSA</span>, 76 MSPR 447, 453 n.3 (1997).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In 2003, the Board decided in <span class="Italic">Tunik v. SSA</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/TUNIK_LLOYD_CB_7521_00_0020_T_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_248671.pdf">93 MSPR 482</a>, 484-93 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-32 (2003), <span class="Italic">reversed in part</span>, <span class="Italic">Tunik v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051733407f3d132611595">407 F.3d 1326</a> (Fed. Cir. 2005), <span class="Italic">post</span>, to depart from precedent and regulation and abandon jurisdiction over constructive removals of ALJs. An ALJ is not removed, the Board held, until he is taken out of his position as an ALJ. Impediments to performing the job, or even interference with judicial independence, do not create Board jurisdiction:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his initial filing, the appellant identified four instances of alleged interference with his qualified judicial independence: 1) an April 3, 2000 memorandum from the agency's Regional Chief Administrative Law Judge Mary Bisantz (CALJ Bisantz) to Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge Mary Reed (CALJ Reed) regarding the appellant's processing of a case and a requirement that he receive training; 2) an April 3, 2000 memorandum from CALJ Bisantz to the appellant regarding processing of the same case; 3) efforts by CALJ Bisantz to prevent the issuance of a decision prepared by the appellant; and 4) a May 15, 2000 memorandum from CALJ Reed regarding the processing of another case. The appellant later added a fifth allegation of interference with his independence. That allegation concerned July 19 and August 1, 2000 e-mail messages from CALJ Reed regarding the processing of old cases on the appellant's docket.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's CALJ granted the appellant's motion for summary judgment regarding claims 1 through 4 and granted the agency's motion for summary judgment regarding claim 5. Both parties have petitioned for review....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On petition for review, the agency asks the Board to "closely scrutinize this matter" to make sure that we have jurisdiction over the actions being appealed. We agree with the agency that we should consider whether the Board has expanded its jurisdiction in ALJ cases beyond that given to us by statute. Our inquiry shows that the Board does not have jurisdiction over cases such as this one. Rather, a prerequisite for the Board's jurisdiction over a removal appeal brought under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 is that the appellant no longer occupies an ALJ position. Because the appellant here was in an ALJ position at all relevant times, the agency did not take a removal action under section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Five fundamental legal principles guide our analysis. The first is that the Board's jurisdiction is not plenary, but is limited to those matters over which it has been given jurisdiction by law, rule or regulation<span class="Italic">. Maddox v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 759 F.2d 9, 10 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The second rule is that, when determining whether a statute gives the Board jurisdiction over an appeal, we must begin with the language of the statute itself<span class="Italic">. Campion v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 326 F.3d 1210, 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2003), <span class="Italic">citing Hughes Aircraft Co. v. Jacobson</span>, 525 U.S. 432, 438 (1999). Thirdly, "it is a basic principle of statutory interpretation that undefined terms in a statute are deemed to have their ordinarily understood meaning." <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1349 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Fourth, it is a "'normal rule of statutory construction that identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.'" <span class="Italic">Department of Revenue of Oregon v. ACF Industries, Inc.</span>, 510 U.S. 332, 342, 114 S. Ct. 843, 849, 127 L. Ed. 2d 165 (1994) (citations omitted). Lastly, where the unambiguous language of a statute does not provide the Board with jurisdiction over an appeal, the Board can take jurisdiction only if there is a "clearly expressed congressional intent contrary to the text of the statute." <span class="Italic">Campion</span>, 326 F.3d at 1214. Application of these principles to the issue before us demonstrates that the statute does not give the Board jurisdiction over this appeal, and that there is no clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary. We begin our analysis with the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7521 of Title 5 of the United States Code provides that an agency may take an "action" against an ALJ "only for good cause established and determined by [the Board] on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(a). Thus, an agency may not take a covered "action" against an ALJ unless it first proves to the Board that there is good cause for taking the action. Subsection (b) of section 7521 lists the five actions which are within the Board's jurisdiction. They are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a suspension;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;a furlough of 30 days or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is instructive to compare those covered actions with the covered adverse actions listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7512 lists the actions which an "employee," as defined in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7511, can appeal to the Board. The actions are:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;a removal;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;a suspension for more than 14 days;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;a reduction in grade;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;a reduction in pay; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;a furlough of 30 days or less[.]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Except for the fact that a suspension in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512 is qualified by the phrase "for more than 14 days," Congress used the same language in section 7521 as in section 7512. In <span class="Italic">Butler v. Social Security Administration</span>, 331 F.3d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2003), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit discussed how sections 7521 and 7512 interrelate and how they must be construed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit began its analysis by noting the rule of statutory construction which says that where identical words are used in different parts of the same statute, as in sections 7512 and 7521 of Title 5, the words are normally given the same meaning<span class="Italic">. Id</span>., 331 F.3d at 1372. The court stated that this rule has "particular force where 'the words at issue are used in two different sections of a complex statutory scheme and those two sections serve the same purpose.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., <span class="Italic">quoting</span> <span class="Italic">National Organization of Veterans' Advocates, Inc. v. Secretary of Veterans Affairs</span>, 260 F.3d 1365, 1379 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Applying these principles, the court found that sections 7512 and 7521 serve the same purpose because they both define the Board's jurisdiction over appeals from adverse actions taken by agencies against employees<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Accordingly, the court held that "section 7521 <span class="Italic">must</span> be construed consistently with its sister provision, section 7512." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). Despite the identical language of sections 7512 and 7521 and the requirement that the terms in those two sections be construed the same, the Board has created a set of actions which can be "constructive removals" under section 7521, but which cannot be considered constructive removals under section 7512. This opinion puts an end to that inconsistency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board can have jurisdiction over a constructive removal under section 7512 only if an appellant was actually separated from his position, either by a retirement or a resignation which was allegedly involuntary<span class="Italic">. See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Gutierrez v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 604 &#x00B6; 7 (2002). The Board's theory of constructive removal under section 7521, however, does not require a separation from the position of ALJ. Instead, as illustrated by the actions at issue here, an ALJ can establish a constructive removal under section 7521 when he remains in his position, but, for example, the agency reassigns some of his work, gives him directions on how <span id="Page_2262"></span>his duties should be carried out, seeks to send him to training, or does not give him cases that he thinks he should have gotten. These kinds of actions are not "removals," as that word is ordinarily understood or as it is interpreted for purposes of jurisdiction under section 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute does not define removal. Section 7521 refers simply to a "removal" action. The ordinary meaning of the word "removal," in the context of a personnel action, is to be separated from one's position of record or not to have a continuing appointment to that position<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Timinski v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 88 M.S.P.R. 559 &#x00B6; 9 (2001); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 501 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13 and 14 (2000). There is nothing in section 7521 indicating that Congress intended to give any other meaning to the word "removal." In fact, the statute at 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101A shows that Congress intended in section 7521 to give removal its common meaning of being discharged or separated from a position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7101A of Title 38 sets forth the procedures that must be taken when a member of the Board of Veterans' Appeals (BVA) is "removed." Subsection (e)(1) of section 7101A states that when the agency removes an ALJ who is a BVA member, the removal of the ALJ from his position on the BVA "shall be carried out subject to the <span class="Italic">same</span> requirements as apply to removal of an [ALJ] under [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521]." [Emphasis added.] Subsection (d) of 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101A states that "removal" from a position on the BVA means that the BVA member loses his <span class="Italic">appointment</span> on the BVA and, upon request, may be placed back in the attorney <span class="Italic">position</span> that he previously held. Thus, it is clear that when Congress borrowed the procedures for ALJs contained in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, it meant that such procedures apply when the Department of Veterans Affairs proposes to remove an ALJ from a <span class="Italic">position</span> on the BVA and return him to his attorney position. The language of Section 7101A does not contemplate anything remotely like a "constructive removal" where an ALJ holding a position on the BVA retains that position but claims that cases have been reassigned from him or that he has been instructed on how to process cases, which are two of the claims made by the appellant here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the above analysis, the word "removal" should be given its ordinary meaning and read as requiring that an ALJ actually be separated from his position before the Board can have jurisdiction over a removal appeal under section 7521. Absent a clear legislative intent showing that Congress meant something more when it used the word "removal" in section 7521, the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal because the appellant continued to occupy his position as an ALJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 170 (1985), the Board created a "theory" of constructive removal which provides jurisdiction in cases where an ALJ has not been separated from his ALJ position. In fashioning this theory, the Board relied on the legislative history of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) discussed in a 1973 Court of Claims opinion, <span class="Italic">Benton v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1017 (Ct. Cl. 1973). The court in <span class="Italic">Benton</span>, however, did not propose or advocate a theory of constructive removal which would establish section 7521 jurisdiction in cases where an ALJ has not been separated from his position. On the contrary, the <span class="Italic">Benton</span> court dealt with an alleged constructive removal under section 7521 which was the same as the kind of constructive removal which can be asserted under section 7512, namely, a claim that the employee was involuntarily separated from his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Benton</span>, the appellant's late husband, a federal hearing examiner, was put on disability retirement at the agency's request and over his objection<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. 488 F.2d at 1019. The issue was whether section 11 of the APA required a hearing before the agency took that action<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1018. The court examined the legislative history of the APA to determine whether Congress intended to exempt alleged involuntary retirements from the protections accorded hearing examiners (now ALJs) under the APA<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1022.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The legislative history on which the court relied showed a congressional intent that involuntary separations of ALJs were covered by the APA<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. There is nothing in the legislative history quoted by the <span class="Italic">Benton</span> court which indicates that Congress intended to extend the protections of the APA to the type of claims brought within the Board's jurisdiction by <span class="Italic">Doyle. See id</span>. at 1021-22. Quite the contrary. The legislative history cited in <span class="Italic">Benton</span> states that section 11 of the APA was intended to make hearing examiners "<span class="Italic">removable</span> only for good cause determined by the Civil Service Commission [CSC], after opportunity for a hearing," and that the CSC must "afford any examiner an opportunity for a hearing before acceding to an agency <span class="Italic">request for removal</span>." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). What Congress clearly was talking about, and what the <span class="Italic">Benton</span> court plainly was interested in, were the procedures that must be invoked before separating a hearing examiner from his position, as was done to Mr. Benton. The CSC regulation on which the court relied supports that reading of <span class="Italic">Benton</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The CSC regulation quoted by the court defined "removal" for purposes of section 11 of the APA as "an involuntary change in the status of an [ALJ], including <span class="Italic">discharge</span>, demotion, and suspension from the <span class="Italic">position</span> of [ALJ] and demotion, reassignment, and promotion, to a <span class="Italic">position</span> other than that of [ALJ]." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1022, <span class="Italic">quoting</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.202(f) (1973 ed.) (emphasis added). The court noted that these interpretative regulations had remained essentially the same since 1946 when the APA was passed<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1023. There is no indication that the CSC regulations changed any time before Congress enacted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 in 1978. Thus, when Congress enacted section 7521, it was presumptively aware that the CSC had interpreted the term "removal" as being limited to separation or reassignment from the <span class="Italic">position</span> of ALJ. The Board in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, however, went beyond the <span class="Italic">Benton</span> decision, the legislative history, and the CSC regulations to create a class of appealable "removal" actions which have nothing to do with being separated from the position of ALJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Butler</span> noted that even though the statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521 does not define "removal," Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations implementing section 7521 define that term. Slip op. at 7. As the court pointed out, OPM's regulations at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 930.202(f) state that a "removal" includes the "<span class="Italic">discharge</span> of an [ALJ] from the <span class="Italic">position</span> of [ALJ] or <span class="Italic">involuntary reassignment</span>, demotion, or promotion to a <span class="Italic">position</span> other than that of [ALJ]." <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 331 F.3d at 1373 (emphasis added). The regulations could not be plainer--an ALJ is removed only when he is separated from or involuntarily reassigned from the position of ALJ. The Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> runs contrary to those regulations. If we continue to adhere to the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of constructive removal, we would effectively be invalidating the OPM regulations which implement section 7521. This is yet another reason not to follow <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. Further, the rationale set forth in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> for expanding the word "removal" to encompass actions which do not result in a separation from an ALJ position is arguably dicta.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After discussing <span class="Italic">Benton</span> and the new theory of constructive removal, the Board found that "Judge Doyle's complaint is a frivolous attempt to invoke the Board's jurisdiction over actions that, as he has alleged them, present no threat to the performance of his judicial functions." 29 M.S.P.R. at 175. Given the frivolousness of Judge Doyle's allegations under any standard of constructive removal, the Board did not need to reach the issue of what kind of actions could constitute section 7521 removals. The <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> decision therefore appears to be nothing more than dicta as it relates to the issue presented in this appeal. Moreover, the Board in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> misread the scope of the <span class="Italic">Benton</span> decision, which was addressing a constructive removal similar to that under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Benton's wife claimed that her husband involuntarily retired. Such an allegation is the same as a claim that a retirement or resignation was involuntary and tantamount to a removal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512<span class="Italic">. See Gutierrez</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 604 &#x00B6; 7. Correctly applying <span class="Italic">Benton</span> shows that the term "removal" in sections 7512 and 7521 can be, and must be, consistently interpreted to limit constructive removals to instances where an appellant is no longer in an ALJ position. The appellant here remained in his ALJ position. Thus, the plain language of the statute, the relevant legislative history, longstanding regulatory interpretation of the statute and binding precedent from the Federal Circuit and the Court of Claims all lead to the conclusion that the Board lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. The Federal Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Sannier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1991), does not change this result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, the court acknowledged that a "constructive removal" is not an action specifically enumerated in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(b)<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 858. The court stated, however, that the Board had found that "certain acts may be the equivalent, for purposes of <span class="Italic">Board</span> jurisdiction, of formal removal." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). The <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> court used <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 1987), to support this proposition. 931 F.2d at 858. The court, citing <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, then stated: "As to ALJs, <span class="Italic">the Board recognizes</span> that an ALJ may be constructively removed by 'cumulative administrative actions or active intervention...[which] prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions...[and which have] a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (emphasis added). There are three important things to note about the court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the court said that the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory implicates the Board's jurisdiction. Since it is our jurisdiction which is at issue, we may address the jurisdictional issue at any time in these proceedings<span class="Italic">. Mulroy v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 404 &#x00B6; 6 (2002). The agency has expressed serious doubts about whether we have jurisdiction over this appeal. We therefore have taken this opportunity to revisit the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, the <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> court relied on its decision in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> to explain the Board's theory of what constitutes a constructive removal under section 7521. The appellant in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> alleged a constructive removal under section 7512. 810 F.2d at 1134. She contended that her resignation from her position was involuntary<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. Ms. Schultz therefore had been separated from her position. Thus, if anything, the opinion in <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> shows that constructive removals require a separation from a position which, if proven to be involuntary, would be tantamount to a removal<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 1136.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2263"></span>Third, the court in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> merely "recognized" the Board's <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of jurisdiction in appeals brought under section 7521. The court did not create the concept or necessarily endorse it. Accordingly, we are free to reexamine <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. A similar situation occurred in a case dealing with requests for law enforcement officer (LEO) service credit.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For years, the Board took an incumbent-oriented approach in deciding whether an appellant was entitled to LEO credit, and the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's approach. Then, in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 318 (2000), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 262 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 534 U.S. 1083, 122 S. Ct. 817, 151 L. Ed. 2d 700 (2002), the Board found that the incumbent-oriented approach was inconsistent with the language of both the retirement statute and OPM's implementing regulations<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11 and 12. Instead, the Board found that a position-oriented approach was required<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. 28.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Federal Circuit approved of the Board's new approach in <span class="Italic">Watson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 262 F.3d 1292 (Fed. Cir. 2001). In doing so, the court stated that, in the earlier case of <span class="Italic">Bingaman v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 127 F.3d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court had accepted the Board's incumbent-oriented approach to LEO service credit, including a list of "factors" to determine if the incumbent was performing primarily LEO duties on a regular basis<span class="Italic">. Watson</span>, 262 F.3d at 1301. In agreeing with the Board that the <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> incumbent-oriented approach was not consistent with the statute and the implementing regulations, the court said that, in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>, it "'merely recognized and applied the [<span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>] factors,' factors which had been 'developed' by the Board, not this court.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (citation omitted). Similarly, we conclude that the <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> court merely recognized and applied the Board's <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of constructive removal for ALJ cases, a theory which was developed by the Board, and not the Court of Claims or the Federal Circuit. Thus, as in <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, we now overrule the Board's prior case law on what can constitute a constructive removal under section 7521 because that law is inconsistent with the statute and the implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142 conforms to the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of jurisdiction. That regulation states that an ALJ may file a complaint with the Board if he alleges that "an agency has interfered with [his] qualified decisional independence so as to constitute an unauthorized action under 5 U.S.C. 7521." The fact that a regulation is based on an erroneous interpretation of a statute does not prevent us from overruling the case law on which the regulation is based. Rather, the statute takes precedence over the regulation<span class="Italic">. See Johnson v. Department of Justice</span>, 71 M.S.P.R. 59, 67 (1996) (provisions of statute will prevail in any case where there is a conflict between a statute and a regulation). We therefore will overrule <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> and change our regulations later to conform to the statute and the new precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decision to overrule <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> is also informed by a commonsense reading of the statute. Section 7521 requires an agency to obtain approval from the Board before taking any of the actions covered by that section. If the Board finds "good cause" to take the proposed action, the agency may proceed. The requirement to seek preapproval from the Board makes sense when "removal" is interpreted to mean separation from the position of ALJ. On the other hand, if constructive removal means what the Board interpreted it to mean in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, then an agency would have to first seek the Board's permission, with the opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing, every time it wants to take actions like the ones at issue here, which involve such things as case processing matters and training requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We cannot believe that this sort of micromanagement, and the likely slowdown in the agency's work that it would cause, is what Congress intended when it used the word "removal" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. Instead, the plain language of the statute shows that Congress intended to protect individuals from losing their positions as ALJs by requiring agencies to obtain the Board's permission before separating persons from ALJ positions. This gives ALJs greater protection than employees covered under section 7512 because an appeal from a section 7512 action may be brought only after the action has been taken. The additional protection afforded by section 7521 sufficiently safeguards the qualified judicial independence of an ALJ. And even if it were insufficient for that purpose, it is not the Board's role to rewrite section 7521 by adding constructive removals of the type created in Doyle.[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum and with respect to the word "removal" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521, we find that the Board has jurisdiction over a complaint filed under section 7521 only if the agency has separated or reassigned an ALJ from his position as an ALJ or the ALJ establishes that his decision to leave the position of ALJ was involuntary under the test for involuntariness used for appeals implicating section 7512<span class="Italic">. Accord</span> <span class="Italic">Butler</span>, 331 F.3d at 1374 (appellant was not subject to appealable reassignment when he retained his ALJ position). Because the appellant here was not separated from the position of ALJ during the relevant time period, he has not alleged facts which, if proven, would show a constructive removal. The Board therefore has no jurisdiction over his appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*] The appellant may have a remedy in federal court for the agency's alleged interference with his qualified judicial independence. In <span class="Italic">Chocallo v. Bureau of Hearings and Appeals</span>, 548 F. Supp. 1349 (E.D. Pa. 1982), for instance, the ALJ asserted that various agency practices interfered with her judicial independence<span class="Italic">. Id</span>. at 1354. The district court judge found that "[j]urisdiction is properly asserted under 28 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1331 and 1343." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Section 1331 of Title 28 provides that district courts "shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." Because the APA is a law, the court in <span class="Italic">Chocallo</span> took jurisdiction over the case. We are aware of no provision in Title 5 which gives the Board concurrent jurisdiction with federal district courts to adjudicate claims of agency interference with an ALJ's qualified judicial independence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board added in <span class="Italic">SSA v. Harty</span>, 96 MSPR 65, 74 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22 (2004), that neither the application of OPM regulations nor the presence of EEO claims will vest jurisdiction over an ALJ's constructive removal claim:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The <span class="Italic">amicus curiae</span> argues that the respondent was improperly reassigned from one ALJ position to another ALJ position without the prior approval of the Office of Personnel Management or detailed from one ALJ position to another ALJ position without compliance with regular civil service procedures, as required by 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 930.205, 930.209, respectively. A reassignment or detail in which the ALJ retains an ALJ position is not one of the actions listed in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521(b). Because the respondent was not separated from the position of ALJ, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider his alleged improper reassignment or detail<span class="Italic">. See Tunik</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 482 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7, 15, 22, 32.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, because the Board lacks jurisdiction over the respondent's constructive removal complaint, it also lacks jurisdiction over his discrimination and retaliation claims with respect to that alleged constructive removal<span class="Italic">. See Wren v. Department of the Army</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 1, 2 (1980) (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b) is not an independent source of Board jurisdiction), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 681 F.2d 867, 871-73 (D.C. Cir. 1982). We therefore will not address his discrimination and retaliation claims with respect to his alleged constructive removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dethloff v. SSA</span>, 93 MSPR 574, 577 &#x00B6; 8 (2003) (Board lacked jurisdiction over appeals by a group of ALJs who asserted that the cumulative acts of the agency interfered with their authority to act in a judicial capacity: "[b]ecause the appellants in this case occupied ALJ positions at all relevant times, and were not separated from the position of ALJ, they have not alleged facts which, if proven, would show a constructive removal"); <span class="Italic">Schloss v. SSA</span>, 93 MSPR 578, 580 &#x00B6; 9 (2003) ("[T]he Board has jurisdiction over a complaint filed by an ALJ under section 7521 only if the agency has separated or reassigned an ALJ from his position as an ALJ, or the ALJ establishes that a separation which he requested, such as a resignation, was actually involuntary and thus should be treated as a removal.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit considered and remanded <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> in 2005, <span class="Italic">Tunik v. MSPB</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/20051733407f3d132611595">407 F.3d 1326</a> (Fed. Cir. 2005). The opinion noted that preexisting law, particularly <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 MSPR 170 (1985), <span class="Italic">Sannier v. MSPB</span>, 931 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1991), and <span class="Italic">Stephens v. MSPB</span>, 986 F.2d 493 (Fed. Cir. 1993), determined that a case could be made out (although the case was not made out in the circumstances of those decisions) that an ALJ could be effectively removed, through agency actions that impair the ALJ's decisional independence. The court acknowledged that a "more natural reading of section 7521 would preclude the constructive removal doctrine entirely." However, the court observed, the Board promulgated a regulation, 5 CFR 1201.142 (1993), establishing jurisdiction in the Board based on an ALJ's allegation that the agency interfered with the ALJ's qualified decisional independence. In <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> the Board overturned its regulation through adjudication. Considering the rulemaking procedures of the APA, the court determined that the Board should not have repealed its regulation without going through the notice and rulemaking process generally required by the APA. Other defenses of the regulation by the Board were rejected by the court. The cases were returned to the Board for further proceedings, the fair implication of the court's decision being that the Board would be free to accept jurisdiction of the appeals by the ALJs but then, based on the Board's assessment of the facts, determine whether the cases presented <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> constructive removals through the standards establish by preexisting caselaw. The Federal Circuit's analysis in <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> was, in part, 407 F.3d at 1333-46:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">In re Doyle</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. 170 (1985), the Board interpreted an earlier but substantively similar version of section 7521 to protect ALJs from more than actual separation from employment. In interpreting "removal" under the statute, the Board concluded that an ALJ could bring a claim for removal under section 7521 even though the offending conduct was less than physical separation from federal employment. The Board based its decision on the history and remedial purpose of the APA. 29 M.S.P.R. at 174-75. The Board held that "'removal' has consistently been interpreted as protecting an administrative law judge from actions of his employing agency that could impair his qualified judicial independence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 174. The Board subsequently codified the holding of <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> pursuant <span id="Page_2264"></span>to notice and comment rulemaking at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142. Merit Systems Protection Board Practices and Procedures, 62 Fed. Reg. 48449, 48455 (Sept. 16, 1997) (interim rule, request for comments); Merit Systems Protection Board Practices and Procedures, 63 Fed. Reg. 42685 (Aug. 11, 1998) (final rule).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board applied this standard in two subsequent cases that were appealed to this court. First, in <span class="Italic">Sannier v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 931 F.2d 856 (Fed. Cir. 1991), a group of ALJs from the Social Security Administration challenged various management practices allegedly intended to promote productivity at the Lansing, Michigan Office of Hearings and Appeals. Because the practices complained of involved, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, refusing to replace ALJs at the particular office until productivity increased and asking ALJs to transfer out of that office so it could be closed, we held that the Board properly determined that it did not have jurisdiction over the action. In reaching this decision, we quoted the Board's standard set forth in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. Agreeing with the Board's standard, we said, "Well-pleaded allegations tying the agency actions to impairment of their decisionmaking independence are, at minimum, necessary to establish <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> Board jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 858. Further, in rejecting the ALJs' claim that they had pled sufficient facts to warrant Board jurisdiction whether or not they would ultimately prevail, this court applied the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard. We said that even "assum[ing] <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the agency explicitly instituted overall targets or goals for the number of appeals to be adjudicated per month, such production targets simply are not, by themselves, probative that the ALJ's impartiality or independence in a particular appeal has been or would be compromised." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 859.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Stephens v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 986 F.2d 493 (Fed. Cir. 1993), Stephens argued that the Department of Health and Human Services' requirement that Stephens attend a specially designed course of instruction resulted in a constructive removal under section 7521. We again affirmed the Board's dismissal of this claim for lack of jurisdiction. In reaching that conclusion, we noted that section 7521 was "specifically limited to removals, suspensions, reductions in grade, reductions in pay and furloughs of 30 days or less." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 496. Nevertheless, citing <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, we said that "[t]his court has determined...that constructive removals are also covered by that section." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In setting forth the standard, we quoted <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>'s quotation of <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> recognizing a constructive removal where an agency's actions interfere with an ALJ's qualified independence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> As in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, the court in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> rejected Stephens's argument that he was entitled to a hearing on jurisdiction because "even accepting all of petitioner's factual allegations as true, the Board still does not have jurisdiction because the program and instructional course do not impair petitioner's decisional independence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 497.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our decisions in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> adopted and applied the Board's <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> standard. In <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, we said that removal under section 7521 encompasses cumulative administrative action or active intervention that prevents the impartial exercise of judicial function and that has a pernicious effect on qualified judicial independence. 931 F.2d at 858 (quoting <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 175). We affirmed the Board's application of the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> rationale in rejecting the ALJs' assertions that personnel policies designed to increase productivity constituted constructive removal, concluding that such policies did not interfere with an ALJ's independence or impartiality. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 858-59. Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, we again employed the standard expressed in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> to reject Stephens's assertion that a mandatory course of instruction amounted to constructive removal. We stated specifically, in referring to <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, "This court has determined, however, that constructive removals are also covered by that section." 986 F.2d at 496. The Board is not free to reject the rationale employed in reaching those decisions as <span class="Italic">dictum</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In its opinion in <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, the Board concluded that this court in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> merely "recognized" the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of jurisdiction. <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 491. The Board said that this court "did not create the concept or necessarily endorse it." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Such a position is difficult to reconcile with the language of <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and is impossible to reconcile with <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, which the Board did not even mention. This court both found the Board's interpretation of section 7521 in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> to be reasonable and affirmed the Board's application of the standard derived from its interpretation in deciding the <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next address the Board's contention that it was free to reconsider its earlier decision in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, notwithstanding our decisions in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>. This entails our consideration of the deference due the Board's interpretation of section 7521 and the extent to which any such deference was employed in our decisions in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>. As to the former, the parties dispute whether the Board is entitled to any deference in its interpretation of section 7521. The Board, citing 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1305, argues that it is charged with administering section 7521 and that its interpretation is entitled to deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984). In <span class="Italic">United States v. Mead Corp.</span>, the Supreme Court "recognized a very good indicator of delegation meriting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> treatment in express congressional authorizations to engage in the process of rulemaking or adjudication that produces regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed." 533 U.S. 218, 229 (2001). Section 1305 provides exactly that for the Board regarding section 7521. Section 1305 states that "for the purpose of section 7521 of this title, the Merit Systems Protection Board may investigate, prescribe regulations, appoint advisory committees as necessary, recommend legislation, subpena [sic] witnesses and records, and pay witness fees as established for the courts of the United States." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1305 (2000). Further, section 7521 authorizes the Board to adjudicate whether an agency has established good cause for disciplinary action against an ALJ. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7521 ("An action may be taken against an administrative law judge...only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board."). Both <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> involved such adjudications. The Board has been charged with administering section 7521 through both rulemaking and adjudication and is entitled to <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> deference in these activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the Supreme Court established a two-part test for evaluating an agency interpretation of a statute. First, "[i]f the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress." <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 842-43. However, "if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 843. Thus, in determining the extent of deference given to the Board in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, the inquiry boils down to which portion of the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> analysis was applied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not expressly framed under either prong of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, the analysis in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> falls into the latter category. The analysis in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> begins by quoting section 7521 but acknowledges, "Petitioners do not, and cannot, contend under these facts that they were subjected to any of the enumerated adverse personnel actions listed in subsection (b)." 931 F.2d at 858. After observing that the petitioners based their claim solely on "constructive" removal, the court said, "Although a 'constructive' removal is not specifically enumerated in subsection (b), the Board, as well as this court, has recognized that certain acts may be the equivalent, for purposes of Board jurisdiction, of formal removal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> This court's initial observation that the petitioners' claim ventured outside the literal language of the statute is an express acknowledgement that Congress has not unambiguously expressed its intent on the issue of constructive removal. Where the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to a particular issue, this court must consider whether the agency's interpretation is permissible. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The analysis in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> continues by stating that "the Board recognizes the possibility that an ALJ may be constructively removed by 'cumulative administrative actions or active intervention...[which] prevent the impartial exercise of his judicial functions...[and which have] a pernicious effect on the complaining judge's qualified independence.'" <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, 931 F.2d at 858 (quoting <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 175) (alterations in original). This court then said,</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">We agree with the Board that "even if [it] were to assume that the ALJs have suffered, among other things, staffing shortages, transfer restrictions and reduced service areas due to management's perception that the Lansing ALJs production rate was low, they have not alleged in any of the many papers submitted that these actions of management have interfered with their impartial decisionmaking ability."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">In re Sannier</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 420, 426 (1990)) (alteration in original). It is difficult to view the analysis in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> as anything other than deferential to the Board's interpretation of section 7521 as a permissible gap-filling in a specific area to which the statute fails to speak. <span class="Italic">See Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44 (noting that Congress may implicitly delegate authority to an agency to fill in gaps where there is not an explicit gap in the statute).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the Board's interpretation of section 7521 was reasonable, the Board's interpretation as set forth in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> and reiterated in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> was properly the law. <span class="Italic">See Mead Corp.</span>, 533 U.S. at 229 (noting that it may be apparent that Congress conferred authority on an agency to speak with the force of law even over issues about which Congress had no intent). When this court again considered the Board's application of section 7521, we applied the Board's constructive removal standard as the governing law. In <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, the court again noted that section 7521 is "specifically limited to removals, suspensions, reductions in grade, reductions in pay and furloughs of 30 days or less." 986 F.2d at 496. Citing <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>, we said that "[t]his court has determined, however, that constructive removals are also covered by that section." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Thus, this court again acknowledged that constructive removal was outside the clear language of the statute and, by implication, the clear intent of Congress. Although it is possible to read that statement in <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> as concluding that section 7521 expressly covers constructive removal--<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, that Congress's intent on this point is clear--as discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> held that the statute was silent on this point. Even <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> acknowledged that the constructive <span id="Page_2265"></span>removal doctrine exceeds the plain language of the statute. The better reading of <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>, then, is that it was merely acknowledging that <span class="Italic">Sannier</span>'s determination that the Board's interpretation was permissible was sufficient to make the Board's interpretation the governing law. Thus, <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> also indicates that this court applied the second prong of <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> to the Board's interpretation of section 7521.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The conclusion that <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> reflect appropriate deference to the Board brings us to the question of whether the Board is free to reconsider its interpretation of section 7521, despite <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>. The Board relies on <span class="Italic">Bankers Trust New York Corp. v. United States</span>, 225 F.3d 1368, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2000). In <span class="Italic">Bankers Trust</span>, this court concluded that the Court of Federal Claims erred in holding that an Internal Revenue Service regulation trumped a prior conflicting decision of the Court of Claims. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1376. In holding that the agency was not free to overturn the decision of its reviewing court by regulation, we distinguished the Ninth Circuit's decision in <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde Construction Co. v. Northern California District Council of Laborers</span>, 861 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir. 1988) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). In <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span>, the Ninth Circuit held that where a prior panel of the court had applied an agency's interpretation of a statute after concluding that the agency's interpretation was reasonable, a later panel of the court was free to accord deference to a new agency interpretation without <span class="Italic">en banc</span> review, even if it conflicted with the interpretation applied in the earlier panel decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1134-36. In <span class="Italic">Bankers Trust</span>, we said, "This is not a case like <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span>, in which the original decision was itself based on deference to the agency; under such circumstances, we might well consider the agency's change of heart as a significant factor." 225 F.3d at 1376. Because we have concluded that <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> were based on deference to the Board's interpretation of section 7521, this court must now confront directly the question presented in <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span> that where an earlier panel decision on statutory construction was based on deference to an agency interpretation, a later panel of this court is free to consider whether a new agency interpretation is reasonable without <span class="Italic">en banc</span> reconsideration of the earlier panel decision. In this circuit, like the Ninth Circuit, panels of the court are bound by prior panel decisions. <span class="Italic">Newell Cos. v. Kenney Mfg. Co.</span>, 864 F.2d 757, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Although that rule could be construed to preclude giving deference to a new agency interpretation even where our prior decision was based on deference, we think that the better view is that a panel should be free to consider whether the new interpretation is permissible in keeping with our role as a reviewing court under the <span class="Italic">Chevron</span> framework. <span class="Italic">See Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 863-64 ("An initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone. On the contrary, the agency, to engage in informed rulemaking, must consider varying interpretations and the wisdom of its policy on a continuing basis."). Quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, in <span class="Italic">Rust v. Sullivan</span>, the Supreme Court said, "This Court has rejected the argument that an agency's interpretation 'is not entitled to deference because it represents a sharp break with prior interpretations' of the statute in question." 500 U.S. 173, 186 (1991) (quoting <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 862). Where an agency's new interpretation is entitled to deference, a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for that of the agency unless the agency's judgment is unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843-44 (stating that where Congress has left a gap in a statutory scheme, even implicitly, "a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency"). Thus, we think the better view, as the Ninth Circuit held in <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span>, is that a later panel of this court must be free to consider whether an agency's new interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering is reasonable without being bound by a deferential interpretation applied in a prior panel decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the Board that <span class="Italic">Watson</span> provides some support for this rule in that this court noted in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> that its prior decision in <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span> was deferential. However, as noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the question was not squarely presented in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> because the standard employed in <span class="Italic">Watson</span> was entirely consistent with the rationale of <span class="Italic">Bingaman</span>. <span class="Italic">Watson</span>, 262 F.3d at 1301-02. Thus, we conclude that the Board was not bound to interpret section 7521 in the same manner it was interpreted in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This leads us next to the question of whether the Board's new interpretation of section 7521 is permissible. <span class="Italic">Chevron</span>, 467 U.S. at 843; <span class="Italic">Mesa Verde</span>, 861 F.2d at 1130-31. The Board justified its new interpretation on multiple grounds. Some of the Board's proffered justifications for adopting its new standard have been rejected <span class="Italic">supra</span>, and there is no need to repeat them here. Because we conclude that the Board's interpretation of the plain language of section 7521 is reasonable based on the policy arguments it has advanced, we will focus on those arguments. The Board, in its <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> decision, stated that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">if constructive removal means what the Board interpreted it to mean in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, then an agency would have to first seek the Board's permission, with the opportunity for a full evidentiary hearing, every time it wants to take actions like the ones at issue here, which involve such things as case processing matters and training requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...We cannot believe that this sort of micromanagement, and the likely slowdown in the agency's work that it would cause, is what Congress intended when it used the word "removal" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521. Instead, the plain language of the statute shows that Congress intended to protect individuals from losing their positions as ALJs by requiring agencies to obtain the Board's permission before separating persons from ALJ positions. This gives ALJs greater protection than employees covered under section 7512 because an appeal from a section 7512 action may be brought only <span class="Italic">after</span> the action has been taken. The additional protection afforded by section 7521 sufficiently safeguards the qualified judicial independence of an ALJ.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 492.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the Board that the plain language of section 7521 reasonably can be read to apply only to cases of actual separation from employment as an ALJ. As noted <span class="Italic">supra</span>, both <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> recognized that the constructive removal doctrine went beyond the plain language of the statute. If anything, the more natural reading of section 7521 would preclude the constructive removal doctrine entirely. The Board's earlier contrary opinion in <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> relied in part on the Court of Claims' decision in <span class="Italic">Benton v. United States</span>, 488 F.2d 1017 (Ct. Cl. 1973). <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>, 29 M.S.P.R. at 174-75. In <span class="Italic">Benton</span>, the Court of Claims held that subjecting a hearing examiner to involuntary retirement under the Civil Service Retirement Act constituted removal under section 11 of the APA. In its analysis, the court said, "We reach our conclusion in recognition of the fact that the APA was a sweeping piece of remedial legislation which was a long time in coming. For that reason, we think it should be given a broad and generous interpretation in light of the objectives sought to be accomplished." 488 F.2d at 1022. <span class="Italic">Benton</span>, however, recognized that "removal" relates to an actual separation from employment and merely extended such removals to circumstances in which the reason for such separation was not disciplinary in nature. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1020-21. Similarly, this court's decision in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> cited <span class="Italic">Schultz v. United States Navy</span>, 810 F.2d 1133 (Fed. Cir. 1987), as supporting a broad understanding of removal. However, <span class="Italic">Schultz</span> held only that a voluntary resignation based on agency coercion constituted an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1137. Thus, no decision of this court has construed section 7521 to cover anything other than actual separation from employment as an ALJ, except in the deferential context of <span class="Italic">Sannier Stephens.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJs argue that the APA was designed to secure decisional independence of administrative judges. Similarly, the ALJs argue that the legislative history of the APA indicates the importance of decisional independence to Congress. Although the ALJs are correct that the APA was concerned with effecting independence for ALJs, neither the APA itself nor the legislative history behind it indicates that Congress intended to extend section 7521 to cover anything less than actual separation from employment as an ALJ. There were some who expressed such views. However, the history of the APA does not show that those views reflected the intent of Congress in enacting the APA. <span class="Italic">See Ramspeck v. Fed. Trial Exam'rs Conference</span>, 345 U.S. 128, 131-33 (1953) ("The position of hearing examiners is not a constitutionally protected position. It is a creature of congressional enactment.... They hold their posts by such tenure as Congress sees fit to give them."); <span class="Italic">see also</span> S. Rep. No. 79-752, at 30 (1945) ("On those subjects, such as the separation of examiners from the agencies they serve, there has been a wide divergence of views. The committee has in such cases taken the course which it believes will suffice without being excessive."). We cannot agree with the ALJs that the term "removal" in section 7521 must be construed to encompass constructive removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJs additionally argue that in view of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105, section 7521 must be construed broadly to include constructive removal. Section 3105 provides that "[a]dministrative law judges...may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as administrative law judges." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105 (2000). Based on section 3105, the ALJs argue that "removal" in section 7521 must include anything that causes ALJs to perform duties that are inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as ALJs. In particular, the ALJs argue that interference with their decisional independence causes them to perform their duties in an unfair manner, which is inconsistent with their duties as ALJs. It is unclear, however, how an agency's interference with an ALJ's decisional independence causes an ALJ to perform a duty that is inconsistent with the ALJ's duties and responsibilities as an ALJ. The ALJs are not arguing that they are being required to perform duties other than the adjudication of cases. Instead, they are complaining about the manner of performance of that duty. Section 3105 does not speak to this issue. Even if the ALJs were correct, there is no plausible reason to engraft such a contorted interpretation of section 3105 onto section 7521. We thus conclude that the Board's interpretation of section 7521 to require actual physical separation from employment as an ALJ is not unreasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining arguments of the ALJs have been considered but are not persuasive. We thus conclude that the Board's new interpretation of <span id="Page_2266"></span>section 7521 is reasonable and that our decisions in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span> do not preclude the Board from adopting such a new interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;Overturning the Regulation</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our holding that the Board's new interpretation of section 7521 is permissible does not end the inquiry. The Board has promulgated a regulation, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142, codifying the holding of <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. The regulation states, "An administrative law judge who alleges that an agency has interfered with the judge's qualified decisional independence so as to constitute an unauthorized action under 5 U.S.C. 7521 may file a complaint with the Board under this subpart." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142 (2004). The Board recognized the inconsistency between the extant regulation and its desire to overrule <span class="Italic">Doyle</span>. In dealing with the regulation, the Board said:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board's regulation at 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.142 conforms to the <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> theory of jurisdiction. That regulation states that an ALJ may file a complaint with the Board if he alleges that "an agency has interfered with [his] qualified decisional independence so as to constitute an unauthorized action under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7521." The fact that a regulation is based on an erroneous interpretation of a statute does not prevent us from overruling the case law on which the regulation is based. Rather, the statute takes precedence over the regulation. We therefore will overrule <span class="Italic">Doyle</span> and change our regulations later to conform to the statute and the new precedent.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Tunik v. Social Sec. Admin.</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 482, 492 (2003) (citation omitted and alteration in original). Because the Board overturned its regulation through adjudication, we asked for additional briefing as to whether the holding of <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3090 v. Federal Labor Relations Authority</span>, 777 F.2d 751, 758-60 (D.C. Cir. 1985), might preclude the Board's decision in this case. The ALJs, the government, and the Social Security Administration submitted supplemental briefs on this issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We conclude that the Board misunderstood its role as an administrative agency and failed to consider the question of whether and under what circumstances the Board, by adjudication, could overturn its regulation. If the Board's regulation is subject to the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 553, requiring notice and comment rulemaking, the Board's regulation is the governing law and may not be overturned by the Board outside the procedural requirements of section 553. <span class="Italic">United States v. Nixon</span>, 418 U.S. 683, 695-96 (1974) ("So long as this regulation remains in force the Executive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as the sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect and to enforce it.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because section 1201.142 is a substantive rule not subject to the exemption in section 553(b)(A) and because it is not subject to the agency management or personnel exception of section 553(a)(2), the Board could only repeal the rule through the notice and comment procedures required by section 553(b). <span class="Italic">United States v. Nixon</span>, 418 U.S. 683, 695-96 (1974) ("So long as this regulation remains in force the Executive Branch is bound by it, and indeed the United States as the sovereign composed of the three branches is bound to respect and to enforce it."); <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 3090 v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth.</span>, 777 F.2d 751, 758-60 (D.C. Cir. 1985) ("[U]nless and until it amends or repeals a valid legislative rule or regulation, an agency is bound by such a rule or regulation."); <span class="Italic">see also United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy</span>, 347 U.S. 260, 267-68 (1954) (holding that the Attorney General may not act in contravention of valid regulations "as long as the regulations remain operative").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board and the Agency argue that an exception to the general rule that an Agency is bound by its own rules applies where the rule is inconsistent with a statute. <span class="Italic">See Am. Tel. &#x0026; Tel. Co. v. Fed. Communications Comm'n</span>, 978 F.2d 727, 733 (D.C. Cir. 1992) ("[T]hen Judge Scalia, concurring in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees</span>, recognized that in some situations, when an agency declines to apply its own rule in an adjudication 'we would be justified [on appeal] in looking beyond the defect of inconsistency, to affirm an adjudication on the ground that its result was mandated by statute and that the conflicting rule was simply unlawful.'" (quoting <span class="Italic">Am. Fed. of Gov't Employees</span>, 777 F.2d at 760 (Scalia, J., concurring)) (alteration in original)). However, the argument that section 1201.142 is inconsistent with section 7521 is foreclosed by our decisions in <span class="Italic">Sannier</span> and <span class="Italic">Stephens</span>. Thus, this exception does not apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we must conclude that the Board lacked authority to overrule section 1201.142 by adjudication. That conclusion does not foreclose the Board from repealing the rule in accordance with section 553(b). However, for purposes of the present case, the Board must adhere to its legislative rule.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">ALJ Mahoney recognizes as much, but asserts that the Act does not preclude claims that do not concern "personnel actions." Pointing to the Supreme Court's statement that "certain actions by supervisors against federal employees, such as wiretapping, warrantless searches, or uncompensated takings, would not be defined as 'personnel actions' within the statutory scheme," <span class="Italic">Bush v. Lucas</span>, 462 U.S. 367, 385 n.28 (1983); <span class="Italic">see also Stewart v. Evans</span>, 275 F.3d 1126, 1130 (D.C. Cir. 2002), he asserts that not all workplace claims challenge "personnel actions" within the <span id="Page_2267"></span>meaning of the Act. He contends that his claims "are so far afield from the types of claims that are cognizable under the [Act] that the [Act] does not preempt them." Appellant's Reply Br. 22. His claims, he argues, do "'not concern his employment status, compensation, job responsibilities, or even his working conditions.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 24 (quoting <span class="Italic">Mahoney</span>, 824 F. Supp.2d at 65). We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act defines "personnel action" to include any "significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). ALJ Mahoney challenges four sets of actions: (1) the selective assignment of cases on the basis of political considerations or the Secretary's perceived interests; (2) the failure to provide docket numbers necessary for the administrative law judges to manage their cases, as well as to provide access to legal-research resources; (3) unauthorized <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications between his supervisor and a litigant appearing before him; and (4) the practice of providing the Justice Department with advance warning of notices of election in certain cases. We think these actions affect "working conditions" and thus fall within the scope of a "personnel action" under the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The selective assignment of cases affects the number or type of cases an administrative law judge will receive. That strikes us as a working condition. Moreover, the requirement that administrative law judges "be assigned to cases in rotation so far as practicable" appears in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3105, the provision governing the appointment of administrative law judges and providing that they "may not perform duties inconsistent with their duties and responsibilities as administrative law judges." The appointment of an administrative law judge is a "personnel action," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(i), as is a significant change in "duties" or "responsibilities," <span class="Italic">id</span>. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii). This strongly suggests that the assignment of cases is also a personnel action under the Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, the failure to provide docket numbers and the failure to provide access to legal-research resources affect the ability of administrative law judges to do their jobs efficiently and effectively. In that respect, these actions affect working conditions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is perhaps less clear that the <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> communications and the advance warning of notices of election concern working conditions. But ALJ Mahoney alleges that these actions interfered with his decisional independence. We believe "working conditions" can and should be read broadly enough to include such actions. The degree of independence of an administrative law judge--the extent to which an administrative law judge may "exercise[ ] his independent judgment on the evidence before him, free from pressures by<span class="Italic">...</span>officials within the agency," <span class="Italic">Butz v. Economou</span>, 438 U.S. 478, 513 (1978)--certainly sounds like a working condition. Accordingly, to the extent the complained-of actions are alleged to interfere with ALJ Mahoney's decisional independence, they may be said to affect his working conditions.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Tunik, an administrative law judge with the Social Security Administration, alleged that the acting regional chief administrative law judge had interfered with his decisional independence by instructing that one of his decisions, remanding a disability claim to the state agency, be prevented from issuing and by directing that the case be transferred. (The decision ultimately was issued with a minor change.) After ALJ Tunik remanded another case to the state agency on the same grounds, he was informed that the case would be reassigned unless he vacated his order. <span class="Italic">See Tunik v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd</span>., 407 F.3d 1326, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;As ALJ Mahoney points out, in a footnote the Board suggested that "[t]he appellant may have a remedy in federal court for the agency's alleged interference with his qualified judicial independence." <span class="Italic">Tunik</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. at 492 n.*. The Board pointed to a district court case, <span class="Italic">Chocallo v. Bureau of Hearings &#x0026; Appeals</span>, 548 F. Supp. 1349 (E.D. Pa. 1982), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 716 F.2d 889 (3d Cir. 1983) (table), in which an administrative law judge asserted that various agency practices had interfered with her judicial independence in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. We find no significance in the Board's comment, and it does not alter our conclusion here. The <span class="Italic">Chocallo</span> court did not address whether the Civil Service Reform Act precluded the plaintiff's claims. Indeed, the court did not even mention the Act--perhaps because the plaintiff brought suit in 1977, before the Act was enacted. Nor did the Board consider whether the actions at issue in <span class="Italic">Tunik</span> were "personnel actions" within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 or whether the claims would be precluded by the Act. Beyond pointing to a single district court case--to which we owe no deference--the Board offered no reason why judicial review would be available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Construing the term "working conditions" in 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302 to include actions alleged to interfere with an administrative law judge's decisional independence, as we do here, on the other hand, raises no such concerns. Rather, it is entirely consistent with the language and structure of the Act to treat an action alleged to interfere with an administrative law judge's decisional independence as a personnel action subject to investigation by the Office of Special Counsel. To do otherwise would "impermissibly frustrat[e]" the "exhaustive remedial scheme" of the Act by permitting, for such actions, "an access to the courts more immediate and direct than the statute provides with regard to major adverse actions," such as removal, suspension, and reduction in pay or grade, <span class="Italic">Carducci</span>, 714 F.2d at 174--more serious actions that are subject to pre-approval by the Merit Systems Protection Board because of their potential to compromise the independence of an administrative law judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We thus conclude that the Civil Service Reform Act precludes ALJ Mahoney's claims of interference with his decisional independence. As a result, the district court lacked jurisdiction over his claims.</p>
