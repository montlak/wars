<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-265"><span class="space">g.</span> Attorney Work Product Privilege</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Of the work product privilege, <span class="Italic">Waymo LLC v. Uber Technologies, Inc</span>., 870 F.3d 1350, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2017), offered:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The work-product doctrine protects from discovery documents, tangible things, or compilations of materials that were prepared in anticipation of litigation by a party or its representative. <span class="Italic">See United States v. Richey</span>, 632 F.3d 559, 567 (9th Cir. 2011). Documents that "w[ere]not prepared exclusively for litigation," known as "[d]ual purpose documents," may be entitled to work-product protection if they were prepared "because of" litigation, meaning "the document[s]can be fairly said to have been prepared or obtained because of the prospect of litigation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 568 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Even if a party has demonstrated that documents are entitled to work-product protection, that protection may be waived through disclosure to a third person. <span class="Italic">See Hernandez</span>, 604 F.3d at 1100. The common interest doctrine, however, may serve as "an exception" to a waiver of privilege, including work-product protection, that "allow[s]attorneys for different clients pursuing <span id="Page_1253"></span>a common legal strategy to communicate with each other." <span class="Italic">Pac. Pictures</span>, 679 F.3d at 1129; <span class="Italic">see Pecover v. Elec. Arts Inc</span>., No. C08-2820 CW (BZ), 2011 WL 6020412, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 2, 2011) (stating that the common interest doctrine "is a narrow exception to the rule of waiver" of work-product protection).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In the litigation entitled <span class="Italic">In re Subpena Addressed to OSC</span>, 16 MSPR 596, 599 (1983), the Board first addressed attorney work product privilege invoked by the attorneys of OSC to resist the efforts of an appellant who was trying to prove, through OSC records that she sought through discovery, her affirmative defense of a prohibited personnel practice. The Board resolved that the privilege claim must be specific, tied to particular documents, and not general in nature:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he Special Counsel additionally opposes the application for enforcement of the subpoena on the grounds that the attorney work product privilege removed the investigative file from the scope of allowable discovery. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the work product privilege is a qualified privilege that may be pierced by a showing that the party seeking the documents has a "substantial need of the materials in the preparation of [its]case" and would be "unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the materials by other means." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3). Nevertheless, under the Federal Rules, even when the required showing of need and undue hardship had been made, the court is still required to "protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other representative of a party concerning the litigation." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Counsel has invoked the protection of the attorney work product privilege with regard to its investigative file in the Martin matter without identifying the nature and specific content of the material to be protected. Without more, it is difficult for the Board to assess the applicability of the privilege to the file, and whether such protection should extend to the file in whole or in part. As Professor Moore has stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a claim of privilege must normally be directed toward specific documents so that the court can rule intelligently thereon, and hence a general objection to a subpoena may be too vague.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 J. Moore, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice &#x00A7;</span> 45.01 at 45-46 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Special Counsel is ORDERED to prepare an affidavit that lists and describes all documents contained in the Martin investigative file, identifying each document by reference to the author, recipient, and subject(s) covered, noting the number of pages comprising the document, and asserting the respective privileges that attach to the document, providing the basis for each privilege asserted.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The work product issue returned to the Board. <span class="Italic">In re Subpena Addressed to OSC</span>, 18 MSPR 454, 458 (1983). The Board concluded that documents prepared by or for the Special Counsel in an investigation into allegations of prohibited personnel practices were prepared "in anticipation of litigation," because that route constitutes the only means available for enforcement by OSC and therefore falls within the scope of the work product privilege. That privilege remained in effect during the pendency of the applicant's appeal of her removal "because of the relatedness of the appeal to the investigation of the Special Counsel."

<p class="Block-Quote1">...We hold that documents prepared by or for the Special Counsel in an investigation into allegations of prohibited personnel practices, such as the investigation into the applicant's claims, were prepared "in anticipation of litigation," inasmuch as that route constitutes the only means available for enforcement by the Special Counsel. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1206(c)(1)(B), (g), (h), 1207, 1208; Fed.

<p class="Body-Text">The Board noted in the subpoena enforcement proceedings involving the Special Counsel that the work product privilege is not absolute. Discovery of the materials may be obtained, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3), by a showing that the party seeking discovery has substantial need of the materials in the preparation of his case and that he is unable to obtain the substantial equivalent by other means without undue hardship. The Board determined, however, that the passage of time and resulting dimming of witnesses' memories did not warrant the production of statements without identifying specific witnesses who died or were otherwise unavailable, or whose memories had faded. Nor was the possibility that the file sought might contain impeachment evidence a sufficient basis for ordering disclosure of work product. Finally, the cost or inconvenience of taking depositions, unless prohibitive, did not suffice to meet the undue hardship requirement, 18 MSPR at 459-60:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board finds these arguments insufficient to establish the showing of substantial need and undue hardship required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3).

<p class="Body-Text">The OSC subpoena case resulted in an order directing disclosure of some documents, protection of others, and <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection by the Board of still others. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">In re Subpena</span>, 18 MSPR at 461 n.6, that its exercise of <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection review of allegedly privileged materials "lies within the Board's inherent authority and discretion as a quasi-judicial body and advances the judicious pursuit of enforcement of Board subpoenas." The case returned to the Board again, following <span class="Italic">in camera</span> inspection, in <span class="Italic">In re Subpena</span>, 20 MSPR 245 (1984). Some documents were ordered produced and some were privileged. The Board added, as to invocation of the work product privilege applied to OSC correspondence with congressional offices, <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 248-49:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One additional document constitutes correspondence prepared by the Office of Special Counsel and transmitted to the General Accounting Office. Another document similarly constitutes OSC correspondence transmitted to Senator Thomas Eagleton. Both letters concern the status or procedural handling of the case, and do not expressly or impliedly involve mental impressions or theories of personnel in the Office of Special Counsel about the case. Thus they do not appear to constitute attorney work product. Even if they did, the Special Counsel may be considered to have waived the privilege by disclosures of the information contained in the correspondence to the General Accounting Office and Senator Eagleton. <span class="Italic">See In re</span> <span class="Italic">Doe,</span> 662 F.2d 1073, 1081 (4th Cir. 1981), <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 455 U.S. 1000, 102 S. Ct. 1632, 71 L. Ed.2d 867 (1982)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The efforts to obtain documents for the MSPB litigation directed against OSC led to court review. In court, the government addressed the work product privilege and its relation to the Privacy Act. A federal district court determined that the plaintiff, Ms. Martin, was entitled to the materials, <span class="Italic">Warren and Martin v. Special Counsel</span>, CA 84-2232 (D.D.C. February 7, 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Relying upon the Privacy Act ("Act")...the plaintiff Betty Martin seeks the release of documents held by the Office of Special Counsel ("OSC") relating to its investigation of charges that her dismissal from the Air Force was unlawful....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government initially claimed that the eleven witness statements and the notes of interviews were exempt from disclosure under 5 USC 552a(k)(2) because the witnesses were advised that their identities would be protected....&#8197;[T]he government has now conceded that it cannot rely on this exemption. [The OSC investigator] states that he cannot recall whether he made specific promises of confidentiality when he interviewed the witnesses. This statement is clearly insufficient for the government to carry its burden to demonstrate that the statements can be withheld under this exemption....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By filing a complaint with the OSC, the plaintiff invoked the only remedy available to her to challenge the Air Force's alleged reprisals against her for being a "whistleblower."...&#8197;And by appealing her Air Force dismissal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, she was also invoking a remedy authorized by statute....&#8197;Because the OSC decided that her complaint was without merit, based on the information contained in the witness affidavits, it decided not to take further action on her behalf. Plaintiff <span id="Page_1254"></span>believes that the information being withheld will assist her in her appeal before the MSPB, and it would also be of use in deciding whether to challenge the OSC's actions. Surely her quest is not the sort of "improper raiding" that concerned Congress....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having failed to justify the withholding of the remaining documents under the "confidential source" exemption, the government turns again to the "work product" exemption. 5 USC 552a(d)(5). First, it makes the surprising claim that the witness affidavits are work product because they would reveal the thought processes of the investigator who determined what information they should include....&#8197;Verbatim witness statements are the product of the witness, not of the lawyer who directed their preparation. They do not fall within the (d)(3) exemption. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Robbins Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co. v. NLRB</span>, 563 F.2d 724, 735 (5th Cir. 1977).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining disputed documents are notes of interviews with fifteen witnesses, eleven who made formal statements and four who did not. The Court's task here is to determine if these notes contain purely factual information or instead reflect the deliberative process and therefore fall under exemption (d)(5). If both are present, the Court must decide if it would be appropriate to sever and release the factual information. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mervin v. FTC</span>, 591 F.2d 821, 826 (D.C. Cir. 1978). Even factual material can be protected by the work product exemption if it would disclose the deliberative process of the attorney/investigator. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Kent Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 530 F.2d 612, 623-24 (5th Cir. 1976).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Court has reviewed the disputed interview notes <span class="Italic">in camera</span>. Each set of notes simply records in a shorthand version the comments of the witness. There are no notations in the margins, no comments of the attorney, no analysis of or reaction to the facts described by the witness. In short, there is nothing in these notes that would disclose "the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories" of the attorney/investigator....&#8197;The Court holds, therefore, that neither the witness affidavits nor the interview notes are exempt from disclosure under exemption (d)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The government appealed the district court's ruling. The District of Columbia Circuit reversed the district court, <span class="Italic">Martin v. Special Counsel</span>, 819 F.2d 1181, 1184-87 (D.C. Cir. 1987), concluding that the long sought materials were exempt under FOIA and the Privacy Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...To resolve the present case we must grapple directly with the confusion plaguing the courts' efforts to apply the law of civil discovery privilege in Exemption (b)(5) analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant argues that the attorney notes and witness statements Ms. Martin seeks are classic attorney work product, privileged under the Supreme Court's opinion in <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span>, 329 U.S. 495 (1947). As these documents would not be released "normally" or "routinely" in civil discovery, OSC insists, they fall squarely within the Court's interpretation of the exemption....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court interpreted Exemption (b)(5) more narrowly. The court found that, whatever the scope of the attorney work-product privilege in civil discovery, under Exemption (b)(5) that privilege extends only as far as does the general "deliberative process" executive privilege enjoyed by agencies. The court reasoned that Congress enacted Exemption (b)(5) only to protect the "free and frank discussion" of policy shielded by the deliberative process privilege, rather than to incorporate civil discovery privileges wholesale. Consequently, because factual material is not privileged under the deliberative process privilege, "purely factual" work product, even if otherwise privileged, does not come within Exemption (b)(5)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The words of a statute presumptively establish its meaning, and the intent of Congress behind it....&#8197;Here, those words point clearly, unequivocally, to the incorporation of all civil discovery rules into FOIA Exemption (b)(5). Nothing on the face of the provision incorporates the deliberative process privilege in a vacuum. We find neither the legislative history of the Act nor the reasoning in <span class="Italic">Robbins Tire</span> and <span class="Italic">Deering Milliken</span> sufficiently powerful to require the conclusion that Congress meant Exemption (b)(5) to extend to the limits of the "deliberative process" executive privilege, but no farther.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The legislative history does not suggest that this concern for "frank discussion" was exclusive, or that Congress intended Exemption (b)(5) to be a mere surrogate for the deliberative process privilege....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court's <span class="Italic">Weber Aircraft</span> opinion, decided after <span class="Italic">Robbins Tire</span> and <span class="Italic">Deering Milliken</span>, puts any lingering doubt on the question to rest. In that case, the Court explicitly rejected the notion that "purely factual material can never qualify for protection under Exemption 5." 465 U.S. at 800 n.17. <span class="Italic">Mink</span>, the Court explained, "merely states that <span class="Italic">otherwise nonprivileged</span> factual material cannot be withheld under Exemption 5 merely because it appears in the same document as privileged material, and that Congress intended to adopt relevant case law on privilege."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">One other critical consideration compels us to adopt this interpretation of Exemption (b)(5). By applying the fact/deliberative process distinction to a work-product privilege case, the district court's decision effectively allows FOIA to be used as a supplement to civil discovery. Not only does this use of FOIA undercut the exemption's apparent function (the exemption on its face seems designed to avoid precisely this possibility), it also runs afoul of the decisions of the Supreme Court, which have "consistently rejected such a reading of FOIA."...&#8197;Ms. Martin was unable to obtain these documents using ordinary civil discovery methods, and FOIA should not be read to alter that result.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Naturally, if the privilege asserted by OSC in this case had been the "deliberative process" executive privilege itself, the district court would have been correct to evaluate the "factual" character of these documents as one factor in its Exemption (b)(5) analysis. But it is the work-product privilege that drives this case, not the deliberative process privilege. The work-product privilege simply does not distinguish between factual and deliberative material....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consequently, we must determine whether these documents fall within the work-product privilege. We find that they do. A clearer case for the application of <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span> is difficult to imagine. In <span class="Italic">Hickman</span> the Supreme Court held that witness statements prepared at the request of an attorney are privileged work product and not subject to discovery unless the discovering party can show the statements are "essential" to her case....&#8197;The Court also held that attorney <span class="Italic">notes</span> taken during witness interviews are, for all practical purposes, <span class="Italic">always</span> privileged....&#8197;Without doubt, these documents would not "normally" and "routinely" be released in civil discovery. We hold, therefore, that they are shielded from disclosure under FOIA by Exemption (b)(5)....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Moving on to the Privacy Act claim for the documents, <span class="Italic">Martin</span> concluded the court had no authority to direct release, 819 F.2d at 1187-88:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Privacy Act Exemption (d)(5) provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nothing in this section shall allow an individual access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 552a(d)(5) (1982). At the outset, we note that this language does not admit of any distinction between "facts" and "deliberative processes."...&#8197;The character of the attorney notes and witness statements...is irrelevant to proper analysis under this provision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Martin's principal argument, however, rests on a different ground. She insists that Exemption (d)(5) does not properly cover documents compiled, as here, in anticipation of administrative, rather than judicial, proceedings. Extending the exemption to such hearings, she asserts, would eviscerate the Privacy Act by insulating a vast array of agency documentation from the Act's disclosure requirements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This objection, although not without an element of truth, founders on the actual language of the exemption. The phrase "civil action or proceeding" plainly encompasses nonjudicial hearings of some kind; to argue otherwise is to make the words "or proceeding" meaningless. Ms. Martin gives us no other reasonable explanation of Congress' intent in enacting this phrase. The core issue, then, is not <span class="Italic">whether</span> documents prepared for administrative hearings can ever come within Exemption (d)(5), but rather <span class="Italic">what sort</span> of administrative proceedings Congress had in mind for such protection.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Martin justifiably raises the alarm against exempting documents reasonably prepared in anticipation of any type of administrative proceeding. If Exemption (d)(5) shielded document prepared for administrative hearings of any sort, the Privacy Act might indeed become a dead letter. Hearings are the bread and butter of many executive agencies, and documents prepared for those hearings comprise an enormous portion of the information Congress intended to make available to concerned individuals under the Privacy Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But OSC does not argue, and this case does not require, that we must interpret Exemption (d)(5) so expansively. We merely must decide whether Congress intended the exemption to shelter documents prepared in anticipation of quasi-judicial hearings of the sort conducted by MSPB. For several reasons, we find that Congress did so intend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the language of the exemption is strong evidence of that intent. By using the phrase "civil action or proceeding," Congress unquestionably intended to protect documents prepared for actions in the district courts. Documents prepared for some types of administrative proceedings also come within this language, although the phrase does not make clear just which. Of all types of administrative hearings, quasi-judicial hearings are most like the formal civil actions Congress clearly and <span class="Italic">specifically</span> intended to protect. MSPB's hearings are adversarial, include discovery proceedings...and are subject to the rules of evidence....&#8197;The functions of this sort of quasi-judicial tribunal track those of the civil courts....&#8197;Moreover, courts of appeals review decisions of the MSPB directly, just as they review district court decisions....&#8197;It is difficult to see any functional reason to distinguish between documents prepared in anticipation of a district court action and those prepared in anticipation of proceedings before MSPB....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1255"></span>Second, appellee's concern notwithstanding, exempting documents prepared in anticipation of quasi-judicial proceedings will not gut the Privacy Act. Quasi-judicial hearings are relatively rare, and the vast majority of agency records will not be associated with them....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the Office of Management and Budget has consistently interpreted Exemption (d)(5) to include documents prepared for quasi-judicial proceedings....&#8197;Although the existence of this interpretation alone would not settle the issue before us, it is worthy of our attention and solicitude....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-09-264.html#sec2-261">OSC File; Executive and Investigative Privileges</a>," for more discussion of the OSC subpoena case.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Not every piece of paper given by a client to an attorney is protected from discovery or production as a result of the attorney-client privilege. The key is the relation between the documents and the representation provided by counsel to client, <span class="Italic">Neal v. DOJ</span>, 120 Fed. Appx. 300, 303 (Fed. Cir. 2004 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The attorney-client privilege "protects the confidentiality of communications between attorney and client made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice." <span class="Italic">Genentech, Inc. v. United States Int'l Trade Comm'n</span>, 122 F.3d 1409, 1415 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Shearing v. Iolab Corp.</span>, 975 F.2d 1541, 1546-47 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In determining whether the privilege applies, "the central inquiry is whether the communication is one that was made by a client to an attorney for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services." <span class="Italic">In re Spalding Sports Worldwide, Inc.</span>, 203 F.3d 800, 805 (Fed. Cir. 2000).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Further explanation of the work-product privilege was provided by the Federal Circuit in a patent infringement case, <span class="Italic">In re Seagate Technology, LLC</span>, 497 F.3d 1360, 1375-76 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An advice of counsel defense asserted to refute a charge of willful infringement may also implicate waiver of work product protection. Again, we are here confronted with whether this waiver extends to trial counsel's work product. We hold that it does not, absent exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The work product doctrine is "designed to balance the needs of the adversary system: promotion of an attorney's preparation in representing a client versus society's general interest in revealing all true and material facts to the resolution of a dispute." <span class="Italic">In re Martin Marietta Corp.</span>, 856 F.2d 619, 624 (4th Cir. 1988). Unlike the attorney-client privilege, which provides absolute protection from disclosure, work product protection is qualified and may be overcome by need and undue hardship. Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 26(b)(3). However, the level of need and hardship required for discovery depends on whether the work product is factual, or the result of mental processes such as plans, strategies, tactics, and impressions, whether memorialized in writing or not. Whereas factual work product can be discovered solely upon a showing of substantial need and undue hardship, mental process work product is afforded even greater, nearly absolute, protection. <span class="Italic">See id.</span>; <span class="Italic">Upjohn Co. v. United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383, 400 (1981); <span class="Italic">Holmgren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.</span>, 976 F.2d 573, 577 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that work product "may be discovered and admitted when mental impressions are <span class="Italic">at issue</span> in a case and the need for the material is compelling"); <span class="Italic">see also Office of Thrift Supervision v. Vinson &#x0026; Elkins, LLP</span>, 124 F.3d 1304, 1307 (D.C. Cir. 1997) ("virtually undiscoverable"). <span class="Italic">But see Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co.</span>, 967 F.2d 980, 984 (4th Cir. 1992) ("'absolutely' immune from discovery").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the attorney-client privilege, however, work product protection may be waived. <span class="Italic">United States v. Nobles</span>, 422 U.S. 225, 239 (1975). Here, the same rationale generally limiting waiver of the attorney-client privilege with trial counsel applies with even greater force to so limiting work product waiver because of the nature of the work product doctrine. Protecting lawyers from broad subject matter of work product disclosure "strengthens the adversary process, and...may ultimately and ideally further the search for the truth." <span class="Italic">Martin Marietta</span>, 856 F.2d at 626; <span class="Italic">accord Echostar</span>, 448 F.3d at 1301 ("[W]ork-product immunity...promotes a fair and efficient adversarial system...."); <span class="Italic">Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep't of Energy</span>, 617 F.2d 854, 864 (D.C. Cir. 1980) ("The purpose of the privilege, however, is not to protect any interest of the attorney...but to protect the adversary trial process itself. It is believed that the integrity of our system would suffer if adversaries were entitled to probe each other's thoughts and plans concerning the case."). In addition, trial counsel's mental processes, which fall within Convolve's discovery requests, enjoy the utmost protection from disclosure; a scope of waiver commensurate with the nature of such heightened protection is appropriate. <span class="Italic">See Martin Marietta</span>, 856 F.2d at 625-26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has approved of narrowly restricting the scope of work product waiver. In <span class="Italic">United States v. Nobles</span>, a criminal case, an accused armed robber presented the testimony of an investigator in an attempt to discredit the two eyewitnesses. When they testified for the prosecution, the defense attorney relied on the investigator's report in cross-examining the eyewitnesses. 422 U.S. at 227. After the prosecution rested, the defense attempted to call the investigator to testify. The trial court, however, ruled that if the investigator testified, his affirmative testimony would mandate disclosure of the portions of his report relating to his testimony. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 229. The Supreme Court agreed that the investigator's affirmative testimony waived work product protection, but it approvingly noted the "quite limited" scope of waiver imposed by the trial court and its refusal to allow a general "fishing expedition" into the defense files or even the investigator's report. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 239-40. Similarly, Convolve has been granted access to the materials relating to Seagate's opinion counsel's opinion, and he was made available for deposition. The extent of this waiver accords with the principles and spirit of <span class="Italic">Nobles</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we hold that, as a general proposition, relying on opinion counsel's work product does not waive work product immunity with respect to trial counsel. Again, we leave open the possibility that situations may arise in which waiver may be extended to trial counsel, such as if a patentee or his counsel engages in chicanery. And, of course, the general principles of work product protection remain in force, so that a party may obtain discovery of work product absent waiver upon a sufficient showing of need and hardship, bearing in mind that a higher burden must be met to obtain that pertaining to mental processes. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 26(b)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the work product doctrine was partially codified in Rule 26(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which applies work product protection to "documents and tangible things." Courts continue to apply <span class="Italic">Hickman v. Taylor</span>, 329 U.S. 495, to "nontangible" work product. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">In re Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig.</span>, 343 F.3d 658, 662-63 (3d Cir. 2003); <span class="Italic">United States v. One Tract of Real Property</span>, 95 F.3d 422, 428 n.10 (6th Cir. 1996). This is relevant here because Convolve sought to depose Seagate's trial counsel. We agree that work product protection remains available to "nontangible" work product under <span class="Italic">Hickman</span>. Otherwise, attorneys' files would be protected from discovery, but attorneys themselves would have no work product objection to depositions.</p>

United States</span>, 449 U.S. 383 (1980) (discussion of attorney work product privilege); <span class="Italic">Mervin v. FTC</span>, 591 F.2d 821 (D.C.
