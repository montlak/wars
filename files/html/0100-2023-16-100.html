<h4 class="h4" id="sec9-99"><span class="space">5.</span> Discrimination; Disparate Treatment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Title VII, ADEA, and Rehabilitation Act defenses are available in performance actions. Employees removed under 5 USC 4303 appeal to the Board under 5 USC 7701, and 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(B) provides that an agency action may not be sustained if it is based upon any prohibited personnel practice described in 5 USC 2302(b). Included within the prohibited personnel practices listed in 2302(b)(1)(D) is discrimination on the basis of a disabling condition pursuant to &#x00A7; 501 of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Newton v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 156, 158 (1985) (action was set aside because the agency did not prove that it considered the appellant for other vacant positions in accordance with its own regulations governing the accommodation of individuals with the disabling condition of alcoholism; its attempts were neither meaningful nor conscientiously pursued); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Siedle v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 35 MSPR 241, 249 n.9 (1987) (Title VII and Rehabilitation Act law were applicable in Chapter 43 cases, but no violation of those statutes was established by the appellant); <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 308, 309 (1984) (EEO affirmative defenses were available in an appeal from a step increase denial); <span class="Italic">Overton v. IRS</span>, 6 MSPR 439, 442, 6 MSPB 373 (1981) (disability discrimination as to a step increase denial). Reprisal defenses are allowable. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Romero v. EEOC</span>, 55 MSPR 527, 537-38 (1992); <span class="Italic">Battaglia v. DHHS</span>, 13 MSPR 183 (1982) (applying a reprisal analysis in an ALOC reconsideration appeal). [Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-089.html#sec12-85">Inappropriate Job Modification; Increased Job Burden</a>"; refer to <a href="0100-2023-19-001.html#sec12-1">Chapter 12</a> for analysis of discrimination.]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Establishment of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in a performance action requires that the employee show three elements: that she is a member of a protected class; that she was the object of an adverse employment action; and that there was a causal relationship between membership in the protected class and the adverse action. <span class="Italic">Nordell v. DHHS</span>, 15 MSPR 276, 286 (1983) (allegations of discrimination and reprisal in a WIGI denial appeal); <span class="Italic">Wermers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 272, 278, 7 MSPB 171 (1981) (Board concurs, through factual analysis, in an EEOC determination that WIGI denial was discriminatory). A bare allegation of discrimination, without supporting evidence, is insufficient to establish even a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Clark v. DHHS</span>, 28 MSPR 143, 146 (1985) (WIGI appeal). There must be a connection between the condition requiring accommodation and the performance problem leading to the appeal. <span class="Italic">Whitney v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 28 MSPR 330, 334-35 (1985) (no evidence that the appellant's performance of duties evaluated in a Chapter 43 case was impaired by multiple sclerosis or that she was regarded by the agency as disabled). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-097.html#sec9-96">Comparison of Employees' Performance</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A disability discrimination defense failed when the agency demonstrated both that the visually disabled employee had performed his job successfully for a period of time, and that neither his disability nor his critical elements changed between the prior satisfactory performance and the subsequent unsatisfactory performance. The agency's proof dispelled the allegation that the appellant's disability caused the later unsuccessful performance. New equipment was provided for him at his request. The appellant was also reassigned to another supervisor, his work location was changed, and he was given less complex assignments and a lighter workload than were assigned to coworkers. <span class="Italic">Conti v. Dept. of Army</span>, 34 MSPR 272, 279 (1987).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision also lacks findings and conclusions with respect to all of the appellant's proposed accommodations for his handicapping condition. The appellant alleged that the agency could reasonably accommodate his handicapping condition by reassigning him to another position or by delaying implementation of the PIP until he received additional counseling that would enable him to perform his duties successfully. Although the initial decision recognized that medical evidence supported the proposition that the appellant could be reasonably accommodated by a reassignment to less stressful duties, including a change to a lower grade, it only discussed the agency's offer of a demotion without including findings on either of the other suggested accommodations....</p>

DHUD</span>, 12 MSPR 607, 611 (1982), assumed the existence of a disabling mental disorder but determined that the agency made reasonable, if unsuccessful, accommodative efforts to assist the appellant with the performance problems that led to his removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that appellant established that he met the definition of handicapped person and that he was a "qualified handicapped person" as defined at 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.702(f), we find that the agency reasonably accommodated him within the meaning of 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704<span class="Italic">. See Stalkfleet v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637 (1981). The record shows that the agency attempted to aid appellant by (1) assigning a training adviser to assist him, and permitting the adviser to spend 459 hours reviewing his work product and attempting to correct his performance deficiencies; (2) restructuring his position by not assigning him "troubled" projects and by reducing his workload by 30%; (3) allowing appellant's unsatisfactory performance to continue for almost two years; and (4) suggesting a downgrade. However, appellant emphatically stated that he would not accept a downgrade, even if a position were available.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that any further attempts at accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1613.704(a). The record reveals that appellant's numerous errors caused various agency employees to divert significant amounts of time in order to correct them and to provide him with intensive remedial training to improve his performance. In view of these circumstances, appellant's removal was proper and promoted the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2969"></span>Another disability defense failed to convince the Board in an appeal from a performance-based removal, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. SSA</span>, 114 MSPR 487, 495-96 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 21-22, 2010 MSPB 155 (2010):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that she had requested as a reasonable accommodation that the agency provide her with a mentor for 8 hours per day during the 120-day OPS period. In fact, the appellant herself testified that this is what she required as an accommodation. Specifically, she testified that the agency should have had the same Lead Technician sit with her for 8 hours per day and mentor her one-on-one in the processing of the forms as she processed each form.<span class="Italic"></span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the administrative judge did not err in finding that the appellant's requested accommodation was not reasonable because it would have, in effect, required the agency to assign two people to perform her work. A reasonable accommodation is intended to allow an employee with the necessary job skills to overcome her disability so as to be able to fully perform the essential functions of her position. <span class="Italic">See Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 13 (2006). Despite the mentor training during the 120-day OPS period, the record reflects that the appellant was, at the end of the OPS period, still making the same errors in processing the CDR forms. Thus, the appellant's asserted accommodation would have required the agency to assign her a full-time mentor to assist her in performing the essential functions of her position on an on-going basis. We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's asserted accommodation was unreasonable and would have negatively affected the agency's ability to conduct business.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's finding that the appellant is not a qualified individual with a disability because she cannot perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation. An agency is not obligated to restructure a position if doing so would entail the removal of the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Henry v.

The appellant's suggested accommodations essentially request that the agency only require her to perform the simplest, most linear duties of her position. Yet, the evidence in the record demonstrates that the appellant could not acceptably perform even the simplest duties within her position description, and it is unclear how the appellant's requested accommodations would allow her to perform these duties successfully. Furthermore, although the appellant might be able to perform some duties of her position if she was placed in a quiet environment and did not have to deal with attorneys or the public as requested, the agency is not required to accommodate her disability by assigning her to limited duties that do not comprise a complete and separate position. <span class="Italic">See Green v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 47 M.S.P.R. 661, 668 (1991). Accordingly, we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that the appellant's suggested accommodations are reasonable or likely to allow her to perform the essential duties of her position successfully.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant suggests no accommodation that will permit the performance standards to be met, the Board is not likely to find disability discrimination through a failure of accommodation, <span class="Italic">Manock v. Dept. of State,</span> PH-0432-13-0293-I-1 (NP 7/23/2015):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that Critical Element 1, Employee Work Commitments and Standards, was an essential function of the appellant's position. The term "essential function" means the fundamental job duties of the position the individual with a disability holds, not including marginal functions. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(1). It includes those duties that are the reasons for which a position exists. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(2)(i); <span class="Italic">see also Clemens,</span> 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 6. Here, the agency presented evidence that the purpose of the Passport Specialist position is to determine the entitlement of applicants for U.S. passports and to facilitate legitimate travel to and from the United States. Thus, the purpose of the position is to perform the function of Critical Element 1, which required the appellant to apply law, regulations, and guidance to determine if applicants were entitled to passports, and efficiently and accurately adjudicate passport applications.[12]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[12]&#x2003;In addition, an employer's judgment is relevant evidence to be considered in determining whether a function is essential. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(3)(i). Here, the fact that the agency designated Critical Element 1 as a critical element demonstrates that the agency considered it to be an essential function. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 430.203 (defining a critical element as a work assignment or responsibility of such importance that unacceptable performance on the element would result in a determination that an employee's overall performance is unacceptable).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the appellant was unable to demonstrate successful performance in both qualitative and quantitative performance standards of Work Commitments 1a and 1c of Critical Element 1 during the PIP. To demonstrate successful performance in Work Commitment 1a, the appellant could make no more than six significant knowledge errors when adjudicating passport applications during the PIP. The agency demonstrated that the appellant made forty-seven significant knowledge errors. Work Commitment 1c specified that, among other things, the appellant was required to adjudicate an average of sixteen to eighteen new passport applications per hour, and an average of thirty-four to thirty-eight renewal passport applications per hour, and set forth maximum rates of certain other types of errors that she could not exceed. The agency established that the appellant adjudicated only an average of 8.78 new passport applications, and 18,41 renewal passport applications, per hour during the PIP, and exceeded the maximum rate of each of the error types addressed under Work Commitment 1c.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As a result, we find that the appellant failed to establish that a reasonable accommodation would have enabled her to satisfy the performance standards in Work Commitments 1a and 1c. The appellant asserts that the agency could have accommodated her by moving batches of passport applications that she was required to adjudicate closer to her desk. However, as discussed above, the appellant's performance was significantly deficient in qualitative, as well as quantitative, aspects of a critical element of her position, and she has not adequately explained how an accommodation would have resolved these deficiencies. To prevail on a claim of disability discrimination, the appellant cannot merely articulate an accommodation, but instead, must prove that the accommodation would enable her to perform the essential duties of her position. <span class="Italic">See Paris</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 331 at &#x00B6; 24. Based upon the evidence that the appellant elected to present on this issue below, we find that she failed to prove that her articulated accommodation would enable her to meet her performance standards.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, this does not end the inquiry of whether the appellant is entitled to an accommodation. She also would be entitled to be considered for reassignment to a vacant funded position for which she was otherwise qualified as a form of reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Gonzalez-Acosta v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 277, &#x00B6; 14 (2010); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(2)(ii), (q). At hearing, the appellant testified that after her unsuccessful performance appraisal in 2010, she asked her supervisor if she could reduce her pay grade to assist her in meeting her production quotas. Yet, the appellant has not established that any vacant, funded positions at a lower pay grade were available. <span class="Italic">See Jackson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 46, 53-54 (1998) (in a disability discrimination claim, the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proving that vacant, funded positions for which she was otherwise qualified were available). Furthermore, she has not presented any evidence regarding the essential duties of a Passport Specialist at a lower pay grade, or that she would have been able to perform those duties, either with or without accommodation. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge correctly determined that the appellant failed to meet her burden of proof on her affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hersko v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, CH-0432-13-0493-I-1 (NP 11/24/2014) ("In addressing the appellant's request that he not be subject to 'hyper-scrutiny,' the administrative judge found that that was not a reasonable accommodation because the appellant was essentially asking the agency to relieve him of working within the prescribed time limits of his performance standards but agencies are not required to alter performance standards as an accommodation and because the very nature of a PIP presumes a heightened scrutiny of an employee's work.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Accommodation should be requested before, not after, the completion of a PIP, since the accommodative responsibility is prospective, not retroactive, <span class="italic">Kotsis v. Dept. of Transp</span>., AT-0432-16-0006-I-1 (NP 8/9/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On review, the appellant does not dispute the administrative judge's finding that he did not request any accommodation prior to completing the PIP period or that he was already on leave for the period of the disallowed sick leave, but argues that the agency improperly denied him a reasonable accommodation because it did not allow him another opportunity to demonstrate effective service. He further argues that the administrative judge erred in failing to determine whether his request for additional time to find effective medication and another opportunity to demonstrate improved performance would have caused the agency undue hardship. For the reasons discussed below, we find no merit to these arguments.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2970"></span>Reasonable accommodation is always prospective; an agency does not have a duty to retroactively excuse an employee's poor performance on the basis of a subsequent request to accommodate a previously unknown disability. See 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12112(b)(5) (defining illegal disability discrimination under the ADAAA to include failing to reasonably accommodate "known physical or mental limitations"); 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.9(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, after the appellant learned that he might be removed for failing the PIP, he requested time to find an effective medication and a second chance to demonstrate acceptable performance once he adjusted to his new medication. However, for the reasons discussed above, a second chance is not a reasonable accommodation as contemplated by the Rehabilitation Act even when, as here, the performance deficiency may be related to the disability. <span class="italic">See, e.g., Dewitt v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company</span>, 845 F.3d 1299, 1316-17 (10th Cir. 2017) (holding that, "[t]he ADAAA does not require employers to accommodate disabled employees by overlooking a past violation of a workplace rule, regardless of whether that violation was caused by the employee's disability[ ]"); <span class="italic">Purcell v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, EEOC Request No. 05970773, 1999 WL 448126, at *1-*2 (June 24, 1999) (finding that an agency was not required to accommodate an employee or retroactively excuse her poor performance on the basis of an after-the-fact request for accommodation). Therefore, as the administrative judge correctly determined, the agency was not obliged to accommodate the appellant by excusing his prior PIP failure and giving him a second chance to demonstrate acceptable performance. Furthermore, the agency need not show that the appellant's requested accommodation would impose an undue hardship because his requested accommodation was not reasonable. <span class="italic">See, e.g., McElwee v. County of Orange</span>,700 F.3d 635, 641 (2d Cir. 2012) (holding that an "accommodation that simply excuses past misconduct is unreasonable as a matter of law[ ]").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review that the agency must "honor [its] invitation to provide reasonable assistance to improve [his] performance" because the EEOC's regulations require the Federal Government to be a "model employer" of individuals with disabilities. As previously discussed, however, the Rehabilitation Act does not require the agency to provide the appellant a second chance to demonstrate improved performance. The fact that the agency invited the appellant to request any reasonable assistance that might help him to improve his performance prospectively, while considering how to deal with his prior unacceptable performance, does not suggest that the agency failed to act as a model employer. To the contrary, the appellant's allegations reflect that the agency complied with its obligations under the Rehabilitation Act to engage in the interactive process to determine an appropriate accommodation after the appellant notified his supervisors of his medical condition and his need for an accommodation. <span class="italic">See Clemens v. Department of the Army</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 616, &#x00B6; 17 (2014) (finding that, even if an appellant had requested a reasonable accommodation, an agency's failure to engage in the interactive process, standing alone, does not violate the Rehabilitation Act); <span class="italic">Simpson</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 16. Therefore, we find no merit to the appellant's argument that the agency failed to act as a model employer, and his argument on review provides no basis to disturb the initial decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant next argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that his request for a reasonable accommodation was too late because, unlike the cases cited in the initial decision wherein the employees were aware of their disability at the time of their alleged misconduct, the appellant was not aware that he was disabled until after the PIP period ended. Thus, he argues that his "request for additional time to demonstrate effective service after he was granted time to address his newly diagnosed disability" was made at the earliest possible time. We find no merit to this argument. As the administrative judge correctly found and as discussed above, the agency was under no legal obligation to ignore or excuse the appellant's unacceptable performance occurring prior to his request for an accommodation. The fact that the appellant lacked a diagnosis until after completing the PIP period does not change this result.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Kimble v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 70 MSPR 617, 621-22 (1996) [discussed in Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-132.html#sec12-128">Firm Choice, Last Chance Agreement</a>"], signaled the demise of the "firm choice" doctrine for alcoholic and drug-impaired employees. While the firm choice doctrine was in effect, some performance cases considered, and accepted, Rehabilitation Act defenses based on alcoholism in performance cases. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Holley v.

[Refer to Chapter 12, "<a href="0100-2023-19-055.html#sec12-53">Rehabilitation Act: Disabling Conditions</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other defenses involve claims of discrimination based on race and age. One appellant claimed that the agency discriminated against him on the basis of race by removing him for unacceptable performance while leaving in place his supervisor who reviewed and approved the work. The agency rebutted any inference of discrimination by showing that the supervisor was counseled as to his supervisory deficiencies, that he was warned that he would receive a poor rating, and that his departure from the agency prevented his demotion. <span class="Italic">Papritz v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 495, 499-500 (1986). Evidence that a supervisor told an appellant that "any claims representative with 20 years' experience should be fired" was insufficient, in itself, to show age discrimination in a performance action. <span class="Italic">Van Patten-Steiger v. DHHS</span>, 29 MSPR 324, 328 (1985) (appeal of Mr. Mouser). An allegation of age discrimination was considered in the Chapter 43 appeal of <span class="Italic">Tripathi v. NASA</span>, DC-0432-14-0612-I-1 (NP 7/28/2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), found at 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 633a(a), Federal sector employees can prove a violation merely by showing that age was a factor in the contested personnel action, even if it was not the "but for" cause. <span class="Italic">See Savage v. Department of the Army</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 40 (2015). Given the statute's sweeping language, it is unnecessary to look for a particular quantum of influence, such as substantial evidence, but rather for the existence of any influence at all. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. This is so because any amount of discrimination tainting a personnel action, even if not substantial, means that the action was not free from any discrimination based on age. <span class="Italic">Wingate v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 118 M.S.P.R. 566, &#x00B6; 7 (2012).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant may establish a violation of the ADEA using direct evidence or any of three types of circumstantial evidence: convincing mosaic, comparator, or pretext. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 42. Direct evidence is evidence that can be interpreted as an acknowledgment of discriminatory intent. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The first kind of circumstantial evidence consists of suspicious timing, ambiguous statements oral or written, behavior toward or comments directed at other employees in the protected group, and other bits and pieces from which an inference of discriminatory intent might be drawn. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Considered together, such bits and pieces may compose a convincing mosaic of discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The second kind of circumstantial evidence is comparator evidence, consisting of evidence, whether or not rigorously statistical, that employees similarly situated to the appellant other than in the characteristic on which an agency is forbidden to base a difference in treatment received systematically better treatment. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The third kind consists of evidence that the agency's stated reason for its action is unworthy of belief, a mere pretext for discrimination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. None of the aforementioned types of evidence, i.e., direct, convincing mosaic, comparator, or pretext, will be needed in every case. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Each type of evidence is sufficient by itself to support a judgment for the appellant; or they can be used together. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an appellant asserts an affirmative defense of discrimination or retaliation under the ADEA, the Board first will inquire whether he has shown by preponderant evidence that the prohibited consideration was a motivating factor in the contested personnel action. <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. Such a showing is sufficient to establish that the agency violated the ADEA, thereby committing a prohibited personnel practice under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Savage</span>, 122 M.S.P.R. 612, &#x00B6; 51. In making an initial showing, an appellant may rely on direct evidence or any of the three types of circumstantial evidence described above, either alone or in combination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If the appellant meets that burden, the Board then will inquire whether the agency has shown by preponderant evidence that the action was not based on the prohibited personnel practice, i.e., that it still would have taken the contested action in the absence of the discriminatory or retaliatory motive. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. If we find that the agency has made that showing, its violation of the ADEA will not require reversal of the action. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant attempted to prove his allegation of age discrimination with the first and second type of circumstantial evidence described above, i.e., ambiguous statements and comparator evidence. The appellant asserts that his supervisor made one or two comments to the appellant suggesting that he retire. He claims that, since January 1, 2009, 11 of 12 proposed removals were issued to employees who were over 50 years of age, and all of those over 50 were removed. He also claims that this evidence shows that the removals for conduct and performance of employees over the age of 50 are disproportionate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree with the administrative judge that the appellant's evidence does not constitute preponderant evidence that his removal constituted discrimination on the basis of his age. As she found, the appellant's claim that his supervisor suggested that the appellant retire, even if true, does not show that the statement was due to the appellant's age, especially given the supervisor's denial that he made such a statement, the evidence that other older employees who continue working within the unit are past the eligibility age to retire, and the detailed performance-related reasons for the appellant's removal. As she also found, the examples of removals submitted by the appellant each cite specific reasons for removal that are independent of age, and the appellant's argument does not include other relevant information to support his assertion, such as the number of employees over 50 at the agency as a whole who were not presented with notices of removal. Further, a newspaper article submitted by the <span id="Page_2971"></span>appellant stating that the agency is seeking younger employees suggests that its workforce is disproportionately older. Therefore, the Board will not disturb an administrative judge's findings when, as here, she considered the evidence as a whole and drew appropriate inferences. <span class="Italic">See Crosby v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 98, 105-06 (1997); <span class="Italic">Broughton v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 357, 359 (1987)....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">As explained above, one way an appellant may establish a discrimination claim is through comparator evidence, or evidence relating to the treatment of similarly situated employees. <span class="italic">See Fox v.

The appellant and her coworker reported to the same first-line supervisor and had the same core competencies and strategic goals. However, as part of their annual performance plans, the supervisor assigned each of them different tasks related to the strategic goals. According to the supervisor, she assigned different tasks to the appellant and her coworker because of the need to divide work amongst her small staff. The administrative judge made no finding as to whether the assignments were the result of discrimination.</p>

In determining whether the agency has afforded the appellant this opportunity, relevant factors include the nature of the duties and responsibilities of the appellant's position, including whether assignments of work were made in a discriminatory manner. <span class="italic">Id</span>.; <span class="italic">see Lee v. Environmental Protection Agency</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 533, &#x00B6; 43 (2010) (considering in a chapter 43 action the appellant's allegations of national origin discrimination that non-Chinese employees in the appellant's position were not required to perform the same types of assignments as the appellant).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that as an employee in the same position, assigned work by the same supervisor and subject to the same general standards governing performance, the appellant's coworker was similarly situated to the appellant for purposes of determining whether the tasks assigned to the appellant during the PIP period were the product of discrimination.[6]...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;On remand, the administrative judge is not required to address the appellant's argument that "another [unidentified] agency employee" who reported to a different supervisor and allegedly was on a PIP "could have been a comparator." <span class="italic">See Fox</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 529, &#x00B6; 37 (finding that employees that reported to different supervisors were not similarly situated to the appellant).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Age discrimination was rejected as a defense in the Chapter 43 case of <span class="Italic">O'Hearn v. GSA</span>, 41 MSPR 280, 286 (1989), determining that the replacement of an older employee by a younger worker does not raise the same inference of improper motive that attends the replacement of a black employee by a white person in a Title VII case, and concluding that other evidence, including statistical information, presented by the appellant did not establish a link between his age and his removal:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, while his immediate supervisor was 37 years old, both the proposing and deciding officials were in their early 50's, and all of the employees hired since the appellant's removal were in the protected age group, four in their early 40's and one in his late 40's. The agency cites <span class="Italic">Kelly v. American Standard, Inc.,</span> 640 F.2d 974, 980 (9th Cir. 1981), to show that "simply the replacement of an older employee by a younger worker does not raise the same inference of improper motive that attends replacement of a black by a white person in a Title VII case." We agree that such age comparisons alone are insufficient to establish an inference of age discrimination. <span class="Italic">See also Marshall</span> <span class="Italic">v. Goodyear Tire &#x0026; Rubber Co.,</span> 554 F.2d 730, 736 (5th Cir. 1977). Here, the appellant has presented no other evidence to establish a link between his age and his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Anthony v. SSA</span>, PH-0432-15-0405-I-1 (NP 7/28/2016) (PIP-based failure of training scheme: "The administrative judge found, moreover, that the agency applied the same objective performance measures to all trainees and did not discriminate in deciding who passed and who failed the Benefit Authorizer training. The administrative judge determined that the appellant did not claim, and there was no evidence to suggest, that the agency applied those standards more rigorously when assessing older female trainees or that it intentionally failed those trainees despite having met the standard. The administrative judge further found that the appellant admitted that she was unable to meet the required standard of processing at least five cases a day with a required minimum accuracy rate.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Goodwin v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 75 MSPR 204, 209-10 (1997), considered how the Board would evaluate claims of discrimination stemming from allegations of dissimilar treatment of comparable employees:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claims that the AJ erred in finding that she did not prove her claim of discrimination. The AJ found that the agency's proof on the merits of its charge constituted a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moultrie v. Department of the Navy,</span> 65 MSPR 153, 160 (1994) (the agency's presentation of evidence to support its charges suffices to meet its burden to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason). The AJ further found that the appellant presented no persuasive evidence of pretext. In this regard, the AJ found that the appellant and a Caucasian employee who also reported to the appellant's supervisor, received an unacceptable performance rating, but accepted a voluntary downgrade and was not placed on a PIP, were not similarly situated because they held completely different positions, and their duties and responsibilities and relative levels of performance could not be fairly compared. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green</span>, 411 U.S. 792, 804, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1825, 36 L. Ed.2d 668 (1973) (evidence relevant to a showing of pretext includes evidence that an employee of a different race engaged in acts of comparable seriousness but was nevertheless retained). The appellant claims that this finding was error because there was only one CPO at Minot AFB, and she could never have identified a comparative employee under the AJ's reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In order for comparative employees to be considered similarly situated, all relevant aspects of the appellant's employment situation must be nearly identical to those of the comparative employee. <span class="Italic">See Richard v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 MSPR 146, 153 (1995). Among other things, comparative employees must have had performance deficiencies similar to the appellant's, without differentiating or mitigating circumstances that would distinguish their performance deficiencies or the appropriate discipline for such deficiencies. <span class="Italic">See id.; Meyers v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</span>, 45 MSPR 488, 492 (1990) (there was no finding of discrimination where the appellant did not show that the performance deficiencies of the comparative employees were comparable to his own performance deficiencies). Here, the fact that the appellant and the comparative employee occupied different positions was not a sufficient basis for finding them not similarly situated. Both employees occupied the same type of position, namely, supervisory Flight Chiefs, and reported to the same supervisor. The appellant was the Flight Chief for the Civilian Personnel Office, while the comparative employee was the Flight Chief for the Family Support Center. The mere fact that their duties and responsibilities may have been different is not a "relevant" aspect of their employment situation for purposes of the discrimination claim raised in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we find that the AJ's error does not warrant reversal of the initial decision because the appellant and the comparative employee were not similarly situated for another reason. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Panter v. Dept. of the Air Force,</span> 22 MSPR 281, 282 (1984) (an adjudicatory error that is not prejudicial to a party's substantive rights provides no basis for reversal of an initial decision). The appellant's supervisor testified that he did not put the comparative employee on a PIP because she recognized her performance problems, cooperated in trying to solve them, and eventually accepted a voluntary downgrade. By contrast, the appellant's reaction to any attempt by her supervisor to improve her performance was the exact opposite. We find that this constitutes a differentiating or mitigating circumstance that distinguishes the appellant from the comparative employee<span class="Italic">. See Stokes v. Department of Agric.</span>, 9 MSPB 22, 9 MSPR 372, 375-76 (1982) (any disparity in treatment resulted from a difference in conduct after both employees were given an opportunity to resolve problems that their supervisor found with the travel vouchers they submitted, rather than from racial discrimination). Therefore, the appellant did not show that she and the comparative employee were similarly situated, the appellant's claim of pretext must fail, and the appellant has not proven her affirmative defense of discrimination by preponderant evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board reviews allegations that an agency's choice of a particular Chapter 43 action results from disparate treatment only if there is an assertion that the agency action constitutes prohibited discrimination or other prohibited personnel practices under 5 USC 2302. <span class="Italic">Buggie v. DHHS</span>, 27 MSPR 109, 111 (1985), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Rutz v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 28 MSPR 677, 680 (1985). <span class="Italic">Landon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 27 MSPR 374, 377-78 (1985), extended <span class="Italic">Buggie</span>, declining to credit a claim of disparate treatment of two substandard performers:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the presiding official erred in finding disparate treatment and in mitigating the removal. Appellant had alleged that the agency <span id="Page_2972"></span>imposed disparate penalties in removing her while demoting another employee similarly situated. She contended that the agency therefore committed a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6), which prohibits the agency from "grant[ing] any preference or advantage not authorized by law, rule, or regulation to any employee or applicant for employment...for the purpose of improving or injuring the prospects of any particular person for employment."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Buggie v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 27 MSPR 109, 111 (1985), the Board held that it lacks authority to review allegations of disparate treatment in an agency's selection of a 5 USC Chapter 43 action where those allegations are not based on prohibited discrimination or a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302. However, the Board expressly reserved judgment on whether allegations of disparate treatment based on prohibited personnel practice should be considered in this regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, insufficient evidence here to establish a prohibited personnel practice under 5 USC &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6). That section contemplates that the difference in treatment be conferred for the specific purpose of injuring one employee's prospects for employment and for improving those of another. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baum v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 13 MSPB 74, 75, 14 MSPR [392] (1983); <span class="Italic">Price v. Department of the Army</span>, 12 MSPB 319, 321, 14 MSPR 161, 163-64 (1982). The record does not establish the existence of this type of 'purposefulness.' Rather, the record shows that the agency's suggestions that appellant request a voluntary demotion resulted from attempts by the agency, in collaboration with appellant and her union representative, to reach a satisfactory solution to appellant's performance problems. Appellant failed to accept either of the two positions she was offered by the agency, and the agency presented testimony showing that, by the time of appellant's removal, both positions had been filled. Thus, we find that the agency showed a legitimate reason for the difference in treatment of both employees and that the disparate penalties were not based on a prohibited personnel practice. <span class="Italic">See Bivens v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, 8 MSPB 139, 142, 8 MSPR 458, 463 (1981). Moreover, we find that the presiding official erred in finding that the agency was required to show the reasonableness of the action taken and in considering appellant's dissatisfaction with her new assignment as a mitigating factor. <span class="Italic">See Lisiecki v. Federal</span> <span class="Italic">Home Loan Bank,</span> 23 MSPR 633, 645 (1984).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">It will be difficult to prove discriminatory intent in the course of Board litigation. Another course may be to defend on the basis of 5 USC 2302(b)(10), making it a prohibited personnel practice to discriminate for or against an employee on the basis of conduct that does not adversely affect the employee's performance. Because in some cases the supervisor uses a performance-based action to rid himself of an employee he finds personally offensive, the real basis for the removal is personal conduct of the appellant rather than job performance. The discrimination could be established if it can be shown that someone else who produces no better work under the same or similar standards is retained while the appellant is removed or demoted. [Refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-100.html#sec9-99">Discrimination; Disparate Treatment</a>," under "<a href="0100-2023-15-157.html#sec8-156">Defenses</a>"; refer to Chapter 10, "<a href="0100-2023-17-104.html#sec10-105">RIF as Adverse Action</a>"; refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-16-097.html#sec9-96">Comparison of Employees' Performance</a>"; refer to Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-299.html#sec8-302">Comparative Performance</a>" and "<a href="0100-2023-15-290.html#sec8-288">Performance</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant who defends a performance-based case by alleging discrimination or improper motivation may open the case up to management's proof of difficulties with the employee that go beyond the scope of the charges. <span class="Italic">Taggart v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 59, 60-61, 5 MSPB 134 (1981), a performance case prosecuted as an adverse action under Chapter 75, noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find no error in the presiding official's admission into evidence of testimony regarding incidents other than those outlined in the agency's notice of proposed removal. The admission of such testimony was required due to the appellant's affirmative defense that his removal was motivated by "personal vendetta." Our review of the record and the initial decision clearly indicates that the presiding official's determinations regarding the agency charges were based solely upon evidence relating to those charges.</p>
