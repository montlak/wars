<h4 class="h4" id="sec17-80"><span class="space">3.</span> Decisional Standards for Arbitrator</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Arbitrators deciding adverse actions must adhere to the Reform Act and follow Board law. 5 USC 7121(e)(2). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 105 S. Ct. 2882 (1985), <span class="Italic">post.</span> The Federal Circuit generally reviews an arbitrator's decision in a personnel case under the same standards of review that govern MSPB appeals. <span class="Italic">Hunt v. DHHS</span>, 758 F.2d 608, 611 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citing <span class="Italic">Grigsby v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 729 F.2d 772 (Fed. Cir. 1984)). This is an interesting situation. Most arbitrators, particularly those whose background is in the private sector, adjudicate discharge and suspension cases under what is known as a "just cause" standard. This standard basically embraces the arbitrator's notion of what is right and wrong coupled with practices in the industry and shop where the grievant is employed. It takes into account an employer's disciplinary guidelines, and considers the seriousness of the offense and the past record of the employee. Over the years the result has been that, given an employee with a good record, arbitrators are reluctant to sustain discharges for first offenses, generally preferring a pattern of progressive discipline. The Board's experience is the opposite: given the deference defined in <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, the Board sustains most adverse actions and mitigates few penalties. Arbitration is the choice of those who have access to a contractual grievance procedure, who understand the system, and who have the means to finance the process. [Refer to Broida's, <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Sector Arbitration Law</span> (<a href="https://deweypub.com/store/21POA.html">Dewey Publications, Inc</a>. 2023).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The standard of review by the Federal Circuit of an arbitrator's award was described, <span class="Italic">Eilers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 415 Fed. Appx. 234, 237-38 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This court reviews the decision of an arbitrator in a federal employment dispute under the same standard as if the dispute was decided by the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 412 F.3d at 1263-64. We must affirm the decision of an arbitrator unless it was "(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c). "[T]he standard is not what the court would decide in a <span class="Italic">de novo</span> appraisal, but whether the administrative determination is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole." <span class="Italic">Parker v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1115 (Fed. Cir. 1987). "Substantial evidence is 'such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'" <span class="Italic">McEntee v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 404 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (quoting <span class="Italic">Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 305 U.S. 197, 229 (1938)). In addition, a "presiding official's credibility determinations...are virtually unreviewable." <span class="Italic">Hambsch v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The review standard was restated, <span class="Italic">Muller v. GPO</span>, 809 F.3d 1375, 1378-79 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(e)(1), part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ("CSRA"), a federal employee seeking to challenge disciplinary action by his employing agency may appeal his claim to the MSPB or, alternatively, take his claim to an independent arbitrator under a negotiated grievance procedure created by collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator's decision is reviewed by this court under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f). Section 7121(f) establishes that arbitrations of such grievances are reviewed under the same standard of review that applies to appeals from decisions of the MSPB. The statute provides that, "[i]n matters covered under sections 4303 and 7512 of this title which have been raised under the negotiated grievance procedure in accordance with this section, section 7703 of this title...shall apply to the award of an arbitrator in the same manner and under the same conditions as if the matter had been decided by the Board." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7121(f); <span class="Italic">see also Cornelius v.

Mr. Muller's claim arises under &#x00A7; 7512, as it concerns a reduction in grade and a reduction in pay, so &#x00A7; 7703 applies here. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512(3), (4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 7703(c) requires this court to set aside "any agency action, findings, or conclusions found to be (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7703(c); <span class="Italic">see also Appleberry v.

This difference, with substantially less deference granted to arbitrations of the grievances of federal employees, is consistent with the purpose of the CSRA, which created arbitration defined by collective bargaining agreement as a parallel alternative to dispute resolution at the MSPB.

<p class="Body-Text">Disagreement among courts regarding the degree that Board precedent and procedural law govern arbitrators was addressed by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 105 S. Ct. 2882 (1985). The issue involved application of the harmful error rule encompassed in 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), i.e., whether the statutory standard applied by the MSPB is also applicable in arbitration of adverse action cases litigated by unions arguing that they, rather than an appellant, have been harmed by a violation of a collective bargaining contract. The Court concluded that if the employee and the union invoke arbitration, the arbitrator should apply the same substantive standards that the Board would apply if the case had been appealed to the Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7121(e)(2). This means that the harmful error rule is incorporated by reference into arbitration cases involving adverse actions or performance-based removals or downgradings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span> involved review of disciplinary action against two employees of the Federal Protective Service. They edited tape recordings of their activity reports to avoid revealing that one of the employees purchased beer for the other employee, a supervisor, who drank it while on duty. During interviews, the two employees provided incriminating statements without the benefit of a warning from the employer--required by the contract--that they had the right to have a union representative present during the interviews. The two men were removed. Their cases were heard by an arbitrator who found that although there was cause for discharge, the employer violated two provisions of the contract between the union and the employer: first, the employer failed to provide the employees an opportunity to have a union representative present; second, the employer exceeded the time permitted by the contract for initiation of the actions. Although the arbitrator concluded that there was no prejudice to the employees as a result of the failure to have a union representative present or because of the delay in issuance of the notices of proposed adverse action, he found that the contract violations warranted mitigation of the removals to suspensions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On appeal by OPM, the Federal Circuit decided that although the arbitrator was bound to follow the statutory harmful error rule, he could use mitigation to penalize the agency for contract violations. <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>, 718 F.2d 1048, 1053-54 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that because the law did not define harmful error, the Board's definition, at 5 CFR 1201.56(c)(3) [now 5 CFR 1201.4(r) (2022)], was entitled to deference. As interpreted by the Court, the rule required the harmful error to affect the employee, not the union. The Court declared as to the union's argument that the arbitrator should have the authority to consider significant violations of union contractual rights in an adverse action case, <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 105 S. Ct. at 2889:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Congress clearly intended that an arbitrator would apply the same substantive rules as the Board does in reviewing an agency disciplinary decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Adoption of respondents' interpretation of the harmful error rule in the context of an arbitral proceeding would directly contravene this clear congressional intent. An employee who elects to appeal an agency disciplinary decision to the Board must prove that any procedural errors substantially prejudiced his rights by possibly affecting the agency's decision....&#8197;If respondent's interpretation of the harmful-error rule as applied in the arbitral context were to be sustained, an employee with a claim that the agency violated procedures guaranteed by the collective-bargaining agreement would tend to select the forum--the grievance and arbitration procedures--that treats his claim more favorably. The result would be the very inconsistency and forum shopping that Congress sought to avoid.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We, however, do not rest our decision solely on deference to the Board's interpretation of the harmful-error rule and on the clear congressional intent that an arbitrator apply the same substantive standards as does the Board. Rather, we rest our decision ultimately on the conclusion that we must interpret the harmful-error rule as does the Board if we are "'to remain faithful to the central congressional purposes underlying the enactment of the CSRA.'" <span class="Italic">Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 470 U.S. 768, 794 (1985), <span class="Italic">quoting Devine v. White</span>, 225 U.S. App. D.C., at 183, 697 F.2d, at 425. As noted above, one of the major purposes of the Act was to "preserv[e] the ability of federal managers to maintain 'an effective and efficient Government.'" <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S., at 92, quoting 5 U.S.C. 7101(b). In order to achieve this purpose, one of the "central tasks" of the Act was to "[a]llow civil servants to be able to be hired and fired more easily, but for the right reasons. "S. Rep. No. 95-969, p. 4 (1978). In particular, the provisions of 7701 of the Act, including the harmful-error rule, were intended "to give agencies greater ability to remove or discipline expeditiously employees who engage in misconduct, or whose work performance is unacceptable." [472 U.S. 648; 663] <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 51. In the present case, the grievants concededly committed improper acts that justified their removal from the federal service. Although the agency committed procedural errors, whose errors do not cast doubt upon the reliability of the agency's factfinding or decision. We do not believe that Congress intended to force the Government to retain these erring employees solely in order to "penalize the agency" for nonprejudicial procedural mistakes it committed while attempting to carry out the congressional purpose of maintaining an effective and efficient Government.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span> discounted union arguments that the result reached by the arbitrator was necessary if negotiated procedural protections were to be of significance. First, the Court determined that if a violation of the procedural right prejudiced the employee, the discipline would be reversed. Second, the Court stated that the union may file its own grievance (or pursue the issue in the employee's grievance) concerning procedural violations, and the arbitrator may remedy the situation through a cease and desist order. The union may file an unfair labor practice charge over a patent violation of the contract without running afoul of 5 USC 7116(d), requiring that issues that can be raised under appeals procedures may be raised there or as ULPs in most instances, but not in both forums.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit honors <span class="Italic">Cornelius v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Concededly <span class="Italic">Grace</span> addresses judicial enforcement of private arbitration and Gonce and Riley have a statutory right of judicial review, but it is pertinent to the proposition that courts should respect arbitral awards based on agreements both parties bargained for....&#8197;Like the second arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Grace</span>, the arbitrators here came to a conclusion about the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement different from those who decided the issue earlier. But that in and of itself is not any reason for us to question it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Courts should be careful not to "judicialize" the arbitration process. Arbitration normally envisions that each case be decided on its own under the controlling contract without undue reliance on other arbitration awards, even if the facts and circumstances are close. Arbitrators are expected to bring their best independent judgment to bear, not to ritualistically follow what others have done, especially, as here, when they suspect an error was earlier committed. It is one thing to bind the parties by estoppel when the same facts have already been resolved by an earlier forum of competent authority...; it is quite another to bind them when there is not precise correspondence of facts, circumstances, and timing, as here.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Decisions reviewing arbitration awards prior to <span class="Italic">Nutt</span> suggested considerable deference to arbitrators' judgments in civil service cases. In <span class="Italic">Long v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 751 F.2d 339, 347-48 (10th Cir. 1984), the court cited with approval <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 438 (D.C.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit is not deferential to arbitrators' interpretations of collective bargaining agreements. Considering interpretation of a contractual provision of what constituted the proper filing time for a grievance challenging an adverse action, <span class="Italic">Huey v.

Although the result in <span class="Italic">Huey</span> may have favored the employee, the reasoning of the decision was a departure of customary deference shown to arbitrators' contract interpretations. Labor contracts occupy a special place in our jurisprudence. Supreme Court decisions, principally the <span class="Italic">Steelworkers</span> trilogy (<span class="Italic">United Steelworkers v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">As to an arbitrator's authority to make awards under a collective <span id="Page_5295"></span>bargaining agreement, this court held in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span> that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]lthough the arbitrator is free to make an award consonant with the scope of the collective bargaining agreement, he must not issue awards that conflict with "external law" such as federal statutes and regulations (citations omitted). 718 F.2d at 1055.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Arbitrator Brisco's decision contravened these principles.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When Congress enacted the harmful error rule of 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A), it intended to change the standard of appellate review to avoid unnecessary reversal of agency actions because of technical procedural oversights. S. Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 54, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2723, 2776. By ruling that parties to a collective bargaining agreement could exclude the harmful error rule from the agreement, Arbitrator Brisco effectively and erroneously concluded that INS and AFGE had authority to abrogate a provision of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the Congressionally-established standard of review, the MSPB must sustain an agency decision "supported by a preponderance of the evidence," 5 USC 7701(c)(1)(B), unless the employee shows, among other things, harmful error in the agency's decision-making procedures, 5 USC 7701(c)(2)(A). <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d 421, 441 (D.C. Cir. 1983). Arbitrators are required to follow this rule by 5 USC 7121(e)(2) (1982). <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>, 718 F.2d at 1054. The harmful error rule is not, however, limited in applicability to situations where employees are prejudiced, but extends to instances where a union can show violations tantamount to harmful error to itself. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1055. Accordingly, we hold that Arbitrator Brisco's decision to overturn Parrish's suspension for insubordination without requiring Parrish or AFGE to show harmful error was not in accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The harmful error rule can appropriately be regarded as part of the "'standard of proof' (if not of the burden of proof itself)," and, therefore, must be applied by the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>, 718 F.2d at 1054. If this court were to sustain Arbitrator Brisco's decision, the lower standard (or burden) of proof required by him compared to that required by the MSPB would promote inconsistency and forum shopping, contrary to Congressional intent. H.R. Rep. No. 1717, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 157, <span class="Italic">reprinted in</span> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. &#x0026; Ad. News 2891.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no contention that Parrish was prejudiced by INS's delay in advising him of its proposed disciplinary action. In its brief, AFGE even asserts that Arbitrator Brisco's award is similar to that in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>, because there was no prejudice to the individual grievant in either case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">AFGE does, however, argue that INS's delay in giving Parrish notice of the proposed disciplinary action harmed AFGE in the same way that the union was harmed by a similar delay in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>. However, the facts of the present case are distinguishable from those in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>, where the union argued to the arbitrator that the agency's failure to comply with the notification time limitations of the collective bargaining agreement and its failure to promptly supply requested information interfered with the union's preparation for hearings and resulted in the filing of additional unfair labor practice charges. Because the agency failed to comply with these provisions of the agreement, the arbitrator mitigated the agency-imposed penalties even though he found that the grievants were not personally prejudiced. In this case, however, there is no indication in the record that AFGE presented any evidence to Arbitrator Brisco that it was harmed by INS's delay in giving notice to Parrish; further, AFGE's post-hearing brief makes no assertion that AFGE was harmed by the delay. In the absence of a showing of harm to AFGE, we are, in effect, asked to assume the existence of harmful error, because timely notice is lacking here as it was in <span class="Italic">Devine v. Nutt</span>. However, a mere conjectural possibility of prejudice cannot suffice as a basis for inferring actual prejudice. <span class="Italic">Devine v. White</span>, 697 F.2d at 442. Moreover, since the issue of harm to the union was not raised before Arbitrator Brisco, it cannot now be raised for the first time on appeal....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In view of the foregoing, Arbitrator Brisco's decision overturning the 30-day suspension for insubordination is reversed.[10]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[10]&#x2003;We decline to grant AFGE's request made at oral argument to vacate and remand for further proceedings, because AFGE already had the opportunity to present evidence of harmful error to Arbitrator Brisco and failed to do so.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, 724 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed. Cir. 1983), suggested that an arbitrator need not apply Board standards governing mitigation. The circuit observed that although an arbitrator should apply the same substantive rules as the Board in reviewing agency action under CSRA, the arbitrator will not necessarily be required to adhere to particular decisions of the Board; it is the result that counts. The same conclusion was reached as to nexus determinations. Arbitrators' decisions will not be reversed on the premise that the Board might have drawn a different conclusion from the evidence. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Horner v. Hardy and AFGE Local 1395</span> (Fed. Cir. 1987 NP No. 87-3125) (citing <span class="Italic">Devine v. NTEU</span>, 737 F.2d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1984), and <span class="Italic">Devine v. Sutermeister</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>). In the D.C. Circuit, <span class="Italic">Devine v. Pastore</span>, 732 F.2d 213 (D.C. Cir. 1984), determined that arbitrators must consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors in disciplinary actions. This means the arbitrator cannot make his own assessment of a penalty; rather, the arbitrator must defer to the agency penalty selection in the same manner that the Board does. The court held that the result was compelled by 5 USC 7121(e)(2) of the Reform Act, directing arbitrators to apply the standard applied by the MSPB, 5 USC 7701(c)(1).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The notion that arbitrators should apply Reform Act law to cases before them does not mean that arbitrators completely forego the traditions of their profession when adjudicating federal personnel cases. Arbitrators bring their own style to the adjudication. They need not parrot the language of the Reform Act to demonstrate that their decisions are consistent with the statute. It is sufficient that their decisions are not inconsistent with the legislation. <span class="Italic">Long v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 751 F.2d 339, 346 (10th Cir. 1984). The court's scope of review of arbitrators' decisions is necessarily circumscribed by general policy considerations favoring the resolution of labor disputes through arbitration and the resulting deference traditionally accorded arbitral awards. Only if the arbitrator's decision conflicts with provisions of external law, i.e., statutes or regulations, will a court upset that decision. Awards that are common in arbitration, e.g., reinstatement without back pay, are accepted by the court even though the same remedy would not likely be selected by the Board. <span class="Italic">Linville v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-587) (affirming an award that reinstated the appellant without back pay when the appellant initially presented his principal arguments in favor of mitigation to the arbitrator rather than to the oral reply officer of the agency); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Bigelow v. DHHS</span>, 750 F.2d 962, 964-66 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (suspensions were sustained by an arbitrator, who ordered two employees reinstated, but without back pay; considering the appeals from an arbitrator's award on the same substantive grounds as if the case had come from the MSPB). The Board disapproves of time-served suspensions, and on review of arbitrators' awards may modify those penalty determinations. [Refer to Chapter 5, "<a href="0100-2023-12-263.html#sec5-262">Penalty, Time-Served Suspension; Remedy</a>," and refer to Chapter 7, "<a href="0100-2023-14-033.html#sec7-34">General Considerations</a>" under "<a href="0100-2023-14-032.html#sec7-33">Mitigation or Aggravation of Penalties</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even if the arbitrator uses the wrong standard of proof in an adverse action case, it is the substance, rather than the form, that guides the court's evaluation of the award. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. VA</span>, 412 F.3d 1258 (Fed. Cir. 2005). <span class="Italic">Corkery v. DHS</span>, 674 Fed. Appx. 990, 994 (Fed. Cir. 2017 NP), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the outset, Corkery argues that the arbitrator failed to cite to a legal standard in his decision, or alternatively, that the arbitrator failed to apply the correct standard in making his determination. But it is substance, rather than form, which guides our review of arbitrators' decisions. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 412 F.3d 1258, 1264 (Fed. Cir. 2005); <span class="Italic">see Girani v. Fed. Aviation Admin</span>., 924 F.2d 237, 242 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Wissman v. Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 848 F.2d 176, 178 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Further, the arbitrator identified the legal standard when he stated that "the Agency proved by <span class="Italic">preponderant evidence</span> that Corkery was not fit for duty as a BPA. Corkery was removed for just and sufficient cause. His removal promoted the efficiency of the service."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Arbitrators may write awards that are shorter or longer than decisions issued by the Board. Some arbitrators address the result (grievance sustained, grievance denied) rather than the process leading to the result. This does not mean that their decisions are less thoughtfully arrived at than Board decisions. The arbitrator is assumed to be impartial, knowledgeable, and considerate of the parties' positions, assumptions that permit shorter opinions than those of the MSPB--an adjudicator that some expect to write elaborate opinions to justify the result and to sustain the parties' trust. An arbitrator is under no duty to set out specific findings of fact to support an award unless there is a requirement to do so in the negotiated agreement. <span class="Italic">Gonce v. VA</span>, 872 F.2d 995, 999 (Fed. Cir. 1989). A short arbitration award was approved despite an attack on its brief treatment of a mitigation issue in <span class="Italic">Hunt v. DHHS</span>, 758 F.2d 608, 609 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (affirming an award in a discharge case, but noting that "The sparse opinion of the arbitrator does not articulate the details, which, by comparison, we have come to expect when reviewing an opinion of the Merit Systems Protection Board."). It was sufficient that an arbitrator found a removal decision "clearly reasonable" rather than reciting statutory language calling for removals to promote the efficiency of the service. <span class="Italic">Girani v. FAA</span>, 924 F.2d 237, 242 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (also stating that "[n]othing in the statute compels arbitrators to make an explicit finding that an agency's decision is supported by a preponderance of the evidence").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an arbitrator's award is written so that it cannot be determined what charges are or are not sustained, the case will be remanded for a more complete statement. <span class="Italic">AFGE and Purdie v. Defense Gen. Supply Ctr.</span> (Fed. Cir. 1988 NP No. 87-3458). This caution in mind, however, <span class="Italic">Wissman v. SSA</span>, 848 F.2d 176, 178 (Fed. Cir. 1988), affirmed an arbitrator's award challenged for lack of specific factual findings in a Chapter 43 performance case:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Wissman's contention that the arbitrator should have made specific findings of fact for each incident of unacceptable performance supporting his removal is unsound. The only procedures an arbitrator must follow are those specified in the collective bargaining agreement, in the submission of the parties to the arbitrator, or required by statute. Otherwise, the arbitrator and the parties may agree on the procedures <span id="Page_5296"></span>and the manner of reporting the award. If there is no contractual or statutory obligation, an arbitrator is not required to set forth findings of fact....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The collective bargaining agreement does not require the arbitrator to make findings of fact. The article governing the arbitration procedure merely provides that "the procedures used to conduct the arbitration shall be determined by the arbitrator," and the "arbitrator's decision shall be final and binding." According to this article, the award need not even be in writing....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Nothing in the CSRA...suggests...a procedural right to a specific form of an arbitration award. To be sure, in cases about removal for unacceptable performance, arbitrators must follow the same "substantive rules" as the board, including its regulatory interpretations....&#8197;But the "substantive rules" to which <span class="Italic">Cornelius</span> pertains are matters like the standard of review for substantial evidence and the harmful error rule....&#8197;But this has nothing to do with rules of practice and procedure which the board may implement for its own internal purposes....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Webb v. Federal Bureau of Prisons</span>, 269 Fed. Appx. 977, 979 (Fed. Cir. 2008 NP), noted the decisional leeway granted to arbitrators:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, Webb argues that the Arbitrator's decision denying his grievance should be vacated for failure to comply with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1). Section 1201.111(b)(1) is a Board regulation which requires that an administrative judge's initial decision must contain "[f]indings of fact and conclusions of law upon all the material issues of fact and law presented on the record." Because &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1) only applies to the form of the initial decision, it is neither a substantive regulation nor a condition of an appeal, but rather an internal procedural regulation of the Board. Accordingly, the Arbitrator was not bound to comply with &#x00A7; 1201.111(b)(1). <span class="Italic">See Bloomer</span>, 966 F.2d at 1439; <span class="Italic">see also Wissman</span>, 848 F.2d at 178 (holding that, absent a contractual or statutory obligation, an arbitrator is not required to set forth an arbitration award in a specific form).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit affirmed an arbitrator in a performance-based case joined with an affirmative defense of whistleblowing reprisal when the arbitrator apparently provided but brief discussion of the reprisal claim, <span class="Italic">Ince v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 2000 NP No. 99-3161):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator stated that Mr. Ince's removal was based solely on his poor job performance "regardless of the questionable matter of alleged 'whistleblowing.'" The arbitrator's statement, while not setting out the legal issues, standards, and findings in detail, does show that the arbitrator considered Mr. Ince's whistleblowing claim, and the arbitrator's characterization of the whistleblower claim as "questionable" is supported by substantial evidence in the record provided. The asserted protected disclosures by Mr. Ince consisted of (1) a 1994 disclosure to the Occupational Health and Safety Administration regarding safety violations with respect to certain electrical installations; and (2) a 1997 disclosure regarding safety hazards created by the installation of electricity to a pump station. The detection and correction of these problems, to the extent that they existed, was within the scope of Mr. Ince's duties as an employee. The arbitrator's decision is consistent with the understanding that the Whistleblower Protection Act should not protect an employee who blows the whistle on his own inadequacies. <span class="Italic">See Marano</span> v. <span class="Italic">Department of Justice</span>, 2 F.3d 1137, 1142 n.5 (Fed. Cir. 1993); 135 Cong. Rec. 5033 (1989) ("[The WPA] will not shield employees who engage in wrongful conduct merely because they have at some point 'blown the whistle.'").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arbitrator's conclusion that the Army removed Mr. Ince "based solely on redundant instances of poor, or willfully negative, job performance" is not disputed by Mr. Ince. Since the arbitrator found that the personnel action was supported on its merits, the arbitrator was not required to elaborate on the other claims. <span class="Italic">See Girani v. Federal Aviation</span> <span class="Italic">Admin.</span>, 924 F.2d 237, 242 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (requiring detailed arbitration findings on all issues would be contrary to arbitration's role as a faster, cheaper, and less formal alternative to litigation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Segura v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3616) (sufficient for the arbitrator to find that "one must conclude that the Grievant committed the misconduct charged"); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Smith-Nwagwu v. VA</span>, 446 Fed. Appx. 294, 298 (Fed.
