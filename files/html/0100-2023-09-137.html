<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-135"><span class="space">c.</span> Reduction in Force Appeal</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board extended the anti-abatement benefits of &#x00A7; 7701(j) to RIF appeals in <span class="Italic">Pugh v. Defense Commissary Agency</span>, 65 MSPR 6, 7-10 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On April 3, 1993, the agency separated the appellant by reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures from the position of Sales Store Clerk, and he timely petitioned for appeal from that action. The agency subsequently moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, contending that the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had approved the appellant's disability retirement application on May 22, 1993, and that the effective date of his retirement was April 3, 1993. In his response to the motion, the appellant conceded that his application for disability retirement had been voluntary and that the effective date of the approval of his disability retirement application was the same as that of his separation by RIF procedures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. He cited the Board's holding that the granting of a voluntarily-initiated disability retirement application retroactive to the same date as a separation by RIF procedures divested the Board of jurisdiction over the RIF action [<span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Malone v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 29 MSPR 458, 459 (1985)] . The administrative judge also stated, however, that the Civil Service Due Process Amendments, Pub. L. 101-376, 104 Stat. 461 (1990) (CSDPA), had been enacted after this holding and that they had added the provision codified at 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j); that provision, he found, precluded an individual's retirement status from being taken into account in determining the appealability of his removal from the federal service. Relying on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Jesko v. Dept. of Veterans Affairs</span>, 52 MSPR 517, 520-21 (1992), he nonetheless found that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) did not apply to RIF actions, concluding that the appellant's retirement divested the Board of jurisdiction over his separation....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Before the passage of the CSDPA, appeals by employees who had retired voluntarily after their agencies had decided to take the appealed actions generally could not be heard. If the employee retired on or before the effective date of the action at issue, the appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction on the basis that the action had never been effected and therefore could not be appealed. Retirement after the effective date of the action at issue was generally held to moot an appeal from that action, because the employee would not be entitled to reinstatement or back pay if he prevailed in his appeal. <span class="Italic">See Drumheller v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 55 MSPR 441, 443-44 (1992) (citations omitted). The Board subsequently interpreted the provision added by the CSDPA, 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j)[*], to preclude dismissals of appeals where the employees retired after the actions appealed were effected; it still held, however, that where employees' retirements became effective on or before the effective dates of the actions appealed, those actions could not be appealed because they had never been effected. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 444. The Board thus focused on the effective dates of retirements in determining the appealability of agency actions in such situations. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;That provision states that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[i]n determining the appealability [under section 7701] of any case involving a removal from the service (other than the removal of a reemployed annuitant), neither an individual's status under any retirement system established by or under Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any system may be taken into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Recently, however, both the Board and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have interpreted 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) differently. They have held that no basis exists for the distinction found in <span class="Italic">Drumheller</span> between retirements effective after removals from service and retirements effective on or before the dates of those removals<span class="Italic">. See Mays v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 27 F.3d 1577, 1580-1581 (Fed. Cir. 1994); <span class="Italic">Jankowski v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 63 MSPR 596, 598 (1994). As the Board stated in <span class="Italic">Jankowski</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">the essential occurrence in these types of cases is the timing of the <span class="Italic">action of the agency</span>, rather than the timing of the <span class="Italic">grant of retirement</span> by OPM....&#8197;As long as the action was effected prior to the grant of retirement by OPM, the Board would have jurisdiction over an appeal of that action regardless of the effective date of the retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 63 MSPR at 598-599 (emphasis in original). Applying that holding here, the Board would have jurisdiction over the action appealed by the appellant, because (as noted above) the separation was effected prior to the grant of retirement by OPM, even though that retirement was given an effective date retroactive to the effective date of the separation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding this interpretation of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j), the administrative judge correctly noted the holding in <span class="Italic">Jesko</span> that the provision does not apply to separations by RIF procedures. In <span class="Italic">Jesko</span>, the Board cited the word "removal" in the text of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) and the phrase "adverse action" used in the relevant legislative history as terms of art indicating that Congress did not intend the provision to apply to RIF actions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 52 MSPR at 520-21 (citations omitted). Subsequently, in finding that the provision did apply to actions effected under Chapter 43, the Board found that the legislative history of the CSDPA showed that one of the primary objectives in drafting the section was to protect an employee's basic due process rights: Congress believed it unfair to force an employee to choose between exercising due process rights and claiming entitlement to an annuity. <span class="Italic">See Willis v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 56 MSPR 433, 436-37 <span id="Page_1077"></span>(1993) (citations omitted), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, No. 94-3084, 29 F.3d 645 [table] (Fed. Cir. June 16, 1994) (Table). The Board concluded that Congress did not provide "any clear message" that 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) should apply to Chapter 75 actions but not to Chapter 43 actions, and it determined that, absent such a message, it would not infer an exclusion of Chapter 43 actions from the coverage of the section. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> Distinguishing the appeal from <span class="Italic">Jesko</span>, however, it nonetheless found that the word "removal" in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) was a term of art applicable only to actions brought under Chapter 75 or Chapter 43. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 437.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We now reconsider our conclusion in <span class="Italic">Jesko</span> and <span class="Italic">Willis</span> that RIF actions are not covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j), and find that it is not well-founded. As noted above, an important Congressional motive in the drafting of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j) was to prevent employees from having to choose between the exercise of their due process rights and retirement. In expressing its intent regarding this issue, Congress may well have used terms of art applicable to actions under Chapters 75 or 43. An employee separated by RIF procedures, however, faces the same choice that Congress deemed "unfair" if such an action is held to fall outside the coverage of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j), i.e., between exercising his due process rights or claiming entitlement to an annuity. Neither the text of section 7701(j) nor the relevant legislative history explicitly mandates such a result, and we can discern no reason on the part of Congress for creating such a distinction between RIF actions and actions effected under Chapters 75 or 43.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, lacking a "clear message" from Congress to distinguish RIF actions from Chapter 75 and Chapter 43 actions in this context, or a principled reason for such a distinction, we decline to do so. <span class="Italic">See Willis</span>, 56 MSPR at 436-37; <span class="Italic">Mays</span>, 27 F.3d at 1580, <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson</span>, 456 U.S. 63, 71, 102 S. Ct. 1534, 1538, 71 L. Ed.2d 748 (1982) ("'Statutes should be interpreted to avoid untenable distinctions and unreasonable results whenever possible.'"). We overrule our contrary holding in <span class="Italic">Jesko</span> and hold that separations by RIF procedures are covered by 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(j). Thus, based on our construction of section 7701(j) in <span class="Italic">Jankowski</span>, the appellant's separation is appealable to the Board, because the grant of retirement occurred after the separation was effected<span class="Italic">.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rogers v. Dept. of Army</span>, 88 MSPR 610, 618-19 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16 (2001), found no impediment to a USERRA appeal from a RIF separation leading to a discontinued service annuity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mootness can arise at any stage of litigation, and an appeal will be dismissed as moot where the appellant has obtained all of the relief he could have obtained had he prevailed before the Board, or where there is no further relief the Board can grant. <span class="Italic">See Currier v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 72 MSPR 191, 195 (1996). An appellant who prevails in a USERRA appeal such as this is entitled to a Board order requiring the agency "to comply with [the USERRA] provisions [that the agency violated] and to compensate [the appellant] for any loss of wages or benefits suffered by [the appellant] by reason of such lack of compliance." 38 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4324(c)(2); <span class="Italic">Vandesande v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 76 MSPR 190, 195 (1997). For the reasons discussed below, we find that the appellant's retirement does not moot the appellant's claim for reassignment to a position of like status and pay following his uniformed service because, as further discussed below, the retirement was involuntary and must be, canceled<span class="Italic">. Cf. Social Security Administration v. Carr</span>, 78 MSPR 313, 344 (1998) (appeal from the appellant's placement on administrative leave was mooted by her subsequent removal which the Board affirmed), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 185 F.3d 1318 (Fed. Cir. 1999); <span class="Italic">Adair v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 69 MSPR 431, 435 (1996) (appeal from demotion with saved grade and pay was mooted by the appellant's subsequent removal, which the Board affirmed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserted on remand that he took discontinued-service retirement on January 4, 1999, and that the retirement was involuntary. He contended that he retired due to the agency's 1998 RIF separation notice and that, had the agency reassigned him from his abolished position, consistent with its USERRA obligation, the 1998 RIF separation notice would not have been issued, and, in turn, he would not have retired. The agency has not disputed his contention that he would not have retired but for his proposed RIF separation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although a retirement is presumed to be a voluntary action not appealable to the Board, that presumption may be rebutted if the employee establishes that his retirement was a result of duress or coercion brought on by government action, or of misleading or deceptive information, or if the employee was mentally incompetent<span class="Italic">. See Contreras v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 78 MSPR 281 285 (1998). The common element in all cases of involuntary retirement is that factors have operated on the employee's decision-making process that deprived him of freedom of choice. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. A retirement is involuntary if, due to a violation of law that directly, affected an employee's rights, a reasonable person would have felt compelled to resign. <span class="Italic">See Baker v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 71 MSPR 680, 695 (1996); <span class="Italic">Zygmunt v. Department of Health &#x0026; Human Services,</span> 61 MSPR 379, 383 (1994); <span class="Italic">Swift v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 61 MSPR 29, 32 (1994); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Knowles v. Citicorp Mortgage, Inc</span>., 142 F.3d 1082, 1086 (8th Cir. 1998) (in an action under the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act, a constructive discharge occurs when an employer deliberately renders an employee's working conditions intolerable with the intent of forcing the employee to leave the employment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the agency abolished the appellant's GS-13 AFI position on March 31, 1997, and subsequently separated him by RIF on December 1, 1997, after he returned from uniformed service. After the agency canceled the appellant's December 1, 1997 RIF separation, it detailed him to unclassified duties. Notwithstanding the detail, he continued to occupy the abolished AFI position. The agency then issued another notice of RIF separation in 1998, purportedly based on the abolishment of the same GS-13 AFI position which was abolished in March 1997. Had the agency satisfied its USERRA obligation by reassigning the appellant to another position after abolishing his AFI position in 1997, he would not have been subjected to the 1998 RIF separation notice based on the abolishment of that same position. Under these circumstances, we find that the appellant was coerced into taking discontinued-service retirement based on the agency's violation of his USERRA rights. <span class="Italic">See Baker,</span> 71 MSPR at 695 (the appellant's resignation would be involuntary if the agency coerced him to resign by unjustifiably depriving him of income); <span class="Italic">see also Knowles,</span> 142 F.3d at 1086 (the employee can satisfy the requirement to show the agency intended to force him to resign, by demonstrating that his resignation was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the employer's actions). We therefore conclude that the appellant's retirement was involuntary and that it must be reversed as a constructive removal taken without minimum due process<span class="Italic">. See Drummonds v. Department of</span> Veterans Affairs, 58 MSPR 579, 584-85 (1993); <span class="Italic">Stephen v.</span> Department <span class="Italic">of the Air Force,</span> 47 MSPR 672, 680-81, 684 (1991).</p>
