<h3 class="h3" id="sec6-168"><span class="space">M.</span> CANCELATION</h3>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was negotiable that approved annual leave requests for 16 hours or more would be canceled only for valid operational reasons requiring that the employee not take leave, <span class="Italic">AFGE Nat'l INS Council and INS</span>, 27 FLRA 467, 473 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's argument, we find that Provision 3 does not set a precondition on management's right to cancel annual leave. The language of the provision does not require arbitration before management cancels approved annual leave....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In agreement with the Union, we find that the standard...that approved annual leave for sixteen hours or more be cancelled "only for valid operational reasons," is consistent with Office of Personnel Management guidance in FPM Letter 630-29. That letter states in section 2:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Denial of a leave request or cancellation of approved leave normally needs to be based on the necessity for the employee's services. Leave must not be denied or cancelled for arbitrary or capricious reasons. Denial or cancellation of leave is not disciplinary in character and must not be used as a punitive measure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, Provision 3 requires that management make the same determination that is required by the standard in the cited FPM letter. That is, management must consider whether an employee's services are needed for operational reasons before cancelling approved annual leave. Furthermore, the examples of "valid operational reasons" in Provision 3 make it clear that management is able to reconsider annual leave which it previously approved. Changed circumstances, such as an unexpected lack of personnel to perform work, unanticipated assignments, and similar contingencies which were unknown to management when leave was approved would constitute "valid operational reasons" for leave cancellation.</p>
<p class="noindent">A negotiable proposal required that an employee may be called back from leave when an emergency arises. The proposal did not limit "management's right to cancel leave to a particular definition of an 'emergency' or limit management's right to cancel leave for other reasons." <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-75 and Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv.</span>, 24 FLRA 56, 58 (1986). [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-136.html#sec6-137">Leave Forfeitures; 'Use or Lose</a>.'"]</p>
<p class="noindent">A proposal was not negotiable that precluded the agency from rescinding approved leave absent an emergency. The proposal directly interfered with the right to assign work. It did not constitute an appropriate arrangement. It abrogated management's right to assign work. The proposal was not saved by qualifiers that "every effort" would be made to avoid cancelation of leave. The substantive limitation on management's right remained. <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses Ass'n and VAMC, N. Chicago</span>, 27 FLRA 714, 732-33 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1900 and Dept. of Army, Ft. McPherson</span>, 51 FLRA 133, 134 (1995) (Provision 1 was nonnegotiable: "[o]nce granted, the leave will not be rescinded except in those cases of <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> emergencies"; proposal infringed on management's right to assign work; no arrangements argument was made); <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 239-40 (1987) (proposal was not negotiable that leave be rescheduled if its approval severely jeopardized patient care). A proposal was nonnegotiable as an arrangement that precluded management from canceling leave to require an employee to attend training. <span class="Italic">PASS and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 61 FLRA 97, 101 (2005) (Proposal 2). A similar proposal was not considered an appropriate arrangement necessitated by the hardship to employees who were forced, on leave cancelation, to forfeit vacation deposits. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1994 and Military Entrance Processing Station, Boston, Mass.</span>, 27 FLRA 968, 969-70 (1987) (Provision 1: "Approval for annual leave scheduled in advance will not be withdrawn by the Employer except in emergencies."). Another proposal was nonnegotiable that called on the employer to agree to restrict leave cancelation to circumstances involving an unscheduled and unpredictable mission requirement. The proposal interfered with the right to assign work by prohibiting leave cancelation based on other legitimate workload or staffing considerations. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2761 and Dept. of Army, Army Publications Distrib. Ctr., St. Louis</span>, 32 FLRA 1006, 1010-11 (1988). A proposal that leave not be canceled under certain circumstances without the approval of the regional administrator was not negotiable. It required a specific duty to be vested in a particular employee, violating management's right to assign work. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 1 and EPA Region 9</span>, 17 FLRA 427, 428 (1985).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26 and Dept. of Air Force, Langley AFB</span>, 40 FLRA 118, 119 (1991), approved for negotiation Proposal 1:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Employer agrees to reimburse employees for any loss of funds, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, airline tickets, hotel reservations, etc., which is caused by a cancellation of approved leave for any reason. The employee will submit written documentation of the loss.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26</span> explained that the proposal, relating to a condition of employment, was not inconsistent with law, rule, or regulation, 40 FLRA at 121-23:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In deciding whether a proposal concerns a condition of employment of bargaining unit employees, the Authority has considered whether: (1) "the proposal pertains to bargaining unit employees"; and (2) "the record establishes that there is a direct connection between the proposal and the work situation or employment relationship of bargaining unit employees."...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that Proposal 1 is intended to apply to reimbursement for only those losses resulting from a cancellation of approved leave by the Agency.... Under this interpretation, the proposal would not require the Agency to reimburse an employee for losses resulting from the employee's cancellation of previously approved leave for purely personal considerations, as the Agency suggests. Rather, it would result in reimbursement only when an employee, in reliance upon the Agency's approval of a leave request, has made nonrefundable payments, and therefore incurs losses solely because the Agency later withdraws its approval.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is not disputed that the proposal pertains to bargaining unit employees [but]...the Agency contends that the proposal concerns only employees' activities on non-duty hours and has no direct connection with the work situation or employment relationship. We disagree. Clearly, leave is "a significant and valued benefit of employment[.]"... When leave has been approved, an employee is justified in believing that he or she can make plans to enjoy that work-related benefit. Often, those plans will involve expenditures that cannot be recouped. When management cancels leave approval in such circumstances and instead requires the employee to report to work, the resultant losses incurred by the employee stem directly from the work relationship even though the original expenditures were made for activities that would have taken place on non-duty time.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Comptroller General has final authority over the expenditure of appropriated funds and has found that the expenditure of such funds for the purposes required by the proposal is inappropriate.&#x2003;However, the Union states that the funds required by the proposal are intended to be generated from nonappropriated funds. The proposal does not indicate which funds would be utilized for the reimbursement of loss expenses. Because the Union's stated intent is consistent with the language of the proposal, we find the proposal does not require that the funds be derived from appropriated funds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Inasmuch as the funds required by Proposal 1 need not be derived from appropriated funds, we reject the Agency's arguments that the proposal is nonnegotiable under section 7117(a) because the use of appropriated funds under the circumstances is inconsistent with decisions of the Comptroller General. As the Agency has not established, and it is not otherwise apparent, that the proposal is inconsistent with law, rule or regulation, we find that the Agency has not demonstrated that Proposal 1 is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic"><span id="page_735"></span>ACT Puerto Rico Army Chap. and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 56 FLRA 493, 497 (2000), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 56 FLRA 807 (2000), disapproved Provision 2, seeking reimbursement of expenses incurred for hotel reservations or airline tickets purchased by employees in anticipation of leave later canceled. The agency lacked discretion under Comptroller General guidance to expend funds for purposes covered by the proposal. <span class="Italic">Langley AFB</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, was distinguished as involving nonappropriated funds. A series of court and FLRA remand decisions then ensued. FLRA's decision was vacated and remanded for reconsideration under the law governing appropriate arrangements by <span class="Italic">ACT, Puerto Rico Army Chap. v. FLRA</span>, 269 F.3d 1112, 1116-18 (D.C. Cir. 2001):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA's decision was premised on the assumption that the Travel Expenses Act governs the disputed provision in the collective bargaining agreement. It does not. The disputed provision says that "[o]nce leave has be[en] approved and the employer has a compelling need to cancel the previously approved leave, the employer agrees not to subject the employee to a <span class="Italic">loss of funds expended in the planning of the leave</span>," and gives costs incurred from hotel reservations and airline tickets as examples. 56 F.L.R.A. at 496 (emphasis added). That provision does not speak in terms of travel expenses, personal, official, or otherwise. As the Union notes, it requires the agency to "pay employees' out-of-pocket losses (whether or not travel-related) when the agency--acting for its convenience, and in its interest--exercises its management right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) to cancel leave and assign work instead." In contrast, the Travel Expenses Act, and specifically 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702, the provision in question, only governs per diem and reimbursement when an employee is "traveling on official business." The Union proposal does not necessarily even involve canceled travel, and it certainly does not address official business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA cannot cite a single provision within the Travel Expenses Act, much less &#x00A7; 5702, that <span class="Italic">prohibits</span> the disputed provision, expressly or impliedly. The Act addresses different subject matter altogether. It authorizes official travel. It does not by its terms prohibit anything. The Authority is attempting to force a square peg into a round hole. No faithful reading of the Travel Expenses Act, which establishes "entitled" reimbursement or allowance "when traveling on official business," 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702(a)(1), is relevant to the disputed provision, which provides compensation for unavoidable expenses resulting from canceled leave. To force such a reading turns the Travel Expenses Act on its head.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This is not to say that the expenditure of appropriated funds in a manner not authorized by law is negotiable--it is not. In an attempt to salvage its decision, the Authority now argues that its decision was based on the general principle that expenditures are not authorized unless a law or regulation affirmatively authorizes them, and that there is no authorization for the expenditure required by the disputed provision. But the Authority's decision <span class="Italic">was not</span> based on a lack of authorization for the expenditure. Rather, it is clear that the FLRA's decision reasoned that because the Travel Expenses Act did not authorize the expenditure, it was prohibited. The Authority offered no other reason. Specifically, it did not rely on the lack of authorization elsewhere in governing law. Agency decisions must generally be affirmed on the grounds stated in them. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Fort Stewart Schools v. FLRA</span>, 495 U.S. 641, 651-52, 110 S. Ct. 2043, 109 L. Ed. 659 (1990) ("[I]t is elementary that if an agency's decision is to be sustained in the courts on any rationale under which the agency's factual or legal determinations are entitled to deference, it must be upheld on the rationale set forth by the agency itself."); <span class="Italic">SEC v. Chenery Corp.</span>, 318 U.S. 80, 93-95, 63 S. Ct. 454, 87 L. Ed. 626 (1943). Post-hoc rationalizations, developed for litigation are insufficient. <span class="Italic">See Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</span>, 371 U.S. 156, 168, 83 S. Ct. 239, 9 L. Ed.2d 207 (1962) ("The courts may not accept appellate counsel's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationalizations for agency action...."). If the Authority only based its decision on the Travel Expenses Act, then that is the only rationale we may consider.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its original opinion below, under "Analysis and Conclusions," the FLRA begins its analysis as follows: "The disbursement of appropriated funds must be authorized by statute<span class="Italic">. Thus, the use of appropriated funds to reimburse employees for travel expenses</span> must be authorized by statute." 56 F.L.R.A. at 497 (emphasis added). The FLRA clearly saw the provision as one involving travel expenses and treated it as squarely governed by the Travel Expenses Act. Because the Travel Expenses Act did not authorize these expenditures, it concluded (following the Comptroller General's opinions), that there was no authority for the disputed provision, and declared it nonnegotiable. That proves at most that the Travel Expenses Act cannot be the source of authority for the disputed provision, not that the provision is contrary to law. However, the Union does not rely on the Travel Expenses Act as a source of authority--quite to the contrary, it expressly argues that the Act is inapplicable, instead relying on the collective bargaining laws as authorizing resulting expenditures. The FLRA did not address this argument.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The argument that the collective bargaining laws themselves authorize the expenditure is one reason that the Comptroller General opinions relied on by the FLRA cannot resolve this case.&#x2003;Those opinions did not address a collective bargaining situation and did not consider what effect, if any, the collective bargaining laws would have in authorizing the disputed provision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 56 F.L.R.A. at 497 (discussing Comptroller General opinions). Reliance on these opinions of the Comptroller General is flawed for yet another reason....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its motion for reconsideration, the Union expressly argued that the expenditures required by the disputed provision "are <span class="Italic">authorized by the collective bargaining law</span>, [5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101, <span class="Italic">et seq</span>.], and therefore by the law that generally authorizes agency expenditures." (emphasis added). Yet again, however, the Authority failed to address this argument. Instead it relied on its position that the "provision clearly requires the Agency to pay employees for lost travel expenses," and noted that in the original decision it "applied Comptroller General decisions which <span class="Italic">have interpreted the Federal Travel Regulations</span> to hold that agencies have 'no authority' to reimburse employees for the kind of purely personal travel expenses that are set forth by the terms of the provision." 56 F.L.R.A. at 808 (emphasis added). The FLRA was only "appl[ying]" a rule that under the Travel Expenses Act and corresponding regulations, there is no authority to reimburse personal travel expenses or expenses that arise from canceled leave, and that rule does not dispose of the Union's argument that the collective bargaining laws and laws that generally authorize agency expenditures provide an independent source of authority....</p>
<p class="noindent">Following consideration on remand, FLRA reaffirmed its decision: the proposal for the government to reimburse employees' forfeited travel expenditures was nonnegotiable, <span class="Italic">ACT Puerto Rico Army Chap. and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 58 FLRA 318, 320-24 (2003), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 59 FLRA 2 (2003):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the provision requires an expenditure of appropriated funds that is not authorized by law, and, therefore, the provision is contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute requires unions and agencies to "discuss and negotiate on any condition of employment." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114(b)(2). The Statute also provides that bargaining must take place within the limitations imposed by other federal laws. In particular, &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1) provides that the duty to bargain in good faith does not extend to matters that are "inconsistent with any Federal law." The Authority has summarized these principles as establishing that "matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law." <span class="Italic">Patent</span> <span class="Italic">Office Professional Assn, </span>53 FLRA 625, 648 (1997); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Treasury Employees Union, </span>21 FLRA 6, 10 (1986) <span class="Italic">(NTEU), aff'd sub nom. Dep't of Treasury,</span> <span class="Italic">United States Customs Service v. FLRA, </span>836 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Thus, the Statute requires an agency to bargain over matters over which it otherwise has discretion under law as long as those matters are not otherwise contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the provision requires the disbursement of funds in order to reimburse employees for losses incurred as a result of cancelled leave. In determining the legality of an agency's disbursement of funds, it is well established that any disbursement of appropriated funds must be authorized by statute. The Constitution specifically provides that "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...." U.S. Const. Art. I, &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7<span class="Italic">. See also OPM v. Richmond, </span>496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990) ("payments of money from the Federal Treasury are limited to those authorized by statute"); <span class="Italic">Nat'l Ass'n</span> <span class="Italic">of Reg'l Councils v. Costle, </span>564 F.2d 583, 586 (D.C. Cir. 1977) ("[g]ovemment agencies may only enter into obligations to pay money if they have been granted such authority by Congress"); <span class="Italic">Downs v. Office of Personnel</span> <span class="Italic">Management, </span>69 F.3d 1141, 1143 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("[t]he United States Constitution limits payments of monies from the Federal Treasury to those authorized by statute").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the Statute provides the necessary authorization for the Agency's expenditure of funds to reimburse employees for losses incurred as a result of cancelled leave. There is no express or implied authorization in the Statute or its legislative history for agencies to expend funds in the manner required by the provision in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, we note that in <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol,</span> <span class="Italic">Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA, </span>464 U.S. 89 (1983) <span class="Italic">(BATF v. FLRA), </span>the Supreme Court rejected the Authority's interpretation that the Statute's grant of official time under &#x00A7; 7131(a) provided authorization for employee negotiators to a per diem allowance and reimbursement for travel expenses incurred in connection with collective bargaining. The Court found that the Statute's provision for collective bargaining did not provide authorization for the reimbursement of travel expenses related to such bargaining. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 107. As the Court stated, "there is no reference in the [S]tatute or the legislative history to travel expenses<span class="Italic">." Id</span>. at 104.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, consistent with the Court's reasoning, the Statute's provision for collective bargaining does not provide statutory authorization for the expenditures at issue here <span class="Italic">Cf. INS, Los Angeles District, Los Angeles, Cal., </span>52 FLRA 103, 106 (1996) (Authority denied General Counsel's request for reimbursement of parking expenses incurred as a result of agency's unfair labor practice; Authority adopted D.C. Circuit's holding in <span class="Italic">Dep't <span id="page_736"></span>of the Army, United States Army Commissary,</span> <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison, Indianapolis, et al. v. FLRA,</span> 56 F.3d 273 (D.C. Cir. 1995) that the Statute does not waive sovereign immunity to an award of money damages not related to an unlawful reduction in pay, allowances or differentials).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the same vein, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">BATF</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA </span>for the proposition that the Agency has discretion to use appropriated funds to reimburse employees for losses incurred as a result of cancellation of leave is misplaced. As the Authority noted in 56 FLRA at 808 n.5 (citations omitted):</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span class="Italic">BATF and GSA </span>concerned substantially similar proposals that required the agency to allow the union to use a government telephone for labor-management activities.... The Authority ruled the subject matter negotiable when the Agency failed to cite to 'any statutory or regulatory provision which would prohibit it from exercising through negotiations its discretion to determine that telephone installation and service for union offices relating to labor-management relations activities is sufficiently within the interest of the United States so as to constitute official business.'</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority held that the agency could through negotiations determine that union use of government telephones constituted "official business." [4] Conversely, in this case, the Union has acknowledged that the expenditures required by the provision, such as nonrefundable hotel reservations, airline tickets, and tickets for local theater, sports events and banquets, are personal expenses and "do[ ] not concern employees 'traveling on official business.'" Also, in this respect, in finding that the Travel Expenses Act governing travel expenses related to official business does not apply, the D.C. Circuit confirmed that the provision "certainly does not address official business." <span class="Italic">ACT, Puerto Rico</span> <span class="Italic">Army Chapter, </span>269 F.3d at 1116. Accordingly, <span class="Italic">BATF</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA </span>are inapposite and do not establish the governing standard in this case since this provision does not involve the Agency's exercise of discretion in determining whether these expenses concern "official business."</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;Along the same lines, in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, discussed <span class="Italic">supra</span>, the Supreme Court noted that the lack of statutory authorization for the travel expenses under &#x00A7; 7131(a) did not "preclude an agency from making such payments upon a determination that [the travel in question constituted official business by] serv[ing] the convenience of the agency or [was] otherwise in the primary interest of the Government." 464 U.S. at 107 n.17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently looked beyond its enabling Statute for statutory authorization for the expenditure of money by agencies.&#x2003;In this respect, the Authority has held that when a proposal or provision requires payment for items beyond the limits of the particular statute authorizing payment, the proposal is inconsistent with federal law and therefore outside the duty to bargain or the provision is contrary to law under &#x00A7; 7117(a) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., UPTO, </span>48 FLRA at 292 (proposal requiring the payment of fees for obtaining job-related licenses was nonnegotiable in the absence of specific statutory authorization), <span class="Italic">aff'd mem.,</span> No. 93-70827 (9th Cir. May 23, 1995); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Navy, United States Marine Corps, </span>34 FLRA 635, 638 (1990) (provision for safety vests to be used for commuting to work was inconsistent with laws regarding purchase of safety equipment); <span class="Italic">cf. United States Dep't</span> <span class="Italic">of Defense, Education Activity, Arlington, VA, </span>56 FLRA 119 (2000) (<span class="Italic">DOD</span>) (Authority set aside arbitration award implementing a provision that required an expenditure of federal money that was not authorized by law).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Agency's appropriations for general operating expenses provide it with the discretion to make the expenditures authorized by the provision. In this case, the determination of whether the Agency has any discretion to use its appropriated funds for operations to reimburse employees for the expenses covered under the provision in this case is primarily an issue of appropriations law. In applying the principles governing the use of appropriated funds, we reject the Union's argument that the Agency has discretion to use appropriations for general operating expenses to implement the contract provision in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Generally, the disbursement of appropriated funds is governed by 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a), which provides that "[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law." One of the categories or "objects" in the 2000 DOD Appropriations Act for which funds were appropriated was what are generally referred to as operations and maintenance activities by the Army National Guard, the appropriations entitlement referenced by the Union as being proper to cover the payments provided for by the contract provision at issue here.[5] <span class="Italic">See </span>P.L. 106-79, 113 Stat. 1212, 1216-17 (October 25, 1999). As is generally the case, several specific categories or types of Army National Guard activity to be funded are identified, as well as more general activities. Appropriations statutes may also contain express limitations on the amounts of funds to be expended on listed operations and maintenance activities, as noted, for example in the Act's discussion of operations and maintenance funds for the Navy and Marine Corps. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1215. Additionally, appropriations provided by an appropriations statute may also be limited by other statutory limitation, such as the congressional limitation on the expenditure of funds by DOD components to prohibit the payment of employees otherwise on paid duty time while engaged in official time activities to lobby Congress<span class="Italic">. See, e.g., Assn of Civilian Technicians, Old Hickory Chapter</span>, 55 FLRA 811, 812-13 (1999) (Member Wasserman dissenting) (proposal granting official time for lobbying activities involving pending legislation held inconsistent with &#x00A7; 8012 of the 1998 Department of Defense Appropriations Act).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, the first possible consideration regarding the permissible expenditure of appropriated funds to be considered, although certainly not the only possible consideration, is based upon the language of the relevant appropriations statute. We find nothing in the express language of this appropriations statute or its legislative history that indicates that Congress intended these funds to be expended for the purpose of reimbursing employees for personal expense losses (such as nonrefundable hotel reservations, airline tickets, and tickets for local theater, sports events, and banquets) incurred in connection with the Agency's cancellation of previously approved leave. <span class="Italic">See </span>National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, 113 Stat. 512; Conference House Rept. 106-371 (October 13, 1999).[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;We note that neither party has addressed specifically the applicability of the 2000 Appropriations Act and it is unclear for instance whether the Agency uses funds appropriated for "Operation and Maintenance [for] Army National Guard," for operations related to civilian National Guard technicians.<span class="Italic"> See </span>P.L. 106-79, 113 Stat. 1212, 1216-17 (October 25, 1999). As noted earlier, the Union has not pointed to any particular section of the 2000 Appropriations Act that allegedly authorizes or addresses in any manner the expenditures required by the provision in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;There is no substantial difference in the language in subsequent appropriations acts for 2001 and 2002. DOD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2001, P.L. 106-259, 114 Stat. 656 (August 9, 2000); DOD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002, P.L. 107-117, 115 Stat. 2230 (January 10, 2002).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, although not central to our analysis, we note that in applying and interpreting 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a), the Comptroller General has recognized that &#x00A7; 1301(a) does not require that every item of expenditure be specified in an appropriation act. <span class="Italic">See </span>United States General Accounting Office, Office of the General Counsel, 1 Principles of Federal Appropriations Law (PFAL) 4-15 (2nd ed. 1991). The Comptroller General has noted that to require an explicit or specific appropriation for every expense would be clearly impractical given the relative levels of generality that Congress uses to provide funding for the various agency programs and activities. B-270446, February 11, 1997. In this regard, the Comptroller General has applied the "necessary expense doctrine" in determining whether expenditures not specifically or explicitly authorized in an appropriation act are nonetheless lawful. Under this doctrine, "expenditures must bear a logical relationship to the appropriation sought to be charged[, that is,] it must make a direct contribution to carrying out either a specific appropriation or an authorized agency function for which more general appropriations are available." 1 PFAL at 4-16 (citing 63 Comp. Gen. 422, 427-28 (1984)); B-230304 (1988). Otherwise stated, under the doctrine, the expenditure must be reasonably necessary to carrying out an authorized function. 71 Comp. Gen. 527, 528 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even assuming, without deciding, that the necessary expense doctrine applies, the provision would not satisfy application of that doctrine. The Union has not demonstrated that, and it is not apparent to us how, the Agency's reimbursement of such personal expenses for planned activities while on leave, including hotel reservations, airline tickets, and tickets for local theater, sports events and banquets, would make any contribution to the Agency's authorized purpose in maintaining the Agency's operations that necessitated the cancellation of leave. For instance, the reimbursement of the entertainment expenses specifically mentioned by the Union for sporting events is neither reasonably necessary nor relevant to maintaining the Agency's operations that necessitated the cancellation of leave. The fact that employees will incur personal losses as a result of the cancellation of leave does not change the essentially personal nature of these expenses nor does this fact overcome the lack of any material connection to the Agency's operations. <span class="Italic">See </span>68 Comp. Gen. 502, 505 (1989) (personal expenses require specific statutory authorization unless expense primarily benefits government). Indeed, if reimbursement of these personal items satisfied the doctrine, it is difficult to imagine circumstances under which an agency could not be required to reimburse any other personal expenses under the doctrine.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, we find that Congress' enactment of 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1053a, which provides statutory authorization for reimbursement of travel and related expenses incurred by members of the armed forces as a result of cancellation of previously approved leave under certain circumstances, is particularly instructive here.[7] The enactment of &#x00A7; 1053a strongly <span id="page_737"></span>suggests that specific statutory authorization is required in order for individuals (military personnel, in this instance) to receive reimbursement for personal losses incurred as a result of an agency's cancellation of leave. Similarly, specific statutory authorization would be necessary for the Agency to reimburse bargaining unit employees for the same category of personal expenses. As such, the Union's proper recourse is with Congress, and not the Authority, in obtaining specific statutory authorization for the Agency's expenditure of funds for the purposes set forth in the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[7]&#x2003;10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1053a, "Expenses incurred in connection with leave canceled due to contingency operations: reimbursement" provides in pertinent part--</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(a)&#x2003;Authorization to reimburse.--The Secretary concerned may reimburse a member of the armed forces under the jurisdiction of the Secretary for travel and related expenses (to the extent not otherwise reimbursable under law) incurred by the member as a result of the cancellation of previously approved leave when the leave is canceled in connection with the member's participation in a contingency operation and the cancellation occurs within 48 hours of the time the leave would have commenced.</p>
<p class="noindent-3">(b)&#x2003;Regulations.--The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to establish the criteria for the applicability of subsection (a).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, we find, in agreement with the Agency, that the provision is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536. Section 5536 provides that "an employee or a member of a uniformed service whose pay or allowance is fixed by statute or regulation may not receive additional pay or allowance for the disbursement of public money or for any other service or duty, unless specifically authorized by law and the appropriation therefor specifically states that it is for the additional pay or allowance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed here that pay for unit employees is fixed by statute or regulation.&#x2003;In our view, Agency reimbursement of personal losses incurred as a result of the Agency's cancellation of leave, as mandated by the provision in this case, clearly constitutes "additional pay or allowance for the disbursement of public money." <span class="Italic">Cf. Kizas v. Webster, </span>707 F.2d 524, 536-37 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (court found that limiting compensation rights to those expressly granted by statute under Title 5 thereby barred "any additional pay, extra allowance, or compensation, in any form whatever" as provided in the statutory predecessor of &#x00A7; 5536).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we find that the provision requires an expenditure of appropriated funds that is not authorized by law, and that is contrary to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536 as well. In light of our determination that the provision is contrary to law and in line with Authority precedent, we need not address agency is obligated under the Statute to bargain over the Union's argument that the provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement<span class="Italic">. See Nat'l Treasury Employees Union, </span>55 FLRA 1174, 1181 (1999) <span class="Italic">(Customs Serv.)</span> (a provision that is contrary to law or Government-wide regulation remains so regardless of whether it is an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the court for a second time<span class="Italic">. See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter v. FLRA,</span> 269 F.3d 1112 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("<span class="Italic">ACT I</span>"). After the Department of Defense ("the Agency") had disapproved Provision 2 of a collective bargaining agreement as contrary to law under the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7101 <span class="Italic">et seq.,</span> (hereafter, "collective bargaining law"), the Association of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter ("the Union"), filed a negotiability appeal with the Federal Labor Relations Authority ("FLRA") pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7105(a)(2)(E). FLRA agreed with the Agency that Provision 2 was contrary to law and therefore nonnegotiable under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), concluding that Provision 2 expenditures were not authorized by the Travel Expenses Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 5701, <span class="Italic">et seq. See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter,</span> 56 F.L.R.A. 807, 2000 WL 1455234 (2000). The court reversed, holding that the Travel Expenses Act was irrelevant, <span class="Italic">see ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1116, and remanded the case for FLRA to address two issues presented by the Union, namely that Provision 2 expenditures are authorized (1) generally by the collective bargaining law, "and therefore by the law that generally authorizes agency expenditures," <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 1115, 1117-18; or (2) specifically as an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) for employees injured as a result of the Agency's exercise of the management right to cancel leave and "assign work" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B)<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 1118. On remand, in again ruling that Provision 2 was contrary to law, FLRA addressed the first issue but not the second.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress has declared in the collective bargaining law that "labor organizations and collective bargaining in the civil service are in the public interest." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a). The collective bargaining law therefore protects the rights of federal employees to form or join or refrain from joining any labor organization, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7102, and imposes on federal agencies and labor organizations a duty to bargain collectively in good faith<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7116(a)(5), (b)(5). It also excludes certain management rights of an agency from inclusion in negotiations, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(a), but requires an agency to bargain over the procedures by which these management rights are exercised, <span class="Italic">id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(b), including negotiating "appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any [management] authority." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3). It generally requires that federal agencies and labor organizations bargain in good faith over the terms and conditions of employment, unless a bargaining proposal is inconsistent with an existing federal law, rule, or regulation<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7103(a), 7114, 7116, 7117(a). Thus, if a collective bargaining provision is inconsistent with federal law, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), or excessively interferes with management's rights, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106, the provision is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under Provision 2 of the proposed collective bargaining agreement, the Union seeks reimbursement for its members' out-of-pocket losses resulting from the Agency's cancellation of previously approved leave. The provision provides:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Once leave has be[en] approved and the employer has a compelling need to cancel the previously approved leave, the employer agrees not to subject the employee to a loss of funds expended in planning of the leave (i.e. hotel reservations, airline tickets, etc.). The employee will demonstrate the unavoida[bility] of the loss of funds.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1113-14. Because Provision 2 requires the disbursement of appropriated funds, the question before FLRA was whether such disbursement is authorized by law<span class="Italic">. See</span> U.S. Const. Art. I., &#x00A7; 9, cl. 7; 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a). While acknowledging that the collective bargaining law does not "by itself" authorize the Agency to spend money, the Union again argued before FLRA on remand that "where Congress generally has authorized an agency to expend appropriated funds for agency operations, the collective bargaining law authorizes expenditures to implement contract provisions that are not otherwise contrary to law." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter,</span> 2003 WL 190510, 58 F.L.R.A. 318 (2003); <span class="Italic">see also ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1115. In other words, "[t]he collective bargaining law creates new agency obligations which general agency appropriations may be used to meet."; <span class="Italic">see also ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1115. The Union also renewed its position that Provision 2 is alternatively authorized as an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), arguing that "Agency payment of employees' unavoidable out-of-pocket losses incurred in reliance on the [A]gency's grant of leave, subsequently revoked, is a narrowly-tailored remedy for harm inflicted...by an [A]gency's exercise of its right to...[cancel leave and assign work]."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the first remanded issue, FLRA concluded that neither the text of the collective bargaining law, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7101(a), nor its legislative history provides express or implied authorization for the Agency's expenditure of appropriated funds for Provision 2 reimbursements. In finding no express authority, it relied on <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms v. FLRA,</span> 464 U.S. 89, 104, 104 S. Ct. 439, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983) ("<span class="Italic">BATF</span>"), in which the Supreme Court stated that "there is no reference in the statute or the legislative history to travel expenses and per diem allowances." In finding that the collective bargaining law also does not provide implicit authorization for such reimbursements, FLRA relied on this court's statement in <span class="Italic">ACT I</span> that Provision 2 reimbursements do not concern employees "traveling on official business," 269 F.3d at 1116, and concluded that, unlike the disputed provisions in <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms,</span> 26 F.L.R.A. 497, 498, 1987 WL 90443 (1987) ("<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>"), and <span class="Italic">National Federation of Federal Employees and General Services Administration,</span> 24 F.L.R.A. 430, 432-33, 1986 WL 54556 (1986) ("<span class="Italic">GSA</span>"), Provision 2 does not involve "official business." FLRA thus rejected the Union's argument that under <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> the Agency has discretion to use funds appropriated for general operations for Provision 2 reimbursements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Then, instead of turning to the second remanded issue, whether Provision 2 is authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) as an "appropriate arrangement [ ]," FLRA examined whether there was other statutory authorization for Provision 2 reimbursements by looking to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-79, 113 Stat. 1212, 1216-17 (1999) ("2000 Appropriations Act")<span class="Italic">. Cf. ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1116-17. FLRA concluded that the 2000 Appropriations Act does not expressly authorize Provision 2 reimbursements. Further, assuming the applicability of the "necessary expense doctrine," which requires that an expenditure be reasonably necessary or reasonably related to or make a direct contribution to carrying out an authorized function, <span class="Italic">see</span> United States General Accounting Office, Office of the General Counsel, 1 <span class="Italic">Principles of Federal Appropriations Law</span> 4-14 to 4-22 (2d ed. 1991) ("<span class="Italic">Principles</span>"); 71 Comp. Gen. 527, 528 (1992); 63 Comp. Gen. 422, 427-28 (1984); 42 Comp. Gen. 226, 226 (1962), FLRA concluded that the appropriation for "Operation and Maintenance" for the Army National <span id="page_738"></span>Guard in the 2000 Appropriations Act does not implicitly authorize Provision 2 reimbursements, because the Union had failed to show that such reimbursements would make "any contribution to the Agency's authorized purpose...." Alternatively, FLRA concluded that Provision 2 reimbursements are prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536, which bars payment to a federal employee of "additional pay or allowance" beyond that fixed by law for the service or duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the Union's overarching contention is that FLRA failed to consider Congress's general authorization of appropriations for the Agency in the context of the collective bargaining law. According to the Union, because Congress requires the Agency to conduct its operations in accordance with the collective bargaining law, reasonably necessary expenses, which are authorized by general appropriations such as in the 2000 Appropriations Act, include expenditures to carry out negotiated contract terms that are negotiable under the collective bargaining law. FLRA responds that neither the collective bargaining law nor the 2000 Appropriations Act authorizes the expenditure of funds to reimburse civilian employees for travel and recreational expenses forfeited when the Agency cancels previously approved leave, and regardless, such expenditures are prohibited by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A few preliminary observations guide our analysis.&#x2003;The Union has not argued that express authorization exists for Provision 2 reimbursements under federal law. Rather, it contends that implicit authorization for Provision 2 reimbursements may be found either pursuant to the collective bargaining law in conjunction with the 2000 Appropriations Act or pursuant to the 2000 Appropriations Act. As the collective bargaining law is FLRA's own enabling statute and the court would owe "considerable deference" to FLRA's interpretation of it, <span class="Italic">see BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 97, 104 S. Ct. at 444, the court in <span class="Italic">ACT I</span> remanded the case for FLRA to determine whether implicit authorization for Provision 2 reimbursements could be found either (1) through the "official business" test recognized by the Supreme Court in <span class="Italic">BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 107 n.17, 104 S. Ct. at 449 n.17, and by FLRA in <span class="Italic">NTEU,</span> 26 F.L.R.A. at 498 and <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 24 F.L.R.A. at 432-33, because Provision 2 reimbursements are sufficiently within the interest of the Agency to constitute "official business" and as such, such reimbursements are implicitly authorized under the 2000 Appropriations Act; or (2) through 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), because Provision 2 is an "appropriate arrangement[ ] for employees adversely affected by the exercise of...[management's] authority" to cancel leave and "assign work" and as such, the reimbursements are implicitly authorized under the 2000 Appropriations Act<span class="Italic">. See ACT I,</span> 269 F.3d at 1118. Another approach for finding implicit authorization of Provision 2 reimbursements not addressed in the court's remand, but which FLRA addressed on remand, and as to which the court would owe no deference to FLRA's interpretation, <span class="Italic">see Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Tony Kempenich Memorial Chapter 21 v. FLRA,</span> 269 F.3d 1119, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 2001) ("<span class="Italic">Tony Kempenich</span>"), would be based on the "necessary expense doctrine" through which Provision 2 reimbursements might be found to be authorized under the 2000 Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We first examine FLRA's interpretation of the collective bargaining law, then turn to its interpretation of the 2000 Appropriations Act, and finally address its alternative ruling on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In rejecting the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA</span> for the proposition that the collective bargaining law, in conjunction with general appropriations laws, implicitly authorizes Provision 2 reimbursements, FLRA took the position that Provision 2 "does not involve the Agency's exercise of discretion in determining whether these expenses concern 'official business.'" Although the court generally owes deference to FLRA's interpretation of the collective bargaining law, <span class="Italic">see BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 97 &#x0026; n.7, 104 S. Ct. at 444 &#x0026; n.7; <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n v. FLRA,</span> 47 F.3d 1217, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 1995); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 706(2)(A), 7123 (c), FLRA must "provide a rational explanation for its decision." <span class="Italic">FDIC v. FLRA,</span> 977 F.2d 1493, 1496 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,</span> 463 U.S. 29, 43, 103 S. Ct. 2856, 2866-67, 77 L. Ed.2d 443 (1983). In addressing the first remanded issue, FLRA has not done so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Precisely what activity constitutes "official business" is a context-specific determination that requires an evaluation of factors that Congress has determined FLRA is well suited to do<span class="Italic">. See BATF,</span> 464 U.S. at 97, 104 S. Ct. at 444. It is clear that the term has some elasticity. The Supreme Court acknowledged in <span class="Italic">BATF</span> that its conclusion that "federal agencies may not be required under [the 'official time' provision in 5 U.S.C.] &#x00A7; 7131(a) to pay the travel expenses and per diem allowances of union negotiators does not, of course, preclude an agency from making such payments upon a determination that they serve the convenience of the agency or are otherwise in the primary interest of the Government...." 464 U.S. at 107 n.17, 104 S. Ct. at 449 n.17. FLRA itself has construed the term "official business" pragmatically, concluding that the appropriate inquiry is whether the provision is "sufficiently within the interest of the United States so as to constitute official business." <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 26 F.L.R.A. at 498; <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 24 F.L.R.A. at 432-33. Yet on remand FLRA relied on the court's statement in <span class="Italic">ACT I</span> that Provision 2 "does not necessarily even involve canceled travel, and it certainly does not address official business." 269 F.3d at 1116. When read in context, it is clear that the court was referring to the fact that Provision 2 does not relate to official travel, i.e., "travel expenses, personal, official, or otherwise," to which the Travel Expenses Act would apply. That is a different question than whether Provision 2 reimbursements would be authorized under the "official business" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At no point on remand did FLRA evaluate whether Provision 2 might or might not constitute "official business" within the meaning of the <span class="Italic">BATF</span> footnote and its own precedent. It did not address the Union's argument that the collective bargaining law, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), 7114, being itself sufficiently within the interest of the United States, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7101, creates "official business" that would not be "official business" in the absence of the law. Neither did it address the implications of its previous rulings in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> and <span class="Italic">GSA</span> that the Agency could exercise its discretion to use appropriated funds for union-use of government telephones for labor-management relations<span class="Italic">. See NTEU,</span> 26 F.L.R.A. at 498; <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 24 F.L.R.A. at 433. Nor did it address whether for reasons of adequate staffing, retention, recruitment, or morale, for example, such reimbursements might advance the Agency's interests or convenience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, FLRA failed to address at all the second remanded issue in <span class="Italic">ACT I,</span> namely whether Provision 2 reimbursements would be authorized as an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) and therefore implicitly authorized under the 2000 Appropriations Act. If Provision 2 reimbursements are not authorized by law, Provision 2 will be deemed inconsistent with federal law under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7117(a)(1), which bars negotiation on matters "inconsistent with any Federal law or any Government-wide rule or regulation." Provision 2, however, may constitute an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" if it is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by management's exercise of its rights, and does not "excessively interfere[ ]" with the exercise of management rights under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)<span class="Italic">. Nat'l Ass'n of Gov't Employees,</span> 21 F.L.R.A. 24, 29-33, 1986 WL 54613 (1986); <span class="Italic">see also U.S. Dep't of Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA,</span> 960 F.2d 1068, 1072-73 (D.C. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA,</span> 702 F.2d 1183, 1185-88 (D.C. Cir. 1983). To make that determination FLRA would need to address (1) whether employees have been adversely affected, (2) by a management decision, and if so, (3) whether reimbursement of resulting monetary losses are likely to interfere excessively with management rights. To the extent that (1) and (2) are undisputed, inasmuch as Union members will, absent reimbursement, incur out-of-pocket losses as a result of management's recall decision pursuant to its right under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) to cancel leave and to "assign work," the conclusion as to (3) may turn on a variety of considerations, including, for example, whether or not there is a cap on the amount of individual expenditures or a limited period of time for covered expenditures so as not to chill "excessively" management's exercise of its rights in response to the needs of the Guard. But if Provision 2's out-of-pocket losses are directly caused by the Agency's exercise of its management rights, it is possible to view that reimbursement as not for purely personal expenses, but rather for an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" to compensate civilian technicians harmed by the exercise of management rights. The "appropriate arrangement [ ]" determination, moreover, will inform FLRA's analysis of whether Provision 2 reimbursements are for or related to "official business" if they advance the Agency's interests or convenience.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Had FLRA addressed the second remanded issue, there might have been no occasion for it to interpret the 2000 Appropriations Act. The one member of FLRA who addressed the issue concluded that Provision 2 was not an "appropriate arrangement[ ]," and were such a conclusion adequately explained, that, absent express congressional authorization for such reimbursements, would presumably be the end of the matter. In any event, upon <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, for the court owes no deference to FLRA's interpretation of the appropriations act, <span class="Italic">see Tony Kempenich,</span> 269 F.3d at 1121, the court is unable to determine on the basis of the present administrative record whether Provision 2 reimbursements are implicitly authorized under the 2000 Appropriations Act.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FLRA acknowledged on remand that 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1301(a), which provides that "[a]ppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made....," does not require that every authorized expenditure be expressly authorized in an appropriations act<span class="Italic">. See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter,</span> 2003 WL 190510, at *9, 58 F.L.R.A. 318 (2003) (citing 1 <span class="Italic">Principles, supra,</span> at 4-15). Under the "necessary expense doctrine," the Comptroller General has opined that expenditures not explicitly authorized in an appropriations act may nonetheless be lawful<span class="Italic">. See</span> 6 Comp. Gen. 619, 621 (1927); 1 <span class="Italic">Principles,</span> <span class="Italic">supra,</span> at 4-15 to 4-16. In rejecting the Union's reliance on the 2000 Appropriations Act as implicitly authorizing the use of appropriated funds to carry out negotiated agreements, FLRA concluded that "reimbursement of such personal expenses...is neither reasonably necessary nor relevant to maintaining the Agency's operations that necessitated the cancellation of leave." <span class="Italic">Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter,</span> 2003 <span id="page_739"></span>WL 190510, at *9. It is not, however, self-evident under the "necessary expense doctrine," which FLRA assumed applied without deciding, that use of the Agency's appropriations for Provision 2 reimbursements would be unlawful. Whether for reasons of adequate staffing, retention, recruitment, or morale, for example, Provision 2 reimbursements could make a "contribution" to carrying out an authorized function, such as "assign[ing] work." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B). Deciding that question would require additional information both about the Agency's function with regard to the Guard and about the expenditures authorized in the 2000 Appropriations Act for Agency operations and maintenance. FLRA noted on remand that neither party had addressed the applicability of the 2000 Appropriations Act, nor whether the Agency uses funds appropriated for the Guard's operations and maintenance for operations related to civilian Guard technicians<span class="Italic">. See Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter,</span> 2003 WL 190510, at *8 n.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To the extent that FLRA looked to 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1053a as support for its conclusion that Provision 2 reimbursements are not implicitly authorized by the 2000 Appropriations Act, its reliance was misplaced. Under 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1053a(a), military personnel may receive reimbursement for "travel and related expenses...incurred by the member as a result of the cancellation of previously approved leave when the leave is canceled in connection with the member's participation in a contingency operation and the cancellation occurs within 48 hours of the time the leave would have commenced." FLRA ignored, however, that military personnel do not enjoy the collective bargaining rights accorded to civilian employees under the collective bargaining law for the terms and conditions of their employment<span class="Italic">. Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7114 <span class="Italic">with</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976; <span class="Italic">see Ass'n of Civilian Technicians, Wichita Air Capitol Chapter v. FLRA,</span> 360 F.3d 195, 196 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Congress, consequently, must enact specific laws to provide military personnel any employment rights or benefits, including reimbursement for such out-of-pocket losses<span class="Italic">. See</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 976(c)(2). FLRA thus failed to consider adequately the Union's argument that, by parity of reasoning, Provision 2 reimbursements are statutorily authorized because the collective bargaining law lends a similar congressional imprimatur to conditions of employment resulting from collective bargaining agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">FLRA's alternate holding that Provision 2 reimbursements are barred by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5536 is likewise flawed. Section &#x00A7; 5536 prohibits the receipt by federal employees with statutorily fixed salaries of "additional pay or allowance...for any other service or duty" without specific authorization. The plain text of &#x00A7; 5536 limits its reach to payment for "other service or duty" falling within a federal employee's duties for which compensation is fixed by Congress. The Supreme Court explained in <span class="Italic">Stansbury v. United States,</span> 8 Wall. 33, 75 U.S. 33, 37, 19 L. Ed. 315 (1868), of &#x00A7; 5536's predecessor, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 70 (1842), that "[t]he law was passed to remedy an evil which had existed, of detailing officers with fixed pay to perform duties outside of their regular employment, and paying them for it, when the government was entitled, without this double pay, to all their services." <span class="Italic">See also Mullett v. United States,</span> 150 U.S. 566, 569-70, 29 Ct. Cl. 558, 14 S. Ct. 190, 191-92, 37 L. Ed. 1184 (1893); <span class="Italic">United States v. Johnson,</span> 173 U.S. 363, 372-81, 19 S. Ct. 427, 430-34, 43 L. Ed. 731 (1899); <span class="Italic">Lewis v. United States,</span> 244 U.S. 134, 145-46, 37 S. Ct. 570, 574-75, 61 L. Ed. 1039 (1917).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Congress's concern with "additional pay or allowance" is not implicated by negotiation of a "condition of employment" under the collective bargaining law, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114, to reimburse civilian employees for out-of-pocket losses incurred as a result of the Agency's exercise of a management right<span class="Italic">. See id.</span> &#x00A7; 7106(a)-(b). Upon recall, Union members will receive their regular fixed compensation for service to the Guard; the question is not whether they will receive additional pay for "other service or duty," but whether they must absorb unavoidable monetary losses caused by the Agency's recall. There was no suggestion in <span class="Italic">Stansbury</span> that reimbursement of expenses incurred as a result of employment is prohibited by &#x00A7; 5536; indeed, the actual expenses had been paid in that case. 75 U.S. at 34-35, 36. Counsel for FLRA conceded at oral argument that the Agency has discretion to negotiate reimbursements for personal expenses such as uniform allowances, certain health benefits, and personal travel expenses associated with transporting the employee to the work site upon recalling the employee's leave. FLRA's view that Agency reimbursement of such personal expenses is not "additional pay or allowance" prohibited under &#x00A7; 5536 weakens its reliance on &#x00A7; 5536 in concluding that Provision 2 reimbursements are barred and, therefore, nonnegotiable under the collective bargaining law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because FLRA's decision on remand failed to provide an adequate explanation of its decision on the first remanded issue and failed altogether to address the second remanded issue, we grant the petition and remand the case to FLRA. This time on remand FLRA shall, if it adheres to its conclusion on the first remanded issue in <span class="Italic">ACT I,</span> provide an explanation in accordance with the guidance provided by this opinion and in light of any further arguments of the Union or the Agency on remand. In addition, in order to avoid another remand in the event the Union petitions for review of FLRA's adherence to its original position on the first remanded issue, FLRA shall also determine whether Provision 2 is an "appropriate arrangement[ ]" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent">Back from court, FLRA reaffirmed the nonnegotiability of the travel reimbursement provision, <span class="Italic">ACT Puerto Rico Army Chap. and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-180.html">60 FLRA 1000</a>, 1004-08 (2005) (recon. den., 62 FLRA 144 (2007), <span class="Italic">post</span>):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the following reasons, we find that the provision is outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We address the issues in the order presented by the court.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Whether the provision might or might not constitute "official business" within the meaning of the BATF v</span>.<span class="Italic"> FLRA footnote and Authority precedent</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In response to the court's remand, and the Union's argument, we address whether the provision is within the duty to bargain on the ground that the reimbursements required by the provision are authorized by the "official business" standard in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span> and Authority precedent applying the "official business" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, the issue before the Supreme Court was whether the authorization for official time under &#x00A7; 7131(a) of the Statute also authorized union representatives to a per diem allowance and travel expenses. The Court reversed the Authority's holding that the Statute provided authorization for such expenses. However, the Court found that agencies could "mak[e] such payments upon a determination that they serve the convenience of the agency or are otherwise in the primary interest of the Government, as was the practice prior to the passage of the [Statute]." 464 U.S. 89, 107 n.17 (1983) (citing n.11). In this respect, the Court noted that prior to the passage of the Statute, such per diem payments to employee negotiators were authorized pursuant to the Travel Expense Act, which expressly provides that a federal employee "traveling on official business away from [his or her] designated post of duty...is entitled to...a per diem allowance." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702(a). The Court explained that under the Travel Expense Act, agencies may authorize per diem allowances for travel "upon a certification that the employees' travel served the convenience of the employing agency," or would be in the "primary interest of the [g]overnment[,]" so as to be regarded as "official business." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 106, 101 n.11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, in context, the Court's discussion clearly indicates that the Travel Expense Act provided authorization for travel expenses for union representatives only in certain circumstances--where the agency had certified or determined that the expenses were in the "primary interest of the government," under the official business standard. Contrary to the Union's assertions, the Court in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span> did not establish a general, "official business" standard authorizing the expenses under the instant provision.<span class="Italic"> </span>Rather, the Court first found and relied on a statutory authorization (the Travel Expense Act) permitting the expenditure of funds for this purpose. Without the statutory authorization of the Travel Expense Act, there would have been no basis for the Court's application of the official business standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, since the Travel Expense Act does not apply here, it cannot serve as a statutory basis for the application of the "official business" standard in this case. <span class="Italic">See ACT v. FLRA I</span>, 269 F.3d at 1116-17 (court reversed Authority's finding that the Travel Expense Act governs the instant provision, noting that "no faithful reading of the Travel Expense Act, which establishes 'entitled' reimbursement or allowance 'when traveling on official business' is relevant to the disputed provision, which provides compensation for unavoidable expenses resulting from canceled leave"). The Court's application of that standard in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span> did not create a <span class="Italic">general</span> "official business" standard that would substitute for statutory or regulatory provisions that expressly authorize expenditures for official business. Further, nothing in the 2000 DOD Appropriations Act authorizes the expenditure of funds for this purpose. Without a statutory authorization already in place that expressly authorizes the expenditures required by the provision, there is nothing against which to apply the "official business" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Our review of <span class="Italic">GSA</span> and <span class="Italic">BATF</span> reaffirms our conclusion that the "official business" standard cannot be generally applied in the absence of relevant statutory or regulatory provisions that expressly authorize certain expenditures for official business. In <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, the Authority found that the agency had the discretion to pay for telephones used by unions under the applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, which expressly authorized expenditures for telephone service for "official business" that is necessary "in the interest of the [Government]." <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 24 FLRA at 432-33 (citing 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1348(b), 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 201-38.007)). In so holding, the Authority relied on its holding in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span> that bargaining over the payment of union travel expenses for collective bargaining was permissible because such payment was within the agency's discretion under the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, which authorized expenditures for "official business" that "is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government[.]" <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA at 10, 15, 18 (citing Travel Expense Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702; Federal Travel Regulations &#x00A7; 1-1.4).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_740"></span>Thus, <span class="Italic">GSA</span> and <span class="Italic">BATF</span> establish that the Authority applied the "official business" test in these cases because relevant statutory provisions explicitly allowed the use of government telephones for "official business." In contrast, there are no analogous statutory or regulatory provisions in this case that expressly grant agencies discretionary authority to make the reimbursements under the provision. In the absence of such applicable statutory and regulatory provisions, the "official business" test is not applicable in this case and, therefore, cannot serve as a basis to determine that the Agency has discretion to reimburse employees as required by the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Whether the Statute, see 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), &#x00A7; 7114, being itself sufficiently within the interest of the United States, see id. &#x00A7; 7101, creates 'official business.'</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Statute neither creates official business nor provides a statutory basis to apply the official business standard.&#x2003;Unlike the Travel Expense Act, nothing in the Statute warrants application of the "official business" standard to determine whether agencies have discretion to expend appropriated funds. Here again, <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span> is highly instructive. The Court found that Congress' declaration in &#x00A7; 7101(a) that collective bargaining is in the public interest did not warrant the conclusion that employee negotiators are on "official business" of the Government under the Travel Expense Act so as to entitle them to travel expenses. The Court found nothing in the Statute or its legislative history to demonstrate that Congress intended union negotiators to be allowed per diem and travel expenses on the theory that they were engaged in Government business. 464 U.S. at 99. Indeed, the Court found that even as to those employees acting in an "official capacity," Congress generally provides explicit authorization for such payments. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 105 (citing Travel Expense Act, &#x00A7; 5702, &#x00A7; 5751(b), &#x00A7; 6322(b)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Likewise, nothing in the Statute or its legislative history indicates that Congress intended &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) or &#x00A7; 7101(a) to constitute spending authorization for agencies to reimburse employees in the manner required by the provision as official business.[2] Moreover, neither the Authority nor the courts have found the Statute to constitute an independent statutory basis for authorizing agencies to expend funds as required by the provision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[2]&#x2003;We note that in <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>, the court vacated an order for monetary relief requiring the agency to reimburse unit employees for all monies lost or interest incurred as a result of agency actions. The court held that such relief constituted money damages or "a sum of money used as compensatory relief...given to the plaintiff as a substitute for a suffered loss...." 56 F.3d at 276. Further, the court held that the remedial provision under &#x00A7; 7118(a)(7) of the Statute did not unambiguously establish a waiver of immunity to money damages. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 277-79. As relevant here, the court noted that Congress' waiver of sovereign immunity must be "unequivocally express[ed]...on the face of the statute[, and]...cannot be discerned in...legislative history." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 277. As such, <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span> supports the need for independent statutory authorization, separate and apart from the duty to bargain imposed by the Statute, for the expenditures required by the instant provision that would reimburse employees for incurred losses as a result of the Agency's cancellation of leave.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Rather, long-standing Authority precedent reflects that "matters concerning conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining when they are within the discretion of an agency and are not otherwise inconsistent with law[.]" <span class="Italic">Patent Office Professional Ass'n</span>, 53 FLRA 625, 648 (1997); <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 6, 10 (1986) (<span class="Italic">NTEU</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Dep't of Treasury, United States Customs Service v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The Authority found in <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA</span> and <span class="Italic">BATF</span> that the Statute required the agencies to bargain over travel expenses for union negotiators and union use of government telephones since the agencies had discretion over such matters under law as discussed above and these matters were not otherwise contrary to law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">The implications of the Authority's previous rulings in BATF and GSA that the Agency could exercise its discretion to use appropriated funds for union-use of government telephones for labor-management relations</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As explained in detail above, <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span> and the Authority's decisions establish the need for independent and express statutory authorization for the expenditure of funds separate and distinct from the duty to bargain imposed by the Statute.[3] Contrary to the Union's assertions, these cases do not support the proposition that the Statute provides implicit spending authority for the agencies to pay union representatives for per diem allowances or travel expenses incurred in connection with collective bargaining in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, or that the Statute provides authorization for the union's use of government telephones. As discussed above, in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, and <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, the respective statutory and/or regulatory provisions under the Travel Expense Act and 31 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1348(b) and 41 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 201-38.007, not the Statute, granted the agencies discretion to determine whether the expenditures were in relation to "official business," and sufficiently within the interest of the United States to permit agencies to expend funds for those purposes.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;We note that unlike the reimbursements in this case, the examples cited at oral argument, such as payments for uniform allowances, certain health benefits, and employee travel expenses, have been authorized by Congress: uniform allowances are authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5901; uniform health benefits for non-appropriated fund employees are considered under &#x00A7; 349 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995; and travel expenses are authorized under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5701, <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">D.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Whether for reasons of adequate staffing, retention, recruitment, or morale, for example, such reimbursements might advance the Agency's interests or convenience under the official business standard</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have found that the "official business" standard is not applicable in this case. Nonetheless, we are mindful of the court's instruction on remand to determine whether the provision constitutes "official business."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "official business" standard has been articulated in terms of whether the activity involved was sufficiently in the interest of the United States so as to be regarded as official business, served the convenience of the agency or was otherwise in the primary interest of the Government. <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA at 10 (citing <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>, at 100-01 n.11 and 107 n.17, citing 46 Comp. Gen. 21 (1966)); <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 24 FLRA at 432-33; <span class="Italic">BATF</span>, 26 FLRA at 498. To this end, we acknowledge that the provision might serve the Agency's interests by promoting employee morale and mitigating disappointment over the cancellation of leave and any incurred financial losses by employees. However, the Union has not established that the provision would serve the interests of the Agency in any of the other categories.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to adequate staffing, regardless of the existence of this provision, the Agency has the right to cancel leave of employees in order to fulfill its objectives or mission in "provid[ing] 'trained personnel' for 'mobilization in times of war, national emergency or civil disruption." 60 FLRA at 347 (citing <span class="Italic">New York Council, Ass'n of Civil Tech. v. FLRA</span>, 757 F.2d 502, 505 (2d Cir. 1985)). This provision does not enhance the Agency's ability to adequately deploy or mobilize personnel. We reject the Union's claims that the provision would necessarily make managers less reluctant to cancel leave and assign work, since the provision could deter the Agency from deploying or mobilizing certain employees on leave in light of the financial liability it may incur for the employees' personal losses.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to retention or recruitment, we similarly find that the Union has not demonstrated that the provision would advance the primary interests or convenience of the Agency. Although the provision might provide a possible boost in employee morale, it is nevertheless hard to quantify or assess the benefit to the Agency in terms of retention and recruitment. Nothing in the record suggests that retention and recruitment is a problem under current Agency policy and rules. Also, it is reasonable to conclude that employees, or those considering employment with the Guard, realize that the Agency may be compelled to cancel leave without much notice in order to deploy and mobilize personnel, especially under current circumstances. As such, it is hard to assess, what, if any, impact the provision would have on the Agency's retention and recruitment efforts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Thus, notwithstanding any improvement in employee morale, which is highly speculative at best, we find that the Union has not demonstrated that the provision would advance the Agency's interests in ensuring adequate staffing, retention and recruitment. As a result, we find that the provision is not sufficiently within the primary interest of the Agency so as to constitute official business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">E.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Whether the Provision Constitutes an Appropriate Arrangement</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">As instructed by the court, we will address whether the provision constitutes an appropriate arrangement, and that determination will inform our analysis of whether the reimbursements are for, or related to, official business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In determining whether a provision is an appropriate arrangement, the Authority follows the analysis set forth in <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R14-87</span>, 21 FLRA 24 (1986) (<span class="Italic">KANG</span>). Under this analysis, the Authority first determines whether the provision is intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. <span class="Italic">See KANG,</span> 21 FLRA at 31; <span class="Italic">see also United States Dep't of the Treasury, Office of the Chief Counsel, IRS v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1073 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The claimed arrangement must also be sufficiently tailored to compensate employees suffering adverse effects attributable to the exercise of management's rights.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Customs Serv., </span>55 FLRA at 1187. If the provision is determined to be an arrangement, then the Authority determines whether it is appropriate, or whether it is inappropriate because it excessively interferes with the relevant management right(s). <span class="Italic">See KANG</span>, 21 FLRA at 31-33. In doing so, the Authority weighs the benefits afforded to employees under the arrangement against the intrusion on the exercise of management's rights. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_741"></span>As applied here, even assuming that the provision constitutes an arrangement that is sufficiently tailored, we would find, in agreement with Member Pope's concurrence in <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Nat'l Guard II</span>, that it is not appropriate because it excessively interferes with the Agency's rights to assign work and assign employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1985</span>, 55 FLRA 1145, 1148 (1999) (right to assign work under &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2)(B) of the Statute encompasses the right to determine the particular duties to be assigned, when work assignments will occur, and to whom or what positions the duties will be assigned). In this regard, the provision would require the Agency to reimburse employees not only for expenses necessary to return to work from cancelled leave, but also for unused theater, sports, and banquet tickets. The Agency's liability under the provision is so uncontrollable, so unforeseeable, and so unrelated to the Agency's exercise of its right to assign work as to be excessive. In this respect, the absence of any limit or cap on the Agency's potential economic liability would interfere with or hinder the Agency's decisions to cancel leave of employees in mobilizing and deploying employees for military missions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The provision would essentially impose a penalty on the Agency's exercise of its rights in mobilizing and deploying employees for missions if the Agency decides that it cannot afford to cancel an employee's leave because of the financial obligations it would incur. In this respect, the provision requires the Agency to consider the financial effects of assigning employees work as result of cancelling their leave. We find that imposing such financial considerations is at odds with the scope of the Agency's right to assign work.[4] Moreover, by requiring the Agency to consider the cost of a financial penalty, which varies from employee to employee, in determining whether to recall employees, the provision conflicts with the already noted mission of the Guard as "a military organization dedicated to a military mission that provides 'trained personnel' for 'mobilization in times of war, national emergency or civil disruption.'" 60 FLRA at 347.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In addition, we note again the absence of any expression of Congressional intent to require the Agency as a general matter to reimburse the employees in this case for the expenses required by the provision. As the Statute is not an independent authorization to pay for expenditures such as those at issue here, a separate statutory authorization must first be identified in order to expend funds, as in <span class="Italic">GSA</span> and <span class="Italic">BATF</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we reject the Union's contentions that the absence of a cap on reimbursable expenses constitutes precise tailoring that renders the proposal appropriate and that the Agency can foresee the amount of the reimbursements based on the duration of the leave and the income level of the affected employees. These factors do not provide a reliable gauge of the Agency's liability, since employees could use credit to purchase vacations that are well beyond their income levels. Similarly, the adverse effects and incurred losses are subject to the employee's control since the employee can secure refundable, as opposed to non-refundable, reservations. Also, as the Agency notes, there are alternatives that employees can explore, such as trip insurance, that would minimize the employee's losses, and in turn, the Agency's liability. In addition, the Union's reliance on <span class="Italic">NAGE</span> is misplaced since that proposal involved the use of nonappropriated funds that are not subject to the same statutory restrictions on the use of appropriated funds at issue here. <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1647</span>, 59 FLRA 369 (2003).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, in balancing these competing interests, we find that the burden on management's rights to assign work and assign employees outweighs the benefits to employees given the excessive interference with the Agency's rights, and that the provision is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, in light of our analysis and finding that the provision excessively interferes with the Agency's rights to assign work and assign employees and that it does not constitute an appropriate arrangement, we find no basis to change our conclusion that the provision is not sufficiently within the primary interest of the Agency so as to constitute official business.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the Agency properly disapproved the provision and that the Union's petition for review should be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hoping to bring finality to the 2000 case, FLRA denied reconsideration of its 2005 decision in the 2007 determination in <span class="Italic">ACT Puerto Rico Army Chap. and DOD, Nat'l Guard Bureau</span>, 62 FLRA 144, 145-46 (2007):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Union's contention that the Authority "erroneously overlooked" the second sentence of footnote 17 in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA</span>. The second sentence of footnote 17 states: "Furthermore, unions may presumably negotiate for such payments in collective bargaining as they do in the private sector." 464 U.S. at 107 n.17. The Union argues that this sentence does not rely on the Travel Expense Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5702(a), and that "the Court was saying that the federal employee collective bargaining law presumably authorizes negotiation of the [per diem] payments just as the private sector bargaining law does."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's contention, the Court's observation in footnote 17 of <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA </span>that "presumably" agencies could agree to the payment of travel expenses for union negotiators does not indicate that such agreements would be authorized pursuant to the Statute, without regard to the standards for such payment in the Travel Expense Act. 464 U.S. at 107 n.17. Rather, the context of this comment, at the end of a discussion of reimbursement for such expenses under the standards of the Travel Expense Act, implies that such agreements would be governed by the same standards as unilateral payments by agencies under that Act, which are also discussed in the footnote.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Court's reference to the fact that travel expenses are a subject of bargaining in the private sector does not establish that the Statute authorizes bargaining in the same manner as bargaining in the private sector. As the Court has also explained, labor relations in the federal and private sectors are governed by different statutes and follow different rules where the statutes differ. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def. v. FLRA, </span>510 U.S. 487, 503 (1994) (union's right to obtain home address lists in private sector has "little relevance" to information disclosure in federal sector). Applying the foregoing distinction, the payment of travel expenses for union negotiators has been found negotiable because, as relevant here, "such payment was within the agency's discretion under the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions, which authorized expenditures for `official business' that `is necessary to accomplish the purposes of the Government[.]'" <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Army Chapter II</span>, 60 FLRA at 1005 (quoting <span class="Italic">NTEU</span>, 21 FLRA 6, 10, 15, 18 (1986) (citing Travel Expense Act; Federal Travel Regulations &#x00A7; 1-1.4)), <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Dep't of the Treasury, United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 836 F.2d 1381 (D.C. Cir. 1988)). This rationale is fully consistent with the Court's decision in <span class="Italic">BATF.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the above reasons, we reject the Union's contention that the decision in <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Army Chapter II</span> is inconsistent with footnote 17 in <span class="Italic">BATF v. FLRA.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also contends that the Authority "erroneously invoke[d]" <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>. The Union maintains that "enforcement of the provision would be permissible equitable relief," and not "monetary damages impermissible without an express waiver of sovereign immunity."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In<span class="Italic"> Fort Benjamin Harrison</span>, the court explained that the waiver of sovereign immunity that permits the Authority, in remedying an unfair labor practice, to order "any remedial action" or "such other action" under &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7105(g)(3) and 7118(a)(7)(D) of the Statute, respectively, encompasses the power to impose equitable, rather than legal, remedies. 56 F.3d at 277. In <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Army Chapter II</span>, the Authority relied on <span class="Italic">Fort Benjamin Harrison</span> solely to illustrate the point that waivers of sovereign immunity must be expressed. 60 FLRA at 1006 n.2. The Authority did not imply that the distinction between equitable and legal remedies in unfair labor practice cases has any bearing on an agency's authority to agree to particular union proposals. It does not.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In any event, as Fort<span class="Italic"> Benjamin Harrison </span>explains, "money damages" refers to a sum of money given as compensation and as a substitute for a suffered loss, while the remedy in an equitable action for specific relief attempts to provide plaintiffs with the very thing to which they are entitled. 56 F.3d at 276. Following this definition and contrary to the assertion of the Union, the provision in this case would apparently provide remedies that are legal, rather than equitable. The provision permits the reimbursement by the Agency of personal monetary losses of employees for "hotel reservations, airline tickets, etc." as a result of the Agency's cancellation of approved leave. <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Army Chapter II, </span>60 FLRA at 1000. The employees would thus receive compensation for a suffered loss, rather than the thing they are entitled to.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Lastly, the Union's claim that the Authority's conclusion that the proposal is not an appropriate arrangement is inconsistent with <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26 </span>is misplaced. In <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26,</span> which, as the Authority noted, involved the use of non-appropriated funds, the question of whether the proposal was an appropriate arrangement was not before the Authority. <span class="Italic">Puerto Rico Army Chapter II, </span>60 FLRA at 1008. That case therefore does not provide any support for the Union's claim that the proposal here is an appropriate arrangement under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, the Union has not established that the Authority erred in relying on <span class="Italic">BATF, Fort Benjamin Harrison </span>or <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R4-26, </span>or that other extraordinary circumstances warrant reconsideration of the Authority's decision. Accordingly, we deny the motion.</p>
<p class="noindent">But finality was not achieved. For the third time, <span class="Italic">ACT</span> returned to court, and the court affirmed FLRA through deference to FLRA's determination that the proposal was not an appropriate arrangement because the unlimited liability it potentially created for the agency (a guarantee to reimburse prepaid vacation expenses) excessively interfered with the exercise of the management right to cancel leave. At least eight years after the initial proposal was presented by the union to management for bargaining, the litigation concluded when the court decided, <span class="Italic">ACT Puerto Rico Army Chap. v. FLRA</span>, 534 F.3d 772, 776-78 (D.C. Cir. 2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In general, the collective bargaining statute imposes upon federal agencies and labor organizations a duty to bargain in good faith with respect to <span id="page_742"></span>conditions of employment, subject to certain exceptions. <span class="Italic">See generally</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7102, 7103(a)(12), 7114(a)(4), 7117(a); <span class="Italic">ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1217. One such exception is set forth in &#x00A7; 7106(a), which excludes enumerated "management rights" from the realm of negotiation. <span class="Italic">See Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 47 F.3d 1217, 1220 (D.C. Cir. 1995). As is relevant here, &#x00A7; 7106(a) provides that, "[s]ubject to subsection (b) of this section, nothing in this chapter shall affect the authority of any management official of any agency" to "assign...employees" and to "assign work." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(a)(2). Subsection 7106(b) then "lists certain kinds of proposals that would affect these managerial rights, yet remain proper subjects of collective bargaining." <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees [AFGE]</span> <span class="Italic">, AFL-CIO, Local 1923 v. FLRA</span>, 819 F.2d 306, 308 (D.C. Cir. 1987). In particular, &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) states that "[n]othing in this section shall preclude any agency and any labor organization from negotiating...appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the exercise of any authority under this section by such management officials." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3) (emphasis added). Hence, "a proposal advancing...an appropriate arrangement for adversely affected employees falls within the scope of an agency's duty to bargain, notwithstanding that implementation of the proposal would affect the enumerated managerial rights." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span>, 819 F.3d at 308.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To determine whether a proposal is an "appropriate arrangement" under &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), FLRA asks whether the proposal "excessively interferes" with management rights. <span class="Italic">National Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R14-87 and Kansas Army Nat'l Guard</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. (No. 4) 24, 31 (1986) (KANG). FLRA adopted that test upon this circuit's suggestion, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>(citing <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees [AFGE]</span> <span class="Italic">, AFL-CIO, Local 2782 v. FLRA</span>, 702 F.2d 1183, 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1983)), and we have repeatedly cited it with approval in reviewing FLRA decisions, <span class="Italic">see ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1221; <span class="Italic">Patent Office Prof'l Ass'n</span>, 47 F.3d at 1221; <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span>, 819 F.2d at 308-09. Under the test, "[a]ssuming that the proposal, as a threshold matter, suggests an arrangement for adversely affected employees, the decisionmaker must ask whether implementation of the proposed arrangement would 'impinge upon management prerogatives to an excessive degree.'" <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span>, 819 F.3d at 308 (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2782</span>, 702 F.2d at 1188). As FLRA does not dispute that the reimbursement provision "is intended to ameliorate the adverse effects of the exercise of a management right, i.e., the cancellation of leave," FLRA Br. 36, the only issue is whether the provision's interference with that right is excessive.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">"The determination whether an interference with managerial prerogatives is excessive depends primarily on the extent to which the interference hampers the ability of an agency to perform its core functions--to get its work done in an efficient and effective way." <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923,</span> 819 F.3d at 308-309. That inquiry involves "weighing the competing practical needs of employees and managers." <span class="Italic">KANG</span>, 21 F.L.R.A. at 31-32. We "afford considerable deference to the FLRA's balancing of management and employee interests under its 'excessive interference' test." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Treasury, Office of Chief Counsel, I.R.S. v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 1068, 1074 (D.C. Cir. 1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, FLRA determined that the disputed reimbursement provision would excessively interfere with management's right "to assign work and assign employees." Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1007. The Authority noted that "the provision would require the Agency to reimburse employees not only for expenses necessary to return to work from cancelled leave, but also for unused theater, sports, and banquet tickets."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> "The agency's liability under the provision," FLRA held, "is so uncontrollable, so unforeseeable, and so unrelated to the Agency's exercise of its right to assign work as to be excessive."<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>In particular, "the absence of any limit or cap on the Agency's potential economic liability would interfere with or hinder the Agency's decisions to cancel leave of employees in mobilizing and deploying employees for military missions." <span class="Italic">Id.; see ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1221 (noting that whether a provision excessively interferes with management rights "may turn on a variety of considerations, including, for example, whether or not there is a cap on the amount of individual expenditures or a limited period of time for covered expenditures").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">ACT argues that, with the reimbursement provision, "management might be <span class="Italic">less</span> disinclined to cancel and assign work [because] it knows that it can hold harmless, at least financially, the employee that it wants to do the work." ACT Br. 25. We do not discount the possibility that management <span class="Italic">might</span> react that way, but the sole question before us is whether the Authority's contrary analysis is unreasonable. And we see no basis upon which to reject as unreasonable FLRA's conclusion that an unlimited and uncontrollable financial obligation will dissuade the Guard from cancelling leave when necessary, thereby impeding the agency's ability to deploy its members and fulfill its mission. ACT effectively concedes as much, stating that "either view might be reasonable and sincerely held." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to ACT's contention,<span class="Italic"> id. </span>at 26, FLRA did not hold that an expenditure cap is always required if a reimbursement provision is to constitute an "appropriate arrangement." Rather, it stated only that, in the specific context of the provision at issue in this case, the lack of a cap exacerbates the burden on agency decisionmaking. <span class="Italic">See</span> Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1007; FLRA Br. 39 n.14. Nor did FLRA render a decision that applies to a broad swath of cases beyond the one before it. <span class="Italic">See</span> Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1007; Oral Arg. Recording at 12:30. Rather, the Authority emphasized that its decision was based on the relationship between the provision at issue and the particular agency mission with which it interferes. The "provision conflicts," the Authority held, "with the already noted mission of the Guard as 'a military organization dedicated to a military mission that provides trained personnel for 'mobilization in times of war, national emergency or civil disruption.'" Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1007-08 (quoting <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Wichita Air Capitol Chapter</span>, 60 F.L.R.A. (No. 73) 342, 347 (2004)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Authority's decision is not a departure from its own precedent, as ACT suggested below and at oral argument. As FLRA explained, the principal decision that ACT relies upon for this contention "involved the use of nonappropriated funds that are not subject to the same statutory restrictions on the use of appropriated funds at issue here." Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1008 (distinguishing National Ass'n of Gov't Employees, Local R426, 40 F.L.R.A. (No. 15) 118, 119-23 (1991)). In addition, "the question of whether the proposal was an appropriate arrangement was not before" the Authority in that case. <span class="Italic">Association of Civilian Technicians, Puerto Rico Army Chapter</span>, 62 F.L.R.A. (No. 38) 144, 146 (2007) (order denying motion for reconsideration). And "unlike the reimbursements in this case," FLRA noted, the other precedents cited by ACT concerning "uniform allowances, certain health benefits, and employee travel expenses, have been [expressly] authorized by Congress." Order, 60 F.L.R.A. at 1008 n.3 (citing statutory authorizations).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that FLRA's determination that the disputed contract provision is not an appropriate arrangement survives the deferential standard of review applicable to its decisions under the collective bargaining statute. <span class="Italic">See BATF</span>, 464 U.S. at 97 &#x0026; n.7; <span class="Italic">ACT II</span>, 370 F.3d at 1219.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our previous opinion in this case, we stated that, if FLRA "adequately explained" a conclusion that the reimbursement provision was not an "appropriate arrangement" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106(b)(3), that "would presumably be the end of the matter." ACT II, 370 F.3d at 1221. FLRA has now provided an adequate explanation, and that does indeed end the matter. Accordingly, the petition for review is denied.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1647 and Dept. of Army, Tobyhanna Army Depot</span>, 59 FLRA 369 (2003) (the union agreed that appropriated funds were not authorized relative to a proposal that the employer pay expenses associated with cancellation of leave; the Authority decided against the union on the issue of whether a local "working-capital fund" was a source of nonappropriated funds).</p>
