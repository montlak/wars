<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-411"><span class="space">d.</span> Gross Procedural Error</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NAIL, Local 5 and DOD, DLA Texarkana</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-83.html">69 FLRA 573</a>, 576 (2016), considered the gross procedural error standard, affirming an award finding a contract overtime assignment violation resulting in a back pay award but no counsel fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also argues that attorney fees should be awarded under the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. This factor requires a party to show that an agency committed "a gross procedural error that prolonged the proceeding[&#8197;] or severely prejudiced the employee[&#8197;]."[52] In order to prove that there was a gross procedural error, a party must establish that the error amounts to more than "simple harmful error" warranting reversal of an agency action.[53] For example, the MSPB found that gross procedural error occurred warranting an award of attorney fees when an agency, while conducting a reduction-in-force (RIF), failed to give an employee the required specific RIF notice, did not establish required competitive areas, competitive levels, and retention lists, did not consider or honor the employee's bump and retreat rights, and did not accord him priority placement required for preference-eligible employees.[54]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[52]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE, Council 220</span>, 61 FLRA 582, 586 (2006) (<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[53]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[54]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id</span>. (citing <span class="Italic">Thomas v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 77 M.S.P.R. 502 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Thomas</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency's conduct did not warrant an award of attorney fees under the fourth factor. He concluded that the matter involved a "legitimate and good[-]faith dispute about the meaning of the [parties'] agreement," and that "the [A]gency here violated no procedural duty."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union claims that the Arbitrator erred when he found that the Agency had not committed a gross procedural error.&#x2003;But the Union fails to point to any evidence demonstrating that the Agency's violation of the overtime procedures in the parties' agreement amounts to more than simple harmful error. Specifically, the Union does not assert that the Agency's error "prolonged the proceeding[&#8197;]."[59] Further, even if the contractual duty that the Agency owed the grievant could properly be characterized as "procedural,"[60] the Union fails to demonstrate that the Agency's action, based on a "legitimate and good[-]faith dispute about the meaning of the [parties'] agreement,] constitutes the kind of disregard of a contractual duty that would rise to the level of a "gross procedural error."[62]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[59]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">AFGE</span>, 61 FLRA at 586.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[60]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[62]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Cf., e.g., Thomas</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 507 (finding that an agency's violation of virtually all of an employee's procedural protections in a RIF situation "was not only harmful, but gross" procedural error).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator did not, as the Union asserts, "impermissibly reexamin[e] or reevaluat[e]" his merits award when he found that the Agency "violated no procedural duties." Rather, the Arbitrator's examination of the record, in response to the Union's fee petition, was solely for the purpose of determining the applicability of the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, and the conclusions the Arbitrator reached were fully consistent with the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency committed a contract violation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, the Union's additional claim--that the fee award fails to draw its essence from the parties' agreement--merely restates its contrary-to-law claim that the Arbitrator erred by not finding that attorney fees were warranted under the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, despite finding that the Agency violated overtime procedures in the parties' agreement. As such, we do not address the Union's essence exception separately.[67]</p>

<p class="noindent">An award of fees was set aside when the arbitrator relied on gross procedural error because there was delay in initiation and conclusion of a suspension, but there was no prejudice to the grievant<span class="Italic">, DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1929</span>, 71 FLRA 597, 597-601 (2020) (Member DuBester dissenting):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 2012, the grievant "self-reported" that he had engaged in misconduct--specifically, that he had "filed for a change of his wife's immigration status" "counter to immigration procedures."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency conducted an investigation that ultimately lasted approximately two years.&#x2003;Two months after the investigation ended in July 2014, the Agency proposed the grievant's removal. The Agency placed the grievant on administrative duty and suspended his law-enforcement status, pending resolution of the proposed removal. But after the grievant and the Union presented to the Agency's deciding official written and oral replies to the proposed removal, the Agency reduced the removal to a fourteen-day suspension.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union filed a grievance contending that the Agency violated the parties' agreement by suspending the grievant without "just and sufficient cause," and by failing to provide him with notice of proposed discipline at "the earliest practical date," as Article 32, Section G of the parties' agreement required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator sustained the grievance in an award dated September 11, 2017 (merits award). As relevant here, the Arbitrator found that "[t]he evidence supports a finding of the requisite just and sufficient cause for the [g]rievant's suspension when the substantive merits of the case are viewed." Nevertheless, the Arbitrator found that the Agency "could have reasonably" proposed its discipline of the grievant much earlier, and "demonstrated unacceptable dilatory handling of this matter." The Arbitrator found that this delay, which he characterized as a "wholly procedural" basis for sustaining the grievance, violated Article 32, Section G's requirement that the Agency ensure "expedient discipline handling." He concluded that the Agency acted without just and sufficient cause, and he awarded the grievant make-whole relief. The Agency did not file exceptions to the merits award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union then filed a motion for attorney fees.&#x2003;The Union argued that an award of attorney fees was warranted "in the interest of justice" under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) and <span class="Italic">Allen</span>.[16]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[16]&#x2003;2 M.S.P.R. 420.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the fee award dated December 6, 2017, the Arbitrator granted the Union's motion and awarded attorney fees. The Arbitrator found that, after investigating for sixty-two days, the Agency then "allowed the matter to sit inactive and dormant." According to the Arbitrator, the Agency's delay included fourteen months during which the Agency waited for a response from the Department of Justice (Justice Department) concerning the grievant's ability to be a witness in immigration proceedings. The Arbitrator noted that the proposal letter stated that "it is very likely that [the grievant's] actions ha[d] the potential of permanently damaging [his] ability to serve as a [g]overnment witness, which is an inherent part of [his] position." Nevertheless, in the Arbitrator's view, the Justice Department's response had "no bearing on the Agency's discipline of the [g]rievant" because the issue that the Agency raised with the Justice Department "[did] not form the basis for the Agency's proposed discipline." The Arbitrator also faulted the proposing official for the amount of time that elapsed between the completion of the Agency's investigation and the furnishing of the proposal letter. In total, the Arbitrator found that "695 days" passed between the grievant's report of his misconduct and the Agency's proposal to remove the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator also considered the Agency's violation of the grievant's contractual due process rights under Article 32, Section G: Further, the Arbitrator found that "the problematic time delay was immediately obvious" and "glaringly noticeable to the Agency." Based on these considerations, the Arbitrator concluded that the Agency's actions "constitute[d] a gross procedural error" under <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, thereby demonstrating that fees were warranted in the interest of justice under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). Although the Union raised other arguments in favor of an attorney-fee award consistent with <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> guidelines, the Arbitrator did not address those arguments.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the fee award is contrary to the Back Pay Act,[30] which incorporates &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)'s interest-of-justice standards for attorney-fee awards. Specifically, the Agency argues that its violation of the parties' agreement was not a gross procedural error that warranted an award of attorney fees under the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[30]&#x2003;5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">After recently examining the Back Pay Act, analyzing the legislative history of the Civil Service Reform Act, and seeking input from the federal labor-management-relations community, the Authority reevaluated its treatment of the MSPB's interest-of-justice guidelines in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>. In <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 2076</span>[32] and <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1633</span>,[33] the Authority held that, although it must adhere to <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> core tenets, <span class="Italic">Allen's</span> guidelines, or categories, must be "adapted"[34] to suit the "context" in which the Authority operates[35]--including contractual disputes and disciplinary appeals that do not involve serious adverse actions. We follow that approach here in evaluating the Agency's exception.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Under the fourth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> guideline, in order to prove that an agency <span id="page_2467"></span>committed a "gross procedural error" warranting attorney fees, a party must demonstrate more than "simply 'harmful' procedural error such as suffices to require reversal of the agency action."[36] In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the MSPB noted legislative history that discussed gross procedural error as being a situation "where the employee has been dragged through a lengthy and costly legal proceeding while in fact he was <span class="Italic">innocent</span> of the charges when it was some procedural error."[37] Consistent with <span class="Italic">Allen</span>,[38] in assessing whether a gross procedural error has occurred, the MSPB balances the nature of, and any excuse for, the agency's error and the prejudice and burden that error caused the appellant.[39] "If, in the balance, the prejudice and burden to the appellant predominates, gross procedural error exists and the appellant is entitled to a fee award."[40] In this regard, the MSPB specifically requires that "the [procedural] error <span class="Italic">must have</span> resulted in 'prejudice and burden' to the appellant."[41]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's analysis in the fee award neglected these central concepts of prejudice and burden to the grievant. Indeed, the Arbitrator found that, on the merits alone, the evidence <span class="Italic">supported</span> "a finding of the requisite just and sufficient cause for the [g]rievant's suspension." The Arbitrator sustained the grievance and found no just and sufficient cause for the suspension only for procedural reasons: specifically, because the Agency violated Article 32, Section G by taking too long to investigate the grievant before the Agency proposed his suspension. But the Agency did not place the grievant on administrative duty until it proposed disciplining him, which means that the Agency's prolonged investigation did not exacerbate any negative effects that administrative-duty status had on the grievant. Ironically, it appears that, in the end, the grievant benefited from any delay because, absent that delay, the Arbitrator strongly suggested that he would have found just and sufficient cause to sustain the grievant's suspension.[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">cf. Lampack v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 29 M.S.P.R. 654, 658 n.6 (1986) (finding that agency's actions did not constitute "gross procedural error" when they "prejudiced the agency and not the appellant").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Arbitrator noted, much of the delay resulted from seeking advice from the Justice Department on the grievant's possible impairment as a witness in immigration proceedings. The Arbitrator faulted the Agency for waiting on that advice because, according to the Arbitrator, the grievant's impairment as a witness did "not form the basis for the Agency's proposed discipline." However, that conclusion conflicts with the Arbitrator's finding that the proposal letter expressly referred to the grievant's potential future impairment as a witness as one of the Agency's considerations. Most importantly, the Arbitrator did not find that the Agency's delay while corresponding with the Justice Department prejudiced and burdened the grievant. For example, the Arbitrator did not find that, if the Agency had proposed the grievant's removal fourteen months sooner, the grievant would have been any less responsible for his <span class="Italic">admitted</span> misconduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the foregoing reasons, we find that the length of the Agency's investigation did not cause the grievant to suffer prejudice and burden within the meaning of the MSPB's precedent on gross procedural error.[47]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[47]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See, e.g., Baldwin</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. at 421-22 (appellant relied on misinformation provided by agency that ultimately required him to file an MSPB appeal in order to have his "resignation" deemed involuntary so as to preserve his (ultimately successful) statutory right to appeal the separation, especially where agency, upon realization of its error, (1) did not correct--or inform the appellant of--its mistake, and (2) benefitted from its known error in opposing appellant's appeal); <span class="Italic">McKenna</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. at 410-11 (agency's failure to forward appellant's resume and other information to agency's reduction-in-force (RIF) team prejudiced appellant's substantive entitlement under the RIF); <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. at 507 (agency's action prejudiced appellant's substantive RIF rights); <span class="Italic">Mercer v. Dep't of HHS</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 115, 121-22 (1989) (evidence showed that appellant might not have been removed if he had been afforded a pre-decision hearing or advisory arbitration); <span class="Italic">Coltrane v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 6, 9 (1986) (agency's failure in the proposal and decision notices to give appellant sufficient factual specificity of the allegations she must refute or acts she must justify impaired her ability to defend against agency's action and prolonged the proceeding); <span class="Italic">McInville v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 31 M.S.P.R. 297, 301 (1986) (agency failed to provide appellant with proper notice of the proposed action; when appellant informed agency that he had not received the notice of proposed action, agency denied his request for an extension of time in which to reply to the charges, even though his request was made before the effective date of the action; and, had appellant been provided an opportunity to reply to the charges, he could have articulated the defense he presented at the MSPB hearing).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Regarding the Arbitrator's assertion that the Agency's delay impaired the grievant's due-process rights, we note that the grievant and his Union attorney were afforded the opportunity to respond to the proposed removal. And, once they did so, the Agency reduced the proposed removal to a fourteen-day suspension. Thus, the grievant's exercise of his due-process rights successfully resulted in the Agency's mitigation of his penalty. And there were no findings that would support a conclusion that the investigative delay infringed upon the grievant's due-process rights in a manner that constituted gross procedural error.[49]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[49]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span> Fee Award at 8-9 (finding that the Agency's violation of contractual procedural requirements necessarily meant that the grievant was deprived of due process amounting to a gross procedural error); <span class="Italic">McIver</span>, 52 M.S.P.R. at 649-50 (no gross procedural error where agency allegedly failed to follow its own personnel procedures, but employee "failed to allege any burden or harm that any such errors caused him"); <span class="Italic">Mitchell v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 51 M.S.P.R. 103, 114-15 (1991) (no gross procedural error where agency allegedly failed to provide employee with notice of constructive suspension and opportunity to respond, but employee failed to show that the agency's procedural error was "likely to have had a harmful effect upon the outcome of the case before the agency").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we set aside the Arbitrator's finding that attorney fees are warranted on the basis of a gross procedural error, as contrary to the Back Pay Act and &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find the record sufficient to determine whether the Union is entitled to attorney fees under the other <span class="Italic">Allen</span> categories that the Union raised below.[50] Because the Agency's delay in imposing discipline was not a "prohibited personnel practice," the Union is not entitled to attorney fees under the first <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category.[51] Further, we do not find that the Agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits,"[52] where, as here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency had just cause for its suspension of the grievant <span class="Italic">but for</span> its "wholly procedural" contractual violation.[53] Thus, attorney fees are not warranted in the interest of justice.[54]</p>
