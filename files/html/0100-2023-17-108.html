<h5 class="h5" id="sec10-109"><span class="space">c.</span> Funding Decision</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency has discretion to organize its operations; a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> modification of those operations will be sustained in a RIF challenge. <span class="Italic">Horne v. ICC</span>, 5 MSPR 208, 211, 5 MSPB 259 (1981). The agency decides what positions are required, where they are located, and when they are filled, abolished, or vacated. The Board does not substitute its judgment for agency managerial discretion. <span class="Italic">Hanks v. FEMA</span>, 23 MSPR 567, 572 (1984); <span class="Italic">Taylor v. Coast Guard</span>, 20 MSPR 457, 459-60 (1984) ("As the Board held in <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 2 MSPB 335, 337 (1980), it has no authority to review management considerations which underlie the exercise of agency discretion. Moreover, only the agency can decide what positions are required, where they are to be located, and when they are to be filled, abolished or vacated."). Planning the work and organizing the work force to accomplish agency objectives within available resources are management responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Connor v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 22 MSPR 123, 127 (1984). Once the agency makes a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> determination to reorganize, the reasons for selecting one position or another for abolition--e.g., workload needs, staffing needs, and employee morale--are beyond the Board jurisdiction and irrelevant to the RIF appeal. <span class="Italic">Caselli v. Dept. of Army</span>, 27 MSPR 196, 198 (1985).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will not second-guess the agency as to the wisdom of program cuts causing the RIF. <span class="Italic">Bacon v. DHUD</span>, 20 MSPR 408, 413 (1984). This principle was affirmed in <span class="Italic">Bacon v. DHUD</span>, 757 F.2d 265, 269 (Fed. Cir. 1985). As to the argument advanced by the appellants that a reorganization did not truly occur, the court determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, substantial evidence supports this basis for the RIF. That HUD headquarters had exceeded personnel ceilings at the expense of field offices is amply supported by the testimony....&#8197;Further testimony supports that there was a decline in the need for certain types of specialists. The testimony of witnesses for petitioner, that they had observed no workload and skills imbalances, was properly disregarded by the presiding official for the reason that these witnesses were not members of management and were not involved in the RIF determination. Workload and skills imbalances, as used here in the budgetary sense, cannot be "observed." Even though all employees in HUD headquarters may have had work to do, a reorganization might, nevertheless, have been required to fulfill overall agency objectives.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant also contended in <span class="Italic">Bacon</span> that the Board erred by refusing to approve as a witness the Secretary of DHUD who, it was argued, was the only one in a position to testify firsthand as to the basis for the RIF action, but, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 269-70:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioners misapprehend the scope of judicial review of administrative action. Contrary to petitioners' view, the MSPB and this court are not empowered, under the circumstances here, to look behind the stated basis for the RIF. Where an agency undertakes administrative action without stating reasons therefore, a court may set aside such action. <span class="Italic">Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe</span>, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). However, the Supreme Court has unequivocably drawn the line against inquiry into the mental process of an agency head. (citing <span class="Italic">United States v. Morgan</span>, 313 U.S. 409, 421-22 (1941) and <span class="Italic">Montgomery Ward &#x0026; Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp.</span>, 673 F.2d 1254, 1263-64 (CCPA 1982)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The MSPB has no authority to probe into the mental processes of the Secretary to ascertain whether a particular "political philosophy" influenced the RIF decision. The reasons were formally stated and the function of review here is to determine whether the record supports the stated reasons or not. A wider inquiry is inappropriate in this case. Accordingly, the presiding official properly refused to require the Secretary to testify.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is no requirement that the shortage of funds relate specifically to the positions sought to be abolished. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1989 NP No. 88-3463). The Federal Circuit explicitly left unresolved whether an <span id="Page_3116"></span>employee subjected to a RIF ever has standing under 5 USC 7701 to contest the legality of an executive decision to terminate a government activity made mandatory by Congress. <span class="Italic">Connor v. Dept. of Energy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1985 NP No. 85-554). But the standing issue may be mooted by <span class="Italic">Waksman v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 37 MSPR 640, 644-46 (1988), deciding that when an agency bases a RIF on a shortage of funds earmarked by Congress for a specific purpose, the shortage need not relate to the specific positions abolished. Under <span class="Italic">Waksman</span>, loss of funding for Project A does not preclude an agency from conducting a RIF of employees in Project B and redistributing some work carried on by employees in Project B to the employees formerly working on Project A:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In their petition for review, the appellants renew their contention that the agency's reduction-in-force action violated 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) because there was no shortage of funds for the project that employed appellants Heldenbrand, Harris, and Wise. In support of this allegation, they argue that they were separated in order to make room for employees whose work had been funded by solar funds, and that those employees, whose funds had been decreasing for years, should have been separated instead.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the arguments described above, we have asked the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for an advisory opinion concerning the following question: When an agency bases a reduction-in-force action on a shortage of funds, do the proper application and implementation of 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) require that the shortage relate to the specific positions abolished, where those funds are earmarked by Congress for a specific purpose? OPM has advised us that, in its opinion, the regulations do not require that the shortage of funds relate to the specific positions abolished. For the reasons stated below, we concur in that conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The permissible bases for a reduction in force are set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">lack of work; shortage of funds; insufficient personnel ceiling; reorganization; the exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights; or reclassification of an employee's position due to erosion of duties when such action will take effect after an agency has formally announced a reduction in force in the employee's competitive area and when the reduction in force will take effect within 180 days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency bears the burden of proving by preponderant evidence that its decision to effect a reduction-in-force action was based upon one or more of the reasons set forth at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2)<span class="Italic">. See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195, 201 (1980) (burden of proof is on the agency to support its decision in a reduction-in-force action by a preponderance of the evidence). As the administrative judge and OPM have noted, however, the Board has held that, when an agency has been shown to have invoked the reduction-in-force regulations for a reason stated in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a), the Board has no authority to review the management considerations that underlie the agency's exercise of its discretion. <span class="Italic">Griffin</span>, 2 MSPR at 171. <span class="Italic">See also LaBonte v. Department of Commerce,</span> 23 MSPR 534, 537 (1984). The Board also has held specifically that the agency, and not the Board, is responsible for deciding whether to retain or abolish particular positions during a reduction in force<span class="Italic">. Griffin,</span> 2 MSPR at 171; <span class="Italic">LaBonte,</span> 23 MSPR at 537. In addition, it has emphasized that an agency has "broad management discretion to take action to avoid [a deficit situation]," and that its authorities in this regard include the authority to conduct a reduction in force. <span class="Italic">LaBonte,</span> 23 MSPR at 537.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency in this case has shown that it conducted the reduction in force for proper reasons--i.e., because of a shortage of funds in the Center for Building Technology, and because of a reorganization resulting from that shortage of funds. Although the shortage of funds resulted from a decrease in solar funds, rather than from a decrease in the funds used to pay for the work that was being performed by appellants Wise, Harris, and Heldenbrand, and although the appellants believe that abolishing the positions covered by the lost solar funds is the only "rational" method of accommodating the shortage of funds, the agency has the authority to decide how to make this accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Griffin,</span> 2 MSPR at 171; <span class="Italic">LaBonte,</span> 23 MSPR at 537. In this case, it did so by redistributing appliance testing work to ten employees who performed that work on a part-time basis. This redistribution of work constitutes a reorganization; and a reorganization is one of the circumstances described in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a) as a valid basis for invocation of reduction-in-force regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants Heldenbrand, Harris, and Wise have noted that the work they previously performed continues to be done by other employees, including some who previously worked on the solar project where funds were eliminated. This situation, however, is not inconsistent with our finding that a reorganization took place. The appellants have not alleged, and the record does not show, that their previous positions continued to exist after the reorganization. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hoffman v. Department of Housing and Urban Development,</span> 22 MSPR 564, 569-70 (1984) (reduction-in-force action based on decision to abolish appellant's position could not be sustained because appellant showed that his position continued to exist). Instead, they have alleged only that particular duties they previously performed continue to be performed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the foregoing analysis, we find that the appellants have failed to rebut the agency's showing that it conducted the reduction in force for proper reasons.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 454, 458-59 (1997) (agency could invoke a RIF based on an anticipated budget shortfall; the RIF was not invalid because later grants of funds temporarily eliminated its financial problems); <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 570 (1994) ("Even if...the agency might have avoided a RIF had it manipulated its budget in a different manner, it is within the agency's broad management discretion to take action to avoid a budget deficit....&#8197;[b]ecause the agency has shown that it is experiencing a shortage of funds, the Board lacks the authority to look behind the agency's decision to remedy that situation by invoking RIF regulations."); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Proctor v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 5 MSPR 464, 465 (1981) (the appellant's office "received a substantial portion of its funds from federal grants"; "grant funds were exhausted, resulting in abolition of appellant's unit"). It is appropriate for an agency to redistribute an appellant's duties as opposed to the duties of other positions if the route is more expeditious during a period of budgetary constraints. <span class="Italic">Foster v. Coast Guard</span>, 8 MSPR 240, 242, 7 MSPB 707 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Muellar v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 13 MSPR 550, 552-53 (1982) (an office was directed to reduce staff to meet budget limits; the abolition of two of five positions in the unit was required; the appellant's position was one of those two).

<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 454, 459 (1997), a RIF necessitated by a budgetary shortfall is not invalid because later grants of funds temporarily eliminated the agency's financial problems. <span class="Italic">McMillan v. Dept. of Army</span>, 84 MSPR 476, 481-83 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-9 (1999), extended <span class="Italic">Cook</span> to establish the general principle that once the agency in good faith declares a RIF for reasons of fiscal constraints, easing of the financial pinch at the time the RIF is effectuated will not serve as a basis for setting aside personnel actions resulting from the RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency established that it invoked the RIF regulations for one of the reasons specified in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a). According to Matthew Laws, the Chief of the Engineering and Planning Division for the Charleston (South Carolina) District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the agency became aware in January 1998, that the Department of Energy (DOE) planned on significantly decreasing the funding that DOE provided to the agency for work that the agency performed for the DOE at a site on the Savannah River. Laws stated that this funding was expected to drop from approximately $3,000,000 a year to $250,000 a year. Laws also stated that the agency was uncertain whether it would receive all of the funding necessary for deepening the Charleston Harbor, a project estimated to cost approximately $35,000,000. Accordingly, the Charleston District sought permission to conduct a RIF from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Manpower &#x0026; Reserve Affairs, Policy and Program Development Division, citing the loss of DOE funding, the increased cost of doing business, and a reduction in the District's funding for fiscal year 1999 (FY 99) as the reasons justifying the RIF. The appellant offered no evidence that would suggest that the agency officials did not honestly and reasonably anticipate decreased funding at the time that the agency invoked the RIF regulations. <span class="Italic">See Cross,</span> 127 F.3d at 1447 ("Whether the agency officials honestly and reasonably anticipated a budgetary shortfall is a question of fact."). It is well settled that an expected loss of funds constitutes a sufficient basis for a RIF. <span class="Italic">See id.; Cook v. Department of the Interior,</span> 74 MSPR 454, 458, <span class="Italic">aff'd sub nom. Shank v. Department of the Interior,</span> 132 F.3d 50 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (Table); <span class="Italic">Sanders v. Department of the Army,</span> 64 MSPR 136, 139-40 (1994), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 50 F.3d 22 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (Table). Therefore, we find that the agency established that it invoked the RIF regulations due to a shortage of funds, one of the reasons specified in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the initial decision also indicated that the agency had a legitimate reason to invoke the RIF regulations when it decided to conduct the RIF, the administrative judge nevertheless reversed the agency action because she found that the agency failed to prove that it had, or was facing, a shortage of funds at the time it effected the personnel actions necessitated by the RIF. In support of this conclusion, the administrative Judge cited staff meeting notes that indicated that "additional projects were obtained, progress was made on the Charleston Harbor Deepening and Widening Project, and the financial outlook for the Charleston District of the Corps of Engineers was improving." She also cited other evidence in the record that indicated that the financial prospects for the Charleston District were improving. In essence, the appellant was permitted to challenge the legitimacy of the RIF based on evidence of the agency's financial situation as of the effective date of the RIF action affecting his position. This was error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has long recognized that an agency has "broad management discretion" to take action to avoid a budgetary deficit. <span class="Italic">Labonte v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Commerce,</span> 23 MSPR 534, 537 (1984). We have also held that there need be no actual deficit in existence before an agency may exercise that discretion, and that an agency is not required to establish a "factual antecedent" in support of a RIF begun on the basis of a shortage of funds. <span class="Italic">See Cook,</span> 74 MSPR at 458-60. In <span class="Italic">Cook,</span> the Board went on to find that even if some funds were subsequently forthcoming, an otherwise <span id="Page_3117"></span>legitimately invoked RIF would not be disturbed absent a showing that such funds were specifically earmarked to prevent the RIF. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 460. We see no reason to depart from that holding here. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Cook</span> expressly rejected a federal district court case holding that an agency may not act on an <span class="Italic">anticipated</span> budget shortfall. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 459-60.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rejection of that latter proposition, and of the need for a factual antecedent proving the actual existence of a shortage of funds, necessarily means that, where an agency properly invokes RIF procedures based on reasonable budget anticipations, the Board will not go further and inquire as to the actual situation at the effective date of a RIF. To hold otherwise would require the Board to scrutinize an agency's precise financial circumstances on the effective date of the action. We find no justification in the regulations to impose a new general requirement mandating that every agency conducting an otherwise <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> RIF produce continued justification of that action right up to the day the personnel actions are effected. As stated in <span class="Italic">Labonte,</span> 23 MSPR at 537:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The Board will not second guess an agency's decision to reorganize its workforce as it has no authority to review the management considerations which underlie the exercise of discretion. Only the agency can decide what positions are required and when they are to be filled, abolished or vacated.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit's disinclination to review agency funding decisions leading to a RIF was reflected in <span class="Italic">Rowland-Clum v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 96-3159):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner is attacking the finding of a legitimate reason for the RIF and the application of that RIF to her position. First, petitioner questions the legitimacy of the shortage of funds reason for the RIF because, she argues, the selection of her position for the RIF did not "save money." Petitioner asserts that through a witness, Charles Harris, who is an outside contractor she alleges assumed the duties of her job, she could establish that the abolishment of her position did not save the Army any money, and was therefore, not the result of a shortage of funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A shortage of funds is a legitimate reason to conduct a RIF. 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a)(2) (1995). The AJ's determination that the RIF was conducted because of a shortage of funds is supported by substantial evidence in the record as based on the testimony of two employees of the Army that the RIF was conducted because of a shortage of funds. Specifically, the AJ found that the Army conducted the RIF because it had to reduce personnel in light of a 15 percent reduction in its budget for the 1996 fiscal year. Once a legitimate reason is established for the RIF, we will not look behind the reason or reevaluate the decision of the Army. <span class="Italic">Gandola</span>, 773 F.2d at 311 ("That decision on the composition and structure of the work force reflects the kind of managerial judgment that is the essence of agency discretion, and is not meat for judicial reevaluation."). Therefore, as the AJ found, the testimony of Charles Harris would not be useful. That petitioner's duties were given to an outside contractor who she alleges was paid more money to do the same work is irrelevant. We find that the determination that the Army conducted the RIF for a legitimate reason was not arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <span class="Italic">See Bacon v.</span> <span class="Italic">DHUD</span>, 757 F.2d 265, 269 (Fed. Cir. 1985) ("If an agency establishes that a RIF was undertaken for any of the five reasons set forth in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201 (a), the action must be upheld.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A RIF will not be set aside as a sham reorganization if the motivating factor is a change in funding, <span class="Italic">Clark v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3029):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants' allegations--that RIF procedures were improperly applied because there was no reorganization, but only a change in funding--overlook the fact that an agency may also invoke RIF procedures when required to separate employees due to lack of work or shortage of funds. The agency's stated basis for the RIF was that the term positions lacked funding and were being canceled. Whether or not the board applied the term "reorganization" too quickly or too broadly, the agency was entitled to apply RIF procedures due to a shortage of funds. While it may have been possible to continue funding the term positions out of general program dollars, as the agency did when it hired the appellants, the agency's independent decision not to do so is not an abuse of its managerial discretion and may not be questioned here or by the board. Similarly, it is clear from the record and the facts found by the board that the agency would have been entitled to invoke RIF procedures because the term employees lacked work once the permanent positions had been filled.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">FDA v. Davidson</span>, 46 MSPR 223, 226 (1990), let stand a furlough of an ALJ who was on a reimbursable detail. His argument that the agency would gain nothing from his furlough was discounted. The Board would not speculate on what might occur during the furlough. It would not look back to see if the furlough might have been avoided, i.e., to see if the employee remained on a reimbursable detail. The agency need not wait until it runs out of funds before conducting a RIF. Instead, it may stave off the deficit. <span class="Italic">LaBonte v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 23 MSPR 534, 537 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 74 MSPR 454, 459 (1997) (RIF based on an anticipated budget reduction; "agencies have broad discretion to avoid deficit situations").
