<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-409"><span class="space">b.</span> Knew or Should Have Known</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">DOD, Defense Distribution Region East, New Cumberland and AFGE Local 2004</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 161-62 (1995), discussed the "knew or should have known" fee criterion in conjunction with an award of environmental differential pay:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice in cases: (1) involving prohibited personnel practices; (2) where agency actions are clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or where the employee is substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) when agency actions are taken in bad faith to harass or exert improper pressure on an employee; (4) when gross procedural error by an agency prolonged the proceeding or severely prejudiced the employee; (5) where the agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceedings; [6] or (6) where there is a service rendered to the Federal work force or there is a benefit to the public derived from maintaining the action. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Red River Army Depot, Texarkana, Texas and National Association of Government Employees, Local R14-52</span>, 39 FLRA 1215, 1222-23 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Red River Army Depot</span>). An award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice if any one of these criteria is met. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1222.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;The Federal Circuit has explained this category as requiring an evaluation of the agency's decision to proceed against the employee. <span class="Italic">E.g., Yorkshire v. MSPB</span>, 746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1984). Thus, in analyzing a request for fees under this category, arbitrators should focus on the agency's actions that resulted in the grievance.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Arbitrator's award fully articulates a reasoned decision setting forth specific findings supporting the determination that the award of attorney fees was warranted in the interest of justice under a recognized criterion. In support of his determination, the Arbitrator found that internal Agency memoranda established that the Agency was aware that the conditions under which the grievants handled materials were unacceptable during the period preceding the grievants' removal from the area where they had been exposed to toxic chemicals. Therefore, the Arbitrator found that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. Where, as here, an arbitrator fully articulates the reasons supporting one of the interest of justice criteria, the Authority will defer to the arbitrator's findings. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Patent and Trademark</span> <span class="Italic">Office</span>, 32 FLRA at 378. Accordingly, the Arbitrator's award satisfies the legal requirements for a finding that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="noindent">An award was sustained that applied the standard, but denied fees, in a dispute over assignment of overtime, <span class="Italic">NAIL, Local 5 and DOD, DLA Texarkana</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v69/69-83.html">69 FLRA 573</a>, 577 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Last, the Union argues that attorney fees should be awarded under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. Under this factor, an award of attorney fees is warranted where the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits." The arbitrator must determine the reasonableness of an agency's action in light of the information available to the agency at the time of the disputed action.[70] That assessment is primarily factual, because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence.[71]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[70]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">SSA, Balt., Md</span>., 63 FLRA 550, 552 (2009).</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[71]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See U.S. Army Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, N.C</span>., 35 FLRA 390, 394-95 (1990) (in evaluating fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, arbitrator relied on factual findings).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator determined that attorney fees should not be awarded under the fifth factor.&#x2003;He found that the Union's grievance did not involve an "express" contractual duty and, therefore, it would be "a reach beyond the evidence...to conclude [that the Agency] should have known that it would not prevail on the merits." The Arbitrator also "note[d] that [f]actor 5 is limited to situations in which the agency brought the proceeding."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Arbitrator's findings in the fee award concerning the nature of the relevant contract provisions are inconsistent with the Arbitrator's conclusion in the merits award that the Agency unreasonably delayed in making overtime work available to the grievant. The Union also argues that the Arbitrator reevaluated his merits award in the fee award. We find these arguments unpersuasive. In the merits award, the Arbitrator sustained the Union's grievance after interpreting the parties' agreement and finding that the Agency unreasonably delayed making overtime available to the grievant. Then, in the fee award, the Arbitrator declined to find, under the fifth factor, that the Agency should have known that its inaction would violate the parties' agreement, noting that the agreement did not impose an "express contractual duty" on the Agency. This finding is consistent with the Arbitrator's finding in the merits award that the Agency violated the parties' agreement, even though "[t]here is no explicit [contract] language" addressing the issue that was before him. Therefore, the Union fails to demonstrate that the fee award is inconsistent with the merits award or that the Arbitrator reevaluated his merits-award's findings in the fee award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union also challenges the Arbitrator's statement "that [f]actor 5 is limited to situations in which the agency brought the proceeding." However, the Arbitrator's inaccurate statement concerning the applicability of the fifth factor does not, as the Union suggests, refute the Arbitrator's ultimate conclusion that attorney fees were not warranted in the interest of justice. As discussed above, the Arbitrator went on to apply the fifth factor and evaluated the nature and weight of the evidence available to the Agency at the time of its disputed action.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we conclude that the Union fails to establish that attorney fees are warranted under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor. And based on the foregoing, we deny the Union's contrary-to-law exception.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Finally, there is no doubt that attorney fees are not warranted in this case applying the various <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors on which the Union relies, and that our determination is consistent with the Authority's current precedent. And because neither party asks us to reconsider this precedent, we do not do so here.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator held that "in light of all the facts and circumstances[,]" "[a]n award of attorney fees is warranted in the interests of justice." Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to consider any mitigating factors, which were readily available at the time of the disputed action, such as: the grievant's excellent eight-year employment record with no other formal discipline; the accuracy of the grievant's medical judgment; the nurse's conduct, which exacerbated the situation; and the penalty being in excess of the guidelines. The Arbitrator determined that "[t]here was no evidence that [the Agency] considered these mitigating <span id="page_2458"></span>factors." Finding that there was no investigation into these "exonerating" facts, the Arbitrator concluded that "[w]ith minimal inquiry [the Agency] would have to know that there were relevant mitigating circumstances."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In view of the Arbitrator's factual findings, the legal conclusion that the Agency "should have known" that it would not prevail is not contrary to law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin., Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>61 FLRA 68, 71 (2005) (agency's failure to consider mitigating circumstances such as grievant's superior employment record and misconduct of agency employee support arbitrator's legal conclusion that agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail); <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, N.C., </span>35 FLRA 390, 394 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Yorkshire v. MSPB, </span>746 F.2d 1454, 1457 (Fed. Cir. 1984)) (knew or should have known requirement satisfied when agency is negligent in conducting investigation). Therefore, although the Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator's factual findings and interpretation of the record, it has not established that the Arbitrator erred. <span class="Italic">See SSA</span>, 63 FLRA at 552 (agency's disagreement with arbitrator's factual findings does not establish that arbitrator erred in awarding attorney fees where agency failed to conduct thorough review of appropriate penalty for employee with excellent employment and flawless disciplinary records).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the cases on which the Agency relies are inapposite. Although in each case the request for attorney fees was denied, there was no finding by the arbitrator, as there was here, that the agency should have known that the penalty it imposed would not prevail. In <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </span>98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996), the court held that there was no presumption of a fee award based on a mitigation of the penalty. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army, </span>711 F.2d 1563, 1570-71 (Fed. Cir. 1983), held that a finding of economic hardship does not create a presumption that a fee award is warranted.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator did not base the fee award on a presumption that it was warranted because the penalty was mitigated. Rather, she concluded that with minimal investigation, the Agency should have known that the penalty imposed would not prevail. Moreover, the <span class="Italic">Dunn </span>decision supports the Arbitrator's finding. There, the court noted that a negligently conducted investigation might give rise to an affirmative finding under <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion 5. <span class="Italic">Dunn </span>98 F.3d at 1313; <span class="Italic">cf. Nat'l Air Traffic Controller's Ass'n </span>64 FLRA 799, 801 (2010) (Authority confirmed arbitrator's legal conclusion that fees were unwarranted where arbitrator made factual findings that agency conducted a thorough investigatory review before it imposed penalty). Finally, the Arbitrator distinguished <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona, </span>64 FLRA 819 (2010), and found that, unlike the arbitrator in <span class="Italic">Monthan </span>who did not find that the agency knew or should have known the penalty it imposed would not prevail, the facts in this case "indicate that the [A]gency was aware that the penalty it imposed was problematic[.]"</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For the reasons set forth above, the Authority denies the exception because the award satisfies Allen criterion 5 and therefore is not contrary to the 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701 (g)(1).[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;As noted, an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if any one of the criteria is satisfied. Thus, we find it unnecessary to resolve the Agency's exceptions regarding criterion 2 on which the Arbitrator also relied.</p>
<p class="noindent">There's a quantitative difference between mitigation of a removal to a short suspension and mitigation of a short suspension to a shorter suspension, and that difference was implicitly recognized by FLRA in 2019, as it revisited mitigation analysis under the "knew or should have known" standard in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2076 and DHS, C&#x0026;IS</span>, 71 FLRA 221, 221–24 (2019) (Member DuBester concurring in part and dissenting in part) (following remand, <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2076 and DHS, C&#x0026;IS</span>, 71 FLRA 1023 (2020) (Member DuBester concurring):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority on the Union's exceptions to Arbitrator William Croasdale's supplemental award, which denied the Union's request for attorney fees under the Back Pay Act (BPA). The request for attorney fees followed a merits award in which the Arbitrator sustained the Agency's charge against the grievant but mitigated the penalty from a fourteen-day suspension to a five-day suspension. The main issue before the Authority is whether payment of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice because the Agency knew or should have known that its original penalty determination would not be upheld. For the reasons that follow, we set aside the supplemental award and remand the matter to the parties for resubmission to the Arbitrator--or a different one--absent settlement.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that under <span class="Italic">Lambert v. Department of the Air Force</span> (<span class="Italic">Lambert</span>),[18] fees must be awarded here in the interest of justice because the Agency knew or should have known that its chosen penalty would not be upheld. In <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, the Board held that payment of fees is generally warranted under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5) when the Board sustains the charges in an adverse action appeal but mitigates the penalty, provided the decision to mitigate was based on information available to the agency at the time it took the action.[19] The Board reasoned that, under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>,[20] the Board will not mitigate a penalty unless it finds that the agency failed to consider the relevant factors or that its chosen penalty is outside the bounds of reasonableness.[21] Consequently, if the Board mitigates a penalty, and does so based on information that was available to the agency at the time of its decision, this amounts to a finding that the agency acted irresponsibly or unreasonably in selecting the penalty, which in turn implies that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained.[22]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">On several occasions, the Authority has applied Lambert in cases involving minor disciplinary actions--e.g., suspensions of 14 days or less, written reprimands, and oral counselings.[23] We conclude, however, that the Board's rationale in <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> should not apply in this context, because <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> applies to adverse actions--e.g., suspensions of more than 14 days, demotions, and removals. First, when arbitrators review minor disciplinary actions, they are not required to apply the same substantive standards that the Board applies in its review of adverse actions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512.[24] Second, while the Board must defer to the agency's penalty determination, provided the agency considered all of the relevant factors and the penalty is within tolerable limits of reasonableness, arbitrators, however, may mitigate penalties using their own sense of fairness. Thus, in the grievance context, mitigation of a penalty does not necessarily imply that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained, even if the evidence on which the arbitrator relied was available to the agency at the time of its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[23]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Local 3294</span>, 66 FLRA at 432; <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 1923</span>, 66 FLRA 22, 24 (2011) (<span class="Italic">Local 1923</span>) (Member Beck dissenting); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Army Medical Activity (MEDDAC), Fort Drum, N.Y.</span>, 65 FLRA 575, 578–79 (2011); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 355 Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 65 FLRA 219, 221–23 (2009) (Member Beck dissenting).</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Authority will no longer follow <span class="Italic">Lambert</span> in cases where the arbitrator mitigates a minor disciplinary action. In other words, the fact that the evidence on which the arbitrator relied was available to the agency at the time it made its decision will not serve as a sufficient basis for finding that the agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be sustained. Rather, in determining whether an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5), arbitrators must evaluate the nature and strength of the evidence that was available to the agency and assess whether its penalty determination was reasonable in light of that information. To hold otherwise would effectively require an agency to "have a crystal ball to predict precisely how an arbitrator will view the grievance."[25] Circumstances such as this, where all of the charges were sustained and the Agency's choice of penalty was consistent with its table of penalties, strongly support a finding that the Agency's penalty determination was reasonable, and that <span class="Italic">Allen</span> category (5) does not apply.[26]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator issued the initial fee award on June 19, 2020. He found that <span id="page_2459"></span>the Agency committed an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action when it suspended the grievant instead of reprimanding her. He further determined that the Union was the prevailing party, and that an award of attorney fees and costs would be in the interest of justice under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor[3] because the Agency knew or should have known that the ten-day suspension would be excessive under the circumstances. To support this conclusion, the Arbitrator relied on his findings that: (1) there were discrepancies in the evidence upon which the Agency relied; (2) it was undisputed that the grievant had not made any threats or used profanity; (3) the Agency had failed to consider that the misconduct had not become known outside the Agency or had any effect on employees within the Agency; and (4) the Agency failed to consider that the grievant had never received any prior discipline or whether lesser discipline might be appropriate. However, the Arbitrator reduced the Union's requested fees by twenty-five percent.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, the Merits Systems Protection Board identified five factors in which an award of attorney fees would be warranted in the interest of justice: (1) where the agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) where the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded or the employee was substantially innocent of charges brought by the agency; (3) where the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) where the agency committed a gross procedural error; and (5) where the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 434-35.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has explained that in disciplinary actions, where the agency prevails on the charges but the penalty is mitigated, an award of fees may be warranted in the interest of justice under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor if the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained.[17] As the Agency notes, mitigation of a penalty at arbitration does not create a presumption that payment of fees is warranted.[18] Rather, the critical question is whether the agency acted unreasonably by imposing a penalty that it knew or should have known would not be sustained.[19] In addition, the Authority has held that, in making this determination, "arbitrators must evaluate the nature and strength of the evidence that was available to the agency and assess whether its penalty determination was reasonable in light of that information."[20]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator properly conducted this evaluation. In concluding that the Agency acted unreasonably in imposing the grievant's discipline, the Arbitrator considered "written descriptions of what had occurred during the incident" and found that the grievant did not use threats or any profanity during the altercation. He also found that the Agency had no applicable table of penalties; had failed to consider the appropriateness of lesser discipline based on the grievant's lack of prior discipline; and that the grievant's misconduct "had not become known outside the Agency or had any effect on employees within the Agency." Because the Arbitrator analyzed the reasonableness of the Agency's choice of penalty in a manner consistent with Allen,[23] we reject the Agency's argument on this point.[24]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that: (1) the Agency relied on the wrong category of offenses in its table of penalties when it selected a penalty; (2) the Agency's reliance on the wrong category was a "mistake [that] was avoidable based on the evidence the Agency had before it when it made its decision[;]" (3) the Agency failed to consider "mitigating factors" <span id="page_2460"></span>such as an Agency witness' regret reporting the grievant's statement and that he was pressured to report it; and (4) the Agency failed to justify its enhancement of the penalty by failing to demonstrate that the grievant had a record of prior discipline.

Under that criterion, fees are warranted in the interest of justice when the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it disciplined the employee. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. Making this determination requires the arbitrator to evaluate the reasonableness of the agency's actions and positions in light of the information available to it when it disciplined the employee. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Immigration &#x0026; Customs Enforcement</span>, 64 FLRA 1003, 1006-07 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disciplinary actions, the penalty imposed by the agency is an aspect of the merits of an agency's case, and fees are warranted in the interest of justice when the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1006. In this regard, both the MSPB and the Authority have found that, when the penalty is mitigated based on evidence before, or readily available to, the agency at the time of the disciplinary action, and no new information was presented at the merits hearing that was not available to the agency at the time of the discipline, such mitigation establishes that the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, 355 Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 65 FLRA 219, 222 (2010) (Member Beck dissenting) (<span class="Italic">355 Fighter Wing)</span>; <span class="Italic">Miller v.

USPS</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, 434-35 (2007) (<span class="Italic">Del Prete</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator mitigated the grievant's penalty based on "her long[,] and apparently, effective and conscientious service" of "more than [thirty-five] years[.]" There is no dispute that this evidence was before, or readily available to, the Agency at the time when the Agency imposed the five-day suspension. Thus, the Arbitrator's mitigation of the grievant's penalty based on this evidence establishes that the Agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., 355 Fighter Wing</span>, 65 FLRA at 222; <span class="Italic">Miller</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. at 551; <span class="Italic">Del Prete</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. at 434-35. Accordingly, consistent with MSPB and Authority precedent, we find that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion, and set aside the awards.[5]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;In response to the dissent, we emphasize that our decision merely applies MSPB precedent to find that, where an arbitrator mitigates a penalty, and the <span class="Italic">mitigation is based on evidence that was known or readily available to the agency at the time of discipline</span>, attorney fees are required under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Miller</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. at 551; <span class="Italic">Del Prete</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. at 434-35. This standard neither requires a "crystal ball" nor results in attorney fees solely based on penalty mitigation. Thus, our decision today is wholly consistent with <span class="Italic">Matthews v. United States Postal Service</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 523 (1988), and <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308 (Fed. Cir. 1996), both of which held that penalty mitigation does not, by itself, demonstrate that the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion is met. <span class="Italic">See </span>78 M.S.P.R. at 526; 98 F.3d at 1313. Moreover, we note that <span class="Italic">Hilliard v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., 111 M.S.P.R. 634 (2009), cited by the dissent, is a non-precedential decision, <span class="Italic">see id. </span>at 634, and, thus, provides no support for the dissent's position. Finally, as discussed above, <span class="Italic">Miller </span>and <span class="Italic">Del Prete, </span>also cited by the dissent, actually support our holding that attorney fees are warranted in this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority has consistently held that the arbitrator, not the Authority, is the appropriate authority for resolution of a request for attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g, AFGE, Local 3105</span>, 63 FLRA 128, 131 (2009) (citing 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 550.807(a)). As the Arbitrator did not address the other statutory requirements for an award of attorney fees under the BPA, we remand the awards to the parties for submission to the Arbitrator, absent settlement, to address those requirements. <span class="Italic">See AFGE, Local 1592</span>, 64 FLRA 861, 862 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent">Member Beck dissented in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1923</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, at 25:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">I disagree with my colleagues that the Arbitrator's denial of attorney fees is contrary to law for the same reasons that I articulated in my dissent in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Air Force, 355 Fighter Wing, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona</span>, 65 FLRA 219, 223 (2010) (Dissenting Opinion of Member Beck).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Majority effectively transforms the "knew or should have known" standard into a standard of "must have a crystal ball to predict precisely how an arbitrator will view the grievance."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The practical consequence of the Majority's Decision today is that, every time an arbitrator disagrees with the agency about the appropriate discipline that should have been imposed for employee misconduct, an award of attorney fees will be mandated. That is not the result that was intended by the Back Pay Act and <span class="Italic">Allen</span>; both clearly contemplate that some analysis and judgment should be applied to the question of whether attorney fees should be awarded, not that fees must be automatically awarded every time an arbitrator sees a disciplinary situation slightly differently from how the agency saw it. <span class="Italic">Matthews v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 78 M.S.P.R. 523, 526 (1998) (<span class="Italic">Allen </span>does not create a presumption or <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule in favor of fees whenever a penalty is mitigated) (citing <span class="Italic">Dunn v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (<span class="Italic">Dunn</span>)) (a reversal of the agency's action, in itself, does not show that the agency proceeded negligently); <span class="Italic">see also Hilliard v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 634, 641 (2009) (<span class="Italic">Hilliard</span>) (separate opinion of Member Rose at note 1).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Arbitrators may choose to mitigate a penalty for myriad reasons that do not imply negligence, bad faith, or overreaching by the agency--none of which necessarily indicates that the agency knew or should have known the arbitrator would mitigate the penalty. <span class="Italic">Dunn </span>at 1313 (arbitrator did not abuse his discretion or commit legal error in determining that, although petitioner did prevail, the interests of justice did not warrant an award of fees); <span class="Italic">see also Hilliard</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. at 639 (separate opinion of Chairman McPhie) (citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 547, 551 (2007); <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, 434-35 (2007)).</p>
<p class="noindent">In a suspension case the focus was on what the agency knew at the time it made its decision, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 64 FLRA 819, 821-22 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion is whether the agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits" when it brought the proceeding. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. A determination of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of the agency's actions in light of the information available to the agency at the time it imposed discipline. <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 61 FLRA at 70. This determination is primarily factual because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Consequently, when the factual findings support the arbitrator's legal conclusion, the Authority will deny the exceptions to the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that "the penalty is part of the merits of the case, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice where the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1253 (1990) (citations omitted). Attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice where all charges of misconduct against an employee are sustained but the agency-imposed penalty "exceeds the bounds of reasonableness." <span class="Italic">Ciarla v. USPS</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 240, 244 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator found that the grievant committed the offense, based on the grievant's own admission, and that disciplinary action was warranted. She determined that, in light of testimony that several employees were given 14-day suspensions for similar offenses, and her factual finding that the Agency was not aware, at the time it imposed the penalty, that an employee who committed an offense similar to that of the grievant received no discipline, she could not find that the Agency knew or should have known that a three-day suspension for the grievant would not be upheld.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's contention, the Arbitrator did not err by basing her determination regarding the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion on a reexamination and alteration of the factual findings in her merits award. Instead, in her merits and fee awards, she applied the legal standard appropriate to each stage of the proceeding and independently evaluated the pertinent facts. As the Union acknowledges, the Arbitrator applied the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors to determine the appropriate penalty for the grievant's misconduct. In contrast, when determining whether the Union was entitled to attorney fees, the Arbitrator applied the <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criteria.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">For example, in her decision on the merits, one of the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors that the Arbitrator applied was the consistency of the penalty with penalties imposed upon other employees for the same or similar offenses. Having found that a similarly situated employee was given a lesser penalty, the Arbitrator decided to reduce the grievant's penalty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In her fee award, when applying the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion, the Arbitrator <span id="page_2461"></span>considered the same fact but also considered what other facts revealed about whether the Agency knew or should have known that its penalty would not be upheld. Therefore, the Arbitrator's finding that the grievant's penalty should be reduced was not inconsistent with her subsequent finding that the Agency did not have reason to know that its penalty would not be upheld. Accordingly, the Authority finds that, under these circumstances, the Union has not demonstrated that it is entitled to attorney fees under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "knew or should have known" test was applied, with the result that a remand was required for further factual analysis, when the arbitrator mitigated the duration of a suspension, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE</span>, 64 FLRA 459, 460-61 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) because the Arbitrator failed to support his conclusion that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding. When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">U.S. Customs Serv. v. FLRA</span>, 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo </span>review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Dep'ts of the Army and the Air Force, Ala. Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.</span>, 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998). In making that assessment, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The threshold requirement for entitlement to attorney fees under the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5596, is a finding that the grievant was affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action that resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of the grievant's pay, allowances, or differentials. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of Def., Def. Distrib. Region E., New Cumberland, Pa.</span>, 51 FLRA 155, 158 (1995) (<span class="Italic">Defense Distrib.</span>). The Back Pay Act further requires that an award of fees must be: (1) in conjunction with an award of backpay to the grievant on correction of the personnel action; (2) reasonable and related to the personnel action; and (3) in accordance with the standards established under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See id</span>. Section 7701(g)(1) requires that: (1) the employee must be the prevailing party; (2) the award of fees must be warranted in the interest of justice; (3) the amount of the fees must be reasonable; and (4) the fees must have been incurred by the employee. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, the Agency claims that fees were not warranted in the interest of justice within the meaning of &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). The Authority evaluates "interest of justice" issues under &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) by applying the criteria originally established by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Laborers' Int'l Union of N. Am., Local 1376</span>, 54 FLRA 700, 702-03 (1998) (<span class="Italic">LIUNA, Local 1376</span>). Here, the parties dispute only whether the award satisfies the fifth criterion of <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, i.e., whether the Agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding." <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. It is well-settled that the penalty imposed by an agency is an aspect of the merits of an agency's case. <span class="Italic">See U.S. GSA, N.E. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, N.Y., N.Y., </span>61 FLRA 68, 70 (2005) (<span class="Italic">GSA</span>) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1253 (1990)). Thus, attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice if an agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed. <span class="Italic">GSA</span>, 61 FLRA at 70.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A determination as to whether an agency "knew or should have known" that it would not prevail on the merits "requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the evidence available to the agency at the time of its disputed action." <span class="Italic">LIUNA, Local 1376</span>, 54 FLRA at 703. This "requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of an agency's actions and positions in light of what information was available to it in the case." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Additionally, an arbitrator's assessment of whether an agency "knew or should have known" it would not prevail is primarily factual. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>As such, an arbitrator's decision on this issue must be "fully articulated [and] reasoned...setting forth the [a]rbitrator's specific findings supporting the determination on each pertinent statutory requirement[.]." <span class="Italic">Defense Distrib.</span>, 51 FLRA at 158.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the attorney fee award, the Arbitrator stated: "All of the circumstances surrounding this matter, which I will not repeat here, make it abundantly clear that the Agency should reasonably have been expected to know that its proposed penalty was excessive; thus, the 'interest of justice' standard has been met." He did not issue a fully articulated and reasoned decision and did not set forth specific findings supporting his determination. <span class="Italic">Defense Distrib.</span>, 51 FLRA at 158. In this regard, the attorney fee award did not contain the necessary analysis set out in <span class="Italic">LIUNA, Local 1376</span>, 54 FLRA at 703. Moreover, even assuming that the Arbitrator was referring back to findings in the original award when addressing the interest of justice issue, nothing in the original award supports the award of attorney fees. In this connection, although the original award mitigated the Agency's chosen penalty, "[p]enalty mitigation alone...does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen </span>factors." <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 104 M.S.P.R. 429, 433 (2007) (Chairman McPhie dissenting). <span class="Italic">Accord Dunn v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 98 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, there is nothing in the record that would permit the Authority to determine whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice. Where, as here, neither the attorney fee award nor the record indicates whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, the Authority will remand the case to the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Dep't of the Navy, Naval Undersea Warfare Ctr., Newport, R.I.</span>, 56 FLRA 477, 479 (2000). Therefore, we remand this matter for a determination as to whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="noindent">Mitigation was also the focus of <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 65 FLRA 219, 221-23 (2010), resulting in a remand to the arbitrator for further analysis of fee entitlement when the agency did not responsibly set a penalty based on facts known to it when it charged the offense against the grievant:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority resolves whether an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice in accordance with &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) by applying the criteria established by the MSPB in <span class="Italic">Allen</span>. In resolving whether an arbitrator properly applied the criteria, the Authority looks to the decisions of the MSPB and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. <span class="Italic">NAGE, Local R5-188</span>, 54 FLRA 1401, 1406 (1998). In addition, an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice if any one of the <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criteria is satisfied. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.</span>, 64 FLRA 819, 821 (2010).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion 5, an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice when the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it disciplined the employee. <span class="Italic">Allen</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. Making this determination requires the arbitrator to evaluate the reasonableness of the agency's actions and positions in light of the information available to it when it disciplined the employee. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., ICE</span>, 64 FLRA 1003, 1006-07 (2010) (<span class="Italic">ICE</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In disciplinary actions, the penalty imposed by the agency is an aspect of the merits of an agency's case, and fees are warranted in the interest of justice when the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 1006. The critical point is that agencies act unreasonably by imposing penalties that it knows or should know will not withstand scrutiny. <span class="Italic">NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 799, 801 (2010). In this regard, the MSPB has found that, when the penalty is mitigated based on evidence before, or readily available to, the agency at the time of the disciplinary action, and no new information was presented at the merits hearing that was not available to the agency at the time of the discipline, such mitigation establishes that the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. <span class="Italic">E.g., Miller v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. 547, 551 (2007); <span class="Italic">Del Prete v. USPS, </span>104 M.S.P.R. 429, 434-35 (2007). In addition, the MSPB has held that "by imposing an unreasonably excessive penalty, an agency acts irresponsibly and...knows or should know that the penalty will not survive [MSPB] scrutiny." <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dep't of Transp., </span>55 M.S.P.R. 138, 142 (1992).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An arbitrator's assessment of whether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail is <span class="Italic">primarily </span>factual. <span class="Italic">ICE</span>, 64 FLRA at 1007. When the arbitrator's factual findings support the arbitrator's <span class="Italic">legal </span>conclusion, the Authority denies exceptions to the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>However, in resolving fee requests, arbitrators may not reexamine or reevaluate the findings on the merits of the grievance. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. at 552 (Chairman McPhie dissenting as to another matter) (administrative judge's decision on the merits of the disciplinary action is not subject to recharacterization in support of a fee decision). In other words, the arbitrator cannot disregard the findings in the merits award in determining whether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail. <span class="Italic">See Brunning v. GSA, </span>63 M.S.P.R. 490, 493 (1994) (<span class="Italic">Brunning</span>). Consequently, when the arbitrator's findings in the merits award support a conclusion that the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail, the Authority will find a legal conclusion to the contrary (in a fee award) deficient. <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health &#x0026; Human Servs., Public Health Serv., Region IV, Atlanta, Ga., </span>34 FLRA 823, 831 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Public Health Service</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Public Health Service</span>, the arbitrator concluded that an award of fees was not warranted in the interest of justice under <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion 5. However, the Authority found that the arbitrator's factual findings established that the agency relied on incomplete facts and information. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 832. As the complete facts and information were available to the agency at the time of its disputed actions, the Authority concluded that the agency should have known that it would not prevail in arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Accordingly, the Authority determined that the arbitrator's legal conclusion to the contrary was not consistent with his factual findings and was deficient. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>at 831-32.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these principles here, the Arbitrator found, in the merits award, that the parties' agreement provides, in pertinent part: "If the supervisor believes that the condition or corrected condition does not pose an imminent danger, but the employee still believes that an imminent danger situation exists, then the supervisor shall request an inspection by an agency safety or health official." The Arbitrator then found that the <span id="page_2462"></span>grievant's supervisor, "instead of requesting 'an inspection by an agency safety or health official' as the [a]greement directs, ordered [the g]rievant to enter and disassemble the fuel cell."<span class="Italic"> </span>Further, the Arbitrator determined that the supervisor, "who ordered [the g]rievant to enter the cell, had not himself inspected the cell[,]" and that, "by the condition of the cell and by the directives for entry into cells in such condition, the Agency should have had [appropriate protective equipment] available." The Arbitrator then concluded that the Agency did not have just cause for the charge of failure to follow proper orders, and mitigated the suspension to a reprimand. By finding that the Agency improperly failed to inspect the fuel cell, the Arbitrator implicitly--and necessarily--found that information regarding the actual condition of the fuel cell was before and available to the Agency at the time of the decision to suspend the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's own findings in the merits award, which he acknowledged in the fee award, support a conclusion that--as a matter of law--an award of fees was warranted in the interest of justice. In this connection, as in <span class="Italic">Miller, </span>it is evident from the merits award that, in mitigating the suspension, the Arbitrator relied solely on evidence that was before, or reasonably available to, the Agency when it suspended the grievant. <span class="Italic">See Miller</span>, 106 M.S.P.R. at 551. In addition, as discussed previously, these findings were not subject to reevaluation and could not be disregarded by the Arbitrator in concluding whether an award of fees was not warranted in the interest of justice. As in <span class="Italic">Public Health Service, </span>the Arbitrator's findings establish that the Agency relied on incomplete facts and information in failing to determine the actual condition of the fuel cell and that the complete facts and information were available to the Agency when it suspended the grievant.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail, the Arbitrator's general statements in the fee award with regard to the credibility of the Agency's evidence and the reasonableness of the Agency's investigation cannot establish otherwise. <span class="Italic">See Brunning, </span>63 M.S.P.R. at 493. The decision in <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, cited by the Arbitrator, also does not establish otherwise. The court in <span class="Italic">Dunn </span>held that penalty mitigation alone does not create a presumption in favor of satisfaction of any of the <span class="Italic">Allen </span>factors and that fees were not warranted in the interest of justice in that case because the record did not show that the agency chose the penalty negligently or in disregard of relevant facts. <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313. We are not holding that fees are warranted merely because the imposed penalty was mitigated. Rather, we are holding that fees are warranted because the Arbitrator's findings from the merits award demonstrate that the Agency disregarded relevant facts in failing to determine the actual condition of the fuel cell and acted irresponsibly in its choice of penalty.</p>

U.S. Postal Serv., </span>79 M.S.P.R. 71, 73 (1998) ("[F]ees will generally be warranted when...the Board mitigates the penalty imposed, unless the Board's decision to mitigate is based upon evidence that was not presented before the agency.") (citations omitted)). In addition, the Authority noted that the MSPB has held that "by imposing an unreasonably excessive penalty, an agency acts irresponsibly and...knows or should know that the penalty will not survive [MSPB] scrutiny. <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan AFB, </span>65 FLRA at 222 (citing <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Dep't of Transp.</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. 138, 142 (1992) (<span class="Italic">Hutchcraft</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's imposed penalty was excessive because the Agency erroneously applied three <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors and reached a questionable conclusion as to another. Specifically, the Arbitrator determined that the Agency failed to consider the grievant's job level and type of employment, the grievant's past disciplinary record, and the notoriety of the offense or its impact upon the reputation of the Agency as mitigating factors in the grievant's favor. In addition, the Arbitrator found the Agency's conclusions with respect to another <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factor--the adequacy and effectiveness of alternative sanctions to deter such conduct in the future by the grievant or others--to be "open to question." Consequently, in mitigating the suspension, the Arbitrator relied solely on evidence that was before the Agency when it suspended the grievant, rather than new information that was presented at arbitration. Following MSPB precedent as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan</span>, we conclude in this case that the Arbitrator's mitigation of the grievant's suspension solely on the basis of evidence that was before the Agency when it suspended the grievant establishes that the Agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. In other words, the Agency acted irresponsibly and knew or should have known that its penalty would not survive arbitral scrutiny.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Because of the principle we (and the MSPB) apply, our conclusion that the Agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained is not inconsistent with the Arbitrator's finding that the Agency merely made a good-faith mistake. As discussed above, under that principle, fees are warranted when an agency's imposed penalty is mitigated on the basis of evidence before the agency at the time it took the disciplinary action. Moreover, <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, cited by the Agency and our dissenting colleague, is inapposite. In <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, the court held that there can be no <span class="Italic">per se</span> rule that fees are warranted in the interest of justice whenever the MSPB mitigates the imposed penalty. <span class="Italic">Dunn</span>, 98 F.3d at 1313. The principle we apply is different. Under that principle, an agency's choice of penalty will not be found unreasonable when the basis for the mitigation is evidence that was unavailable to the agency. <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft</span>, 55 M.S.P.R. at 142-43.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We acknowledge that certain Authority precedent may be inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan </span>and our decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., NATCA</span>, 64 FLRA 799, 801 (2010) (union failed to meet its burden of demonstrating its entitlement to an award of attorney fees under <span class="Italic">Allen </span>criterion 5). However, as our approach in <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan </span>and this case is consistent with MSPB precedent, we will no longer follow any inconsistent Authority decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NATCA and Dept. of Transp., FAA</span>, 64 FLRA 799, 801 (2010), essentially overruled, at least in part, by <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3294,</span> <span class="Italic">supra</span>, may have provided the employer greater deference as to the reasonableness of its judgment in assessing whether it "knew or should have known" of the unreasonableness of a penalty:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the parties dispute only whether fees were warranted in the interest of justice under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor, i.e., whether the Agency "knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding." <span class="Italic">Allen,</span> 2 M.S.P.R. at 435. It is well settled that the penalty imposed by an agency is an aspect of the merits of an agency's case. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Gen. Servs. Admin., Ne. &#x0026; Caribbean Region, NY., NY.,</span> 61 FLRA 68, 70 (2005) (GSA) (citing <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12,</span> 38 FLRA 1240, 1253 (1990)). Attorney fees are thus warranted in the interest of justice if an agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed. <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 61 FLRA at 70. In this connection, the Authority has explained that "the 'critical point' is that 'an agency should not act irresponsibly or unreasonably in imposing a penalty if it either knows or should have known that the penalty would not withstand...scrutiny[.]" <span class="Italic">Id</span>. (quoting <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12,</span> 38 FLRA at 1253).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, a determination of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the evidence available to the agency at the time of its disputed action. <span class="Italic">GSA,</span> 61 FLRA at 70. This criterion essentially requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of an agency's actions and positions in light of what information was available to it at the time discipline was imposed. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The assessment of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail is primarily factual because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Consequently, when the factual findings support the arbitrator's legal conclusion, the Authority will deny the exceptions to the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In this regard, the party seeking attorney fees has the burden of demonstrating its entitlement to such fees. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Stewart v. Dep't of Army,</span> 102 M.S.P.R. 656, 660 (2006) (appellant bears burden of providing entitlement to attorney fees).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator made specific factual findings to support her legal conclusion that attorney fees were not warranted in the interest of justice. In this connection, the Arbitrator demonstrated that it could not be said that the Agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed, as the Agency had not acted irresponsibly or unreasonably when imposing discipline on the grievant. In support of this conclusion, the Arbitrator cited the record, where, in the merits award, she had noted the substantial evidence that the Agency had in support of its actions. Specifically, as discussed previously, the Arbitrator found in the merits award that, in deciding to impose the suspension, the Agency listened to tape recordings that reflected the grievant's misconduct, considered the facts that the grievant was a controller in charge and that this was the grievant's second offense, and conducted an investigatory interview in which the grievant admitted that he engaged in the charged conduct.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's response was understandable in light of its obligation to ensure safety, and found that the Agency acted erroneously, but not unreasonably in its determination as to progressive discipline. The Arbitrator's consideration of the reasonableness of the Agency's actions was consistent with Authority precedent, <span class="Italic">see GSA,</span> 61 FLRA at 70, and was supported by specific factual findings. Further, although the Union disputes the Arbitrator's method of analysis, the Union does not demonstrate that the Arbitrator's legal <span id="page_2463"></span>conclusion is erroneous, and as such, does not meet its burden of demonstrating its entitlement to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">Cf. NAGE, Local R4-6,</span> 56 FLRA 1092, 1095 (2001) (union failed to establish arbitrator erred) (<span class="Italic">NAGE</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 50 and Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Carolina Dist.</span>, 54 FLRA 250, 254-55 (1998), offered more general analysis of the "knew or should have known" standard, noting that the standard includes factual and practical analysis by the arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Whether fees are warranted requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the evidence available to the agency at the time of its decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Mullins-Howard v. OPM</span>, 71 MSPR 619, 626 (1996). The "knew or should have known" criterion essentially requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of an agency's actions and positions in light of what information was available to it in a case. That assessment is primarily factual, because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the Arbitrator set forth specific factual findings on which he based his legal conclusion that an award of attorney fees was not warranted because the agency did not know and should not have known it would not prevail on the merits. In particular, the Arbitrator found that the grievance was filed under the National Agreement because it was time-barred under the Settlement Agreement and the issue of the application of the Settlement Agreement did not arise until the arbitration hearing. Thus, the Arbitrator found that the Agency could not have known, in denying the grievance, that the merits of its action would be evaluated based on a provision in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Moreover, the Arbitrator found that, because the parties did not litigate the grievance under the Settlement Agreement, the Agency could not have anticipated that he would rely on Authority case precedent referenced in the Settlement Agreement to reject the Agency's claim that a position description from another district was irrelevant to the grievance. The Arbitrator also found that the Agency could not have known that he would conclude that the testimony of the grievant's supervisor was contradictory and that, as a result, the Arbitrator would rely exclusively on the grievant's testimony as to her job duties.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Given the Arbitrator's underlying factual findings, to which we defer, we find that the Arbitrator's legal conclusion that the Agency did not know and should not have known, at the time of its action denying the grievance, that it would not prevail on the merits in arbitration is consistent with the applicable standard of law.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Public Health Service</span> [34 FLRA 823 (1990)]. In that case, the Authority found that the arbitrator's own findings, contrary to his legal conclusion otherwise, supported a determination that the agency should have known that it would not prevail on the merits of the action. In contrast, the Arbitrator's factual findings in the instant case, set forth above, support the legal conclusion that the Agency did not know and should not have known that it would not prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent">A practical analysis by the arbitrator served to deny fees under the "knew or should have known" standard, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 3725</span>, 70 FLRA 73, 76 (2016):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's last argument alleges that attorney fees are warranted under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion. The fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion considers whether the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought forth the proceeding.[41] This determination requires the arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of the agency's actions in light of the information available to the agency at the time of the imposed discipline, and it is primarily factual because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence.[42] Consequently, when the factual findings support the arbitrator's legal conclusion, the Authority will deny an exception to the arbitrator's determination.[43]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[41]&#x2003;2 M.S.P.R. at 435.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[43]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Agency's failure to issue the disciplinary notice as soon as practicable, as determined by the Arbitrator, established that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. The Union further argues that, because the parties have litigated for years over the interpretation of Article 32G, the Agency had before it, when it issued the proposed discipline, the knowledge that the timing of the disciplinary notice was significant. And so--according to the Union--by concluding that the Agency could not have known it would not prevail on the merits, the Arbitrator impermissibly reexamined the merits of the case in his fee award.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Union's contention, the Arbitrator did not reexamine the factual findings of the merits award when he repeated and commented upon them in the fee award. In the fee award, the Arbitrator found that the Agency neither knew nor should have known that it would not prevail on the merits in several respects. The Arbitrator noted that the varying fact patterns of charged conduct and wide disparity in the resulting arbitration awards meant that the Agency lacked definitive guidance establishing how long of a delay is required to trigger a violation of Article 32G, or at what point notice is considered to have occurred on the "earliest practicable date." Therefore, the Arbitrator determined that the deciding official could not have known how the Arbitrator, or any other arbitrator, would have viewed this disciplinary proceeding. As the Union has not filed nonfact exceptions to the fee award, we defer to the Arbitrator's factual findings in this regard. As these factual findings support the Arbitrator's conclusion, we find that the Union fails to demonstrate that the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion is satisfied.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sustaining the award of fees by an arbitrator in the challenge to a disciplinary suspension, FLRA determined as to the "knew or should have known" criterion involving the penalty determination, <span class="Italic">DHS, C&#x0026;BP and AFGE Local 1458</span>, 64 FLRA 285, 286-87 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the parties here dispute only whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, only that issue requires examination. The Authority resolves this issue by applying the factors established by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in <span class="Italic">Allen. </span>As relevant here, fees are warranted in the interest of justice under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factor when the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits when it brought the proceeding.<span class="Italic"> Id. </span>at 583 n.1. Determining whether fees are warranted under this factor requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the agency's evidence.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 586. In addition, the Authority has held that the penalty is part of the merits of the case and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice when the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed. <span class="Italic">GSA, </span>61 FLRA at 70. Additionally, the Authority has stated that the assessment of whether fees are warranted under this factor is primarily factual. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to afford appropriate weight to numerous circumstances and mitigating factors and that, as a result, the Agency imposed an unreasonable penalty. The Arbitrator's determination is supported by her factual findings regarding the grievant's employment history and the circumstances surrounding the incident that gave rise to the disciplinary action. In this regard, the Arbitrator found that the grievant, who had a lengthy, discipline-free employment history, found herself in a unique, difficult, and unanticipated situation and took a course of action that, although flawed, was one that the grievant thought to be responsible under the circumstances. Moreover, the Arbitrator found that a lesser penalty than the suspension imposed by the Agency would serve sufficiently as a deterrent. The Agency has not established that the Arbitrator's finding that it could not have expected its choice of penalty to withstand scrutiny fails to comply with applicable statutory standards.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The two cases on which the Agency relies are distinguishable.&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard,</span> 34 FLRA 725, 732 (1990), the arbitrator specifically found that the agency did not know and could not have known that the penalty imposed would not be sustained. Here, the Arbitrator specifically found that the Agency should have known that, under the circumstances, the penalty imposed was excessive. In<span class="Italic"> Shelton v. O.P.M., </span>42 M.S.P.R. 214 (1989), the MSPB found that the agency could not have been expected to anticipate the factors on which a reviewing court relied to mitigate the penalty. The MSPB further noted that the original penalty was based on multiple charges and that the subsequent decision to mitigate the penalty was based, in part, on the fact that not all of the charges were sustained. Here, in contrast, the penalty originally imposed was based on the single charge that was before, and upheld by, the Arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">B.&#x2003;The award is not based on a nonfact.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To establish that an award is based on a nonfact, the appealing party must show that a central fact underlying the award is clearly erroneous, but for which the arbitrator would have reached a different result. <span class="Italic">E.g., U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Serv., Andover, Mass., </span>63 FLRA 202, 205 (2009) <span class="Italic">(IRS). </span>However, the Authority will not find an award deficient on the basis of an arbitrator's determination of a factual matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency asserts that the Arbitrator's finding that it failed to give appropriate weight to mitigating factors in determining the penalty to be imposed on the grievant is a nonfact. The weight that should be accorded the mitigating factors was a matter that the parties disputed at arbitration. The Agency acknowledged this in the opposition that it filed to the Union's request for attorney fees:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[T]his case does not present a situation in which the Employer totally failed to consider relevant mitigating factors. This case presents only a disagreement on the appropriate weight that should have been accorded to these factors. Other than this disagreement over the weight to which various mitigating factors should have been accorded, there has been no evidence in the record that indicates that any of the <span class="Italic">Allen</span> factors have been met.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="page_2464"></span>The Arbitrator addressed this dispute and determined that the Agency did not give due consideration to mitigating factors.&#x2003;As this matter was disputed by the parties at the arbitration, there is no basis on which to find that the award is based on a nonfact. <span class="Italic">IRS, </span>63 FLRA at 205. Accordingly, we deny this exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">The "knew or should have known" standard justified a fee award in <span class="Italic">GSA Northeast &#x0026; Caribbean Region and AFGE Council 236</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/authority-decisions?volume=61&#x0026;pagenumber=68">61 FLRA 68</a>, 70-71 (2005), when the agency did not properly conduct a penalty analysis:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency disputes the Arbitrator's finding that the fifth criterion is met because the Agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits and that its penalty would not be sustained. A determination of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the evidence available to the agency at the time of its disputed action. This criterion essentially requires an arbitrator to determine the reasonableness of an agency's actions and positions in light of what information was available to it at the time discipline was imposed. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 50</span>, 54 FLRA 250, 254 (1998). The assessment of whether an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail is primarily factual because the arbitrator evaluates the evidence and the agency's handling of the evidence. Consequently, when the factual findings support the arbitrator's legal conclusion, the Authority will deny the exceptions to the arbitrator's determination. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 255.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, the Authority has held that "the penalty is part of the merits of the case, and that attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice where the agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would be reversed." <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA 1240, 1253 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Lambert</span>, 34 M.S.P.R. at 505). Applying this principle, the Authority held that "attorney fees may be warranted based on mitigation of a penalty[.]" <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 12</span>, 38 FLRA at 1253. In this connection, the Authority explained that the "critical point" is that "an agency should not act irresponsibly or unreasonably in imposing a penalty if it either knows or should have known that the penalty would not withstand...scrutiny[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (citing <span class="Italic">Ciarla v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. 240, 245 (1990) (<span class="Italic">Ciarla</span>)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that attorney fees were warranted in the interest of justice under the "knew or should have known" criterion for two reasons: (1) the 14-day suspension was mitigated because one of the charges against the grievant was not sustained; (2) the Agency knew or should have known that its choice of penalty would not be sustained.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the first reason, the Arbitrator found that the Agency's "conduct of the investigation" was "negligent[,]" because the investigation was untimely and depended on unreliable witness statements. Under Authority precedent, reliance on such unreliable information supports a conclusion that an agency knew or should have known it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">See United States Army Headquarters, XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, N.C.</span>, 35 FLRA 390, 394 (1990) (citing <span class="Italic">Yorkshire</span>, 746 F.2d at 1457 (knew or should have known criterion satisfied where agency possessed no trustworthy, admissible evidence, or was negligent in its conduct of the investigation)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">With respect to the second reason, the Arbitrator found that the Agency "fail[ed] to observe the rules of progressive discipline" or consider the <span class="Italic">Douglas </span>factors, as required by Article 32 of the parties' agreement. In particular, the Arbitrator found that the Agency failed to consider mitigating circumstances such as the grievant's superior employment record and the Agency representative's "egregious misconduct" during the incident that prompted the disciplinary action. According to the Arbitrator, the grievant's discipline should have been "minimal" in view of these considerations. These arbitral findings also support the Arbitrator's conclusion that the Agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Ciarla</span>, 43 M.S.P.R. at 244 (knew or should have known criterion established where discipline exceeded bounds of reasonableness).</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy, Norfolk Naval Shipyard</span>, 34 FLRA 725, 732-33 (1990), which the Agency cites, is inapposite because the arbitrator there specifically found that the agency had no way of knowing that its choice of penalty would not be sustained. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Shelton v. OPM</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 214, 221 (1989), which the Agency also cites, the Board found that "the agency could not have been expected to anticipate that the mitigating factors...would have been applied to mitigate" the penalty. Finally, the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">McMonagle v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco &#x0026; Firearms</span>, 26 M.S.P.R. 49 (1985), is misplaced because there, the arbitrator found that the agency possessed credible evidence that the employee committed the alleged offense. In this case, by contrast, the Arbitrator found no credible evidence to support the relevant charge.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the award satisfies the fifth criterion of the interest of justice requirements. Consequently, we deny the Agency's exception.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fees were warranted as a result of the mitigation of a suspension penalty from five to two days under the "knew or should have known" standard, <span class="Italic">SSA and AFGE Local 1923</span>, 63 FLRA 550, 551-52 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As the parties dispute only whether attorney fees are warranted in the interest of justice, we address only that issue. The Authority evaluates the "interest of justice" issue by applying the criteria originally established by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in <span class="Italic">Allen.

<p class="noindent-1">Determining whether attorney fees are warranted under the fifth <span class="Italic">Allen</span> criterion requires evaluation of the nature and weight of the evidence available to the agency at the time of its disputed action. <span class="Italic">See LIUNA, Local 1376, </span>54 FLRA at 703.

<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Arbitrator set forth specific factual findings in support of his legal conclusion that attorney fees were warranted in the interest of justice because the Agency should have known that it would not prevail in its choice of penalty. Specifically, the Arbitrator found that the Agency did not conduct a "sober and thorough" review of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors because it was "hung up" on the length of the grievant's service and the fact that he held a position of trust above the clerical level. The Arbitrator further found that the grievant had an "unblemished disciplinary record and an exemplary work record" and that he did not act maliciously or for gain, but because he was facing a family emergency.<span class="Italic"> </span>Therefore, the Arbitrator found that there was nothing to warrant a penalty that was three days more than the two-day minimum. In view of the Arbitrator's factual findings, to which we defer, the legal conclusion that the Agency "should have known" that it would not prevail is consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def., Dep't of Def. Dependents Schools, </span>54 FLRA 773, 790-91 (1998). Thus, although the Agency disagrees with the Arbitrator's factual findings, and the weight that he gave those findings in his analysis, it has not established that the Arbitrator erred.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, we note that the Agency's reliance on <span class="Italic">Navy</span> is misplaced.<span class="Italic"> See </span>Exception at 11 <span class="Italic">(citing Navy, </span>34 FLRA at 732-33).

In denying the union's exception to the arbitrator's finding, the Authority noted that the union had not established that the finding was erroneous or that it violated any applicable law or regulation.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 733. Similarly, here, the Arbitrator made specific factual findings, based on his evaluation of the evidence, and the Agency has not established that they were made in error or in violation of law or regulation.</p>

Health Serv., Region IV and NTEU Chap. 210</span>, 34 FLRA 823, 831-33 (1990), reversed the award of an arbitrator who refused fees to an employee improperly denied temporary promotion and awarding fees under the "knew or should have known" standard:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator's factual findings demonstrate that the Agency failed to gather and present relevant information and evidence pertaining to the grievant's performance of higher-graded duties. That information was exclusively within the possession and control of the Agency. If Agency management, represented by labor relations officials, had been aware of that information and evidence, then the Agency should have known that it would not prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Arbitrator found that the record...fully supported the Union's contention that the grievant performed the duties of a GS-5 secretary position....&#8197;The Arbitrator found that the Agency relied on the incorrect conclusion of its personnel specialist that the main difference between the GS-4 and GS-5 position "was that the GS-5 secretary was the personal assistant to the head of the office."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Those findings...establish that Agency management and the Agency's advocate in the arbitration proceeding relied on incomplete facts and information when preparing the case for arbitration. If the complete facts and information which were available within the Agency had been <span id="page_2465"></span>obtained, then the advocate and Agency management should have known that the Agency would not prevail in its contention that the grievant was not performing higher-graded duties....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Arbitrator...noted that the Agency should have been aware of the distinction between classification and assignment of duties at a higher level. He concluded that "there was excessive reliance upon a previous award of this Arbitrator."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In summary, we find as a matter of law that the Arbitrator erred when he ruled that attorney fees were not warranted. The Arbitrator's ruling is not consistent with his factual findings concerning the Agency's lack of knowledge of the duties performed by the grievant and the Agency's misunderstanding of the prior arbitration award. It is apparent from the Arbitrator's opinion and award that the Agency advocate should have been aware of the facts and information relating to the grievant's duty assignments because those matters were wholly within the Agency's control. The Agency and its advocate were responsible for making a proper investigation into the matter and ascertaining that information....&#8197;The Agency and its advocate should have, "by making reasonable inquiry," determined that the Agency would not prevail at arbitration....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the grievant is entitled to attorney fees in the interest of justice because the Agency should have known that it would not prevail on the merits....</p>
