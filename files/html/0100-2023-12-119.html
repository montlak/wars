<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-118"><span class="space">1.</span> Factual Findings; "Special Deference"</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board, like any other agency, is entitled to substitute its judgment for that of its hearing examiners. <span class="Italic">McDonough v. USPS</span>, 666 F.2d 647 (1st Cir. 1981). The Board reserves to itself the authority to make decisions on cases, giving only the weight it decides is due to initial decisions. An AJ acts as the Board's agent and has no independent statutory jurisdiction; however, the Board respects the AJ's opportunity to observe the demeanor of those who testify. <span class="Italic">Billingsley v. USPS</span>, 4 MSPR 368, 370, 4 MSPB 428 (1980). The Board may decide to make factual findings itself based on the record, when the AJ has not done so, and when the findings do not require determinations based upon the demeanor (credibility) of witnesses. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Negron v. DOJ</span>, 95 MSPR 561, 565 &#x00B6; 9 (2004). Whoever finds the facts, if charges sustained by the agency and the AJ are not supported by preponderant record evidence, the Board will not sustain the action. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. FAA</span>, 18 MSPR 178, 181 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When it reviews an initial decision, "the Board may freely substitute its own determinations of fact for those of the presiding official, giving the presiding official's findings only as much weight as may be warranted by the record and by the strength of the presiding official's reasoning," <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 129, 132-34, 2 MSPB 297 (1980):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In arguing that the presiding official incorrectly interpreted the evidence, appellant has merely stated his disagreement with the presiding official's conclusion. Although stating that the testimony is in conflict, and citing his own testimony as evidence of that conflict, appellant has pointed to nothing in the record that could explain why his testimony should be assessed as more credible than that of his supervisor. Apart from the bias allegation discussed below, appellant has identified no evidence and given the Board no reason tending to show that the presiding official's credibility determination was in error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701, the Board's presiding officials act as the Board's agents under delegated authority, issuing "initial" decisions which become final between the parties only if the Board itself does not review or reopen those decisions. The presiding officials have not independent statutory jurisdiction. Under this statutory scheme, it would not be appropriate for the Board to apply customary standards of appellate review, such as "clearly erroneous" or "arbitrary or capricious," to the findings of fact set forth in the initial decisions of its own employees. <span class="Italic">Compare FCC v. Allentown Broadcasting Corp.</span>, 349 U.S. 358, 363-365 (1955); <span class="Italic">Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB</span>, 340 U.S. 474, 492-493 (1951). Consequently, in reviewing an initial decision, this Board is free to substitute its own initial decision, this Board is free to substitute its own determinations of fact for those of the presiding official, giving the presiding official's findings only so much weight as may be warranted by the record and by the strength of the presiding official's reasoning.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In undertaking such reviews, however, the Board must recognize that demeanor evidence cannot by its nature be reflected fully in the written transcript, with the result that the Board must depend heavily upon the presiding official's assessment of witness credibility, at least when there are not other, perhaps more persuasive, indicia of credibility included in the record. For this reason, when questions of credibility are presented, due deference must necessarily be given to the assessment of the presiding official who was present to hear and observe the demeanor of the witnesses. <span class="Italic">Universal Camera, supra</span>, 340 U.S. at 496.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such Board review of the presiding official's fact finding will ordinarily be undertaken only when the petitioning party makes a showing consistent with 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115(b), which requires a demonstration that the initial decision is based on an erroneous interpretation (or application) of the statutory requirements governing the weight of the evidence. While the language of the petition may be simply drawn, there must be at least enough specified in the petition to enable the Board to ascertain whether there may be a serious evidentiary question justifying a complete review of the record. A mere conclusory allegation of factual error cannot be sufficient to trigger such a review, in view of Congress' clear desire to restrict the former multi-level appeals process. Before the Board will undertake the burden of a complete review of the record, the petitioning party must, as the regulation plainly states, explain in the petition why the challenged factual determination is incorrect, and identify the specific evidence in the record which demonstrates the error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When the alleged factual error relates to a credibility determination, as in this case, the petition for review must contain some specification of evidence or reasons warranting a review of the presiding official's credibility finding.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative law judge did not ignore the evidence that would support a finding of preferential treatment, and indeed he acknowledged several times that some of their actions might imply or create the appearance of wrongdoing.

It is our view that the administrative law judge gave a sizable body of particularly telling circumstantial evidence too little weight in favor of <span class="Italic">some</span> direct testimony that was inconsistent with that body of evidence. As a result, he explained away serious contradictions between the testimony and the other less favorable evidence in the record, crafting an improbable account of the events leading up to Woodson's appointment to the vacant position. <span class="Italic">See Hillen v. Department of the Army,</span> 35 M.S.P.R. 453, 458 (1987) (factors for assessment of credibility include the contradiction of the witness's version of events by other evidence or its consistency with other evidence, and the inherent improbability of the witness's version of events).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Lee</span> involved two respondents, the other being Diane Beatrez, who took the case to the Federal Circuit. That court reversed the Board's decision because the Board improperly overturned the AJ's findings concerning the appellant's intent, <span class="Italic">Beatrez v. MSPB</span>, 413 Fed. Appx. 298, 304-06 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Beatrez raises several arguments on appeal. We find it necessary to address only one of them: her contention that the Board erred in overturning the administrative judge's findings with respect to her intent. She argues that her actions were based on her belief that there was a legitimate management interest in expanding the announcement so that well-qualified merit promotion candidates at the place where the vacancy occurred could be considered. She argues that the Board erred because at worst, the evidence was as consistent with her having acted with an innocent intent as it was with her not having done so.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both the administrative judge and the Board recognized that this case turns on intent. The administrative judge found that Ms. Beatrez and Mr. Lee did not intend to violate &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6) by granting an illegal preference to Mr. Woodson. This finding was supported by the testimony of Ms. Beatrez, CMDR Hogan, Ms. NelsonPottinger, and Mr. Kogut, all of whom the administrative judge found credible. Noting that the agency may rely on circumstantial evidence to establish intent, the Board took the position that the HR specialists' culpability was undermined by CMDR O'Hare's emails and by what it concluded Ms. Beatrez and Mr. Lee knew about CMDR O'Hare's wishes. According to the Board, the administrative judge failed to take these considerations into account.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's reasons for substituting its own credibility determinations for that of the administrative judge are not sufficiently sound to justify overturning the administrative judge's finding as to Ms. Beatrez's intent. First, we note that while the Board's opinion addresses both HR specialists' culpability, the bulk of the considerations it points to for overturning the administrative judge pertain to Mr. Lee rather than Ms. Beatrez. For example, the Board stated that both Mr. Lee and Ms. Beatrez advised CMDR O'Hare regarding the language of the final vacancy announcement. The testimony does not support this assertion. Rather, it was Mr. Lee alone who emailed CMDR O'Hare and recommend cancelling the second set of vacancy announcements and advertising the position as a GS-09 with potential to GS-11. After receiving Mr. Lee's email, CMDR O'Hare emailed Mr. Lee and directed him to re-announce the position as a "GS-9/11 to expand the pool of qualified applicants with specific licensing experience." She also asked him to limit the announcement to the local commuting area. Mr. Lee passed this information to Ms. Beatrez, stating that she should re-announce the position as a GS-09/11 merit promotion vacancy limited to the Los Angeles commuting area. There is nothing in either the administrative judge's or the Board's decision <span id="Page_1703"></span>indicating that Ms. Beatrez actually advised CMDR O'Hare regarding the language of the final vacancy announcement.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Thus, Ms. Beatrez did not advise regarding the language of any of the vacancy announcements. The first and the second set of announcements were issued before the staffing assignment for the action was transferred to Ms. Beatrez.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further points to a "fairly significant paper trail of email messages" that "clearly document CMDR O'Hare's desire to select Woodson." The Board concluded that the HR specialists intentionally facilitated CMDR O'Hare's blatant attempt to violate &#x00A7; 2302(b)(6). The examples discussed in the Board opinion demonstrating CMDR O'Hare's blatant intent, however, are all emails between CMDR O'Hare and Mr. Lee. There is nothing in either the administrative judge's or the Board's decision indicating that Ms. Beatrez, who was located in Washington, D.C., had any direct contact with CMDR O'Hare. On the other hand, the testimony supports that Mr. Lee and CMDR O'Hare had frequent face-to-face conversations as well as email discussions at every stage of the process. In contrast, all of Ms. Beatrez's limited dealings were all with Mr. Lee.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Beyond the emails discussing CMDR O'Hare's desire to be able to consider Mr. Woodson and the advice provided regarding the vacancy announcements, the Board points to the "carefully tailored nature" of the third and final vacancy announcement. While the announcement expanded the experience level for potential applicants by advertising the open position at both the GS-09 and GS-11 levels, it limited consideration of applicants to the local commuting area. The Board expressed concern that such specifications precluded candidates from other Coast Guard REC facilities even though they were a precise match for the position in terms of their experience. A geographic limitation, however, is not inherently incompatible with an intent to expand the pool of well-qualified internal candidates. This court has previously concluded that 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 335.103(b)(2) provides that a vacancy announcement can be geographically limited so long as the area of consideration is sufficiently broad to ensure the availability of high quality candidates. The administrative judge recognized that it was entirely appropriate to use an announcement that would give the agency's internal candidates an opportunity to be considered for the position. Had the agency used this approach at the outset, the announcement would have been proper. It is only through the backdrop of the repeated postings and repostings that the announcements may have appeared at all suspicious--but Ms. Beatrez was not involved with those earlier postings. Her decision to issue the third vacancy announcement is consistent with her expressed intent to expand the announcement so that well-qualified merit promotion candidates at the place where the vacancy occurred could be considered. Ultimately, candidates from all three sets of announcements were considered.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to the extent that the Board is relying on Ms. Beatrez's decision to cancel the second set of vacancy announcements as circumstantial evidence of improper intent, Ms. Beatrez credibly explained: "I saw that there were just a limited number of applicants, most of which were applicants under the [DEU] or open competitive announcement, I made an assessment that the position was advertised in error so I cancelled that." It is undisputed that there were deficiencies in the first two sets of vacancy announcements and that re-announcing positions under such circumstances was a routine practice. The Board, in considering appropriate penalties, acknowledged this practice. It cited to Mr. Kogut's testimony stating that the Coast Guard frequently "reannounce[s] jobs to get the best quality candidates.... [Beatrez] would have seen this as something that was proper, appropriate versus inappropriate and wrong."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, most of the evidence discussed by the Board goes to CMDR O'Hare's improper intent and Mr. Lee's understanding of that intent. Much of the remaining evidence is at least as consistent with Ms. Beatrez having acted with an innocent intent as it was with her having intended to aid and abet CMDR O'Hare grant an unauthorized preference to Mr. Woodson. Admittedly, Ms. Beatrez testified that Ms. House had told her that CMDR O'Hare wanted to "try and reach Mr. Woodson." But given the above-described problems with the sufficiency of the circumstantial evidence used to infer Ms. Beatrez's intent, the Board's reasons for substituting its own credibility determinations for that of the administrative judge are not sufficiently sound. Accordingly, the Board's decision does not survive substantial evidence review.</p>

A complete factual review was conducted in <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 8 MSPR 204 (1981). The case involved two appellants removed for alleged threats to coworkers. The Board went through an elaborate analysis of the testimony, with citations to the transcript, determined that the threats had not been made, and reversed the initial decision sustaining the removals. The Board's opinion does not indicate what triggered the extensive review, although it may be significant that an administrative law judge of the Federal Labor Relations Authority determined that the employer committed numerous unfair labor practices in the appellant's workplace. (FLRA ALJs normally write detailed opinions, replete with record and legal citation and analysis.) When, in a different appeal, the Board reinstated a removal reversed by the AJ, Board Member Wertheim dissented, noting that the AJ weighed the evidence and the Board failed to state any basis for reversing the factual findings. <span class="Italic">Hayden v.

If the Board comes to a contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence, the Board must articulate a sound reason for this result. [<span class="Italic">Jackson</span> is discussed in Chapter 17, "<a href="0100-2023-24-037.html#sec17-37">Substantial Evidence; Factual Dispute</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The necessity for the Board to analyze evidence carefully when it reverses credibility determinations was emphasized, <span class="Italic">Chauvin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 F.3d 563, 566 (Fed. Cir. 1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ concluded that Chauvin did not intend to remove the plate from the shipyard without authorization. Specifically, the AJ found that scrap metal was commonly used for non-production and personal uses at the shipyard; that Chauvin did not attempt to conceal the plate in his truck, which was parked near a security gate in the shipyard parking lot; that Chauvin testified in a "consistent and credible" manner; and that Chauvin's explanation was corroborated by a written statement of a co-worker, who stated that prior to the date of the incident Chauvin informed him that he intended to obtain a property pass to borrow a piece of scrap metal for his truck. The board majority, disbelieving Chauvin's testimony, substituted its contrary finding. Chauvin argues that the board majority erred in reversing the AJ's credibility finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We agree. The board is not free simply to disagree with an AJ's assessment of credibility. <span class="Italic">Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985). Rather, the board must give special deference to the AJ's factual findings that are based, expressly or implicitly, on the demeanor of a witness. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. When the board reverses such a finding, we cannot sustain the decision on appeal unless the board has articulated sound reasons, based on the record, for its contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the board majority cited the Navy's policy prohibiting personal use of government property, Chauvin's position as a supervisor, and his actions in cutting the plate and placing it in his truck. None of these factors, however, is inconsistent with Chauvin's explanation that he planned to remove the plate from the shipyard only if his supervisor granted him a property pass. They are not probative of the charge of attempted removal. Also, whether a property pass would have been granted does not show lack of intention to obtain one. The evidence cited by the board thus fails to rebut Chauvin's consistent and corroborated explanation for his having placed the plate in his truck. Moreover, the board majority's finding is inconsistent with the Navy's admission during discovery that it did not contend that Chauvin intended to remove the plate from the shipyard without a property pass. We conclude, as did the dissenting board member, and as the Navy now concedes, that the board majority did not articulate a sufficient reason for its disbelief of Chauvin's testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1331 ("[E]vidence in the record which, when taken alone, may amount to 'substantial evidence' and therefore support the Board's decision, will often be insufficient when the trial examiner has, on the basis of the witnesses' demeanor, made credibility determinations contrary to the board's position.") (quoting <span class="Italic">Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Bd.</span>, 565 F.2d 1074, 1078 (9th Cir. 1977)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the deference that should have been afforded the AJ's credibility-based finding concerning Chauvin's intent, and the Navy's admission that it did not allege that Chauvin intended to remove the plate from the shipyard without authorization, we cannot agree that a reasonable fact-finder would have found that Chauvin intended to take that action. <span class="Italic">See Jackson</span>, 768 F.2d at 1332. Because the Navy failed to prove intent, an essential element of the attempted removal charge, the board's decision sustaining the charge is not supported by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">See Burroughs v. Dept. of Army</span>, 918 F.2d 170, 172 (Fed. Cir. 1990) ("If the agency fails to prove one of the elements of its charge, then the entire charge must fail."). We therefore reverse the board's decision insofar as it sustains the charge of attempted removal of government property.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Determinations by an AJ as to the appellant's rehabilitation potential may equate to credibility findings entitled to Board deference, <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. VA</span>, <a href="http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/opinions-orders/15-3196.Opinion.9-30-2016.1.PDF">838 F.3d 1367</a>, 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2016):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[F]indings about Mr. Purifoy's propensity for rehabilitation are necessarily intertwined with issues of credibility and an analysis of his demeanor at trial, and they deserved deference from the Board....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AJ makes findings that do not provide specific record references, the Board may independently review the evidence of record to determine if the AJ's findings are supported. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Blake v. DOJ</span>, 81 MSPR 394, 401 &#x00B6; 8 (1999).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board may also independently review findings not dependent on credibility assessments, <span class="Italic">Hale v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 772 F.2d 882, 886 (Fed. Cir. 1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case may be distinguished from another recent decision by this court, <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985), in which this court reversed the board and concluded that the presiding official's determination that the agency had not proved its case by a preponderance of the evidence was correct. The court there reversed the board's decision because the decision of the presiding official was based on credibility of witnesses, an issue on which the presiding official should be accorded substantial deference. Here, the board's decision not to adopt the presiding official's initial decision was based entirely on a review of documentary evidence, the identical evidence presented to the presiding official and to this court. Where the final decision of the board is based entirely on a question of law, as is this case, there is no basis for according substantial deference to the presiding official's conclusion.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an AJ's findings are not based on the AJ's observation of a witness and consideration of his or her demeanor, the Board need not defer to related findings by the AJ that are contrary to the preponderance of the evidence. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v.

In this case, the initial decision's findings do not indicate that the administrative judge relied upon the demeanor of the witnesses.").

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Caddell v. DOJ</span>, 61 MSPR 670, 682 (1994), concluded that "remand is unnecessary where the record is sufficiently well-developed, and findings can be based on factors other than the witnesses' demeanor." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rackers v.

The same result occurred in <span class="Italic">Frederick v. DOJ</span>, 65 MSPR 517, 532 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, although resolving conflicts in the evidence and deciding issues of credibility is normally the province of the administrative judge, we find that the record is sufficiently developed to address this question without a remand, because we need not base our findings on the factor of demeanor. <span class="Italic">See Uske v. USPS</span>, 60 MSPR 544, 557 (1994). Mr. Womack's demeanor is not at issue, because he did not testify at the hearing and the administrative judge thus had no opportunity to observe him. While the administrative judge certainly had the opportunity to observe Mr. Mayberry's demeanor during the latter's testimony, he did not record his observations in the initial decision and thus apparently did not conclude that they significantly influenced the result that he reached. We find that the issue thus can be resolved here based on factors other than demeanor and that a remand is unnecessary. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_1705"></span>As to its authority to find facts, under <span class="Italic">Deskin v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 505, 510 (1997):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reviewing an initial decision where the record is complete on the issues in conflict, the Board is free to substitute its own determinations of fact for those of the administrative judge, giving his findings only as much weight as may be warranted by the record and by the strength of his reasoning<span class="Italic">.

Further, the Board may substitute its own credibility determinations for an administrative judge's explicit or implicit credibility findings where the administrative judge's findings are not based on the demeanor of the witnesses<span class="Italic">. See Jackson v. Veterans Administration</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

<p class="Body-Text">As to Board authority to reverse the credibility findings of an AJ, the Board may modify those findings on a matter established by circumstantial evidence, e.g., theft, if it has a sound reason, based on the record, for its contrary evaluation of the testimonial evidence. Although the Board chose one set of inferences from the same facts that led the AJ to another set of inferences, the court sustained the Board's ruling, citing <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325, 1330 (Fed. Cir. 1985). <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Air Force</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2648).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the Board wants to affirm the AJ, it rules that the administrative findings were not shown to have rested on testimony either inherently improbable or based on internal inconsistencies, or it rules that the evidence was "merely susceptible to varying interpretations." <span class="Italic">Carroll v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 87, 89 (1987) (citing <span class="Italic">Sowers v. USDA</span>, 24 MSPR 492, 495 (1984)); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 34 MSPR 373, 375 (1987) ("The appellant has failed to establish that the administrative judge's credibility determinations, based on both demeanor and corroboration, actually rested on internal inconsistencies or inherent improbabilities."). Conversely, when documents or objective evidence contradict a witness's testimony or where the explanation itself is so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable factfinder would not credit it, the reviewing authority may find clear error in the purported credibility determination. <span class="Italic">Bledsoe v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 93, 108 &#x00B6; 29 (2002) (considering the inherent improbability of events); <span class="Italic">Bradley v.

DHHS</span>, 34 MSPR 252, 257-58 (1987) ("When documents or objective evidence contradict the witness' story or when the story itself is so internally inconsistent or implausible on its face that a reasonable factfinder would not credit it, the reviewing authority may find clear error in the purported credibility determination."). The Board may be less inclined to entertain objections to findings based on documents or testimony if that evidence was introduced by the party who makes objections to its interpretation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Merchant v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 330, 333 n.6 (1992).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Credibility findings of an AJ were set aside in an appeal involving six or so agency witnesses whose testimony was not consistent, against the testimony of the appellant, found to be consistent. The Board's decision may have been influenced by what appeared to be an attempt by the agency to prevent the appellant from securing some critical testimony and also by the agency's failure to file an opposition to the appellant's PFR. <span class="Italic">Madison v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 465, 468-69 (1987). Credibility findings concerning the intent of the appellant to falsify a SF-171 employment application were set aside in <span class="Italic">Delessio v. USPS</span>, 33 MSPR 517, 519-20 (1987), the Board concluding that the AJ did not consider the total evidence. The same result occurred in another SF-171 falsification case, <span class="Italic">Harmon v. GSA</span>, 61 MSPR 327, 332 (1994), with the Board noting that "[w]hile we normally accord due deference to credibility determinations made by an administrative judge on the basis of a witness's demeanor, the question of the appellant's intent must be resolved not from demeanor evidence alone, but rather from the totality of the circumstantial evidence."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming that the party filing the PFR provides precise citation to evidence, and given the Board's position on review of credibility issues, what does the Board review? <span class="Italic">Broughton v. DHHS</span>, 33 MSPR 357, 359 (1987), suggested that without internal inconsistencies or inherent improbability of evidence, it is the credibility analysis that counts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant's petition contains specific citations to the record in support of her contentions that the administrative judge erred.... However, the petition fails to identify any internal inconsistency or inherent improbability in the fact findings of the administrative judge or other basis sufficient to overcome the special deference which reviewing bodies must necessarily accord the factual determinations of the original trier of fact. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 768 F.2d 1325 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">Connolly v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 766 F.2d 507 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The initial decision reflects that the administrative judge considered the evidence as a whole, drew appropriate inferences, and made reasoned conclusions on issues of credibility. Under these circumstances, the Board finds no reason to disturb those conclusions.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Broughton</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Kirkpatrick v. USPS</span>, 74 MSPR 583, 588 (1997) ("[T]he Board will not disturb an administrative judge's conclusions where an appellant's petition for review fails to identify any internal inconsistency or inherent improbability in the administrative judge's fact findings, or other basis sufficient to overcome the special deference which reviewing bodies must necessarily accord the factual determinations of the original trier of fact."); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Iyer v.

<p class="Body-Text">A typical analysis calling into question an AJ's credibility analysis and examining the probative value of hearsay is provided by <span class="Italic">Womack v. USPS</span>, 70 MSPR 285, 291-93 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While hearsay is admissible in proceedings before the Board, the assessment of the probative value of such evidence depends on the circumstances of each case. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Reniere v. Dept. of Agric.</span>, 62 MSPR 648, 652 (1994). The determination of whether hearsay alone is sufficient to sustain a charge depends on its reliability and trustworthiness. <span class="Italic">See SSA v.</span> <span class="Italic">Whittlesey</span>, 59 MSPR 684, 692 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 39 F.3d 1197 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __U.S.__, 115 S. Ct. 1690, 131 L. Ed.2d 555 (1995). The probative value of such evidence must be evaluated in terms of the factors set forth in <span class="Italic">Borninkhof v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 5 MSPB 150, 5 MSPR 77, 83-87 (1981), such as the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing, the agency's explanation for failing to obtain signed or sworn statements, whether the out-of-court declarant was a disinterested witness to the events, the consistency of the declarant's account with other information, whether corroboration for statements can be found in the agency's record, the absence of contradictory evidence, and the credibility of the declarant when he made the statement attributed to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the administrative judge did not address information in the record that is material in determining the weight to be accorded the hearsay statement of Ingram.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">First, the agency offered no explanation for its failure to call Ingram to testify at the hearing. Instead, the agency called Horger, who testified that the appellant approached Ingram and questioned Ingram regarding whether he deserved to be back at work on limited duty. Horger testified that the appellant called the injury compensation office in Cleveland, representing herself as the injury compensation specialist, and asked about Ingram's medical condition and whether Ingram should have been returned to work. Horger stated that his knowledge of the incident was based on what Ingram told him, and that he reported the incident to Draper. Although the hearing in this appeal occurred over six years after the appellant's demotion, the agency did not show, or even assert, that Ingram was unavailable, and did not obtain a written statement or explain why it did not obtain such a statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Second, corroboration for Ingram's account of the incident cannot be found in the agency's record. The only documentary evidence relating to this charge is a January 24, 1989 memorandum from Draper to the appellant, instructing the appellant to "refrain from further interference in, and misrepresentation of the Youngstown MSC Injury Compensation Unit." The memorandum also states that, should further problems arise, including unauthorized telephone calls to outside agencies, the appellant will be subject to adverse action. While this memorandum may establish that Horger reported Ingram's account of the incident to Draper, it does not corroborate Ingram's account of what occurred.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Third, Horger's testimony regarding what Ingram told him is contradicted by the appellant's live testimony. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. DHHS</span>, 39 MSPR 110, 115 (1988) (hearsay evidence may not be sufficiently probative, in light of contradictory live testimony, to sustain an agency's burden by preponderant evidence). The appellant testified that she did call the Department of Labor after Ingram told her that he could not get through to his claims examiner. The appellant testified that, after reaching the claims examiner, she handed Ingram the telephone and left the office so he could talk to the examiner in private. She testified that she never questioned Ingram or asked him anything; rather, Ingram told her what he needed and she made the call, handed him the telephone, and left the office. She testified that did not talk to Ingram's claims examiner that day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Fourth, Ingram is not a disinterested witness to the events and his credibility is cause for concern. The agency's specification suggests that Ingram had filed an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint against the appellant before this incident occurred. Ingram's statement could therefore be tainted by any bias he may have felt toward the appellant....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Walker v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 59 MSPR 309, 325 (1993), conducted a complete analysis of the testimony and evidence in a sexual harassment case to justify setting aside the AJ's credibility findings favoring the appellant. The Board found no legal fault in the AJ's analysis, but the Board drew different conclusions <span id="Page_1706"></span>as to who should be believed after examining the testimony and evidence in the appeal. The explanation for the result was that the Board was justified under <span class="Italic">Weaver v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 2 MSPR 129, 2 MSPB 297 (1980), in giving the AJ's findings only the weight warranted by the record and the strength of her reasoning, and that its approach was justified because a critical piece of evidence consisted of a tape recording of a telephone conversation that the Board determined could be analyzed by the AJ no better than by the Board.</p>
