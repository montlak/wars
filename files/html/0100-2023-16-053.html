<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-54"><span class="space">1.</span> Breach Amounting to Repudiation of Agreement; <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span></span></h4>
<p class="noindent">In 1996 FLRA provided some clarification of tests applied to contract repudiation cases by disavowing the previous "differing and arguable" interpretation and instead focusing upon the nature and scope of the alleged breach, i.e., was the breach clear and patent, and whether the provision went to the heart of the parties' agreement. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB and NAGE Local R7-23</span>, 51 FLRA 858, 861-864 (1996), involving the employer's change in smoking rules allegedly covered by an agreement requiring negotiations of changes in smoking practices based on safety hazards, internal security measures, or the health of an ill employee, explained:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We construe the complaint as alleging that the Respondent's actions constituted an unlawful repudiation of the parties' agreements. <span class="Italic">See U.S. Department of the Air</span> <span class="Italic">Force, 56th Combat Support Group (TAC), MacDill Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Florida</span>, 41 FLRA 850, 855 n.* (1991). In <span class="Italic">Department of</span> <span class="Italic">Defense, Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins Air Force</span> <span class="Italic">Base, Georgia</span>, 40 FLRA 1211 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Warner Robins</span>), the Authority stated the following with respect to whether a party's failure or refusal to honor an agreement constitutes a repudiation of a collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">We find that the nature and scope of the failure or refusal to honor an agreement must be considered, in the circumstances of each case, in order to determine whether the Statute has been violated. Because the breach of an agreement may only be a single instance, it does not necessarily follow that the breach does not violate the Statute....&#8197;Rather, it is the nature and scope of the breach that are relevant. Where the nature and scope of the breach amount to a repudiation of an obligation imposed by the agreement's terms, we will find that an unfair labor practice has occurred in violation of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1218-19<span class="Italic">. See Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. 648, 664 (1985) (if the violation of an agreement provision constitutes a clear and patent breach of the terms of the agreement, then the union may file an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority), <span class="Italic">citing Iowa National Guard and National Guard</span> <span class="Italic">Bureau</span>, 8 FLRA 500, 510-11 (1982); <span class="Italic">Panama Canal Commission</span>, <span class="Italic">Balboa, Republic of Panama</span>, 43 FLRA 1483, 1507-09 (1992), <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied</span>, 45 FLRA 1075 (1992) (the respondent's actions in unilaterally terminating employees' negotiated right to appeal adverse actions through the administrative appeals procedures went to the heart of the parties' agreements and constituted a repudiation of the agreement provisions). <span class="Italic">See also Department of Defense Dependents</span> <span class="Italic">Schools</span>, 50 FLRA 424, 426-27 (1995).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, two elements are examined in analyzing an allegation of repudiation: (1) the nature and scope of the alleged breach of an agreement (<span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, was the breach clear and patent?); and (2) the nature of the agreement provision allegedly breached, <span class="Italic">i.e.</span>, did the provision go to the heart of the parties' agreement?). The examination of either element may involve an inquiry into the meaning of the agreement provision allegedly breached. However, for the reasons that follow, it is not always necessary to determine the precise meaning of the provision in order to analyze an allegation of repudiation.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, a case involving an alleged breach of a union's statutory right to designate its representative, the Authority held that "when a respondent claims as a defense...that a specific provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement permitted its actions alleged to constitute an unfair labor practice, the Authority, including its administrative law judges, will determine the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and will resolve the unfair labor practice complaint accordingly<span class="Italic">." IRS</span>, 47 FLRA at 1103. In doing this, the Authority applies "the same standards and principles in interpreting collective bargaining agreements as applied by arbitrators" and Federal courts and gives controlling weight to the parties' intent. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at 1110. However, to the extent that IRS and other precedent suggest that it is <span class="Italic">always</span> necessary to determine the <span class="Italic">precise</span> meaning of an agreement provision in order to resolve an allegation that a respondent repudiated that provision, we will no longer follow that precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, with regard to the first element, it is necessary to show that a respondent's action constituted "a clear and patent breach of the terms of the agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">Cornelius v. Nutt</span>, 472 U.S. at 664 (citation omitted). In those situations where the meaning of a particular agreement term is unclear, acting in accordance with a reasonable interpretation of that term, even if it is not the only reasonable interpretation, does not constitute a clear and patent breach of the terms of the agreement.[5] <span class="Italic">Cf., e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Crest Litho, Inc.</span>, 308 NLRB 108, 110 (1992) (NLRB will not find a violation "if the record shows that an employer has a sound arguable basis for ascribing a particular meaning to his contract and his action is in accordance with the terms of the contract as he construes it.") (citing <span class="Italic">Vickers, Inc.</span>, 153 NLRB 561, 570 (1965)). With regard to the second element, if a provision is not of a nature that goes to the heart of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, then it is not necessary to determine the meaning of the provision because, even if the respondent breached the parties' agreement, that breach would not amount to a repudiation.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;The Authority has previously rejected the "'differing and arguable interpretations' analysis...<span class="Italic">." IRS</span>, 47 FLRA at 1103. Under that analysis, the Authority had dismissed complaints alleging a violation of a statutory right when the parties had presented differing and arguable interpretations of the collective bargaining agreement. The analysis was rejected, in part, because it was the subject of confusion<span class="Italic">. See id</span>. at 1104. In addition, in certain cases it left no forum available to resolve the allegation of a violation of a statutory right. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. at 1103. Insofar as the Authority's statement in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> indicates that the reasonableness of a respondent's interpretation of a provision is irrelevant to resolving a complaint alleging a repudiation, it will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this case, we find that no repudiation occurred because the Respondent's action did not constitute a clear and patent breach of the terms of the 1989 agreement. In examining the nature and scope of the alleged failure or refusal to honor the agreement provision, we conclude that the Respondent's argument regarding the interpretation of the 1989 agreement provision is reasonable. The provision allows the Respondent to implement changes to smoking practices before negotiating with the Union in three situations, including cases involving the health of an ill employee. Stating that it was acting "in accordance with" this provision, the Respondent implemented changes to smoking practices in Building 1521 because the unit employee "can not be exposed to secondhand smoke because of health reasons." The provision can be construed in a number of reasonable ways, and we agree with the Judge that in light of the ambiguous wording of the provision and the parties' bargaining history, the "Respondent could reasonably have found that [the employee] was within the category of individuals covered by the procedure which the parties negotiated." Thus, even if the Respondent breached the 1989 agreement, a finding we do not make, the breach was not clear and patent and no repudiation occurred.[7]</p>

<p class="noindent-1">Further, the Agency's reliance on the Authority's "covered-by" doctrine is misplaced.

<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the framework that was set forth in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def., Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga.</span>, 40 FLRA 1211 (1991) (<span class="Italic">DoD</span>), the Authority held in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> that it will examine two elements in analyzing an allegation of repudiation: (1) the nature and scope of the alleged breach of an agreement (i.e., was the breach clear and patent?); and (2) the nature of the agreement provision allegedly breached (i.e., did the provision go to the heart of the parties' agreement?). <span class="Italic">See Scott AFB</span>, 51 FLRA at 862. The examination of either element may require an inquiry into the meaning of the agreement provision allegedly breached. However, it is not always necessary to determine the precise meaning of the provision in order to analyze an allegation of repudiation. <span class="Italic">See id. </span>at 862 n.4 (the Authority will no longer follow precedent suggesting "that it is <span class="Italic">always</span> necessary to determine the <span class="Italic">precise</span> meaning of an agreement provision in order to resolve an allegation that a respondent repudiated that provision[.]" (emphasis in original)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, with regard to the first element, the Authority stated in <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">it is necessary to show that a respondent's action constituted "a clear and patent breach of the terms of the agreement[.]" <span class="Italic">Cornelius v.

<p class="noindent-1">In such a case it is not necessary to examine the second element.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 864. Accordingly, in resolving whether the Judge erred in finding a repudiation, the analytical question here is whether the Respondent acted under a reasonable interpretation of the parties' agreements. The Authority has applied this standard in a number of cases. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, Seymour Johnson Air Force Base</span>, 57 FLRA 772, 774 (2002) (Authority upheld judge's finding of no repudiation where the respondent's interpretation of the parties' agreement was reasonable) (<span class="Italic">Seymour Johnson AFB</span>); <span class="Italic">Social Sec.

<p class="noindent-1">The Respondent disputes the Judge's interpretation of the parties' agreements. In this connection, the Respondent asserts that it acted in accordance with the parties' agreements, as demonstrated by the testimony of its witnesses--the only witnesses who were actually at the bargaining table--as to the parties' intent when negotiating these provisions. We construe this assertion as a claim that the Respondent acted under a reasonable interpretation of the parties' agreements. Based on the testimony cited by the Respondent, which is discussed more fully below, we find that the Respondent acted under a reasonable interpretation of &#x00A7; 9(a) and Article 27 and, as such, did not commit a clear and patent breach of those provisions.</p>

The Authority plainly erred in considering parol evidence that directly contradicts the unambiguous meaning of the contractual terms.</p>
<p class="noindent">On remand from the D.C. Circuit, FLRA determined that the agency committed a ULP by its repudiation of a local agreement that provided for the agency to retain employees in a duty or approved leave status while undergoing substance abuse rehabilitation, and FLRA left for compliance proceedings the relief, if any, to be provided employees adversely affected by the repudiation, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Davis-Monthan AFB and AFGE Local 2924</span>, 64 FLRA 355, 355-58 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As relevant here, the unfair labor practice (ULP) complaint filed by the General Counsel (GC) alleges that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by repudiating negotiated agreements related to drug testing and rehabilitation. In <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Air Force, Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Arizona, </span>60 FLRA 895 (2005) (Member Pope dissenting) <span class="Italic">(Davis-Monthan), </span>the Authority dismissed the complaint on the ground that the Respondent did not commit clear and patent breaches of the parties' agreements.

<p class="noindent-1">II. History of the Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A. Facts</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The facts in this case are set forth fully in <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan, </span>60 FLRA 895, and decision of the Judge, 60 FLRA at 907-916, and are only briefly summarized here. In accordance with Executive Order 12564, "Drug-Free Federal Workplace," the parties executed the "Air Force Civilian Drug Testing Agreement Between Davis-Monthan Air Force Base and AFGE Local 2924" (Local Drug Agreement).<span class="Italic"> Davis-Monthan, </span>60 FLRA at 895, 896. Section 9(a) of the Local Drug Agreement, which addresses employees who have positive drug tests and who have been referred for rehabilitation, provides: "The Employer will retain employees in a duty or approved leave status while undergoing rehabilitation. If placed in a non-duty status, the employee will normally be returned to duty after successful completion of rehabilitation." <span class="Italic">Id. </span>The Local Drug Agreement was incorporated by the parties into their collective bargaining agreement (the parties' agreement). Article 27 of the parties' agreement provides that rehabilitation is the "ultimate objective of the drug and alcohol abuse program" and that "[r]eferral for diagnosis and acceptance of treatment should in no way jeopardize an employee's job security or promotional opportunities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">After the Respondent terminated Employees C, H and N, the Charging Party filed a charge, which was subsequently amended. The GC filed a complaint alleging that the Respondent violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by terminating the employees in repudiation of several contractual provisions, including &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement and Article 27 of the parties' agreement. Prior to the filing of the amended charge, each of the employees filed independent appeals of their terminations either through the negotiated grievance procedure or with the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">D. The Court's Decision in <span class="Italic">Local 2924</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">On appeal, the court held that the Authority's interpretation of the parties' agreements could not be "squared with the plain language of those agreements[, which is] indisputably clear in establishing a temporary safe harbor for employees who are properly engaged in rehabilitation and not otherwise unsuitable for employment." <span class="Italic">Local 2924, </span>470 F.3d at 377. In particular, the court found that there was no ambiguity in &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement or Article 27 of the parties' agreement and that the Authority erred in its reliance on the testimony of Respondent officials to interpret the provisions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 382-83. The court stated: "Section 9 and Article 27 create a safe harbor that protects a narrow class of employees for a limited period of time so that they may focus on treatment and rehabilitation." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 383. Finding that the Authority erred in concluding that the Respondent did not clearly and patently breach the agreements, the court set aside the Authority's dismissal of the complaint and remanded the case to the Authority "to give effect to the plain meaning of the agreements and apply the second prong of [the] repudiation test[.]" <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 384.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">III. Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A. The Provisions Breached by the respondent go to the heart of the parties' agreements.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In evaluating the second element of repudiation, the Authority focuses on the importance of the provision that was breached, or allegedly breached, relative to the agreement in which it is contained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., U.S. Dep't of Homeland Sec., Border &#x0026; Transp. Sec. Directorate, Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Wash., D.C.,</span> 60 FLRA 943, 952 (2005) (then-Member Pope dissenting on other grounds)<span class="Italic"> (Bureau of Customs)</span> (provisions setting forth bargaining obligation on issue of firearm policy were sole purpose for, and therefore went to the heart of, a memorandum between parties); <span class="Italic">24th Combat Support Group, Howard Air Force Base, Rep. of Pan., </span>55 FLRA 273, 282 (1999) <span class="Italic">(Howard AFB)</span> (provisions relating to availability of negotiated grievance procedure went to heart of parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga., </span>52 FLRA 225, 231-32 (1996) (provision related to indoor smoking went to heart of smoking policy agreement); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Wash., D.C. &#x0026; Mid-Pacific Reg'l Office, Sacramento, Cal.,</span> 46 FLRA 9, 28 (1992) (provision related to positions included in bargaining unit went to heart of parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">Pan. Canal Comm'n Balboa, Rep. of Pan., </span>43 FLRA 1483, 1508-09 (1992) <span class="Italic">(Pan. Canal)</span> (provisions allowing certain employees to appeal adverse decisions through the administrative grievance procedure went to the heart of the parties' agreement); <span class="Italic">Dep't of Def., Warner Robins Air Logistics Ctr., Robins Air Force Base, Ga., </span>40 FLRA 1211, 1219-20 (1991) (provision related to shift scheduling and official time for union representatives went to the heart of the parties' negotiation ground rules agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As discussed above, the Judge found that &#x00A7; 9 went "to the very heart of the Local Drug Agreement" and that the Respondent's refusal to comply with it negated "the primary purpose of the agreement[,] which is to provide for the rehabilitation of employees and their return to prior positions." <span class="Italic">Davis-Monthan, </span>60 FLRA at 919. Although the Respondent challenged the Judge's interpretation of &#x00A7; 9, it filed no exception to his finding that this provision went to the heart of the Local Drug Agreement. Therefore, we find that &#x00A7; 9, which deals solely with the drug rehabilitation process, goes to the heart of the Local Drug Agreement and its negotiated protections for employees.<span class="Italic"> See, e.g., Bureau of Customs, </span>60 FLRA at 952 (provision related to sole purpose of agreement goes to the heart of the agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, the Judge found that Article 27 was "a critical adjunct to the Local Drug Agreement and a very important part of the [parties' agreement]."<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 919-20. As with the Judge's interpretation of &#x00A7; 9 of the Local Drug Agreement, the Respondent filed no exception to the Judge's finding regarding Article 27. In previous repudiation cases, the Authority has found that provisions related to employee disciplinary protections go to the heart of the agreements in which they are contained. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Howard AFB, </span>55 FLRA at 282 (availability of negotiated grievance procedure); <span class="Italic">Pan. Canal,</span> 43 FLRA at 1508-09 (availability of administrative grievance procedure). In accordance with this precedent, and in the absence of an exception to the Judge's conclusion regarding Article 27, we find that Article 27, which provides protection against some disciplinary action, goes to the heart of the parties' agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, we find that the second prong of the repudiation test has been met. We therefore consider the remainder of the exceptions raised by the parties.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span> was explained and applied in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Robins AFB and AFGE Local 987</span>, 52 FLRA 225, 230 (1996), finding a ULP when management implemented changes in a smoking policy without completing bargaining, <span id="Page_1278"></span>despite a clear agreement requiring bargaining over changes in smoking policies. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DOD Foreign Language Ctr. and AFGE Local 1263</span>, 64 FLRA 735, 747 (2010) (applying <span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>); <span class="Italic">VA Outpatient Pharmacy Leavenworth and AFGE Local 85</span>, 60 FLRA 844, 848-50 (2005) (exploring element of repudiation analysis); <span class="Italic">Laughlin AFB and AFGE Local 1749</span>, 52 FLRA 413, 414 n.2 (1996) (no ULP when there was no clear and patent breach of settlement agreement).</p>
<p class="noindent">If the there is an unlawful repudiation of an agreement, written or verbal, it may not be necessary to determine whether the agency also violated the statute by unilaterally implementing changed conditions of employment, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 93</span>, 64 FLRA 777, 780 n.11 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As set forth <span class="Italic">supra</span> note 5, the Arbitrator also stated that the Agency improperly changed conditions of employment without bargaining. As the finding that the Agency repudiated the oral agreement supports a conclusion that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5), it is unnecessary to determine whether the Agency also violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) by effecting a unilateral change in conditions of employment. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">U.S. DHS, Border &#x0026; Transp. Sec. Directorate, Bureau of Customs &#x0026; Border Prot., Wash., D.C,</span> 63 FLRA 406, 408 n.1, <span class="Italic">reconsideration denied,</span> 63 FLRA 600 (2009) (after finding respondent unlawfully failed to provide notice and opportunity to bargain, Authority found it unnecessary to also address whether respondent repudiated agreement "because a finding of repudiation would be only cumulative and would not materially affect the remedy[.]") Consequently, it also is unnecessary to resolve the Agency's contention that the effects of the alleged unilateral change were <span class="Italic">de minimis</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU,</span> 64 FLRA 462, 464 (2010) (<span class="Italic">de minimis</span> doctrine applies to determine whether there is an obligation to bargain).</p>
<p class="noindent">Reviewing exceptions to an arbitrator's award in <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS, Office of Chief Counsel and NTEU</span>, 70 FLRA 783, 785 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting), the Authority noted that if there is no contract violation, the contract cannot have been repudiated. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 93</span>, 64 FLRA 777, 780 (2010) ("the 'covered by' defense does not apply to allegations that an agency repudiated a collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Air Force, 375th Mission Support Squadron, Scott Air Force Base, Ill.,</span> 51 FLRA 858, 864 n.7 (1996) (<span class="Italic">Scott AFB</span>) (citation omitted). Thus, the Agency's reliance on the 'covered by' doctrine does not provide a basis for concluding that the Arbitrator erred by finding that the Agency violated &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute by repudiating the oral agreement.").
