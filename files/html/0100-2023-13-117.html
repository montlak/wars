<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-116"><span class="space">c.</span> Arrest</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Probable cause determined through an indictment supports an indefinite suspension. A warrantless arrest is insufficient. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. <span class="Italic">Gonzales v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 37 MSPR 589, 592-93 (1988), set aside an indefinite suspension that was not based on the initiation of formal criminal proceedings or an independent agency investigation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Examples that would establish "reasonable cause" under &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) include: (1) An indictment; (2) an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; (3) an arrest or investigation accompanied by such circumstances showing reasonable cause; (4) a criminal information; and (5) certain egregious acts such as murder or national security offenses, which are detrimental to the agency's mission, brought to the agency's attention via the news media. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin,</span> 12 MSPR at 19. <span class="Italic">See also Dunnington v. Department of Justice,</span> 36 MSPR 122, 124-125 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While an investigation or arrest, standing alone, is insufficient to establish "reasonable cause" to invoke the shortened notice procedure of &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) to effect an indefinite suspension, an investigation or arrest may be accompanied by such circumstances that would give rise to a showing of "reasonable cause." <span class="Italic">See Martin</span>, 12 MSPR at 19. Thus, we disagree with the administrative judge's determination in the instant case that an agency cannot effect an indefinite suspension action under the shortened notice procedure of &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) based on the evidence uncovered by an investigation. <span class="Italic">See id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, we concur in the administrative judge's determination that the agency in this case has failed to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it had "reasonable cause" to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, so as to justify his indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Martin,</span> 12 MSPR at 17-19. At the time of the agency's decision, the appellant had not been arrested, indicted, or bound over by a magistrate. The appellant was never arrested, and he was not formally charged with indecent exposure until after the agency issued the decision notice. The appellant's alleged criminal conduct was not an egregious act, such as murder or a national security offense. At the time it effected the indefinite suspension action, the agency had available and relied on only the police reports and other documentation contained in the police file. The agency did not conduct any investigation of the appellant's alleged conduct beyond a review of the police file and discussions with police officials concerning the police investigation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to establish that, at the time it suspended the appellant indefinitely, it had reasonable cause to believe that he had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See Martin,</span> 12 MSPR at 19<span class="Italic">. See also Dunnington</span>, 36 MSPR at 124-126; <span class="Italic">Morse v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 25 MSPR 346 (1984). We therefore conclude that the indefinite suspension action against the appellant was improper and cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A judicial finding of probable cause, following an arrest, supports an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Jones v. GPO</span>, 13 MSPR 365, 368-69 (1982), involving an indefinite suspension taken pursuant to a shortened notice period, concluded as to an appeal of an employee suspended pending resolution of criminal charges arising out of the stabbing death of her husband:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[I]n order to support an indefinite suspension, it is not enough for an agency to submit evidence that at the time of the suspension action, the employee had been arrested or that he or she was under investigation. Rather, where there was no indictment, it must also present evidence that such circumstances did indeed exist at the time that it effected the suspension action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency submissions in the instant case did not establish that such circumstances existed at the time that it proposed the suspension action. The copies of court documents submitted by the agency reveal that appellant had been arrested and charged with "Homicide" in connection with her husband's death. In addition, although they reveal that a preliminary hearing had been set on the criminal charge which had been reduced to second degree murder, there was no showing that a judicial determination of probable cause had been made. The report which was provided by the Agency's Inspector General confirmed the nature of the criminal charge and the fact that the preliminary hearing had been set, but did not refer to any judicial finding of probable cause or set out evidence which would support a reasonable cause finding. Similarly, although the report and the agency investigator in his testimony described the homicide detective's conversation with the investigator, those accounts of the conversation failed to set out sufficient facts or evidence to support a finding of reasonable cause. However, the record does establish that after the agency proposed the suspension on May 22, 1982, there was a preliminary hearing before a superior court judge on May 27, 1982, which found that there was probable cause to believe that appellant had committed the crime charged and ordered appellant held for grand jury action. Because of this judicial determination which was confirmed by appellant in her reply to the proposed suspension, we find that the preponderance of the evidence shows the existence of reasonable cause at the time that the suspension was effected despite the lack of an indictment. Therefore, we find that the agency established a proper basis for the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find that the evidence supports the presiding official's finding that the suspension promoted the efficiency of the service and was reasonable. The presiding official reviewed the evidence submitted by the agency that because of the seriousness of the conduct charged, the pending criminal action had received widespread notoriety resulting in newspaper coverage as well as in the expression of concern by her co-workers as to when she would return to the workplace. Based on that evidence, she correctly concluded that nexus was shown in that appellant's continued presence in the workplace would not only undermine morale but also affect the reputation of the agency since the fact of appellant's arrest was generally known.[1] Moreover, the seriousness of appellant's alleged conduct gives rise to a presumption of nexus which, we find, appellant has not rebutted with contrary evidence. <span class="Italic">See Merritt v. Department of Justice,</span> 6 MSPB 493, 501, 502-03, 508-09, 6 MSPR 585, 595, 597-599, 604-605. This evidence also supports a finding that the suspension action was reasonable under <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In this respect we reject appellant's contention that the testimony of her supervisor Mr. Neuwiller that he was approached by appellant's co-workers who expressed concern as to her presence in the workplace constitutes uncorroborated hearsay and is therefore insufficient to support the presiding official's finding. His testimony constitutes direct evidence of the fact that he was indeed approached by such employees on this matter....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The admission by the appellant's attorney during the reply process that the appellant was arrested for criminal acts described in the proposed indefinite suspension was insufficient to establish the necessary reasonable cause. The arrest or investigation is, in itself, not sufficient. <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 260, 263 (1984). If an arrest alone is insufficient to support the indefinite suspension, so too is the issuance of a warrant for the appellant's arrest. <span class="Italic">Froehlich v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 265, 268 (1984) (result discussed below, with a different outcome, in <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1152-58 (Fed. Cir. 1992)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_2133"></span><span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1152-58 (Fed. Cir. 1992), addressed both indefinite suspensions and shortened advance notice periods [discussed in Chapter 11, "<a href="0100-2023-18-073.html#sec11-74">Shortened Notice Period; Crime Provision</a>"]. Under <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, an arrest alone, or the issuance of an arrest warrant, is not sufficient to justify an indefinite suspension. An indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings would provide enough evidence of possible misconduct. Lacking an indictment, the agency must undertake, when an arrest warrant is a major part of the case, sufficient investigation to assure itself that the surrounding facts justify summary action by the agency. There must be more than an arrest, with or without a warrant, to support an indefinite suspension, that is, when an arrest warrant is a major part of the case, the agency must assure itself that the surrounding facts are sufficient to justify summary action by the agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case presents, seemingly for the first time in this court, the question of what constitutes reasonable cause for summary indefinite suspension of a government employee. The issue is not without difficulty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Department of Justice (DOJ) indefinitely suspended petitioner Earl V. Dunnington, III (Dunnington) without pay from his position as a Border Patrol Agent following Dunnington's arrest on charges of sexual abuse of a child. The suspension took effect 14 days after it was proposed. Dunnington objected on the grounds, among other things, that he did not receive the 30 day advance notice to which he claimed he was statutorily entitled, and that therefore he was entitled to back pay for the period of the unlawful suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This dispute was heard on three separate occasions by the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), with alternating results (first sustaining the DOJ action, then reversing the action, and finally sustaining the action). The final outcome, in the agency's favor, was that the probable cause determination of the magistrate in issuing an arrest warrant in combination with the fact of the arrest did constitute reasonable cause for the agency's action...and that a sufficient nexus existed between Dunnington's activities and the efficiency of the service.... Dunnington appeals here. We affirm.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dunnington was employed as a Border Patrol Agent with the Department of Justice, Immigration and Naturalization Service. On May 31, 1985, four criminal complaints were filed against Dunnington and four arrest warrants issued. On June 4, DOJ informed Dunnington that in light of the complaints and warrants it proposed indefinitely suspending Dunnington. On June 11, Dunnington was indicted on four counts relating to sexual relations with a child. On June 17, DOJ made the decision to indefinitely suspend Dunnington effective the following day--14 days after DOJ first proposed the suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Dunnington argues that 5 USC 7513(b)(1) (1982) requires that he receive at least 30 days advance written notice of an adverse action or that there be "reasonable cause" to believe he committed a crime for which he could be sentenced to imprisonment. Because he did not receive 30 days notice and because there was no reasonable cause, as he believes that term is used in 7513(b)(1), Dunnington argues that his suspension was improper. Dunnington ultimately resigned from the Border Patrol and now seeks back pay for the period between his allegedly improperly imposed indefinite suspension and his resignation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an agency takes an adverse action against an employee, including the suspension of an employee without pay, the action is subject generally to the provisions of 5 USC 7501-7514 (1982). The statute provides that if a suspension is to be for less than 14 days, the employee is entitled to "advance written notice stating the specific reasons for the proposed action." 5 USC 7503(b)(1). It does not specify what is meant by "advance written notice" in terms of a number of days.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, if a suspension is to be for more than 14 days (<span class="Italic">see</span> 5 USC 7512(2)), the statute specifies that</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[a]n employee against whom an action [e.g., the suspension] is proposed is entitled to <span class="Italic">at least 30 days' advance written notice</span>, unless there is <span class="Italic">reasonable cause</span> to believe the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, stating the specific reasons for the proposed action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 USC 7513(b)(1) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, when more serious adverse actions are contemplated, absent reasonable cause the employee is statutorily entitled to at least a 30 day notice period--a period that does not begin until the employee is made aware of the specific reasons for the action proposed--giving the employee this period of time to consider a response.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear from the statute if &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7511-14 were intended to apply only to definite term suspensions or if they were to encompass indefinite suspensions as well. This court, this court's predecessor, and the MSPB have, at least tacitly, applied the requirements of 7513 to indefinite suspensions.... We see no reason to stray from this course.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It follows that all of the requirements of 7513, including the 30 day notice requirement, apply to indefinite suspensions. Section 7513 contains a number of other substantive and procedural requirements, including the requirement that the imposition of an indefinite suspension promote the efficiency of the service. 5 USC 7513(a). Additionally, like all such actions, the penalty must be shown to be reasonable. <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 MSPR at 19. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. VA</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">MSPB cases addressing the question of when an agency may suspend with less than 30 days notice are at best unclear, and at worst in conflict. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. MSPB</span>, 10 MSPB 568, 12 MSPR 12 (1982), and <span class="Italic">Jones v. Gov't. Printing Office</span>, 11 MSPB 606, 13 MSPR 365 (1982) <span class="Italic">with</span> <span class="Italic">Froehlich v. Dep't of Treasury</span>, 21 MSPR 265 (1984), and <span class="Italic">Larson v. Dep't of Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 260 (1984). The two Board opinions in this case, taking opposite positions on the same facts, illustrate the problem. Our cases and that of our predecessor court do not definitively deal with the issue. We take the opportunity to clarify this matter for future guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule we announce today flows logically from <span class="Italic">Cooper v. United States</span>, 226 Ct. Cl. 75, 639 F.2d 727 (1980). In that case, the adverse action by the agency (removal) was based on a Defense Investigative Service report which summarized several instances of sexual misconduct charged against the individual by local authorities. On appeal, our predecessor court noted that the Government relied solely on the DIS report, which in turn was based on reports from other police sources. The court further noted that the Government made no attempt to go beyond the arrest records; it undertook no independent factfinding investigation. "DIS did not even begin to take the statement of a single witness...the Government's failure to conduct an adequate investigation prior to plaintiff's removal was inexcusable." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 730. The removal decision was not sustained.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Cooper</span> properly recognizes that the rights of the individual must be protected from premature or unfounded governmental actions. At the same time, we must not lose sight of the purpose of the suspension provision. A summary suspension (one taken on less than 30 days notice) is an administrative decision taken to protect the public and agency personnel.... It is available only when there has been an allegation of a serious crime, and only when the misconduct alleged bears a sufficient relationship to the employee's duties in the agency to warrant the action as promoting the efficiency of the service. An indefinite suspension under those circumstances differs from a removal in that the suspension must be terminated within a reasonable time following resolution of the criminal charges. <span class="Italic">Engdahl v. Dep't. of Navy</span>, 900 F.2d 1572, 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1990); <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 MSPR at 17.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To require in every case a full investigation by the agency prior to the agency's availing itself of the summary suspension provision might have adverse effects on both the agency and the employee. From the agency's viewpoint, it could deny the agency the benefits intended by the provision by unduly delaying action necessary to protect the public or the agency. From the individual's viewpoint, if the employee insisted on his administrative rights it could force a premature airing of the individual's defense in a pending criminal case; if he did not insist on his rights, it could be taken as a waiver thereof, or possibly even an admission of guilt....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In an appropriate case, then, the agency must be able to act on the basis of the facts presented to it, without the necessity of an independent investigation of its own. However, those facts must be sufficient to meet the statutory test of reasonable cause, and the agency must take steps to assure that this is so. The problem arises when an employee is arrested, with or without a warrant, or charged with a crime by indictment or information, with or without arrest. Here, the agency is not itself the fact-finder, but the activities of third parties--law enforcement officials, Grand Jury, District Attorney, magistrate--provide the agency with the factual record for its analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the case before us, the AJ found that the agency, at the time it proposed the suspension, had before it the four criminal complaints and four warrants of arrest. In addition, the criminal complaints were supported by statements from the complaining witnesses. This, the AJ concluded, was sufficient to provide reasonable cause. The MSPB, on the first appeal, recharacterized the factual basis for the agency action: "The agency suspended appellant indefinitely <span class="Italic">based only on his arrest</span>...." <span class="Italic">Dunnington 2</span> at 125. The MSPB concluded that this was insufficient: "The agency conducted no investigation and has shown no...[accompanying] circumstances surrounding appellant's arrest." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On rehearing, the MSPB reversed itself. It held that the arrest warrants, issued by magistrate presumably on the basis of probable cause, were equivalent to the probable cause hearing held after the fact of an arrest. The Board went on: "Stated another way, we find that the probable cause determination by the magistrate issuing an arrest warrant is an additional circumstance which together with the fact of the arrest constitutes reasonable cause."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is generally agreed that an arrest by police authorities does not, by itself, provide reasonable cause to believe that an employee has committed a crime for which imprisonment could result. Does the fact that an arrest <span id="Page_2134"></span>warrant issued prior to the arrest change the outcome? If it does, it is not the arrest that matters but the issuance of the warrant--the additional act of sending enforcement officials to locate the subject of the warrant to carry out what the warrant authorizes does not add anything to the reasonable cause determination. The fact of Dunnington's actual arrest is not relevant to the determination of reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question posed to us by the MSPB's decision in <span class="Italic">Dunnington 3</span> is, then, were the arrest warrants sufficient? In fact, there was much more before the agency than the arrest warrants. As the AJ noted, there were the criminal complaints, and the supporting statements from the complaining witnesses.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A charge of sexual abuse of a child is a serious charge. At the same time, it is, like many crimes which occur outside the public eye, more easily made than disproved. When a charge of criminal conduct arises in a context in which the credibility of key parties is necessarily in question--among other things, there was in this case an indication that the charges were initially proffered by an estranged spouse--the agency must assure itself that it has a sound basis for acting. This is particularly true if the agency depends on the knowledge and statements of other investigating agencies rather than its own....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Obviously, the best evidence of reasonable cause will be that determined by the agency after an appropriate investigation of the facts and circumstances of the alleged misconduct. But, for the reasons we have discussed, that may not always be possible, or the wisest course. In absence of its own investigation, the agency must determine whether it has enough to go on. As the cases make clear, the mere fact of an arrest by the police is not, in and of itself, sufficient to provide reasonable cause under 7513(b)(1). At the other extreme, a formal judicial determination made following a preliminary hearing, or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceedings, would provide, absent special circumstances, more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold requirement of reasonable cause to suspend.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are not prepared to conclude, however, that the issuance of an arrest warrant, presumably based on a finding of probable cause found by a magistrate, is the equivalent to more formal proceedings. The process by which arrest warrants are issued is typically <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>. They are often based on information from confidential informers, or other sources not subject to testing for credibility. Given the reality of the manner in which arrest warrants are often issued, it is incumbent upon the agency when an arrest warrant is a major part of the case to assure itself that the surrounding facts are sufficient to justify summary action by the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The facts of this case satisfy the test set forth here. In this case, when the agency had before it additional factual material culled from the complaints and supporting allegations, we cannot conclude that the MSPB's decision upholding the suspension was arbitrary or capricious or without substantial evidence in the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As previously noted, in order for the indefinite suspension to be validly imposed, a nexus must exist between the action taken in response to Dunnington's misconduct and the efficiency of the service. In <span class="Italic">Dunnington 1</span>, the Administrative Judge found that Dunnington, in his duties, was required to work alone in apprehending women and minors, that he had lost the confidence of his supervisors, and that he could not be trusted as a law enforcement officer given the nature of the pending criminal charges.... Thus, the AJ found a nexus between the offenses alleged and the efficiency of the service...and that indefinitely suspending Dunnington promoted the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This finding was sustained by the Board. Appellant has not persuaded us that this finding is incorrect. Indeed, the record leaves little doubt that this finding is fully supported; there is no basis upon which to disturb it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Before the Federal Circuit's decision, the Board considered whether an arrest was sufficient to support an indefinite suspension in <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 36 MSPR 122, 124-25 (1988) (on OPM petition for reconsideration, 45 MSPR 305 (1990)), declaring:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that an indefinite suspension, based upon reasonable cause to believe an appellant has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, is not to punish alleged misconduct but to allow examination into such misconduct. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 12, 18 (1982). The Board found that "reasonable cause" is virtually synonymous with "probable cause," and set forth the following examples which would establish reasonable cause: an indictment; an employee arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate; an investigation uncovering evidence showing reasonable cause; a criminal information; and certain egregious acts such as murder or national security offenses, which are detrimental to the agency's mission, and which are brought to the agency's attention by the media. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 18-19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the Board has held that, while an investigation or arrest standing alone is insufficient to establish reasonable cause, an investigation or arrest may be accompanied by such circumstances which would give rise to a showing of reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board found that reasonable cause was established where the agency relied on a copy of the complaint and arrest warrant which showed that the appellant was jailed without bail for attempted murder, aggravated assault, and endangering the welfare of a child; a newspaper account of the incident; and a memorandum indicating a preliminary agency investigation into the matter. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Byrd v. United States Postal Service</span>, 36 MSPR 86, 89 (1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the agency has failed to show similar circumstances which would establish reasonable cause. The agency conducted no investigation and has shown no similar circumstances surrounding appellant's arrest. The agency suspended appellant indefinitely based only on his arrest for egregious misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The case is similar to <span class="Italic">Larson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 22 MSPR 260, 263 (1984). In <span class="Italic">Larson</span>, the agency relied on the mere fact of the appellant's arrest in concluding that it had reasonable cause at the time of the appellant's suspension. Although the agency had other documents, including a criminal information issued against the appellant, it admitted that it did not rely on them in suspending the appellant. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 263. The Board rejected the agency's argument that reasonable cause may be established by the egregiousness of the conduct alone, pointing out the necessity for other evidence such as an accompanying investigation or aggravating circumstances surrounding the arrest.... The Board found the arrest alone to be insufficient to establish reasonable cause by preponderant evidence. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 263.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the agency relied on the arrest warrants and the complaints on which they were based. The criminal conduct for which appellant was arrested is similar to that for which the appellant in <span class="Italic">Larson</span> was arrested. Also, while the agency here submitted copies of the indictments upon appellant's refiling of his appeal, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the agency relied on them in effecting the suspension. Thus, this evidence will not be considered in support of the agency's attempt to show reasonable cause....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the agency failed to establish that, at the time it suspended appellant indefinitely, it had reasonable cause to believe that he had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">OPM petitioned for reconsideration in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> on the theory that an arrest warrant constitutes the probable cause required to impose an indefinite suspension because, OPM argued, "magistrates may issue arrest warrants in criminal cases only when they have been presented with sufficient evidence to give them probable cause to believe that the person charged has committed a crime." Distinguishing the "mere fact" of an employee's arrest in the <span class="Italic">Larson</span> case from an arrest based on a warrant, the Board determined that the judicial determination supporting the issuance of a warrant established the necessary probable cause to establish the "reasonable cause" required by &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1) for an indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. DOJ</span>, 45 MSPR 305, 306-09 (1990), decided, before the Board's position was clarified or modified by the Federal Circuit:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Director of OPM has filed a petition for reconsideration pursuant to 5 USC &#x00A7; 7703(d) contending that the Board's decision has misinterpreted the "reasonable cause" standard in section 7513(b)(1). OPM urges that, in cases where an indefinite suspension is warranted, the decision will inappropriately prevent managers from suspending an employee as soon as they have reason to believe he or she has committed a crime inimical to the agency's successful accomplishment of its mission. The Director's argument is based on the fact that magistrates may issue arrest warrants in criminal cases only when they have been presented with sufficient evidence to give them probable cause to believe that the person charged has committed a crime. <span class="Italic">See Gerstein v. Pugh,</span> 420 U.S. 103, 111-12, 95 S. Ct. 854, 861-62, 43 L. Ed.2d 54 (1975). The Director contends that where, as here, the agency has copies of the warrant for the employee's arrest and the criminal complaint supporting it, the probable cause finding underlying the warrant provides the agency with reasonable cause to believe the employee has committed a crime. In <span class="Italic">Martin</span> we found that "reasonable cause" as used in section 7513(b)(1) is "virtually synonymous with the 'probable cause' which is necessary to support a grand jury indictment," and we concluded that an indictment standing alone provides a sufficient basis for an indefinite suspension. 12 MSPR at 18-19. However, as to an arrest or investigation, we determined that additional circumstances supporting a reasonable cause to believe are required to meet the statutory standard. The Board's determination reflected the guidance of the former FPM Supp. 752-1, S5-3b:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An agency cannot invoke the "crime" provision solely on evidence that the employee was arrested. However, if the agency has evidence that the employee was arrested and held for further legal action by a magistrate or was indicted by a grand jury, then the agency would have reasonable cause for believing the employee guilty of the crime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 12 MSPR at 19 n.3. The additional circumstance supporting reasonable <span id="Page_2135"></span>cause which is provided when a magistrate holds the arrestee for further legal action is the probable cause finding underlying the magistrate's action. <span class="Italic">See</span> Wright, <span class="Italic">Federal Practice and Procedure, Criminal 2d</span>, &#x00A7; 85 at 172 (1985) (the purpose of the preliminary hearing is to decide whether the showing of probable cause is sufficient to hold the accused person, in custody or on bail, for further action); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Government Printing Office</span>, 11 MSPB 606, 13 MSPR 365, 368 (1982) (the insufficiency of the arrest to support the proposed indefinite suspension was cured before the suspension was effected by a judicial finding of probable cause at the preliminary hearing).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court has interpreted the Fourth Amendment to require that the existence of probable cause be decided by a neutral and detached magistrate whenever possible. <span class="Italic">Gerstein v. Pugh,</span> 420 U.S. at 111, 95 S. Ct. at 863. Although this requirement has not been extended to arrests, in <span class="Italic">Gerstein</span> the Court required a judicial determination of probable cause before any significant pretrial restraint of liberty. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 114, 95 S. Ct. at 863. At the same time, the Court recognized that the standard for arrest and the standard for detaining the arrested person pending further proceedings are the same--whether there is probable cause to believe the suspect has committed a crime. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 120, 95 S. Ct. at 866. Thus, the Court held that the judicial determination of probable cause which is a condition for pretrial custody or restraints is one which can be made either <span class="Italic">before</span> or promptly <span class="Italic">after</span> arrest. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 125, 95 S. Ct. at 868-69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, with respect to the issue here, where a probable cause determination by a neutral magistrate is dispositive, we see no basis for making a distinction between pre-arrest and post-arrest judicial determinations. Accordingly, we agree with the Director that the rule as to the insufficiency of an arrest standing alone to establish reasonable cause does not apply to an arrest pursuant to a warrant. Stated another way, we find that the probable cause determination by the magistrate issuing an arrest warrant is an additional circumstance which together with the fact of the arrest constitutes reasonable cause. As the Court of Claims observed in rejecting an employee's claim that the agency deciding official lacked sufficient evidence to support his decision to remove the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It would be somewhat absurd to say there was enough probable cause for a judicial officer to issue a warrant for Peden's arrest, as occurred here, but not enough for preparation of adverse action charges.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The criminal complaints and warrants for appellant's arrest relied on by the agency distinguish his case from <span class="Italic">Larson v. Department</span> <span class="Italic">of the Navy,</span> 22 MSPR 260 (1984), where the agency relied on the mere fact of the employee's arrest.[6] In light of the evidence that a municipal judge found probable cause to arrest appellant for a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed, the agency had reasonable cause to suspend appellant indefinitely pending disposition of the criminal charges.[7] Accordingly, the agency's action is SUSTAINED.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Previous cases have relied on the arrest warrant, the criminal complaint, and additional circumstances to find reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See Cox v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;We find no merit in appellant's claim that he was disparately treated because other employees were indefinitely suspended following indictment rather than following arrest. There is no evidence that the employees in the cases appellant relied on were arrested prior to indictment or that, if they were, the agency was aware of the arrests.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Under the Federal Circuit's approach in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, an indictment is sufficient, assuming nexus, to support an indefinite suspension. The agency need not conduct a separate investigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Smith v. GPO</span>, 60 MSPR 450, 454 (1994); <span class="Italic">Novak v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 455, 457 (1982) (indefinite suspension for assault cannot be imposed solely on the basis of a refusal to answer questions; however, "appellant's invocation of the Fifth Amendment in response to his proposed indefinite suspension...weighs in favor of proceeding with the action in light of appellant's arrest and criminal information").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to an indefinite suspension based on arrest, the Federal Circuit confirmed the <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> "arrest plus" analysis for an indefinite suspension in <span class="Italic">Pararas-Carayannis v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...The agency's reliance on the criminal charge, the detailed information in the affidavit, and the subsequent indictment was sufficient to support a conclusion that a reasonable cause existed to believe that petitioner committed a crime for which he was subject to imprisonment.

The agency had ample evidence of alleged misconduct, based on the Government's extensive investigation, on which to base its decision to suspend....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">See Brown v.

Under these circumstances, we find that the agency's consideration of the appellant's arrest and arraignment, in conjunction with the results of its own investigation, is sufficient to establish reasonable cause. <span class="italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156-58 (finding the reasonable cause standard met when, in addition to four arrest warrants, the agency considered factual material culled from four criminal complaints and statements from complaining witnesses supporting the criminal complaints).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board took <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> to heart and applied it to require agencies to come forward with more than an arrest record or the fact of incarceration to establish a proper basis for an indefinite suspension and invocation of the crime exception to the statutory advance notice requirements. <span class="Italic">Reid v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 648, 652-54 (1992), reversed an indefinite suspension on the strength of <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Dunnington v. Dept. of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1992), the court stated that, given the fact that the process under which arrest warrants are issued is frequently <span class="Italic">ex parte</span>, mere evidence of an employee's arrest is not, in itself, sufficient to constitute reasonable cause under 5 USC 7513(b)(1). The court stated, therefore, that "it is incumbent upon the agency when an arrest warrant is a major part of the case to assure itself that the surrounding facts are sufficient to justify summary action by the agency." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court concluded in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> that the agency met its burden of establishing reasonable cause that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed because, in addition to arrest warrants, the agency had before it the criminal complaints and the supporting statements from the complaining witnesses. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 1157-58.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, we find that the agency has failed to demonstrate that, at the time it took the indefinite suspension action against the appellant, it had before it facts sufficient to justify its action. Because the administrative judge struck the agency's file from the record as a sanction, the only evidence of record consists of the appellant's submissions, the agency's submissions other than its file, and the testimonial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With his petition for appeal, the appellant submitted, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, copies of the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, the final decision of indefinite suspension, and the agency's investigative memorandum. The notice of proposed indefinite suspension merely set forth the two criminal charges. The final decision relied on the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, noted the appellant's denial in his oral reply to that notice, and stated that the appellant's "arrest and the possibility of a trial or an investigation of [his] alleged misconduct [was] justification for indefinitely suspending [him]." It further noted that the appellant was "in jail from June 23 to July 3, 1991, and advised [his] office that the charges involved sexual assault and public lewdness." The copy of the agency's investigative report noted the criminal charges against the appellant. It stated that "[i]nquiry with the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office on July 8, 1991, disclosed that [the appellant] was remanded to the Hudson County Correctional Facility on June 23, 1991," and, "[o]n June 24, 1991, he appeared before the Honorable Judge Callahan, who set bail at $10,000." It further stated that it was "disclosed that [the appellant] was released from Hudson County Correction Facility on July 3, 1991."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's prehearing submissions merely repeat the above facts. Its additional submissions, responses, and exhibits provide no additional information on the circumstances surrounding the appellant's arrest and incarceration.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the hearing, the agency presented three witnesses: The proposing official, Samuel D. Morrison; the deciding official, Sean M. Lacey; and the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Morrison testified that he based his decision to propose the appellant's indefinite suspension on his discussions with the appellant, in which he testified the appellant admitted that he was incarcerated for "sexual harassment" and "public lewdness," and on "discussion and documents from the inspection service that [the appellant] was arrested and incarcerated." He testified that the appellant did not admit to the criminal charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Lacey testified that he based his decision to indefinitely suspend the appellant on his discussions with Morrison and on "letters" that Morrison wrote. He further testified that he considered the following factors: (1) The seriousness of the charges and allegations; (2) the appellant's management position with the agency; (3) the public trust; (4) customer confidence; (5) the appellant's relationship with his coworkers; (6) the appellant's arraignment; (7) the fact that bail had been set; and (8) the fact that the appellant was scheduled to undergo psychological evaluation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant testified that he had been arrested and incarcerated. He further testified, contrary to the agency's investigative memorandum, <span id="Page_2136"></span>that he appeared before "Judge Leko," and not Judge Callahan, and that his bail was set at only $2,000. He further testified that he had received the psychological evaluation. He did not admit to the criminal charges or to any improper conduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the agency produced no evidence below to establish that the appellant's incarceration, bail, and psychological evaluation were based on the outcome of a formal proceeding, such as a preliminary hearing, or any evidence other than his arrest. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157. Thus, the record indicates that the arrest was the essence of the agency's case. Consequently, the agency was required to satisfy itself that the surrounding facts were sufficient to justify the indefinite suspension action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 1157.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency did not present its investigator as a witness, and there is no indication in the record that either the investigator or the agency conducted an investigation into the facts surrounding the appellant's arrest. Furthermore, the proposing official's discussions with the appellant, during which the appellant simply admitted that he was arrested and incarcerated on the criminal charges, do not satisfy the <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> requirement for an independent agency inquiry that would justify the indefinite suspension action. Unlike in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, the agency failed below to even present a copy of the criminal complaints or statements of the complaining witnesses as exhibits in support of its action. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156-58. Therefore, we find that the agency failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157-58.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Dunnington,</span> <span class="Italic">Ellis v. VA</span>, 60 MSPR 681, 683-85 (1994), set aside an indefinite suspension based only on an arrest and subsequent newspaper publicity:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[U]nder <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, the touchstone of a finding of "reasonable cause" must be whether the agency had sufficient facts to provide a sound basis for its action.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the newspaper story about the killing was brief and provided few details of the incident. It merely reported that there was a shooting at the Turning Point Lounge on July 26, that Harold Conner was killed, and that the appellant was arrested and charged with murder. It also reported that the appellant worked at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, that he was free on bond, that he refused to talk to the police on the advice of counsel, and that other patrons of the bar stated that there was a fight involving Conner prior to the shooting. Thus, even when coupled with the appellant's arrest and the egregious and detrimental nature of the alleged conduct, the newspaper story did not establish a sound basis for believing that the appellant committed a crime for which he could be imprisoned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Other than the newspaper story, the only evidence to support the agency's position was the appellant's purported confession to an agency supervisor that he killed someone. The appellant's second-line supervisor, Anita Grace, testified that the appellant's immediate supervisor, Lun Jemison, told her that there had been a fight at a bar owned by the appellant and that, after the appellant broke up the fight, one of the participants in the fight "came back toward" the appellant and the appellant shot him. Grace testified further, however, that she presumed that Jemison got the information from the appellant; she did not claim knowledge of any "confession." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Grace further testified that, at a July 29, 1991 meeting, the appellant told her that "when someone is threatened, you have to protect them," <span class="Italic">id</span>., thus perhaps implying that the shooting was in self-defense or in defense of another.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that it is unclear from Grace's testimony whether the appellant confessed to Jemison that he committed murder or simply stated that he acted in self-defense. Grace's testimony regarding the appellant's statement to Jemison (quoted at the end of the preceding paragraph) raises questions as to whether the appellant might have acted in self-defense. The testimony does not establish a predicate for self-defense because there is no detail as to whether the decedent was armed or was otherwise a threat to the appellant, but, when coupled with the appellant's July 29 statement to Grace, it creates sufficient uncertainty to require the agency to make further inquiry to assure itself that "reasonable cause" exists. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> at 1157. The Federal Circuit stated in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> that an agency can rely on the factual record developed through the investigative activities of law enforcement officials to establish "reasonable cause." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. There is no indication here, however, that the agency attempted to obtain a copy of the police report of the incident, a copy of the criminal complaint, statements from witnesses, or other similar information.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The only additional inquiry conducted by the agency was to hold at least two meetings with the appellant, his representative, and various agency officials. These meetings took place prior to the decision to suspend the appellant. The deciding official, Jimmie Clay, testified that, despite the meetings, the agency "did not receive any information from [the appellant] as to his version of the incident." The appellant, on the other hand, testified that both he and his representative stated during the meetings that the shooting was in self-defense. Thus, according to the testimony of Clay and the appellant, it appears that, prior to suspending the appellant, the agency knew only of the killing, the subsequent arrest, and the appellant's claim of self-defense. The agency had no additional details to support a finding of "reasonable cause," and appears not to have inquired into the appellant's self-defense claim. Although the appellant had the opportunity to provide the agency with details of his self-defense claim, his apparent failure to do so does not establish a basis for the agency's finding of "reasonable cause." Under <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, the agency must have sufficient facts to provide a sound basis for its action, and in this case it did not possess such facts at the time that it imposed the indefinite suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the agency failed to prove that it had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime for which a term of imprisonment could be imposed, and thus we cannot sustain it.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board extended and further explained <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> in <span class="Italic">Barresi v. USPS</span>, 65 MSPR 656, 661-64, 666-67 (1994), concluding that an agency must "take some affirmative action on its own to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed" to support an indefinite suspension; newspaper publicity and an arrest, even when authorized by a magistrate, will not supply the "reasonable cause." Under <span class="Italic">Barresi,</span> it is the evidence available to the proposing and deciding officials at the time the suspension is imposed that determines whether "reasonable cause" exists to impose the suspension. The indefinite suspension may not be bolstered by evidence that the agency obtains after the suspension is imposed:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he proposing official testified that he based his reasonable cause determination on the fact that the appellants were arrested and arraigned. When asked if he might have based his determination on the investigation conducted by Postal Inspectors, he gave a negative response, stating that the arrests and arraignments were sufficient. He further testified that he had no understanding of what constituted a probable cause finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, consistent with <span class="Italic">Dunnington II</span> [956 F.2d 1151], that the deciding official's reliance on the appellants' arrests and arraignments was insufficient to establish reasonable cause for invoking the "crime provision." With regard to the deciding official's reliance on the Postal Inspectors' investigative report, he testified that he did not receive the report until after he had sustained the indefinite suspensions. The deciding official testified further that the notoriety of the appellants' acts publicized through the local media was a factor he considered in sustaining the suspensions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As noted above, the agency contends that the deciding official's knowledge of newspaper articles and televised news reports covering the charged criminal misconduct and arrests was part of the totality of the circumstances he considered that support the propriety of its action. Although the news stories in this case did purport to quote local law enforcement officials and court pleadings, there is no evidence that the accuracy of these reports was verified by the agency. It would not place an undue burden upon agency officials to require them to do more than read a newspaper before deciding to indefinitely suspend an employee. Accordingly, we find that in making a reasonable cause determination, an agency cannot rely on media reports alone, without some form of independent verification.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Martin</span>, 12 MSPR at 19, the Board suggested in <span class="Italic">dicta</span> that in some cases reports in the news media would suffice to establish reasonable cause. To the extent that <span class="Italic">Martin</span> suggests that a reasonable cause determination may be based solely on news media reports, we hereby modify that decision consistent with our holding in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, for the following reason, we find that the investigative report also does not provide the requisite reasonable cause. The proposing official and the deciding official are the agency's representatives in effecting adverse personnel actions. Thus, the Board will focus on the record that these officials have before them when the action is proposed and before it is effected. This will ensure that an employee receives his due process rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(b)(1), (c)(1) (an agency must inform the employee of the right to review "the material relied on to support the reasons" for its proposal and may not use material that cannot be disclosed to him); 5 CFR &#x00A7; 752.404(d)(1) (this right extends to an employee believed to have committed a crime).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency both informs the employee in the notice of proposed action of the charges against him and allows him the opportunity to respond to the evidence upon which it will base its final decision, the critical factor in determining whether there is "reasonable cause" is the record that the acting official has before him or her at that time. Because the investigative report in this case was not before the deciding official <span id="Page_2137"></span>when he made his final decision, it simply could not have been the basis for invoking the "crime provision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the agency's representatives in effecting the indefinite suspension in this case were unaware of the contents of the investigative report and the investigative report was not given to the appellants as a reason for the agency's possession of "reasonable cause to believe," the agency cannot use the investigative report to establish its charge in hindsight. To do so would be violative of the due process principles requiring the agency to provide an explanation of its evidence, and a fair opportunity to respond. As we have explained, <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review in "crime provision" cases is necessarily and uniquely directed to the <span class="Italic">agency's</span> possession of reasonable belief at the time of the action as opposed to the <span class="Italic">actions of the appellant</span> in other cases. Therefore, the principles of due process and <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review must be harmoniously practiced in these unique cases and one principle may not vitiate the other.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the deciding official relied on the arrests and arraignments of the appellants without investigating the underlying facts behind the arrests and arraignments. He relied on the fact that the agency was conducting an ongoing investigation, but had not read the investigative report before making his final decision. He further relied on news media reports without independent verification of their accuracy. <span class="Italic">Dunnington II</span> requires that the agency take some affirmative action on its own to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed. Because the agency did not take such an affirmative action before it effected the indefinite suspensions, the actions cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Vanderplas v. Dept. of Interior</span>, DE-0752-14-0212-I-1 (NP 12/16/2014), set aside an indefinite suspension for lack of sufficient investigative activity by the agency following the appellant's arrest:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Reasonable cause" in the context of an indefinite suspension based on criminal misconduct is virtually synonymous with "probable cause," which is necessary to support a grand jury indictment, i.e., probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has probably committed it. <span class="Italic">Hernandez</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 14, &#x00B6; 7. The mere initiation of a felony criminal proceeding and issuance of an arrest warrant based on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> finding of probable cause by a magistrate, without more, is insufficient to constitute reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington v. Department of Justice</span>, 956 F.2d 1151, 1153, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 12, 14-15 (1993), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 17 F.3d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table). On the other hand, a formal judicial determination of probable cause following a preliminary hearing or an indictment following an investigation and grand jury proceeding is more than sufficient to establish reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157. Where judicial proceedings alone are insufficient to establish reasonable cause, it is incumbent upon the agency to undertake some affirmative action to "to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed." <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to the proposal notice, the agency based its reasonable cause finding on the "seriousness" of the "formally charged" crimes set forth above. Although what the agency meant by "formally charged" is unclear, the incomplete Utah District Court docket report provided by the agency reveals that on September 13, 2013, an information was filed in district court, a summons was issued, and an initial appearance was scheduled for October 10, 2013. At the initial appearance, the district court judge ordered the state to provide an amended information and scheduled a proceeding identified by the docket report as a "waive prelim hearing" for November 7, 2013. There was no evidence of any further judicial proceeding presented before the administrative judge. At issue then is whether these steps in the criminal proceeding were sufficient to establish reasonable cause and, if not, whether the agency undertook some affirmative action to satisfy itself that it had reasonable cause to take the indefinite suspension action. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157; <span class="Italic">see also Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 666.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Utah, all criminal prosecutions are commenced by the filing of an information or the return of an indictment. Utah R. Crim. P. 5(a). Unlike an indictment, a criminal information may be filed without any prior investigation or probable cause determination by a neutral decision maker but requires only authorization by the prosecuting attorney. <span class="Italic">See</span> Utah Code Ann. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 77-2-1, 77-2.1.1; Utah R. Crim. P. 5. Thus, under the circumstances here, the filing of an information, without more, is insufficient to establish reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition to the filing of the information, there was evidence before the administrative judge that the district court judge issued a summons for the appellant's appearance. In Utah, the magistrate may issue either a warrant for the arrest or a summons for the appearance of the accused if it appears from the information that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that the accused has committed it. Utah R. Crim. P. 6(a). It is well-settled, however, that the issuance of an arrest warrant based on an <span class="Italic">ex parte</span> finding of probable cause by a magistrate, without more, is insufficient to establish reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157. Likewise, we find that the issuance of a summons in lieu of an arrest warrant is insufficient to establish reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See id.; see also</span> Utah R. Crim. P. 6(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserted below that it proposed to indefinitely suspend the appellant on November 20, 2013, because the district court judge upheld the felony charges after a preliminary hearing on November 7, 2013. The agency also asserted that it sustained the indefinite suspension on January 17, 2014, based on the district court judge's decision to hold the case over for a hearing on January 16, 2014. Although a formal judicial finding of probable cause following a preliminary hearing would be sufficient on its own to establish reasonable cause, <span class="Italic">see Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1157, neither the proposal notice nor the decision letter made any reference to any finding by the district court judge. It is well-established that the agency is constrained to those bases enunciated in the proposal notice, and the Board will not consider the agency's <span class="Italic">post hoc</span> rationale for its actions on appeal. <span class="Italic">See Jones</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 607, &#x00B6; 7. Further, there was no evidence before the administrative judge to show that the district court judge took these actions on November 7, 2013, or January 16, 2013. The last entry in the partial docket report provided by the agency is from October 10, 2013, when the appellant made an initial appearance and the district court judge scheduled a proceeding identified as a "waive prelim hearing" on November 7, 2013. As such, the agency's contentions on appeal regarding proceedings and findings in the criminal case are unsupported and fail to establish reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the criminal proceeding alone did not establish reasonable cause, it was incumbent upon the agency to undertake some affirmative action to determine if there was reasonable cause to impose the indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">See Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 666. However, there is no evidence in the record that the agency did so. Accordingly, the agency failed to present sufficient evidence to establish reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">See Phillips</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 12, 15; <span class="Italic">see also Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 666-67 (rejecting the agency's attempt to justify indefinite suspensions based on employees' arrests and arraignments "without investigating the underlying facts behind" those actions).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the agency did not have reasonable cause to indefinitely suspend the appellant and the action cannot be sustained.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Honeycutt v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 22 MSPR 491, 494 (1984), involving an off-duty shooting, sustained an indefinite suspension on an "arrest plus" approach:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official correctly noted that the arrest standing alone was inadequate to establish the reasonable cause to believe appellant committed a crime punishable by imprisonment necessary to sustain his indefinite suspension. <span class="Italic">Martin v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 10 MSPB 568 at 573 (1982). An arrest or investigation may, however, be accompanied by such circumstances as would give rise to reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Contrary to the presiding official's conclusion, we find such additional circumstances were known to the agency when it suspended appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the agency had not reviewed the Uniform Offense Report, when it indefinitely suspended appellant, it had reviewed the Kentucky State Police Arrest Report. This report, besides revealing appellant's arrest for first degree assault and public drunkenness at a local bar, contained information that the victim had been shot in both the neck and hand. The agency had reviewed appellant's arrest warrant which was signed by a state judge, and the bail bond form which indicated that appellant had remained in jail for two days prior to being released on $5,000 bond. Further, while appellant set forth an unelaborated claim that he acted in self defense, he also told his supervisor that he was too drunk to remember what happened on the night of the shooting. The Board finds that the totality of these factors, establish the requisite reasonable cause....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Phillips v. VA</span>, 58 MSPR 12, 15 (1993), sustained an indefinite suspension based upon an arrest plus the appellant's statements in his oral response to the suspension proposal. In his response, the Board held, "the appellant did not deny the underlying facts of the criminal charges but implicitly acknowledged their existence." From this the Board concluded that "examining all of the circumstances in this case, the agency has proven that there was more than enough evidence of possible misconduct to meet the threshold reasonable cause requirement." <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> determined to be insufficient, as a basis for the indefinite suspension, the filing of a criminal complaint that constituted the first step in a criminal proceeding and that preceded a mandatory preliminary hearing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Brantley v.

On review, the appellant does not challenge the administrative judge's finding that the agency had reasonable cause to believe that he committed a crime <span id="Page_2138"></span>punishable by imprisonment when the agency proposed his July 14, 2014 indefinite suspension, and we discern no reason to disturb the administrative judge's findings on this issue.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An indefinite suspension was sustained based on arrest, arraignment, and formal charges of six misdemeanor counts supporting a penalty of at least six months' imprisonment, <span class="Italic">Hernandez v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">To sustain an indefinite suspension, the agency must show: (1) It imposed the suspension for an authorized reason; (2) the suspension has an ascertainable end, i.e., a determinable condition subsequent that will bring the suspension to a conclusion; (3) the suspension bears a nexus to the efficiency of the service; and (4) the penalty is reasonable. <span class="Italic">Sanchez v. Department of Energy</span>, 117 M.S.P.R. 155, &#x00B6; 9 (2011) (internal citations omitted). One of the authorized circumstances for imposing an indefinite suspension is when the agency has reasonable cause to believe an employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed--pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding or any subsequent agency action following the conclusion of the criminal process. <span class="Italic">Gonzalez v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 318, &#x00B6; 13 (2010). At issue in the present appeal is whether the agency had such reasonable cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has held that "reasonable cause" in the context of an indefinite suspension based on possible criminal misconduct is virtually synonymous with "probable cause," which is necessary to support a grand jury indictment, i.e., probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed and that the accused has probably committed it. <span class="Italic">Martin v.

The court further stated that "[f]rom the individual's viewpoint, if the employee insisted on his administrative rights it could force a premature airing of the individual's defense in a pending criminal case; if he did not insist on his rights, it could be taken as a waiver thereof, or possibly even an admission of guilt." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the court found that in an appropriate case, the agency must be able to act on the basis of the facts presented to it. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court cautioned, however, that "those facts must be sufficient to meet the statutory test of reasonable cause, and the agency must take steps to assure that this is so." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The court found that <span class="Italic">Dunnington's</span> indefinite suspension was proper because, in addition to four arrest warrants, the agency had before it factual material culled from four criminal complaints and statements from complaining witnesses supporting the criminal complaints. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1156-58.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Relying on Dunnington</span>, the Board further addressed the issue of reasonable cause in <span class="Italic">Barresi v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. 656, 662-663 (1994). There, the appellants were arrested pursuant to warrants and arraigned on charges of intent to distribute controlled substances. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 660. The administrative judge issued an initial decision in which she sustained the indefinite suspensions, finding that the appellants' arrests pursuant to magistrate-issued arrest warrants based on a finding of probable cause were sufficient to sustain the suspensions. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 661. The Board reversed the initial decision, finding that the deciding official's reliance on the appellants' arrests and arraignments in deciding to suspend the appellants indefinitely was insufficient to establish reasonable cause under the crime provision of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1). <span class="Italic">Barresi</span>, 65 M.S.P.R. at 662-663. The Board stated that <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> required the agency to "take some affirmative action on its own to satisfy itself that there was reasonable cause to believe that a crime was committed for which imprisonment could be imposed." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 666. The Board found that, because the agency did not take such an affirmative action before it effected the indefinite suspensions, those actions could not be sustained. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 666-67.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The Agency Had Reasonable Cause to Believe That the Appellant Had Committed a Crime for Which a Sentence of Imprisonment May Be Imposed</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this appeal, the administrative judge found that, at the time it imposed the indefinite suspension, the agency had reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed based on the following evidence: the appellant had been arrested, arraigned, and formally charged with six misdemeanor counts, each of which could have resulted in a penalty of at least six months' imprisonment; and the appellant had been released on $10,000 bail and ordered to appear for a later-scheduled jury trial. The appellant challenges this finding on review, arguing that the foregoing evidence was not sufficient to establish reasonable cause to believe that he committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. More specifically, the appellant contends that the agency failed to satisfy the reasonable cause requirement because there was no evidentiary hearing finding probable cause on the merits of the charge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree. As noted above, in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, the court found that a formal determination of reasonable cause made following a preliminary hearing usually provides "more than enough evidence" of possible misconduct to satisfy the reasonable cause requirement. 956 F.2d at 1157. The court did not find, however, that a formal judicial determination of reasonable cause made following a preliminary hearing is required to satisfy the reasonable cause requirement. In this case, at the time that the agency imposed the indefinite suspension, the California criminal prosecution was fully underway and the criminal justice process had moved beyond what would be addressed in a preliminary hearing. Therefore, the absence of a preliminary hearing is irrelevant to consideration of this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues on review, as he did below, that the reasonable cause requirement was not met here because the Board held in <span class="Italic">Phillips v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. 12, 14 (1983), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 17 F.3d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table), that a criminal complaint is insufficient to establish reasonable cause. In <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, the administrative judge sustained the appellant's indefinite suspension based on the filing of a criminal complaint charging him with a felony under Missouri law. <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, 58 M.S.P.R. at 14. The Board explained that, under Missouri law, the filing of a criminal complaint is only the first step in the information proceeding and that all persons are entitled to a preliminary hearing prior to the filing of any information setting forth felony charges.[4] <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 15. The Board found that because the appellant's preliminary hearing was still pending at the time of his indefinite suspension, the filing of a criminal complaint was not a proper basis for the agency to find reasonable cause. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Similarly, under California law, a felony complaint is a preliminary accusation that brings the appellant before a magistrate for a preliminary hearing during which a magistrate determines whether there is probable cause prior to scheduling a trial. Cal. Penal Code &#x00A7; 866(b); <span class="Italic">Serna v. Superior Court</span>, 707 P.2d 793, 804 (Cal. 1985). If it appears that there is sufficient cause to believe that the defendant is guilty, the magistrate then issues an order that the defendant be held to answer the complaint. Cal. Penal Code &#x00A7; 872(a).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge properly rejected the appellant's argument that his indefinite suspension must be reversed pursuant to <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>. As the administrative judge explained, this case is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> because the appellant in the instant matter was facing criminal misdemeanor charges, and not felony charges, as was the appellant in <span class="Italic">Phillips. Id.</span> at 6. Misdemeanors in California are prosecuted by the filing of a complaint. <span class="Italic">See</span> Cal. Penal Code &#x00A7; 740. Under California law, while a felony complaint is a preliminary accusation that does not confer trial jurisdiction, a misdemeanor complaint is a formal charge, an accusatory pleading giving the court jurisdiction to proceed to trial. <span class="Italic">Serna</span>, 707 P.2d at 804-05. In fact, in misdemeanor prosecutions, the complaint is the only formal accusatory pleading filed with the court. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 802. Thus, under California law, a misdemeanor complaint is comparable to an indictment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 991 of the California Penal Code governs the determination of probable cause in misdemeanor cases. Under section 991(a), if a misdemeanor defendant is in custody at the time of his or her arraignment and pleads not guilty, the magistrate, on motion of counsel for the defendant or the defendant, "shall determine whether there is probable cause to believe that a public offense has been committed and that the defendant is guilty thereof." The code does not provide for a probable cause determination when, as here, the defendant is not in custody at the time of arraignment. Thus, unlike <span class="Italic">Phillips</span>, in this case there was not a preliminary hearing pending at the time of the appellant's indefinite suspension. Therefore, the basis of the Board's determination in <span class="Italic">Phillips</span> that the administrative judge erred in finding that a criminal complaint is a proper basis for the agency to find reasonable cause, i.e., that a preliminary hearing in a felony matter was pending at the time of the appellant's indefinite suspension, is absent here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency issued the proposed indefinite suspension based on the court documents it obtained from the San Diego County Superior Court and that it did not conduct an independent investigation into the criminal charges against the appellant. As previously noted, however, in <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span> the court found that in an appropriate case, the agency must be able to act on the basis of the facts presented to it, <span id="Page_2139"></span>as an investigation may not always be possible, or the wisest course. <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, 956 F.2d at 1156-57. This is such a case. At the time that the agency imposed the indefinite suspension, the California criminal matter was heading to trial. Consequently, the agency was in no position to conduct its own investigation. Indeed, as the appellant acknowledged in his written reply to the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, if the agency had attempted to conduct its own investigation, it would likely have been interfering with an ongoing criminal prosecution.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under <span class="Italic">Dunnington</span>, the touchstone of a finding of "reasonable cause" is whether the agency had sufficient facts to provide a sound basis for its action. <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 681, 683 (1994). Because the agency indefinitely suspended the appellant based solely on information in the court documents referenced in the notice of proposed indefinite suspension, we must determine whether that information provided the agency with reasonable cause to believe that the appellant had committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment could be imposed. Here, the facts presented to the agency at the time it imposed the appellant's indefinite suspension showed that the District Attorney of San Diego had assessed the evidence and filed a complaint alleging that the appellant committed criminal acts involving two named individuals on a specific date and the case against the appellant had proceeded to the point where the appellant had been ordered to appear for a jury trial. We find that these facts provided the agency with reasonable cause to believe that the appellant committed a crime for which a term of imprisonment could be imposed. Therefore, we sustain the indefinite suspension.</p>
