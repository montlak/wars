<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-170"><span class="space">e.</span> Consensual Conduct Affecting Workplace</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Consensual conduct, an affair between a manager and a second-level subordinate, may prove a basis for severe disciplinary action if the relationship has untoward effects in the workplace, e.g., disruption of the relationship between the subordinate and the intermediate supervisor. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dolezal v. Dept. of Army</span>, 58 MSPR 64, 69 (1993) ("These acts severely undermined the agency's direct chain of command."); <span class="Italic">McLeod v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 451, 454 &#x0026; n.1 (1982) (supervisor was demoted and transferred based on drinking and physical intimacy with a married female subordinate in cocktail lounges and in the office after work "and the resulting aftermath").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Attempts to establish dating relationships, although consensual to begin with, may become sexual harassment if they continue past the point of the refusal by the other employee, <span class="Italic">Biddle v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 63 MSPR 521, 527-29 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not dispute the events leading up to the charge of sexual harassment. Rather, he argues that they were not sexual harassment but only attempts to clarify the status of their friendship and perhaps improve it. He contends that at first his attentions to Eguiguren were welcome and that, after she informed him that they were unwelcome, he did not engage in a pattern of behavior but rather only the one isolated incident, the May 9 visit. The appellant's argument that his attentions were at first welcome does not excuse his behavior once he learned, in October 1991, that Eguiguren no longer wanted his friendship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant asserts that the May 9 incident was the only instance of allegedly offensive behavior after Eguiguren informed him that his attentions were unwelcome, the appellant admitted in testimony that he walked down Eguiguren's street approximately 10 times in the hopes of seeing her between February and May 1992. Statements from neighbors indicate that he was a frequent visitor to the street, that he was seen in the alley next to the appellant's apartment and in the stairwell, and that he aroused their suspicions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also argues that the administrative judge erred in finding that his allegedly harassing behavior was sexual in nature. The administrative judge carefully and exhaustively analyzed this element of the sexual harassment charge. The administrative judge recognized that the appellant's conduct did not involve any sexually explicit language, touching, or overt attempts to start an intimate relationship. Sex-based harassment, however, need not involve sexual activity or language, to give rise to Title VII liability if it is sufficiently pervasive and directed at employees because of their sex. <span class="Italic">See Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1583, citing 8 F.E.P. Manual at 405:6692 (quoting <span class="Italic">Hicks v. Gates Rubber</span> Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1416 (10th Cir. 1987)). The administrative judge relied on the tone of the letter from the appellant to Eguiguren to establish that the appellant's conduct had a sexual connotation. From the letter and the appellant's testimony at the hearing, the administrative judge inferred an attempt to establish a romantic relationship. Furthermore, the administrative judge found that the appellant's behavior in watching Eguiguren's apartment could only indicate an obsession "far beyond the feelings that any mere platonic friendship could engender." Although in <span class="Italic">Van Amber</span>, 47 MSPR at 325, the Board found that an isolated late night visit to the home of an employee had no sexual connotation when there was no other indication that the appellant sought to establish an intimate relationship with the alleged victim, the behavior in this appeal goes beyond that of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Van Amber</span>. We see no reason to disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that this behavior was sexual in nature because the appellant sought to establish a romantic relationship, the conduct was based on Eguiguren's sex, and it occurred with sufficient frequency to become pervasive. <span class="Italic">See Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1583.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also presented evidence in the form of testimony by Eguiguren and her roommate Elizabeth Cahill that Eguiguren was adversely affected by the behavior. She became frightened and nervous to the point that she moved from her apartment. She had difficulty sleeping, had physical symptoms of stress, and could not concentrate on her job. <span class="Italic">See Carosella v. US Postal Service</span>, 30 MSPR 199, 201-02 (1986), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 816 F.2d 638 (Fed. Cir. 1987). Eguiguren also testified that she was concerned about the appellant's discussing their relationship with others at work, including Claudia Parker who evaluated Eguiguren during the relevant time period. Considering all of this evidence, the administrative judge found that the appellant's behavior created an abusive working environment. The appellant argues on petition for review that none of the alleged harassing behavior occurred at work and was not so egregious as to create a hostile environment by altering the terms of employment. We disagree and find that the administrative judge correctly analyzed this issue. The fact that the appellant and Eguiguren worked in close proximity, when added to the anxiety his behavior caused her, changed the terms of her employment. <span class="Italic">See Harris</span>, _ U.S. at _, 114 S. Ct. at 370-71; <span class="Italic">Hillen</span>, 21 F.3d at 1579. Additionally, his involving others in the workplace, particularly Parker, may be sufficient in itself to create a hostile environment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We recognize the difficulty in establishing reasonable guidelines for appropriate social behavior among co-workers. Not every attempt to establish an intimate relationship or every invitation to dinner and a show amounts to sexual harassment. The evidence in this appeal, however, indicates that the appellant's behavior had gone beyond what was reasonable. Even after Eguiguren told him his attentions were unwelcome, the appellant persisted in visiting and questioning her about her reluctance to see him. When Eguiguren informed him of her decision to limit their association to the workplace, the appellant became angry. Although the appellant argues that the one incident on May 9 is not sufficient to establish a pattern of behavior in support of a charge of sexual harassment, he admitted in testimony that he had visited Eguiguren's neighborhood approximately 20 times and stopped to look for her on half of those occasions between February and May 1992.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the repeated, uninvited visits to the complainant's neighborhood, where the appellant lurked and peered into her window, in conjunction with the appellant's discussion of his relationship with Ms. Eguiguren, both to fellow workers and, post-October 1991, with Ms. Eguiguren, constitute sexual harassment and sustain the agency's charge.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">A relationship between a supervisor and a subordinate, who apparently was promised a favorable performance appraisal, led the Board and the Federal Circuit to sustain dismissal for unbecoming conduct, <span class="Italic">Robacker v. USDA</span>, 385 Fed. Appx. 990, 991-92 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Robacker worked as a research entomologist for the agency for over 25 years. During that time, he had romantic relationships with three subordinates. When one of the women with whom he had been romantically involved began to threaten that she would report him for sexual harassment, he contacted the agency's Office of Outreach Diversity and Equal Opportunity. The counselor with whom he spoke said she did not believe she could give him advice and directed him to her supervisor. Robacker spoke with the counselor's supervisor and explained his relationships with the three women, including an arrangement he had made with one of the women under which he would assign her the same performance rating that he received for the year. This conversation triggered an administrative inquiry, which eventually resulted in Robacker retiring to avoid removal for conduct unbecoming a federal employee. He then appealed the removal action to the board, which affirmed the agency's decision to remove him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Robacker's central argument is that consensual romantic relationships between employees are not contrary to any official regulation or policy and therefore the agency had no foundation for his removal. However, the removal action was based on the charge of conduct unbecoming <span id="Page_2676"></span>a federal employee and the agency acted within its discretion in determining that Robacker's actions were unprofessional, prevented him from adequately fulfilling his supervisory role in the workplace, and caused his superiors to lose confidence in his judgment. Furthermore, the record supports the agency's view that Robacker's actions negatively impacted the efficiency of the agency by affecting the interactions between Robacker and two of the women with whom he had been romantically involved. Both the agency and the board considered the mitigating factors provided in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981), such as the length of Robacker's service. While Robacker argues that the penalty of removal is too harsh in light of these factors, the determination that the mitigating factors do not outweigh the seriousness of the agency's concerns about Robacker's actions is not unreasonable.</p>
