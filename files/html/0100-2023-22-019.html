<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-20"><span class="space">a.</span> Enforcement Proceeding Mooted by Agency Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Fees may be available in enforcement proceedings involving a Board merits decision or Board-approved settlement of an appeal even if the agency achieves compliance. A petition is properly filed even if compliance is achieved without a Board-approved settlement resolving compliance issues or without a Board compliance decision favoring the appellant, <span class="Italic">Mynard v. OPM</span>, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/MYNARD_DON_A_DA_0831_06_0436_A_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_313430.pdf">108 MSPR 58</a>, 65-73 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-17, 2008 MSPB 23 (2008) (dissent by dissent of Chairman McPhie) (compliance proceedings following Board decision reversing OPM retirement benefits decision):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the appellant's motion for an award of attorney fees he incurred with respect to his PFE, however, we conclude, for the reasons set forth below, that the fact that the AJ did not issue an enforceable judgment during the compliance phase of this appeal did not preclude an award of attorney fees to the appellant for work his attorney performed during that phase of the appeal. In ruling to the contrary, the AJ relied on <span id="Page_4556"></span>two cases, <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and <span class="Italic">Mulero-Echevarria</span>. In <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the "prevailing party" standard contained in the attorney fees provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to allow an award of fees only when a party has been awarded some relief by the Court. <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 604. The Court stated, "[E]nforceable judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees create the 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties' necessary to permit an award of attorney's fees." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1840 (quoting <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist.,</span> 489 U.S. 782, 792-93 (1989)). The Court specifically rejected the "catalyst theory," whereby a party could be found to have prevailed based on the opposing party's voluntary change of conduct after the filing of a lawsuit, as a viable basis to award attorney fees, reasoning as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">A defendant's voluntary change in conduct, although perhaps accomplishing what the plaintiff sought to achieve by the lawsuit, lacks the necessary judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur</span> on the change. Our precedents thus counsel against holding that the term "prevailing party" authorizes an award of attorney's fees <span class="Italic">without</span> a corresponding alteration in the legal relationship of the parties.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> In <span class="Italic">Mulero-Echevarria</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-6, the Board applied <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> to find that an appellant could not qualify as a "prevailing party" for the purposes of an award of attorney fees under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)[6] where OPM reversed its earlier decision to deny the appellant's disability retirement application after the appellant filed his appeal, and the administrative judge dismissed the appeal as moot without issuing a decision on the merits. The Board stated, "Because OPM's reversal of its decision lacks the 'judicial imprimatur' necessary to find the appellant is a prevailing party, there is no basis upon which to award attorney fees to her under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1)." <span class="Italic">Mulero-Echevarria</span>, 93 M.S.P.R. 154, &#x00B6; 6.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;This provision authorizes the Board and its administrative judges to require an agency to pay attorney fees where the appellant is the prevailing party and the Board or the AJ determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, both <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and <span class="Italic">Mulero-Echevarria</span> involved requests for attorney fees relating to the merits phase of those cases, and the question presented by the instant case is whether the same "prevailing party" standard applicable to an award of attorney fees relating to the merits phase of a Board appeal is equally applicable to an award of attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of a Board appeal. As an initial matter, we note that the Board derives its authority to award attorney fees in retirement cases, such as the instant case, from 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Simmons v.

Furthermore, because 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) includes a "prevailing party" requirement, the Board has generally required appellants to establish that they have "prevailed" with respect to a compliance matter in order to be eligible for an award of fees for work their attorneys performed with respect to the compliance phase of Board appeals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Garstkiewicz</span>, 981 F.2d at 530; <span class="Italic">Stewart</span>, 102 M.S.P.R. 656, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11; <span class="Italic">Thomas v.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;In fact, from a conceptual standpoint, the type of decisions the Board and its administrative judges may issue during the compliance phase of an appeal are not themselves enforceable decisions that alter the legal relationships of the parties; rather, the Board's role in the compliance phase of an appeal is to determine whether the parties' actions are in compliance with a Board order or a settlement agreement that altered the legal <span id="Page_4557"></span>relationship of the parties during the merits phase of the appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 732-33 (Congress expressly granted the Board special power to enforce compliance with its orders, and the Board should order corrective action in cases of noncompliance with such orders).

<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, neither the Board nor its reviewing court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, has issued a precedential decision which specifically addresses the question at issue in this case, i.e., whether, for the purposes of awarding attorney fees for the compliance phase of a Board appeal, <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> applies to preclude such an award where the appellant's compliance efforts do not result in an enforceable order or a Board-approved settlement agreement that materially alters the legal relationship of the parties.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Board is not bound by any of the decisions cited in the preceding paragraph, <span class="Italic">see Fairall v. Veterans Administration</span>, 33 M.S.P.R. 33, 39 (1987) (decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit are controlling authority for the Board, whereas other circuit courts' decisions are persuasive, but not controlling, authority), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 844 F.2d 775 (Fed.

First, because the Board adjudicates a PFE as a continuation of the original appeal rather than as a separately appealable matter, we would be tempted to agree with <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> and <span class="Italic">Cody</span> to the extent that those decisions suggest that the "prevailing party" status a party achieves in the merits phase of a case can carry over to the compliance phase of that case to justify an award of attorney fees for reasonable efforts to enforce or defend the relief ordered during the merits phase were it not for the fact that the Board and the Federal Circuit have generally required appellants to separately establish that they have "prevailed" with respect to a compliance matter in order to establish their eligibility for an award of attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of their appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6; 11, <span class="Italic">supra</span>.[11] Furthermore, because the Board awards attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of an appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1), i.e., the same statute with the same "prevailing party" requirement under which it awards attorney fees relating to the merits phase, we reject the suggestion expressed in <span class="Italic">Grier</span> and <span class="Italic">Rolland</span> that <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> does not apply to eligibility for an award of attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of a case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[11]&#x2003;In addition to the cases cited in &#x00B6; 11, the Federal Circuit has issued several nonprecedential decisions in which it has affirmed the Board's denial of attorney fees with respect to the compliance phase of an appeal on the grounds that the agency's compliance did not result from the appellant's petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Box v.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 F.3d 1521 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nevertheless, we are persuaded by the reasoning set forth in cases such as <span class="Italic">Roberson</span> and <span class="Italic">Blackman</span> that a party may achieve "prevailing party" status for the purposes of qualifying for an award of attorney fees under a fee-shifting statute without obtaining an enforceable judgment on the merits or a court-ordered consent decree so long as the relief the party achieves carries with it sufficient judicial or, in this case, Board imprimatur. As the Second Circuit pointed out in <span class="Italic">Roberson</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">It seems clear from even the majority opinion in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> that the Court intended its statements about judgments on the merits and court-ordered consent decrees as merely "examples" of the type of judicial action that could convey prevailing party status.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Roberson</span>, 346 F.3d at 81 (citing <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span>, 532 U.S. at 605).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, in <span class="Italic">Blackman</span>, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia considered the applicability of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> in the context of a postjudgment procedure that closely resembled the procedure by which the Board considers petitions for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Blackman</span> involved a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1983 to enforce the rights of the plaintiff class under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The court granted the class's motion for summary judgment as to liability and eventually appointed a Special Master "for the limited purpose of assisting the Court in resolving the requests for immediate injunctive relief" with respect to the claims of individual class members. <span class="Italic">Blackman</span>, 328 F. Supp.2d at 38-39. The court entrusted the Special Master "with the dual function of facilitating a mutually satisfactory resolution of each such individual claim, and, in the absence of a mutually acceptable resolution, providing the Court with a report and recommendation with respect to whether any particular plaintiff is entitled to preliminary injunctive relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 39. With respect to each of the three individual class members whose attorney fees motions the court addressed in the decision, the defendants complied with a previously executed settlement agreement after the individual class members filed the motion for a preliminary injunction, the Special Master filed a report recommending that the court deny the class members' motion, and the court accepted the Special Master's recommendation and denied the motion. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 39-40. In determining that the class members were entitled to an award of attorney fees under 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988 despite the fact that the court had denied their motions for a preliminary injunction, the court noted that it was undisputed that the class achieved broad success in the case and continued to secure the defendants' compliance with the IDEA "through their efforts to gain appropriate relief." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 44. The court also stated, "Such an effort to secure a remedy through Court-established procedures is--and must be--inextricably intertwined with the Court's conclusion that the violation existed in the first place." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 18 45. With respect to <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and its applicability to the award of fees, the court explained as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">At the core of <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> is the requirement that there must be a change in the legal relationship between the parties in order [to be] awarded fees, and that change must be judicially sanctioned in some way. In this instance, the legal relationship between the parties changed upon the Court's finding of liability, and that change is actualized, practically speaking, in the preliminary injunctions entered and in the settlement agreements reached as a result of the efforts of the Special Master and the Order of Reference mechanism. As the Court's agent, expressly appointed to the task of resolving requests for immediate injunctive relief pursuant to the Order of Reference, the Special Master provides the process with sufficient Court oversight to ensure that the concerns expressed in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> regarding requisite judicial <span class="Italic">imprimatur</span> of settlements are met. Plaintiffs are "prevailing parties" under <span class="Italic">Buckhannon</span> and 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1988.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 45 (internal citation and footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Like the Special Master in <span class="Italic">Blackman</span>, the Board's administrative judges, in considering a PFE, have the authority to oversee the parties' compliance efforts, to determine whether the parties are acting in compliance with either the Board's final order on the merits or the parties' Board-approved settlement agreement, and to issue a compliance decision recommending that the Board find a party in noncompliance. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183. In addition, it is clear that the Board has express authority to order corrective action in a case where it determines that one of the parties has failed to comply with a Board order. <span class="Italic">See Kerr</span>, 726 F.2d at 732-33 (Congress expressly granted the Board special power to enforce compliance with its orders, and the Board should order corrective action in cases of noncompliance with such orders). Thus, as the District Court concluded in <span class="Italic">Blackman</span>, we <span id="Page_4559"></span>conclude that the Board's oversight of the parties' compliance efforts provides the PFE process with sufficient Board imprimatur to allow an appellant to qualify as a "prevailing party" under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1) even in the absence of a Board order finding the agency in noncompliance or an agreement executed by the parties to settle compliance matters. Because the AJ's decision to deny the appellant's motion for attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of his appeal on the grounds that his PFE did not result in an enforceable judgment is contrary to this conclusion, we are remanding this case to the regional office for further adjudication of the appellant's motion for attorney fees relating to the compliance phase of this appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Mynard</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Shelton v. EPA</span>, 115 MSPR 177, 181-84 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-12, 2010 MSPB 216 (2010), a decision that attempted to straighten out some inconsistencies in the law defining how "prevailing party" status is established in an enforcement proceeding--in <span class="Italic">Shelton,</span> the compliance issue involved the timeliness of payment of counsel fees under a Board-adopted settlement agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his addendum initial decision, the administrative judge explained the parties' burdens of proof as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]t a minimum, the appellant must show that the agency was not in compliance with a material term of the settlement agreement to be deemed a "prevailing party" with respect to the petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Mynard</span> [<span class="Italic">v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 108 M.S.P.R. 58, &#x00B6; 12 (2008)]. Nevertheless, for an attorney fees motion based upon counsel's services in connection with a [petition for enforcement], the burden of proof is upon the agency to prove its compliance, rather than upon the appellant to prove what the agency would not have done in the absence of the [petition for enforcement]. <span class="Italic">See Whaley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 61 M.S.P.R. 340, 346 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the administrative judge correctly recited the holdings of these relevant cases, the case law itself is inconsistent. That is, <span class="Italic">Mynard</span> states that the appellant bears the burden of proving that the agency breached the settlement agreement, whereas <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> states that the agency bears the burden of proving that it did not breach the settlement agreement. For the following reasons, we find that the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Mynard</span> is correct, and to the extent that <span class="Italic">Whaley</span>, <span class="Italic">Thompson v. Department of the Navy</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 509, &#x00B6; 5 (1999), <span class="Italic">Capehart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 385, &#x00B6; 4 (1999), <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The rule as set forth in <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> arises from an attempt to interpret <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 981 F.2d 528, 530 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, the agency failed to pay the appellant back pay under a Board order, the appellant filed a petition for enforcement, the agency made the payments, and the Board dismissed the petition for enforcement as moot. 981 F.2d at 529. The appellant filed a motion for attorney fees related to the petition for enforcement, and the Board denied the motion on the basis that the appellant was not the prevailing party because he failed to establish that the agency would not have paid him absent the petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 529-30. The court reversed, finding that the appellant was the prevailing party because it was undisputed that the agency failed to pay the appellant by the deadline set in the Board's order or the filing of the petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 530. The court stated that, in order to be deemed the prevailing party, the appellant did not also have to prove that the agency's eventual compliance was causally related to the petition for enforcement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The statute does not place on the petitioner the burden of proving what the agency would not have done, when the passing of the Board's deadline had already established noncompliance by the agency. The burden of compliance with the Board's Order was not upon Mr. Garstkiewicz, but upon the Postal Service. It is undisputed that payment was not made as the Board's order required, and that the other provisions of the Board's Order were not complied with.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> held that, in order to establish prevailing party status in the compliance phase of an appeal, an appellant is not required to show that the agency would not have complied but for the petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Because the agency's noncompliance in <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> was undisputed, the court had no occasion to place the burden of proving compliance on one party or the other.</p>

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 331, &#x00B6; 9 (2000), or any other Board cases state that an appellant must prove that the agency's eventual compliance was causally related to the petition for enforcement, they are inconsistent with <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> and are hereby overruled. An appellant may prove that he was the prevailing party by establishing such a causal relationship, <span class="Italic">e.g., Cuthbertson v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 784 F.2d 370, 372-73 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">abrogated in part on other grounds by Sacco v. United States</span>, 452 F.3d 1305 (Fed. Cir. 2006); <span class="Italic">Foley v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 413, 418-20 (1993), but his failure to establish a causal relationship does not necessarily entail a finding that he was not the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> stated merely that "[t]he burden of compliance" is upon the agency, 981 F.2d at 530, the Board in <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> cited <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> for the proposition that "the burden of <span class="Italic">proof</span> is upon the agency to <span class="Italic">prove</span> its compliance," 61 M.S.P.R. at 346 (emphasis added). Thus, the Board in <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, and the cases that rely on <span class="Italic">Whaley</span> for this erroneous proposition are contrary to Board and Federal Circuit case law clearly stating that, in a motion for attorney fees, the appellant bears the burden of proving he is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">E.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1565-66 (Fed. Cir. 1983); <span class="Italic">Krape v. Department of Defense</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 5 (2004).[2] There is no reason that the burden on this matter should shift to the agency merely because the attorney fees motion arises in the context of a petition for enforcement. <span class="Italic">See Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 7 (2004) (the ultimate burden in a petition for enforcement is upon the party seeking enforcement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;To the extent that the court in <span class="Italic">Mynard v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 348 Fed. Appx. 582, 586 (Fed. Cir. 2009), interpreted <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span> as holding that the agency has the burden of proving compliance, we note that the court identified that decision as nonprecedential. Such nonprecedential decisions are not binding precedent. <span class="Italic">See Weed v. Social Security Administration</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 468, &#x00B6; 11 (2009).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the burdens of proof in a motion for attorney fees arising out of a petition for enforcement are as follows. An appellant bears the burden of proving his entitlement to attorney fees by showing that: (1) An attorney-client relationship existed and fees were incurred; (2) he is the prevailing party; (3) an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the fees are reasonable. <span class="Italic">Krape</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 430, &#x00B6; 5. In order to show that he is the prevailing party in the compliance phase of the proceedings, an appellant must establish that the agency materially breached the Board enforceable order or settlement agreement at issue. <span class="Italic">Olson</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 266. In cases where the agency complies with the settlement agreement during the pendency of the petition for enforcement, the appellant is not required to establish that the agency's eventual compliance was causally related to his petition for enforcement in order to establish that he is the prevailing party. <span class="Italic">Garstkiewicz</span>, 981 F.2d at 530. Although the appellant bears the ultimate burden of proving the agency's noncompliance, the agency bears the burden of producing relevant, material, and credible evidence of its compliance. <span class="Italic">See Vaughn</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 97, &#x00B6; 7; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(1). If a settlement agreement sets no time for performance, a reasonable time under the circumstances will be presumed. <span class="Italic">Eagleheart v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 11 (2009).</p>
