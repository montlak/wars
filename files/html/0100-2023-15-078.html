<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Prather v. Dept. of Army</span>, DC-0752-14-0327-B-1 (NP 11/22/2022), described <span id="Page_2530"></span>DOD overseas appointments, return rights, and the effect (as a condition of employment) of loss of those rights:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Department of Defense (DOD) regulations, civilian employment in the competitive service in foreign areas generally is limited to a period of 5 continuous years. DOD Instruction (DODI) No. 1400-25, Volume (Vol.) 1230, &#x00B6; 4.h.(1); <span class="Italic">see</span> 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1586 (generally authorizing the establishment of rotation programs to facilitate the interchange of civilian DOD employees between posts of duty in and outside the United States). An employee who is covered by the 5-year limitation, and who does not have a statutory right to return to a position in the United States,[3] must, as a condition of employment, agree to register in the agency's Priority Placement Program (PPP) before the end of the 5-year period or before the end of an approved extension. DODI No. 1400-25, Vol. 1230, Enclosure (Encl.) 2, &#x00B6; 5.a.(2). The employee also must agree that failure or refusal to register in the PPP is a basis for separation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., Encl. 2, &#x00B6; 5.a.(3)(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;Generally, competitive service career and career-conditional employees who are employed in the United States or another nonforeign area and who accept an assignment in either a foreign area or in a nonforeign area different from the one where they are employed currently shall be granted statutory return rights. 10 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1586(b); DODI No. 1400-25, Vol. 1230, &#x00B6; 4.i.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The DOD PPP Handbook, which sets out standard operating procedures for the PPP, provides that PPP registration will be denied when the registering activity--in this case, the agency's Civilian Personnel Advisory Center (CPAC)--has knowledge of performance or conduct that directly and negatively affects the employee's qualifications, eligibility, or suitability for placement. DOD PPP Handbook, chapter 3, &#x00B6; C.16. In the case of "substantiated conduct or performance problems," regardless of whether formal disciplinary action is taken, eligibility will be withheld for a period of time to ensure that the necessary corrective measures have had their intended effect. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., chapter 3, &#x00B6; C.16.(a). Local agency policy further specifies that when CPAC has knowledge of a conduct or performance problem, PPP registration must be withheld for a period of at least 90 days.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On September 29, 2008, the appellant received a career appointment to the Supervisory Food Service Operations Specialist position in Wiesbaden, Germany. Because the appellant was recruited in Germany, and therefore did not have statutory return rights, the agency required him to sign a Department of the Army Form 5370-R, Rotation Agreement--Employees Recruited Locally in Foreign Areas. The Rotation Agreement provided that his overseas assignment was limited to an initial tour and any management-initiated extension thereof, and that he did not have a right to extensions beyond the initial tour. The Rotation Agreement further provided that, because he did not have return rights, he would apply for assignment to the United States under the PPP before completing his initial tour and any extensions thereof. The appellant acknowledged that failure to comply with the "conditions of employment" described in the agreement could result in a proposal to remove him from Federal service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant's initial tour was limited to 24 months, ending September 28, 2010, but was subsequently extended to September 20, 2012, and again to June 28, 2013. The agency denied his request for an additional extension, and he agreed to register for the PPP. The appellant's PPP registration was initially delayed due to his receipt of a November 28, 2012 letter of reprimand, which rendered him ineligible for 90 days, but he successfully registered for the PPP on March 15, 2013, before the end of his tour. It is undisputed that the agency had discretion to allow him to continue in his position beyond the end of his tour, provided he remained registered in the PPP.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On October 9, 2013, the appellant had a confrontation with his second-line supervisor concerning the supervisor's instruction to keep his office door open. The following day, two coworkers who witnessed the event provided written statements relating that the appellant created a disturbance by yelling at the supervisor, and then yelling at one of the coworkers. On October 11, 2013, a Human Resource Specialist in the Wiesbaden CPAC informed the appellant that he was being removed from the PPP "because of misconduct determined by management." Subsequently, on October 22, 2013, the same supervisor proposed to remove the appellant based on the following charges: (1) the expiration of his tour of duty; (2) his ineligibility to remain in the PPP; and (3) his failure to abide by the terms of the Rotation Agreement. The proposing official explained that the appellant's removal from the PPP "was required because of your disrespectful conduct and for causing a disturbance" on October 9, 2013. The proposing official proceeded to relate his own version of the events of that day, which corresponded with the statements provided by the two coworkers. The appellant submitted a written response, in which he disputed the statements by the proposing official and the two coworkers, alleged that the proposing official had initiated the argument as a pretext for removing him, and contended that he was unlawfully removed from the PPP without prior notice. After considering the appellant's response, the deciding official sustained the proposed action, and the appellant was removed effective December 20, 2013.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">...Following a hearing, the administrative judge issued an initial decision sustaining the action. The administrative judge sustained all three charges, found that the appellant had failed to establish an affirmative defense of retaliation for EEO activity, and further found that the removal penalty was reasonable. The appellant filed the instant petition for review, to which the agency has responded....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">The appellantTs removal from the PPP is not appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.214.</span></p>
<p class="Body-Text">On review, the appellant first argues that his removal from the PPP is appealable to the Board under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.214, which provides that an individual who believes that his reemployment rights under subpart B of 5 C.F.R. part 330 have been violated may appeal to the Board. Subpart B of 5 C.F.R. part 330 governs the operation of the Reemployment Priority List (RPL), which is a required component of an agency's placement programs to assist current and former competitive-service employees who will be or were separated by reduction in force (RIF) or who have recovered from a compensable work-related injury after more than 1 year. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(a). Subpart B also provides that an agency may operate an alternative placement program, approved by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as an exception to the RPL regulations, but this provision is limited in scope to reemployment priority because of RIF separation. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.201(d). Here, regardless of whether the PPP was approved by OPM, the appellant has not alleged that the agency violated any reemployment rights arising from RIF separation or recovery from a compensable injury. Thus, we find that his challenge to the agency's decision to remove him from the PPP is not within the Board's jurisdiction under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 330.214.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">...</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The agency has met its burden of proof on charges (1) and (2), which we construe as a single charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We find that charge (1), the expiration of the appellant's tour of duty, and charge (2), his ineligibility to remain in the PPP, together amount to a single charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment. When, as in this case, a charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment is based on the employing agency's withdrawing or revoking its certification or other approval of the employee's fitness or other qualifications to hold his position, the Board's authority generally extends to review of the merits of that withdrawal or revocation. <span class="Italic">Adams v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 10 (2007), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 273 F. App'x 947 (Fed. Cir. 2008). In conducting that review, the Board determines whether, under the circumstances, the agency acted reasonably in denying the required certification or approval. <span class="Italic">See id</span>., &#x00B6; 19. The Board has recognized a narrow exception in cases in which the adverse action is based on the withholding of a national security credential, such as a security clearance or eligibility to occupy a sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">see Department of the Navy v. Egan</span>, 484 U.S. 518, 530-31 (1988); <span class="Italic">Kaplan v. Conyers</span>, 733 F.3d 1148, 1166 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>). This is not such a case, however. Accordingly, in order to determine whether the agency proved its charge, we will consider whether, under the circumstances, the agency acted reasonably in removing the appellant from the PPP. <span class="Italic">Adams</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 50, &#x00B6; 19.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As discussed above, the agency's policy provides that "[i]n the case of substantiated conduct or performance problems," an employee's eligibility for the PPP will be withheld for a period of time to ensure that the necessary corrective measures have had their intended effect. DOD PPP Handbook, chapter 3, &#x00B6; C.16(a). The PPP Handbook further explains that, for purposes of determining PPP eligibility in accordance with that provision, "conduct problems" include the following: (1) attendance deficiencies such as recurring tardiness or unexcused absence, or abuse of sick leave; (2) conduct on or off the job that could render the employee unsuitable for Federal employment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202; and (3) any other conduct that adversely affects the productivity and efficiency of the organization and could potentially require disciplinary action. DOD PPP Handbook, chapter 3, &#x00B6; C.16(c).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">We find that, under the circumstances, the agency reasonably determined that the appellant had substantiated conduct problems that required his removal from the PPP. <span class="Italic">See</span> IAF, Tab 9 at 10 (explaining that the appellant was being removed from the PPP "because of conduct determined by management"). In addition to the proposing official's personal knowledge, the evidence available to the agency included two written statements, one of them sworn, by disinterested, firsthand witnesses to the October 9, 2013 incident. Both witnesses related that the appellant created a disturbance by arguing with and yelling at the proposing official, and then yelling at one of the coworkers. While the appellant attempted to identify discrepancies in their statements in his response to the proposed removal, we find the two statements are consistent with each other, as well as the recollection of the proposing <span id="Page_2531"></span>official. Given the available evidence, it was reasonable for the agency to conclude that the statements by the coworkers were accurate in their relevant details, and that the appellant did in fact create a workplace disturbance. <span class="Italic">Cf. Borninkhof v. Department of Justice</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 77, 87 (1981) (stating that the Board generally assesses the probative value of hearsay by considering various factors that include the availability of persons with firsthand knowledge to testify at the hearing, whether the statements of the out-of-court declarants were sworn, whether the declarants were disinterested witnesses to the events and whether their statements were routinely made, the consistency of the out-of-court statements with other statements and evidence, whether there is corroboration or contradiction in the record, and the credibility of the out-of-court declarant). Moreover, even accepting as true the appellant's contention that the proposing official initiated the argument, the appellant's admitted participation was unnecessarily disruptive, adversely affected the productivity and efficiency of the office, and could have potentially required at least a minor disciplinary action. We conclude that, under the circumstances present here, the agency reasonably determined that it had knowledge of substantiated conduct problems, thus rendering the appellant ineligible for the PPP, at a time when registration in the PPP was a condition of his continued employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> DOD PPP Handbook, chapter 3, &#x00B6; C.16(c). Accordingly, we sustain the charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">...</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">The removal penalty is sustained.</span> </p>
<p class="Body-Text">The appellant also argues on review that the administrative judge failed to analyze the agency's penalty determination under the applicable <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors. <span class="Italic">See Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981) (listing 12 factors generally recognized as relevant for consideration in determining the appropriateness of a penalty). We find, however, that the penalty determination in this case is not subject to a typical <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis. As our reviewing court has explained, the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> mitigation analysis "reflects the general principle that penalties should be proportional to misconduct." <span class="Italic">Ryan v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 793 F.3d 1368, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2015). Consistent with that principle, the majority of the <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors concern misconduct charges and have no application to adverse actions taken for other reasons, such as failure to maintain a condition of employment. <span class="Italic">Douglas</span>, 5 M.S.P.R. at 305-06; <span class="Italic">see Munoz v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6; 15 (2014) (holding that a "traditional" <span class="Italic">Douglas</span> factors analysis does not apply to an adverse action based on inability to meet a condition of employment, because such an action is not a "sanction or penalty for misconduct").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In determining the appropriate penalty for a charge of failure to maintain a condition of employment, the Board instead considers a more limited set of factors, which generally include (1) the nature of the offense, (2) its effect on the appellant's performance of the job, and (3) the availability and effect of alternative sanctions.[8] <span class="Italic">Penland v. Department of the Interior</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 474, &#x00B6; 8 (2010). The first two considerations generally weigh in favor of removal, because an employee who does not meet the conditions of employment cannot perform his job. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. As to the availability of alternative sanctions, the appellant argues that, instead of removing him, the agency could have granted an additional tour extension, thus permitting him time to correct any conduct issues and regain eligibility for the PPP. The deciding official testified that he did consider the possibility of such an extension. However, as the appellant acknowledged when he signed the Rotation Agreement, extensions are not automatic and not a matter of right. In addition, the proposing official provided unrebutted testimony that, due to a change in mission, the appellant's position no longer needed to be filled. Under these circumstances, we find that it was not unreasonable for the agency to remove the appellant instead of extending his tour.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[8]&#x2003;When an appellant is removed for failure to maintain a security clearance or eligibility to occupy a sensitive position, or for failure to complete an "up-or-out" training program, and there is no law or regulation granting the employee a substantive right to reassignment, the Board will not inquire whether reassignment is a possible alternative sanction. <span class="Italic">Munoz</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 483, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16; <span class="Italic">Radcliffe v. Department of Transportation</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 237, 242 (1993). This is not such a case, however.</p>
