<p class="Body-Text">"The Board has held that neither the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 nor the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 immunizes disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability." <span class="Italic">Williams v. GPO</span>, 86 MSPR 583, 587 &#x00B6; 12 (2000) (disability not identified in decision); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Vilca v. TSA</span>, DE-0752-20-0272-I-1 (NP 2/17/2023) ("[T]he relevant anti-discrimination statutes do not immunize disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Burton v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 112 M.S.P.R. 115, &#x00B6; 16 (2009); <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 M.S.P.R. 477, &#x00B6; 5 (1999).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. VA</span>, 83 MSPR 477, 480-83 (1999), outlined the law disqualifying otherwise disabled employees for misconduct. The appellant, a telephone operator at a VA hospital, was discharged for violation of hospital procedures, verbal abuse of a volunteer worker, use of inappropriate language in front of staff and patients, and misdirecting a medical team during an emergency. The appellant, although suffering from depression and bipolar disorder, was not qualified for accommodation. She was properly discharged:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may not be removed for her purported disability, and assuming her misconduct was a manifestation of the alleged disabling conditions, neither the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 nor the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) immunize disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. This basic principle has been repeatedly applied by the courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Hamilton v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</span>, 136 F.3d 1047, 1052 (5th Cir. 1998) ("[t]he ADA does not insulate [employees from] emotional or violent outbursts blamed on an impairment. An employee who is fired because of outbursts at work directed at fellow employees has no ADA claim." (footnote omitted)); <span class="Italic">Palmer v. Circuit Court of Cook County</span>, 117 F.3d 351, 352 (7th Cir. 1997) ("[I]f an employer fires an employee because of the employee's unacceptable behavior, the fact that the behavior was precipitated by a mental illness does not present an issue under the [ADA]."), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 893, 139 L. Ed.2d 879 (1998); <span class="Italic">Martinson v. Kinney Shoe Corp.</span>, 104 F.3d 683, 686 n.3 (4th Cir. 1997) ("[M]isconduct--even misconduct related to a disability--is not itself a disability, and an employer is free to fire an employee on that basis."); <span class="Italic">Harris v. Polk County</span>, 103 F.3d 696, 697 (8th Cir. 1996) (an employer may hold disabled employees to the same standard as non-disabled employees, even if the misconduct is alleged to have been caused by the disabling condition); <span class="Italic">Williams v. Widnall</span>, 79 F.3d 1003, 1007 (10th Cir. 1996) (the Rehabilitation Act does not require an employer to accept egregious behavior from a disabled employee when the same behavior by a non-disabled employee would require discharge); <span class="Italic">Despears v. Milwaukee County</span>, 63 F.3d 635, 637 (7th Cir. 1995) (ADA and Rehabilitation Act do not require an employer to overlook misconduct committed by employee even where such behavior was arguably caused by the employee's disability); <span class="Italic">Maddox v. University of Tennessee</span>, 62 F.3d 843, 847 (6th Cir. 1995) (no ADA violation to discharge a disabled employee for misconduct for which a non-disabled employee could lawfully be discharged); <span class="Italic">Leary v. Dalton</span>, 58 F.3d 748, 753 (1st Cir. 1995) (Rehabilitation Act does not protect employees from the consequences of their own misconduct, even if caused by a disability); <span class="Italic">Little v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official explained why the sustained misconduct, especially the sustained misconduct in specification (B), was serious, detrimental to patient welfare, disruptive of hospital operations, and merited removal. The appellant presented no evidence in rebuttal. Thus, we find that the appellant's misdirection of the code blue team and her abuse of the volunteer were job-related and were consistent with the business necessity of running the hospital and its mission of caring for the veterans who were patients there.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3521"></span>The administrative judge's prehearing order notes a claim that "other individuals involved in the July 23 incident were not disciplined for fighting." The appellant submitted no evidence identifying the alleged comparison employees or showing what they may have done on July 23. In fact, there is no evidence that any personnel were fighting on that date. Moreover, because the appellant was not charged with fighting, she is not similarly situated to the purported combatants. Because there is no evidence showing that the agency treated the appellant differently from other employees who engaged in similar actions, we find no basis on which to find disparate treatment in violation of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See Ferrell</span>, 1997 WL 177246, at *10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies to grant reasonable accommodation to employees as part of their obligation to make affirmative plans for the hiring, placement, and advancement of individuals with disabilities." <span class="Italic">Walsh v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 74 MSPR 627, 633 (1997). An agency shall make reasonable accommodation to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is a qualified individual with a disability unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operations of its program. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1614.203(c)(1). Hence, an agency can discriminate against a disabled employee by failing to provide reasonable accommodation. However, as the regulation and the case law cited above make clear, an agency has a duty to provide accommodation only to "otherwise qualified" employees. In this case, the appellant committed misconduct. As a result of this misconduct, she cannot be termed an "otherwise qualified" employee. Therefore, the agency did not have a duty to accommodate whatever limitations she might have experienced as a result of her purported mental disability. <span class="Italic">See Taub v. Frank</span>, 957 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1992) (employee's misconduct meant employee could not be a "qualified handicapped person" under the Rehabilitation Act); <span class="Italic">Husowitz v. Runyon</span>, 942 F.

In addition, we note the appellant's testimony that at no time while occupying the position of Telephone Operator did she even ask for accommodation. The appellant therefore has not proven her allegation of disability discrimination, and the administrative judge erred in finding that she did.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that we were to find that the appellant was disabled, and even if, contrary to the AJ's finding, we were to conclude that his misconduct was consistent with, and a manifestation of, his bipolar disorder, <span class="Italic">see Brinkley v. Veterans Administration</span>, 37 MSPR 682, 684 (1988), we would still find, as set forth below, that he did not prove his allegation of disability discrimination. Subsequent to the issuance of the ID in this case, the Board issued <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 MSPR 477 (1999), which did not make new law, but synthesized an existing principle regarding an agency's obligation to accommodate a disabled employee who commits misconduct. In <span class="Italic">Laniewicz</span>, relying on extensive precedent of the courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Board clearly held that neither the Rehabilitation Act nor the Americans with Disabilities Act immunize disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8. In other words, an agency is never required to excuse a disabled employee's violation of a uniformly-applied, job-related rule of conduct, even if the employee's disability caused the misconduct. And, because agencies have a duty to provide accommodation only to "otherwise qualified" employees, agencies have no obligation to accommodate employees who have committed misconduct because, as a, result of their misconduct, they are not "otherwise qualified" employees. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official explained why the sustained misconduct was serious, detrimental and disruptive to the educational process, and deserving of removal. Specifically, she explained that the appellant's disrespectful and disorderly conduct adversely affected public confidence in him, in his assigned school, and in DoDDS as an educational institution; that his intimidating behavior and verbal outbursts caused continual disruption and reflected a lack of proper attention to his academic program; and that his actions impaired his ability to be a positive role model in the community. Although the appellant denied engaging in some of the charged misconduct, the AJ generally found his denials incredible as to the sustained specifications, further finding on the appellant's part a tendency to misconstrue people's motives and conduct, and to become agitated and upset at the slightest provocation....&#8197;As such, we find that the sustained incidents of disorderly and disrespectful conduct and failure to follow directives were not only job-related, but reflected a violation of workplace standards, consistent with the business necessity of running the school and its mission of providing quality education within a safe environment for its students. <span class="Italic">See Laniewicz</span>, 83 MSPR 477 at &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-7. And, the appellant submitted no evidence, nor did he allege, that the agency treated him differently from other employees who engaged in similar actions, or even that there were any other employees who had engaged in such actions.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the appellant may not be removed for a perceived disabling condition, assuming he was so perceived, the disability discrimination statutes do not immunize disabled employees from being disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, provided the agency would impose the same discipline on an employee without a disability. <span class="Italic">Laniewicz v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> 83 MSPR 477, 5 (1999). The agency proved that the appellant swung tire chains at a supervisor, made a menacing gesture with an open pocket knife toward a supervisor, cursed and screamed at an agency nurse, told the nurse that he was "going after" his supervisor and everyone in the medical unit, including her, and shouted at her that the blood would be on her hands. Prior to these events, the agency had informed all employees that threatening conduct would not be tolerated and would result in severe disciplinary action, up to and including removal. Mr. Guertler said that the agency was concerned about incidents involving violent actions by Postal Service employees around the country, and that, as Postmaster of the Elkins Park station, he was concerned about the safety of other employees in view of the behavior manifested by the appellant during the specific incidents referenced in the decision letter. This evidence shows that the agency would have taken the same action absent any perceived disability. Moreover, the appellant did not allege that the agency treated him differently from any other employees who might have engaged in similar misconduct. Under these circumstances, the appellant did not prove his allegation of disability discrimination....</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency proposed the appellant's removal based on two charges, <span id="Page_3522"></span>Striking a Coworker and Use of Abusive Language in the Workplace. The appellant asserted an affirmative defense of disability discrimination. Although the administrative judge failed to analyze the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination under the recent amendments to the Americans with Disability Act (ADA), the error did not affect the outcome of this case and, therefore, is not harmful error. The Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 (ADAAA), which liberalized the definition of disability, came into effect on January 1, 2009. Pub. L.

U.S. Postal Service</span>, 113 M.S.P.R. 346, &#x00B6; 10 (2010). All of the events in this case occurred after that date, so the ADAAA applies to this appeal. In order to prove an allegation of disability discrimination, an appellant must show that he is both a disabled person and a qualified disabled person. <span class="Italic">See Pinegar v. Federal Election Commission,</span> 105 M.S.P.R. 677, &#x00B6; 36 (2007). Thus, even if the appellant was disabled under the more expansive interpretation mandated by the ADAAA, because of the appellant's misconduct, he was not qualified, and therefore, the agency had no duty to accommodate him. <span class="Italic">E.g., Fitzgerald v. Department of Defense</span>, 85 M.S.P.R. 463, &#x00B6; 6 (2000).
