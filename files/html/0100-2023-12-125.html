<h3 class="h3" id="sec5-124"><span class="space">D.</span> REVIEW OF NEW EVIDENCE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Under 5 CFR 1201.115(d) (2022), the Board may grant a PFR when it is established that "[n]ew and material evidence or legal argument is available that, despite the petitioner's due diligence, was not available when the record closed." <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 91 MSPR 239, 245 &#x00B6; 12 (2002) ("To constitute new evidence, the information contained in the documents, not just the documents themselves, must have been unavailable despite due diligence when the record closed."). As to the procedure for submitting new evidence while the PFR is pending but the record is closed, 5 CFR 1201.114 (2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Petition and cross petition for review--content and procedure</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(a)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Pleadings allowed</span>. Pleadings allowed on review include a petition for review, a cross petition for review, a response to a petition for review, a response to a cross petition for review, and a reply to a response to a petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A petition for review is a pleading in which a party contends that an initial decision was incorrectly decided in whole or in part.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;A cross petition for review has the same meaning as a petition for review but is used to describe a pleading that is filed by a party when another party has already filed a timely petition for review.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;A response to a petition for review and a cross petition for review may be contained in a single pleading.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(4)&#x2003;A reply to a response to a petition for review is limited to the factual and legal issues raised by another party in the response to the petition for review. It may not raise new allegations of error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(5)&#x2003;No pleading other than the ones described in this paragraph will be accepted unless the party files a motion with and obtains leave from the Clerk of the Board. The motion must describe the nature of and need for the pleading.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Doe v. Dept. of Navy,</span> AT-0752-15-0206-I-1 n.4 (NP 4/21/2016), opaquely remarked of the process to be followed when new evidence is submitted while the PFR is pending:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1709"></span>[A]fter the record closed on petition for review, the appellant filed a motion to consider new and material evidence in which he asserted that the Department of Defense Central Adjudication Facility favorably adjudicated his security clearance and to which he attached two documents. ...While one of the documents submitted by the appellant is dated after the close of the record on review, we find that the evidence or argument submitted is not material to the outcome of this appeal. Moreover, the appellant failed to comply with the Board's regulations requiring a party to file a motion with and receive leave from the Clerk of the Board before filing a pleading other than the ones set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(a). Accordingly, we give no further consideration to the appellant's November 23, 2015 pleading or the agency's response thereto.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">[Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-065.html#sec5-65">Authority to Reopen and Reconsider</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-12-143.html#sec5-142">Review of New Issues or Issues Not Raised With Judge</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A request to allow submission of an additional pleading in the PFR process must be specific as to what will be provided to the Board, <span class="Italic">English v. SBA, DE-0752-16-0306-I-1</span> (NP 2/3/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also has filed, after the record closed on review, a motion for leave to file an additional pleading. He asserts that he has new and relevant information that relates to his whistleblower allegations and shows that a management official made false statements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pleadings allowed on review include a petition for review, a cross petition for review, a response to a petition for review, a response to a cross petition for review, and a reply to a response to a petition for review. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(a). No other pleading will be accepted unless the party files a motion with and obtains leave from the Clerk of the Board. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(a)(5). Such a motion must describe the nature of and need for the pleading. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Here, the appellant has not sufficiently explained the nature of the information in question and how this alleged new evidence would change the outcome of his appeal.

<p class="Body-Text">Usually, "new evidence" pertains to the merits of the appeal, e.g., whether a suspension was justified; however, evidence is also "new" if it pertains to a procedural issue, e.g., whether a pleading was submitted to the AJ on time, when a party first learns of the procedural deficiency upon receiving the AJ's decision and can first address that deficiency through a sworn statement submitted to the Board with a PFR. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bradley v.

<p class="Body-Text">New evidence will be considered only if three conditions are met. First, whatever is being offered must be evidence, or the whole exercise is moot. Second, the evidence must be new. Third, the evidence must make a difference, i.e., it must be material. If an allegation of new evidence is made, the allegation must contain specifics. A bare allegation of new evidence is insufficient to demonstrate compliance with these tests. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text">If a PFR requests the Board to remand for the purpose of developing new evidence, the suggestion is taken as an offer of new evidence, considered unpersuasive because discovery procedures could have been used by the appellant to obtain the evidence sought through the PFR. <span class="Italic">Davis v.

<p class="Body-Text">There is another, practical condition to a petition seeking review on the basis of new evidence: the petition must be timely filed. Once the appellant has good reason to believe there is a basis for review on new evidence, the PFR or reopening request must be filed with due diligence or suffer dismissal as untimely. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jenkins-Nye v. GSA</span>, 34 MSPR 382, 384-85 (1987). Months of delay by an appellant who ought to be aware of Board review procedures will not serve to support a belated petition based on new evidence. <span class="Italic">Pearce v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 52 MSPR 251, 252-54 (1992), an appeal that originated prior to the Reform Act, emphasized the need quickly to bring new evidence to the Board's attention through a reopening petition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the Denver Regional Office, after a hearing, issued an initial decision dated June 12, 1979, sustaining the appellant's removal from his position of Aircraft Worker, WG-8, effective December 29, 1978. The removal was based on charges of absence without leave and failure to request leave in accordance with established procedures. The initial decision stated that the appellant could request the Board to reopen and reconsider the initial decision within a reasonable time after receipt of such decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated July 19, 1991, the appellant filed a request to reopen the initial decision. He submitted a letter dated October 23, 1990, from the Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Program (OWCP), accepting his condition of organic brain disorder resulting from his employment injury on December 1, 1977. The appellant asserts that his reasons for stopping work were related to "compensable, properly claimed employment caused health damages, and the refusal of my employer to recognize and accept their responsibility toward me in regard to these damages and the issues relating to them."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since the appellant's request was not submitted until approximately 12 years after the initial decision was issued, he was afforded an opportunity to show good cause for the delay. He asserts that he had no acceptable evidence to submit until June 24, 1991, the date he received retroactive OWCP paychecks for the periods from August 26, 1978 to December 29, 1978, and from December 30, 1978 to August 25, 1979. He claims that he was diligent in pursuing the reconsideration request within thirty days of the date he came into possession of the first acceptable evidence that his removal was unjustified. The agency has not submitted a reply to the appellant's request.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has not shown that his request for reconsideration was filed within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the initial decision issued on June 12, 1979. Although the request was based on the submission of alleged new and material evidence that was not available at the time that the regional office decision was issued, the appellant cannot sit on his rights for an unreasonable period of time and then recover back pay for that period. <span class="Italic">See Doe</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 7 MSPB 612, 8 MSPR 128, 130 (1981). Until his letter of July 19, 1991, there is no showing of any action taken by the appellant with regard to the regional office decision of June 12, 1979. Clearly, a request filed over 11 years after an initial decision has been issued cannot be considered submitted within a reasonable length of time.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Further, even, if we were to find that the delay prior to receipt of the OWCP decision was reasonable, we find that the appellant did not act with reasonable diligence once he was aware of that decision. The appellant was aware in October 1990, that OWCP had accepted his claim for a 1977 on-the-job injury. He has not, however, provided any <span id="Page_1710"></span>explanation for the nine month delay between his receipt of this "new" evidence and his July 19, 1991 request to the Board. <span class="Italic">See Jenkins-Nye v. General Services Administration,</span> 34 MSPR 382, 384-85 (1987). The argument that the appellant did not have "acceptable" or "solid" evidence to request reopening until receipt of OWCP paychecks in June 1991 is not persuasive. There is no allegation of circumstances beyond his control which prevented the appellant from promptly requesting review after receipt of the October 23, 1990 OWCP decision. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Fousek v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 48 MSPR 328, 329 (1991) (the appellant's contention that he did not realize that he had good grounds for an appeal does not constitute good cause for his untimely filing); <span class="Italic">Martin v.

Cir. 1989) (Table).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we find that the appellant did not pursue diligent and timely action in requesting reopening in the matter. <span class="Italic">Cf.

Dept. of Treasury</span>, 115 MSPR 1, 2010 MSPB 179 (2010)), the Federal Circuit accepted the Board's formulation that a petition for reopening on the basis of new evidence be granted only if the new evidence is "of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome from that of the initial decision," but that standard and associated timeliness limitations, the court determined, would not be applicable if the appellant acts to reopen quickly after discovering a basis for reopening--in the case before the court, the possibility that a settlement was procured through fraud:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We first examine the MSPB's decision that Armstrong could not be permitted to file his untimely petition for review. A petition for review of an AJ's decision is required to be filed with the full MSPB within 35 days. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.114(d). The MSPB has discretion, though, to waive regulatory requirements, including the 35-day time limit, if a party requests such a waiver and shows good cause for waiving the requirement. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.12 and &#x00A7; 1201.114(f). The regulations and statutes governing the MSPB do not define what constitutes "good cause" for waiving the timeliness requirement. The MSPB has previously held that "[t]he discovery of new evidence may establish good cause for the untimely filing of a petition for review 'if the evidence was not readily available before the close of the record below, and is of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome from that of the initial decision.'" <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 69 M.S.P.R. 21, 26 (1995) (quoting <span class="Italic">Boyd-Casey v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</span> 62 M.S.P.R. 530, 532 (1994)). This same standard has been applied by the MSPB in other cases as well. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., De La Gal v. Dep't of Justice,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 396, 399 (1998). Both <span class="Italic">Jones</span> and <span class="Italic">De La Gal</span> were affirmed by the Federal Circuit in non-precedential decisions. <span class="Italic">De La Gal v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.,</span> 194 F.3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (table); <span class="Italic">Jones v. Dep't of Transp.,</span> 111 F.3d 144 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (table). In light of this court's prior implicit acceptance of the MSPB's standard for waiving the timeliness requirement in light of new evidence, we cannot say that it was wrong for the MSPB to consider whether Armstrong's new evidence was "of sufficient weight to warrant a different outcome from that of the initial decision."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But our approval of this standard does not mean that satisfying it is the only way that a petitioner may gain a waiver of the MSPB's timeliness requirement. Certainly, there may be cases in which satisfaction of the sufficient-to-warrant-a-different-outcome standard is the only appropriate criterion by which to judge timeliness. In <span class="Italic">De La Gal,</span> for example, the evidence uncovered after the close of the original record was over 18 months old at the time the petitioner filed his petition for review. 79 M.S.P.R. at 400-01. Given the lengthy delay between the discovery of the evidence and the filing of the petition for review, which implied a lack of diligence on the part of the petitioner, it was clearly appropriate for the MSPB to inquire whether it would be worthwhile to consider the new evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, though, we are not convinced that the record demonstrates a similar lack of diligence on Armstrong's part. Armstrong alleges that the first time he learned of the allegedly improper contacts between TIGTA and USDA personnel was when TIGTA produced its investigators' reports during discovery in the Privacy Act suit. These were produced on May 9, 2008. Given that the MSPB found that Armstrong's effective petition filing date was May 28, 2008, an alleged discovery date of May 9 suggests that Armstrong tried to bring the newly discovered evidence to the MSPB's attention promptly. This prompt reaction to evidence tending to show that the settlement agreement may have been procured through fraud should not be subject to the same narrow standard as the dilatory reaction to similar evidence in <span class="Italic">De La Gal.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor is the situation here similar to that in <span class="Italic">Jones.</span> In that case, the petitioner had explicitly waived his argument that the settlement agreement was invalid, and the MSPB held that, despite new evidence tending to support that theory, the argument could not be raised after it had been waived. 69 M.S.P.R. at 26-27. Here, though, Armstrong never departed from his argument that the new evidence showed that the settlement agreement had been procured through fraud and should be considered void <span class="Italic">ab initio</span>, even though he also made the alternative argument that TIGTA had breached the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a petitioner delays before filing a petition for review, as in <span class="Italic">De La Gal,</span> or when a petitioner presents new evidence supporting a theory that he previously waived, as in <span class="Italic">Jones,</span> justice may require waiving the timeliness requirement only when the new evidence is likely to change the result originally reached. But where neither of these circumstances applies, as here, we do not believe the timeliness requirement needs to be so stringently applied. It may be that Armstrong's new evidence will not change the outcome; we express no opinion on whether this is so. But whether it changes the result or not has no bearing on whether Armstrong was diligent in filing his petition after discovering the new evidence. Because the MSPB improperly conflated the issue of whether Armstrong should prevail on the merits of his petition with the issue of whether his petition was timely filed, we vacate the MSPB's decision and remand for further proceedings. On remand, the MSPB should conduct whatever proceedings are necessary to determine when Armstrong actually learned of the existence of the new evidence he presents in support of the theory that the settlement agreement was procured through fraud. If the delay between his learning of the existence of this evidence and his filing his petition for review does not indicate a lack of diligence, as Armstrong alleges, then the MSPB should waive the timeliness requirement. At that point, the MSPB may conduct whatever proceedings are necessary to determine the merits of Armstrong's claim.</p>

Dept. of Air Force</span>, 83 MSPR 277, 280-81 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-9 (1999) (belated PFR was accepted on the basis of new evidence, developed during enforcement proceedings, showing that settlement was unenforceable because the appellant did not meet statutory requirements for an immediate regular retirement annuity called for by the agreement). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Graves v.

<p class="Body-Text">At times the Board modifies its relatively rigid rules concerning "new" evidence. One case found the Board considering, during adjudication of a PFR, a court document that suggested the appellant might not have been mentally competent to conduct his case at the regional level. The document was available at the time of regional adjudication. In the interest of "equity and fairness," the Board remanded the case to the region to ensure that the appellant had an opportunity to request a hearing and submit evidence concerning the charge against him. <span class="Italic">Daggett v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 304, 306-07 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Meyer v. OPM</span>, 223 Fed. Appx. 982, 984 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (criticizing the Board for inexplicably failing to recognize the significance in a disability retirement case of medical evidence of mental impairment filed with a PFR by an appellant who was <span class="Italic">pro se</span> before the regional office and who asserted that his mental condition left him unable to deal with the process). Another decision excused belated submissions pertaining to the timeliness of an appeal. Evidence of "diminished mental capacity" and use of medication leading to mental confusion caused the appellant to be unable to understand the importance of submitting evidence to support her assertions. Her failure to submit the evidence in response to the AJ's acknowledgment order resulted from excusable neglect. <span class="Italic">Blaine v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 449, 451-52 (1993). The Board's reviewing court declared that "an attack on the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of a settlement agreement, based on an assertion of mental incompetence, is not necessarily required to be made during the period between entry of the agreement into the record and the time to appeal from that entry." <span class="Italic">Hardy v. USPS</span>, 76 F.3d 366, 368 (Fed. Cir. 1996).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is another, somewhat practical exception to the usual rule: the Board will consider on PFR evidence and argument offered by an intervenor who was not a party to the earlier Board proceedings. <span class="Italic">Quittley v. USPS</span>, 54 MSPR 70, 71 n.1 (1992). Another practical exception allows for the submission of evidence for the first time with a PFR if the AJ incorrectly advised the appellant that the evidence was not relevant or the AJ failed properly to identify issues, particularly those of jurisdictional significance. If the evidence supplied with the PFR is not in dispute, the Board may then consider it in the disposition of the appeal; if it is disputed, a remand to the AJ is likely. The Board may consider evidence first offered with a PFR if it essentially constitutes rebuttal evidence that the AJ foreclosed by improperly closing the record, particularly in appeals decided without a hearing, without providing an opportunity to file evidence responsive to evidence initially filed on the date of the closing of the record before the AJ.

<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's argument was rejected that evidence should be accepted with a PFR because the appellant had not timely received the acknowledgment order.

Further, as noted by the agency in its response to the appellant's petition for review, there is no indication that the acknowledgment order was returned to the regional office as undeliverable to the appellant based on the minor error in the street address. Moreover, as also noted in the agency's response to the petition, the agency response file, which was served on the appellant at his correct address, referenced the May 24, 2011 acknowledgment order, and stated that it was submitted in response to the order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant asserts several times throughout his petition for review that he was unable to submit additional documents and evidence because he did not receive the May 24, 2011 acknowledgment order, the appellant fails to submit any additional documents with his petition for review. However, in support of his marital status discrimination claim, the appellant asserts for the first time in his petition for review that in July 2010 his "single female supervisor said...that she was not aware that [the appellant] was married" and that "she was looking to fill the position of her subordinate with a single person." He further asserts that, in December 2010 following a visit to the office by his wife and baby, his supervisor commented that now not only was the appellant "married but married with children and getting further away from being single."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant seems to imply that he would have made this assertion below if he had received the May 24, 2011 acknowledgment order. Particularly in light of the detailed assertions and examples of alleged marital status discrimination described by the appellant in his initial filing with the Board, the appellant has failed to explain how his assertion regarding his supervisor's alleged comments, which coincidentally have a much stronger relationship to the essence of the appellant's marital status, was at all dependent on his receipt of the May 24, 2011 acknowledgment order. Accordingly, the appellant's assertion regarding his supervisor's statements constitutes new evidence on review, and the appellant's assertion that he did not receive the May 24, 2011 acknowledgment order is not sufficient to show that such evidence was unavailable before the record closed below. <span class="Italic">See Avansino v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 3 M.S.P.R. 211, 214 (1980) (under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, the Board will not consider evidence submitted for the first time with the petition for review absent a showing that it was unavailable before the record was closed despite the party's due diligence). Accordingly, we have not considered it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board is presented with a PFR accompanied by evidence that is not "new," the Board will explain that the evidence is not being considered. A party opposing the PFR may move to strike the new evidence. If the Board agrees with the party's position, the motion is granted. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Colleran v. USPS</span>, SF-0752-09-0285-B-1 (Nonprecedential 9/24/2010) ("These arguments are extensions of the appellant's arguments in his petition for review and on remanded appeal. Consequently, we grant the agency's motion to strike under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.115, which provides that after the record closes on review, no additional evidence or argument will be accepted unless the party submitting it shows that the evidence was not readily available before it closed."); <span class="Italic">Siler v. USPS</span>, 76 MSPR 10, 13 (1997) ("The appellant has not argued, let alone shown, that these documents, all of which predate the close of the petition-for-review record by almost a month, were unavailable before the record closed despite his due diligence. Thus, we grant the agency's motion to strike the reply, and we have not considered it. <span class="Italic">See Moran v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 77, 82 n.* (1994).").</p>
