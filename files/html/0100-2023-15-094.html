<h4 class="h4" id="sec8-94"><span class="space">5.</span> Lack of Suitability for Continued Employment</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Suitability determinations, [discussed under "<a href="0100-2023-08-390.html#sec1-383">Suitability Determination</a>" in Chapter 1], are ordinarily considered as to applicants for federal jobs or individuals serving in their first year of federal employment, with some cases involving fraud in the application process brought by OPM later in an employee's career. An agency is not precluded, however, from applying Chapter 75 adverse action procedures to nonprobationary employees who are charged with conduct that makes them unsuitable for their federal employment. The charge will depend on the supporting specifications, the proof of the charges, nexus, and penalty determinations; in short, the appeal is still resolved under the "efficiency of the service" standard applied in adverse actions. If the charge asserts that the employee is unsuitable for employment, rather than being based on specific misconduct leading to the conclusion that the employee is not suitable for continued employment, matters become more complex, requiring an analysis of who is initiating the action (the agency or OPM), why the action is being initiated (specific misconduct or suitability), and with what result (removal from employment or removal couple with a bar to reemployment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Tom v. Dept. of Interior</span>, 97 MSPR 395, 403-12 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 13-16, 21-22, 24, 38-41 (2004), analyzed an adverse action under then-applicable OPM suitability grounds. The case involved removal of a supervisory accountant for misuse of a government credit card:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although not squarely raised by either party, we note that the AJ adjudicated this case as an adverse action under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75 taken for reasons of suitability, not as a suitability case directly appealable under 5 C.F.R. part 731. A review of our case law reveals a dearth of precedent indicating how cases such as these are to be handled. Our review of the record indicates that this is not a part 731 suitability case. It is a chapter 75 adverse action based on a charge of unsuitability, and chapter 75 procedures, not part 731 procedures, apply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Part 731 is designed to "establish criteria and procedures for making determinations of suitability for employment in positions in the competitive service and for career appointment in the career Senior Executive Service." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(a). OPM has delegated to agencies the authority to make suitability determinations in cases involving "applicants"[1] and "appointees"[2] except in cases involving "evidence of material, intentional false statement or deception or fraud in examination or appointment" (which we will refer to as the fraud exception for simplicity's sake). 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.103(a). OPM's regulations provide that OPM may take a part 731 suitability action against an applicant or appointee based on any permitted reason, and agencies may take part 731 suitability actions against an applicant or appointee for any reason other than the fraud exception noted above. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 731.105(a) &#x0026; (b). Agencies must refer cases involving the fraud exception to OPM or seek prior approval from OPM if they intend to resolve the matter by taking a chapter 75 adverse action or terminating a probationary employee under 5 C.F.R. part 315.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;An "applicant" is a "person being considered for employment." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;An "appointee" is a "person who has entered on duty and is in the first year of a subject to investigation appointment" under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.104. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.101(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases concerning "employees" as opposed to "applicants" or "appointees," only OPM may take a part 731 suitability action, and only in cases involving the fraud exception. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.105(c). Agencies are not permitted to take part 731 suitability actions against employees under any circumstances. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.105(d). However, the regulations explicitly state:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Nothing in this part precludes, or is intended to preclude, an agency from taking an adverse action against an employee under the procedures and standards of part 752 of this title or terminating a probationary employee under the procedures of part 315 of this title.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id.</span> In other words, while OPM can take a part 731 suitability action against an employee under the fraud exception, agencies with concerns about an employee's suitability for reasons not covered under the fraud exception cannot take a suitability action under part 731, but they may take an adverse action based on a charge of unsuitability under chapter 75 subject to chapter 75 procedures and standards of proof. In such a case, the agency is not taking an action under authority delegated by OPM pursuant to part 731, but under its own independent statutory authority pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513. <span class="Italic">Cf. Seigla v. Smithsonian Institution</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 55, 57-58 (1994) (although the agency lacked delegated authority to remove the appellant based on its own suitability determination, it could nonetheless take an adverse action against the appellant based on the misconduct on which the suitability determination was based).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, there is no question that the appellant is an "employee" and not an "applicant" or "appointee." Therefore, action against the appellant based on a negative suitability determination can only be taken pursuant to chapter 75, as the agency did here. Thus, the AJ correctly adjudicated this case as a chapter 75 adverse action appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The factual narrative underlying the charge of unsuitability indicates that the agency determined that the appellant was unsuitable for employment as a Realty Specialist for six reasons: (1) Fifteen unauthorized ATM withdrawals using her Government credit card; (2) five instances of unauthorized personal use of her Government credit card while on sick or annual leave; (3) two instances of unauthorized personal use of her Government credit card in which the appellant charged hotel expenses to her Government credit card while on sick or annual leave; (4) unauthorized use of her Government credit card to purchase gasoline for her personal vehicle when those charges should have been billed to a centralized account, and then claiming reimbursement for mileage on a travel voucher for that same trip; (5) a pattern of non-payment of the balance on her Government credit card; and (6) unauthorized use of her secretary's Government credit card to pay her Government cell phone bill.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although this case was properly taken under 5 U.S.C. Chapter 75 procedures, the agency correctly applies the suitability standards set forth by OPM in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b) and in Departmental Manual, part 441, chapter 5 (441 DM 5.3), in determining whether an employee is suitable for continued employment. OPM's suitability regulations provide that, among the factors that may be considered a basis for finding an employee unsuitable are, as relevant in this case, misconduct or negligence in employment. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.202(b)(1). The agency's suitability standards are similar but contain more detail. As relevant here, the agency may consider "misconduct or negligence in prior employment which would have a bearing on efficient service in the position in question, or would interfere with or prevent effective performance by the employing agency of its duties and responsibilities." The agency's standards further explain that the misconduct or negligence "[m]ay or may not have resulted in dismissal from employment. If dismissal resulted, primary emphasis should be placed on the act or conduct which prompted the dismissal rather than on the mere fact of dismissal." Therefore, in order to prevail on a charge of unsuitability based on the proven acts of misconduct noted above, the agency must show by a preponderance of the evidence that its determination was made for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 731.201. We find that the agency has met this burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, contrary to the AJ, that these violations were more than mere "technical violations" and that they do cast doubt on the appellant's reliability....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, therefore, we find that the agency proved that the appellant committed the credit card misuse described in the narrative discussion of the charge of unsuitability. We also find that this misconduct occurred while the appellant had responsibility for the Navajo Region's Government credit card program. She was well aware of the rules for appropriate credit card use. Her misconduct directly impacted on the duties and responsibilities of her position and, most important, the misconduct directly impugns her honesty and reliability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is not disputed that the appellant's Realty Specialist position was properly designated as a High Risk position in 1999, well before the appellant occupied it. One of the reasons for this high-risk designation was that the Realty Specialist position involved access to the agency's information technology systems and to individual Indian and tribal trust account information. In fact, the appellant's position directly involved the administration of real property belonging to Indian and tribal clients. The agency has designated the appellant's position as containing the highest degree of risk factors in four out of five categories, degree of public trust, importance to program, program authority level, and supervision received, and the second-highest degree of risk factors in the category <span id="Page_2589"></span>of fiduciary responsibility. As the agency notes, it is currently involved in highly-publicized, contentious litigation over its management of Indian Trust accounts which has resulted in the current and former Secretary of the Interior and a former Secretary of the Treasury being held in contempt by a United States District Court judge.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's judgment in this matter is not entitled to deference; it must prove its negative suitability finding by preponderant evidence. Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the agency has met its burden. Simply put, we see no basis in the record for disagreeing with the agency's judgment in determining that the appellant's misconduct raises a sufficient question as to her reliability such that the finding of unsuitability promotes the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching this conclusion, we note that the AJ adjudicated this case by considering each allegation of wrongdoing and the appellant's explanation for it and determining, for each independent allegation, whether that allegation, if proven, was serious enough to warrant a finding that the appellant is unsuitable for continued employment in her Realty Specialist position. This mode of analysis was not appropriate under the circumstances of this case. Even if, in the AJ's view, the acts of misconduct were individually not serious enough to warrant a finding of unsuitability, the AJ should have considered whether the proven misconduct, <span class="Italic">taken as a whole</span>, was preponderant evidence in support of the agency's charge of unsuitability. A series of relatively minor acts, considered together, could constitute a pattern of misconduct that raises a serious concern as to an individual's suitability. The better course is to consider the entire universe of proven misconduct, not individual acts, and determine whether the misconduct as a whole warrants a finding of unsuitability.</p>
