<h4 class="h4" id="sec6-14"><span class="space">7.</span> Notice of Work and Shift Change; Change Made to Avoid Salary Costs</h4>
<p class="noindent">Under 5 USC 6101(a)(3)(A) and with the qualifications and conditions stated in 5 CFR 610.121(a)(1) (2022), an agency may make changes in an employee's tour of duty as long as it provides a minimum of seven days' notice. An agency may make changes in work schedules within the required seven-day notice period if the agency would otherwise be impaired in carrying out its mission or if costs would be substantially increased. <span class="Italic">FOP Lodge 1F and VAMC, Providence, R.I.</span>, 32 FLRA 944, 950 (1988) (relying on <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 and Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB</span>, 23 FLRA 753 (1986)). <span class="Italic">FOP</span> dismissed as nonnegotiable a requirement, Proposal 3, that changes to an officer's regular workweek or tour of duty were not to be made to accommodate court appearances without advance agreement between the employee and the employer.</p>
<p class="noindent">If a proposal concerning advance notice of shift and work changes does not substantially limit management's actions, the proposal is likely negotiable. A proposal was negotiable that "[a]s soon as possible, Management will give employees advance written notice before changing tours or shifts, except for emergency or unforeseen situations," <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 642 and BLM, Lakeview Dist. Office</span>, 27 FLRA 862, 864 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency essentially argues that Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable because the requirement for written notice and the requirement that written notice be given except in "emergency or unforeseen situations" are inconsistent with applicable law and regulation. We disagree.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We have interpreted 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 to provide that employees must have a minimum of 7 days' advance notice of a change in work schedules except where it is determined that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 1546 and Department of the Army, Sharpe Army Depot, Lathrop, California</span>, 25 FLRA No. 78 (1987); <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23 and Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 23 FLRA No. 97 (1986) (Proposal 1). In those cases, we found that proposals which set exceptions to notice periods which are narrower than the statutory and regulatory exceptions were nonnegotiable because they would impermissibly restrict the Agency's right, under law and regulation, to revise employee work schedules.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Neither 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 nor 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121 prescribes the form in which management must inform an employee of a change in work schedules. Therefore, the requirement that notice of schedule changes must be written rather than oral is not inconsistent with law or regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In claiming that Proposal 2 is inconsistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121, the Agency has misinterpreted the proposal. Proposal 2 does not restrict the Agency's ability to change employee work schedules without 7 days' advance notice where it determines that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased. The proposal, unlike the statutory and regulatory provisions, does not establish a minimum time period for advance notice. It simply requires management to notify employees "[a]s soon as possible[.]" Under the proposal, therefore, management may change employee work schedules at any time or for any reason. The proposal requires only that whenever the Agency changes schedules, and for whatever reason, employees be notified in writing, unless the change is necessitated by an emergency or unforeseen circumstances. In those situations, verbal notice followed by written confirmation would be sufficient.</p>
<p class="noindent">Negotiability problems occur when the contract provision impairs management's ability to change work schedules or shifts on very short or no notice. A shift change notice proposal was negotiable in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1799 and Army, Aberdeen Proving Ground</span>, 26 FLRA 926, 926-28 (1987), clarifying the law by interpreting the proposal that "[w]hen a change in established tours of duty is required, the employer will normally notify the employee or employees at least one administrative work week in advance. The revised tour of duty will continue over a period of not less than one basic work week":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Provision 1 is within the duty to bargain.&#x2003;It does not impermissibly restrict the Agency's right, under statutory and regulatory authority, to revise an employee's tour of duty.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23 and Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois</span>, 23 FLRA No. 97 (1986) [<span class="Italic">post</span>], we held that proposal 1, which required the agency to give 14 days' notice before changing work schedules, except in emergencies, was outside the duty to bargain. Specifically, we reconsidered the rationale for our decision in <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span> [<span class="Italic">post</span>] and concluded that it should no longer be followed. We found that under applicable law and regulation, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a), employees must have a minimum 7-day notice of a change in work schedule except where: (1) the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions, or (2) costs would be substantially increased. Because proposal 1 in that case restricted the Agency's ability to revise work schedules, within the 7-day notice period, to emergencies, it was narrower than <span id="page_620"></span>the exceptions permitted under the statutory framework and, therefore, inconsistent with law and regulation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The present provision, unlike <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span>, does not restrict the Agency's ability to revise a tour of duty within the minimum 7-day notice period to specific circumstances, for example, in emergencies. In our view, the phrase "normal conditions" in provision 1 simply means a work situation where the two exceptional circumstances stated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) do not exist. Thus, under such "normal conditions," the 7-day notice period required by applicable law would apply. Accordingly, the Agency has not established that provision 1 is inconsistent with law and regulation. Rather, the provision simply reflects the minimum notice period required in the absence of the statutory and regulatory exceptions to the notice period.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The absence of restrictions on the Agency's ability to revise tours of duty distinguishes provision 1 from provisions 2 and 3 in <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees Local 2182, AFL-CIO and Propulsion Laboratory U.S. Army Research and Technology Laboratories</span>, 26 No. 74 slip op. at 4-5 (1987). In that case, provisions 2 and 3--which required two weeks notice before changing tours of duty unless the change was for voluntary or emergency reasons--were found to be outside the duty to bargain because those restrictions were narrower than the exceptions permitted under the statutory framework. In contrast, provision 1 contains no such restrictions.</p>

<p class="noindent">OPM's regulation at 5 CFR 610.121 (1984) required management to change work schedules as necessary and to notify employees of the change. For a synopsis of the evolution of the law concerning the negotiability of work schedule policies, review <span class="Italic">Nat'l Weather Serv. Employees Org. and Dept. of Commerce, NOAA, Nat'l Weather Serv.</span>, 38 FLRA 369, 376-81 (1990).</p>
<p class="noindent">Doctrinal confusion concerning negotiability of notice of shift changes started with <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2484 and Army Garrison, Ft. Detrick</span>, 17 FLRA 769 (1985). The proposal was that employees would be given two-weeks written notice of changes in their tours of duty. FLRA rejected negotiability of the proposal, because it would require two weeks of advance notice before a change could be made in the workweek, leaving the proposal contrary to government-wide regulation. AFGE carried <span class="Italic">Ft. Detrick</span> to court. Pending appeal, FLRA decided <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 and Dept. of Air Force, Scott AFB</span>, 23 FLRA 753, 755-57 (1986). FLRA reconsidered its position, determining a proposal nonnegotiable that sought two weeks of advance notice, emergencies excepted, of changes in duty hours, days, or weeks currently in effect. Although the result was the same, the reasoning was different, leading to the possibility that other proposals, with different language, could be negotiable:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applicable law, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A), provides that an agency shall schedule employees' tours of duty not less than seven days in advance, except where it is determined that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased.... [I]n the <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span> decision, the Authority interpreted OPM regulations implementing that provision--in particular, 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b)(2)--as requiring an agency to change employee work schedules as soon as it became aware that such a change would be necessary. Upon further review, we conclude that this interpretation does not comport with the statutory requirement that work schedules may be revised less than seven days in advance only where it is necessary to prevent the agency from being handicapped in the execution of its functions or to forestall a substantial increase in operational costs. In other words, interpreting 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(b) consistent with 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a), employees must have a minimum of seven days advance notice of a change in work schedules unless the change is being made for the reasons set forth in the statute (and repeated in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal at issue here, which would permit the Agency to change employee work schedules within the fourteen day notice period only in an emergency, is inconsistent with the statutory and regulatory provisions. We note at the outset that the proposal allows the Agency to change employee work schedules without notice in an "emergency," without defining that term, and thus is consistent with management's right to take action in an emergency under section 7106(a)(2)(D).... However, the exception to the notice period set forth in the proposal is too narrow. The terms defining the statutory (5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A)) and regulatory (5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a)) exceptions are broader than the term "emergency" used in the proposal. Situations falling within the scope of the statute and regulations--circumstances which would seriously handicap an agency in accomplishing its functions or would substantially increase costs--would not necessarily constitute "emergencies" as defined by the Agency pursuant to its right under section 7106(a)(2)(D). The exception set forth in the proposal therefore would impermissibly restrict the Agency's right, under law and regulation, to revise employee work schedules....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Although we are no longer following the rationale of the <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span> decision, the result in that case, or in cases which relied on <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span> and involved similarly worded proposals or provisions, would not be different from the result here. Because the provision in <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span>, like the proposal here, limited the agency's right to change employee work schedules to situations constituting an "emergency," it would also be inconsistent with law and regulation for the reasons stated above and outside the duty to bargain.</p>
<p class="noindent">Having decided <span class="Italic">NAGE Local R7-23 and Scott AFB</span>, the Authority recalled <span class="Italic">Ft. Detrick</span> and issued a remand decision in <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2484 and Ft. Detrick</span>, 25 FLRA 908, 910-11 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...There is nothing in the express language of either provision or in the record in the case which indicates that the Agency would be permitted to change work schedules without the required notice even in circumstances when the Agency determined that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 610.121(a) were met. That is, even if the Agency determined that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased if it did not change work schedules, for example, to avoid overtime, these provisions preclude such changes. Thus, as these provisions are inconsistent with law and Government-wide regulation, they are outside the duty to bargain under section 7117(a)(1) of the Statute. Since section 7106(b)(2) and (3) apply only when management exercises one of the reserved rights set out elsewhere in section 7106 it is unnecessary for us to address the Union's claim that the provisions constitute "procedures" or "appropriate arrangements."...</p>
<p class="noindent">If a schedule, once set, can be modified under abnormal, unusual, or unforeseen circumstances, then the proposal is sufficiently broad to include circumstances that would seriously impair the agency in carrying out its functions or that would impose substantially increased costs. The proposal is then negotiable. Management must be able to maintain that flexibility. A proposal that requires at least 24 hours' notice of a change in schedule is nonnegotiable if the proposal precludes the change when management would face substantially increased costs or the agency would be seriously disabled in carrying out its functions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 3157 and USDA, Fed. Grain Inspection Serv.</span>, 44 FLRA 1570, 1587-88, 1599-01 (1992) (Proposal 2) (but determining negotiable Proposal 6, that basic workweek assignments be scheduled at least 10 days in advance, cover periods of at least 28 days, and include location and assigned duty point; management was given flexibility to alter arrangements in other than normal circumstances).</p>
<p class="noindent">Other factors, e.g., concerns about internal security practices, may impact proposals for notice of work assignments or changes in assignments. <span class="Italic">NFFE Local 2058 and Dept. of Army, Aberdeen Proving Ground Support Activity</span>, 38 FLRA 1389, 1399 (1991) (Proposal 2), involved a provision that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Normally schedules reflecting employees' post and patrol assignments will be posted on applicable official bulletin boards seven (7) days in advance prior to the administrative workweek. Whenever management knows in advance that work requirements will differ in the next week from those required in the current workweek, management will make the schedule changes and inform the employees prior to the beginning of the administrative workweek of those changes. Only in the case of an unforeseen emergency will management deviate from this requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="Italic">Aberdeen Proving Ground</span> proposal was partially negotiable, 38 FLRA at 1401-07:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that the first sentence of Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable and that the remaining portion of Proposal 2 constitutes a negotiable appropriate arrangement under section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An agency's right to determine its internal security practices under section 7106(a)(1) of the Statute includes the right to determine the policies and practices which are part of its plan to secure or safeguard its personnel, physical property, and operations against internal and external risks.... Where an agency shows a link or reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding personnel or property and protecting its operations and its practice or decision designed to implement that goal, a Proposal which directly interferes with or negates the agency's practice or decision conflicts with the agency's right under section 7106(a)(1)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A proposal that negates an agency's plan to protect against the unauthorized removal of agency property interferes with the agency's section 7106(a)(1) right to determine its internal security practices....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Proposal 2 requires the Agency, absent an unforeseen emergency, to notify the employees of their post and patrol assignments 7 days in advance and to notify employees of any change in their work requirements prior to the beginning of the administrative workweek. The Agency argues that its policy of providing no advance notice of posts, partners, and patrols is a precautionary security measure designed "to safeguard the installation and its employees."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency has determined that advance notice would provide "guards with the opportunity to plan for the access to secured or restricted areas for non-authorized personnel" and that its current policy <span id="page_621"></span>precludes "guards from participating or colluding with other guards in activities which could compromise the security of [Aberdeen Proving Ground]." To support this argument, the Agency provides evidence showing that two guards were recently removed from the Federal service for the "unauthorized removal and possession of Government property." According to the Agency, "the advance notification of partner assignments and posts allowed these guards to plan this theft." Therefore, the Agency contends that the Union's proposal requiring such advance notice interferes with its right to determine its internal security practices.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find that the Agency's policy of providing no advance notice of partner assignments and specific patrol and post locations is linked to its stated purpose of safeguarding the property and operations of the installation and its employees. That is, the decision to provide no advance notice of partner and patrol assignments is designed to reduce the risk of the theft of Agency property by employees. By requiring the Agency to notify employees in advance of their post and patrol assignments and that work requirements will differ from the previous week, Proposal 2 directly interferes with the Agency's security plan. Therefore, Proposal 2 is inconsistent with the Agency's...right to determine its internal security practices....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that the Agency "offers no evidence or any other proof" that "advance notification of posts allowed [the] guards to plan [their] theft[.]" To the extent that the Union argues that the Agency has not shown a link because it has not offered such factual proof, we reject that argument. In establishing a link, the Authority requires an agency to show a reasonable connection between its goal of safeguarding personnel or property and its practice designed to implement that goal, rather than factual proof that the danger or risk has occurred....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union's argument may also be construed to address the merits of the Agency's security plan, specifically, that providing no advance notice of work locations and assignments would not necessarily prevent thefts. However, where, as here, a link has been established between an agency's plan and its expressed security concerns, the Authority will not review the merits of the agency's plan in the course of resolving a negotiability dispute....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union contends that Proposal 2 constitutes an appropriate arrangement within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3) of the Statute. To determine whether the proposal constitutes an appropriate arrangement, we must determine whether the proposal is: (1) intended to be an arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of management rights and (2) appropriate because it does not excessively interfere with the exercise of management's right....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union states that Proposal 2 is intended to allow employees "to plan for assignments that separate them from food and drinking water and expose them to serious environmental hazards." We conclude that the proposal is intended to address the adverse effects of the internal security practice that the Agency has used at its facilities and, therefore, that it is an "arrangement" within the meaning of section 7106(b)(3).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The next question is whether Proposal 2 excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices so as not to constitute an "appropriate" arrangement. To determine whether a proposal "excessively interferes" with a management right, we weigh "the competing practical needs of employees and managers" to determine whether the benefit to employees afforded by the proposal is greater than the burden placed by the proposal on the exercise of the management right or rights involved....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency contends that Proposal 2 is not an appropriate arrangement because it prevents the Agency from implementing an "integral aspect" of its internal security program. By prohibiting the Agency from issuing post, patrol, or partner assignments without advance notice, the Agency argues, the proposal excessively interferes with its right to determine its internal security practices and, therefore, is not an appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...The Union concludes that by improving morale and reducing leave usage, the proposal would have a positive effect on the effective and efficient operations of the Government. The Union cites specific instances where food and clean water have not been readily available or where employees assigned to wooded posts subsequently contracted lyme disease. The Agency did not refute the Union's claims.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[T]o the extent that Proposal 2 requires the Agency to notify employees of their partners in advance, it is not an appropriate arrangement. Advance notification of partners would not serve the Union's interest in preparing employees for adverse working conditions and, therefore, does not provide a benefit that offsets the burden on the Agency's security plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also find that the proposal's requirement that employees be notified of their post and patrol assignments 7 days in advance does not offset the burden it places on the Agency's security plan.... [T]he Union has not established that employees need to be notified 7 days in advance to enable them "to plan for assignments that separate them from food and drinking water and expose them to serious environmental hazards."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, to the extent that the proposal requires the Agency to notify employees of their partner assignments in advance, it excessively interferes with the Agency's right to determine its internal security practices. Further, because the first sentence of Proposal 2 requires the Agency to notify employees of their post and patrol assignments 7 days in advance, it does not provide a benefit that offsets the burden on the Agency's security plan, and, therefore, is not an appropriate arrangement. Consequently, we find that the first sentence of Proposal 2 is nonnegotiable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As to the second sentence of the proposal, the Agency has not alleged or shown that advance notice of "work requirements" would result in the same risk of collusion or theft. For the following reasons, we find that the second sentence of Proposal 2 is a negotiable appropriate arrangement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Notifying employees in advance of changes in their "work requirements" would require only that the Agency tell employees whether they should bring warm clothes, food and water, or insect repellent. Interpreted in this manner, the proposal would not require the Agency to divulge specific work locations, but would merely require the Agency to notify employees of what they should bring to work. The Union states that there are "twelve different posts...in many different areas throughout the sprawling Aberdeen Proving Ground area." The Agency has not alleged or shown that providing employees with general information of what they will require at work would negate its security plan.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also note that the third sentence of Proposal 2 allows the Agency to deviate from the requirements of the first and second sentences of the proposal if there is an unforeseen emergency.&#x2003;We find that this exception does not sufficiently decrease the burden on the Agency's security plan so as to alter our conclusion that the first sentence of Proposal 2 is not an appropriate arrangement, nor does it affect our conclusion that the second sentence of Proposal 2 is an appropriate arrangement. In our view, the third sentence of Proposal 2 is negotiable insofar as it relates to the second sentence of the proposal.</p>
<p class="noindent">Nonnegotiable was a proposal that precluded the agency from changing working schedules without substantial and reasonable considerations, when the proposal also prohibited the agency from changing work schedules to avoid payment of overtime, even if the agency determined that it would be seriously obstructed in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased if it did not change work schedules to avoid overtime, <span class="Italic">Tidewater Va. FEMTC and Dept. of Navy, Navy Pub. Works Ctr., Norfolk</span>, 25 FLRA 3, 5-7 (1987):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We recently reconsidered the basis of the <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick</span> decision in <span class="Italic">National Association of Government Employees, Local R7-23 and Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois,</span> 23 FLRA No. 97 (9186). As we stated in <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base,</span> 5 U.S.C. Section 6101(a)(3)(A), provides that an agency shall schedule employees' tours of duty not less than seven days in advance, except where it is determined that the agency would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased. 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(a)(1) implements that statutory provision and contains essentially the same language. In <span class="Italic">Fort Detrick,</span> the Authority interpreted 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(b)(2) as requiring an agency to change employee work schedules as soon as it became aware that such a change would be necessary. Upon further review, we concluded in <span class="Italic">Scott Air Force Base</span> that this interpretation does not fully take into account the statutory requirement that work schedules may be revised less than seven days in advance <span class="Italic">only</span> where it is necessary to prevent the agency from being handicapped in the execution of its functions or to forestall a substantial increase in operational costs. In other words, interpreting 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(b) consistent with 5 U.S.C. Section 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(a), employees must have a minimum of seven days advance notice of a change in work schedules unless the change is being made for reasons set forth in 5 U.S.C. Section 6101(a)(3)(A) (and repeated in 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(a)).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The proposal in this case permits work schedules to be changed when the change is based on "substantial and reasonable considerations." The Union contends that this phrase is consistent with the criterion established in 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(a). That is, the Union argues that under this proposal the Agency could change work schedules if it determined it would otherwise be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or would incur a substantial increase in costs. We find, however, that the Union's claim that the proposal permits the Agency to change work schedules if there are "substantial and reasonable considerations" cannot be sustained. This proposal expressly provides that "in no instance shall (the Agency change work schedules) with the intent of avoiding the payment of overtime." Thus, the proposal prevents the Agency from changing work schedules to avoid the payment of overtime even in circumstances when the Agency determines that the requirements of 5 U.S.C. Section 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 C.F.R. Section 610.121(a) are met. That is, even if the Agency determines that it would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would <span id="page_622"></span>be substantially increased if it does not change work schedules to avoid overtime, this proposal precludes such changes. Finally, we also find no merit in the Union's apparent contention that the proposal merely assures that employees who work more than a 40 hour workweek are paid overtime under applicable laws and regulations. There is nothing in the language of this proposal which concerns such a requirement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 85 and VAMC, Leavenworth</span>, 30 FLRA 400, 413 (1987) (Proposal 11 nonnegotiable, calling for agreement that tours of duty shall not be changed solely to avoid overtime pay); <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 2182 and Propulsion Lab., Army Research and Tech.

Nothing limited the agency from rescheduling or assigning holiday work if the agency could not provide 14-days' advance notice. The reference to "the supervisor" was surplusage, for the parties had apparently agreed that the required notice need not be posted by a particular individual. But in that decision Provision 4 was nonnegotiable because it placed two limits on changes of schedules less than 14 days in advance: an unanticipated emergency, or mutual consent of the employee and the agency. The exceptions were too narrow to comply with 5 USC 6101(a)(3)(A) and 5 CFR 610.121(a)(1), allowing an agency to make changes if the agency would otherwise be handicapped in carrying out its mission or if costs would be substantially increased. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 1815 and Army Aviation Ctr., Ft.

<p class="noindent">Another limit on the ability to negotiate for advance, fixed schedules involves the nature of the employees' work. Analogies were drawn to the cases involving shift swaps in <span class="Italic">Illinois Nurses' Ass'n and VAMC, Hines</span>, 28 FLRA 212, 227-28 (1987), determining to be nonnegotiable a proposal that nurses' schedules, once posted, be changed only in emergency:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">VA Medical Center, Ft. Lyons</span>, 25 FLRA No. 66, we noted that the requirements of patient care may vary throughout a day and during a week. The particular tasks to be performed to meet those requirements, therefore, must vary consistent with patient care needs. Because these tasks often involve specialized skills and knowledge of special procedures and techniques not shared by all nurses, we held that proposals which would restrict management's ability to assign nurses to the particular shifts or tours of duty where those particular skills are needed, would directly interfere with management's right to assign work.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...This case therefore, is distinguishable from <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service</span>, 14 FLRA 243 (1984), where the Authority found that a provision which concerned the assignment of employees from the second or third shift to the "prime shift," did not involve different positions or different duties, but only involved employees' performing the duties of their positions during a different shift of work. The Authority held that the provision was negotiable because it solely concerned which employee, among those in the bargaining unit to whom management in its discretion had already assigned the work involved, would be selected to perform such work during a particular shift....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The fact that the proposal would permit management to change nurses' work schedules in an emergency renders the proposal consistent with management's right to take action in an emergency under section 7106(a)(2)(D) of the Statute. The proposal nevertheless directly interferes with management's right to assign work, because it would prohibit management from changing working schedules, once they have been posted, in situations which are not "emergencies."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Additionally, the first paragraph of section 4 is not an "appropriate" arrangement for employees adversely affected by the exercise of a management right. It would prevent management from changing nurses' work schedules in situations which may not be considered "emergencies" and therefore excessively interferes with management's right to assign work so as to meet patient care requirements....</p>
<p class="noindent">Case law precluding negotiability of proposals requiring advance notice of shift changes applies to National Guard employees. The definitions in 5 USC Chapter 61 and, in particular, those of 5 CFR 610.121 (2022) apply to Guardsmen.
