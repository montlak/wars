<h4 class="h4" id="sec7-14"><span class="space">4.</span> Off-Duty Drug Offense</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">Earlier discussed was <span class="Italic">Merritt v. DOJ</span>, 6 MSPR 585, 6 MSPB 493 (1981), involving off-duty use of drugs by a correctional officer. <span class="Italic">Borsari v. FAA</span>, 699 F.2d 106, 111-12 (2d Cir. 1983), <span class="Italic">aff'g Borsari v. FAA</span>, 12 MSPR 265, 269 (1982), involved dismissal of an air traffic controller who sold marijuana to another individual at a bar after work hours. The Board decision first observed that: "[e]very controller must be alert and have clear-headed judgment at all times, and the agency must be able to rely with confidence on the judgment of each of its controllers." The Board next noted that "[w]hen off-duty misconduct of an air traffic controller is at issue, the misconduct must be carefully examined in order to determine whether or not it reflects upon ability of others to trust and rely upon this judgment." The Board concluded that the drug-related misconduct of appellant prevented the agency from possessing the requisite confidence in the appellant's judgment and reliability. From that conclusion, the Board determined that a nexus was established between the appellant's drug-related misconduct and his position. On review, following the Board's affirmation of appellant's removal, the court agreed that if an employee's misconduct is in conflict with the mission of the agency, dismissal without proof of a direct effect on the individual's job performance is permissible under the service efficiency standard. Reasoning that absolute public trust in the work of air traffic controllers is incompatible with any connection to illegal drugs, including a connection extending to possession or sale, not necessarily use, the court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although it may be true that an individual who has sold or possessed drugs is no more likely to have used them, it is reasonable to infer that as a group, individuals possessing drugs are more likely to employ them. Indeed, the class of drug users must, in the nature of the act, be composed entirely of those who have possessed illicit substances....&#8197;"[T]o an employer, there is a greater risk that an employee who has once sold marijuana will use it than in the case of one who has never sold marijuana."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In matters concerning air traffic control, however, any additional risk is unwise and unwarranted. The FAA's decision to eliminate the perceived danger was, therefore, well within its discretion. Indeed, the MSPB's ruling upholding the FAA's action on the basis of Borsari's breach of his co-worker's trust is persuasive precisely because suspicion engendered by Borsari's misconduct would be entirely legitimate. The fact that no employee testified concerning a specific distrust of Borsari cannot diminish the likely impact upon pilots, controllers, and the public at large, possessed of knowledge that an individual dealing in drugs is working in the control tower....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he explicit language of 5 USC 2302(b)(10) permits employers to punish misconduct which will have an adverse effect on "the performance of others." That language is easily susceptible if the interpretation that Congress expressly permitted removal of employees whose actions might disrupt an agency's smooth functioning by creating suspicion, distrust, or a decline in public confidence. <span class="Italic">See Wild v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 692 F.2d 1129 at 1132 (7th Cir. 1982). Petitioner does not point to anything in the legislative history suggesting an employer must demonstrate a specific impact on the performance of a particular individual to justify dismissal, nor do we find support for this proposition in the legislative materials....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The concept of loss of trust and confidence led the Federal Circuit to condemn off-duty drug use by an air traffic controller in <span class="Italic">Stump v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 761 F.2d 680, 681-82 (Fed. Cir. 1985). The employee was found by the Board to have once used cocaine off duty. The incident was reported by the police to the FAA, although no arrest resulted. The court concluded that removal was warranted. Off-duty use of narcotics was prohibited by FAA orders. The table of penalties ranged from a one-day suspension to removal for a first offense. As to nexus, the court essentially permitted a presumption of publicity, "Clearly, the public's awareness of the use of drugs by an air traffic controller, even off-duty use, would detract from its confidence in the agency. While this incident may have received no publicity at the time, disciplinary proceedings are not secret."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Another controller was removed as a result of violation of a rehabilitation agreement calling for no use of drugs in <span class="Italic">Scott v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 45 MSPR 639, 644 (1990). <span class="Italic">See Banks v. FAA</span>, 10 MSPR 3, 8 (1982) (removal of a controller was affirmed following the results of a drug screening). On the basis of assumptions similar to those in <span class="Italic">Stump</span> and <span class="Italic">Borsari</span>, the Board sustained removal of an aircraft mechanic involved in the backyard cultivation and harvesting of marijuana. The nexus determination was based on the employee's need to perform his work with great precision and on the theory that a reasonable inference could be made that the employee might distribute or sell marijuana to agency employees during working hours, an event that an agency already having problems with drug usage need not await. <span class="Italic">Olson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 25 MSPR 97, 100 (1984). Through this type of analysis, the nexus formulation encompasses not only established impact of misconduct, but speculative future impact of that misconduct. On review, <span class="Italic">Olson v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-1926), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[P]etitioner's job as an aircraft mechanic on the test line involved him in critical phases of rebuilding aircraft including the final checking and preparation of aircraft for test flights. In carrying out the agency's mission of repairing naval aircraft, this work must be done with precision and accuracy, since errors could result in the loss or injury to life and property. The record shows that there was known on-the-job drug abuse at the Naval Air Rework Facility at the time petitioner was arrested. We agree with the Board that it was reasonable for the agency to infer that petitioner was likely to distribute or sell marijuana to his co-workers at the...facility, thereby threatening the agency's ability effectively and accurately to repair and test rebuilt aircraft. We agree with the Board that the requisite nexus was established on the facts of this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When evidence of an employee's drug abuse problem was considered along with the importance of an appellant's work in the train movement system, there was direct proof of nexus between off-duty misconduct, involving violation of a rehabilitation program's rules, and service efficiency. The agency established its reasonable concern over performance of the appellant's job to ensure that the movement of trains was safe, timely, and efficient. <span class="Italic">Burkwist v.

<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit reversed the award of an arbitrator who failed to find nexus between a conviction for off-duty possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and termination of a NASA electrician who was responsible in part for the central power plant, the main electrical substation, and the complex housing the Goddard Space Flight Center's spacecraft tracking and data control centers. The court explained in <span class="Italic">Brook v. Corrado</span>, 999 F.2d 523, 527-28 (Fed. Cir. 1993), as it sustained OPM's petition for review, reversed an arbitrator's award, and upheld removal of Mr. Corrado:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 USC 7513(a), NASA must show a connection between the employee's misconduct and the employee's job responsibilities. <span class="Italic">Brown v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 735 F.2d 543, 548 (Fed. Cir. 1984). To make this showing, NASA emphasized the sensitivity of Goddard's mission. Goddard provides tracking and data for operation of the Space Shuttle, Space Station, and satellite systems. This mission relies on a dependable and uninterrupted supply of electricity. In this context, any mistake in judgment by Mr. Corrado could result in the loss of lives or millions of dollars worth of equipment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Against this background, Mr. Corrado's criminal activities pose threats to Goddard's mission. NASA could no longer trust Mr. Corrado implicitly....&#8197;Mr. Corrado's crime casts doubt on his honesty, integrity, and reliability. NASA also has a reasonable interest in preventing the spread of cocaine at critical facilities like Goddard. The nature of the crime indicates a willingness to break the law for personal financial gain.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, Mr. Corrado's conviction also creates a potential embarrassment for NASA. To deserve continued funding and support, the public and their representatives must have the utmost confidence in NASA's competence and reliability. Entrusting to a convicted drug dealer unsupervised control over the entire Goddard electrical system and potential responsibility for the safety of persons and equipment could seriously undermine the public's confidence in the agency's ability to perform its mission. NASA need not wait until Mr. Corrado makes a mistake on the job before removing him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Given the level of trustworthiness required by Mr. Corrado's position and consequences of an error in judgment, the Government showed by a preponderance of the evidence the connection between Mr. Corrado's misconduct and his removal to promote NASA's efficiency. An agency's reasonable loss of trust and confidence sufficiently establishes the necessary nexus. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Sanders v. United States Postal Service</span>, 801 F.2d 1328, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 1986).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A presumption of nexus arises when the employee's misconduct is so <span id="Page_2292"></span>egregious that it "speaks for itself." <span class="Italic">Hayes</span>, 727 F.2d at 1539. This court, including its predecessor, the Court of Claims, has consistently held that involvement in drug trafficking, even when limited to off-duty conduct, is sufficiently "egregious" conduct to warrant a presumption of nexus. <span class="Italic">See Parker v. United States Postal Service</span>, 819 F.2d 1113, 1116 (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Sanders</span>, 801 F.2d at 1330; <span class="Italic">Strothers v. United States</span>, 220 Ct. Cl. 642, 644, 618 F.2d 121 (1979). Although Mr. Corrado's crime occurred off of Goddard's premises, the egregiousness of the crime and the potential effect on safety inherent in Mr. Corrado's position at Goddard warrant a presumption of nexus in this case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Rhoads v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 12 MSPR 115, 117-18 (1982), affirmed dismissal of a GS-11 Criminal Investigator whose principal charged offense was smoking marijuana:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here appellant, a Criminal Investigator, pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana. While employed in that position, the appellant occupied a "high-risk" position of great flexibility and responsibility. In order to function effectively in that capacity, the appellant had to maintain an image of professional trustworthiness, good reputation and moral character. As a part of his job, he was required, when called upon, to testify in court and in grand jury proceedings. Appellant, himself, admits that an arrest record and guilty plea to the possession of marijuana, would not aid his effectiveness as a witness for the government in criminal cases.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The deciding official, in his testimony, summed up the appellant's position very appropriately by stating:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">"All of our enforcement officers are considered high-risk positions. We rely on them. Employees are required to act independently, handle large volumes of money, make large adjustments against tax payers. They are subject to integrity stresses such as bribes which are reported quite frequently. We have to be able to rely upon an employee's veracity and his honesty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In a criminal case and for a revenue agent, a revenue agent is similar to a special agent, he can come before a grand jury, he has to testify on cases which are criminal. We have to rely on the reports which these agents prepare. We have no room to doubt somebody, whether he got in a bind, that they would be honest or not."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellant's veracity and integrity were, thus, necessarily damaged, with a concomitant detrimental effect on his ability to effectively perform the full scope of his duties and on the agency's ability to accomplish its mission through him as its employee and representative. <span class="Italic">Id.; [s]ee also Webb v. Veterans Administration</span>, 8 MSPB 508, 9 MSPR 164 (1981). We find, therefore, that the agency has carried its burden of establishing that appellant's retention would impair the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit sustained removal of a ranger in the Corps of Engineers whose duties included issuing citations to persons found with marijuana on land maintained by the Corps. The ranger was discharged for off-duty contact with marijuana, a result justified because of the appellant's law enforcement position. <span class="Italic">Wilhoit v. Dept. of Army</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-551); <span class="Italic">see Sanders v. USPS</span>, 801 F.2d 1328 (Fed.

United States</span>, 589 F.2d 1048 (Ct. Cl. 1978) (customs control officer removed for off-duty use of marijuana: "we cannot say that the Customs Service has punished an agent too severely when it discharges him for smoking and transporting marijuana, the illegal smuggling of which he is sworn to uncover and prevent"). <span class="Italic">McCauley v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 85-2322), found an adequate nexus between off-duty use of marijuana and removal of a pharmacy aide. The evidence of drug use by the employee destroyed the trust between the employee and her superiors necessary to maintain an efficient working atmosphere in the pharmacy. A VA clerk-typist was properly removed when he was engaged in off-duty distribution and sale of marijuana at a nearby military base. The appellant was distributing drugs to the patient population serviced by the VA medical facility, whose mission included treatment and rehabilitation of veterans for drug addiction. <span class="Italic">See Flores v. VA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1994 NP No. 94-3329).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal of a computer operator was sustained after a conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana. <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 22 MSPR 462, 464-67 (1984). The appellant worked on a system used to trace lost government checks. His position was considered sensitive. A permissible inference of untrustworthiness was drawn. The Board took "administrative notice" that dealers in controlled substances often are subject to demands for money not likely obtainable through lawful commercial channels supporting legitimate enterprises. The Board considered the possibility of blackmail against individuals who lead two lives--one within, one outside, the law. The agency was not required to continue placing trust and reliance in an appellant who voluntarily involved himself in illegal conduct while having access to systems and procedures involving public funds. The agency did not need to await misconduct within the government before removing the employee. Witnesses attesting to the appellant's character were "unaware of the precise nature of appellant's conviction and one witness chose not to believe that appellant engaged in the illegal act." The Board essentially considered irrelevant evidence demonstrating the appellant's excellent work record and evidence challenging the potential lack of public confidence if appellant's acts were publicly known. <span class="Italic">Harrison</span> distinguished <span class="Italic">Fisher v. DHHS</span>, 9 MSPR 2, 8 MSPB 371 (1981), involving a file clerk convicted of distributing LSD off duty. In <span class="Italic">Fisher</span>, the adverse action was based on the apprehension of the appellant's coworkers about his conviction. When the agency failed to present evidence from the coworkers and the agency did not learn of the misconduct until a year after the event, there was no reason for adverse action: there was no present apprehension about the presence of the appellant; the appellant did not occupy a position of trust. Board member Devaney dissented in <span class="Italic">Harrison</span>, arguing that the conviction of a crime does not in itself establish nexus; as to proof of nexus, he noted that the appellant's supervisors observed no change in appellant's good work before and after the conviction. Harrison worked six months after the conviction and prior to the removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Removal was sustained of a city carrier convicted of the not-for-profit accommodation sale of cocaine. The employee was in a position of visibility and responsibility, warranting a finding of nexus. <span class="Italic">Person v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 618, 620 (1984). Nexus sufficiently supported removal of a treasury plate printer working on currency who became involved or intended to become involved in the off-duty sale and distribution of heroin. The off-duty conduct undermined the trust needed in the employee to warrant his retention. <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 25 MSPR 121, 123 (1984), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span>, 785 F.2d 320 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (NP). Involvement with the sale of cocaine, coupled with publicity, established nexus by showing the lack of trustworthiness of a mail handler, <span class="Italic">Johnson v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 254, 256-57 (1985):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Notwithstanding the existence of certain factors which arguably weigh against a finding of nexus in this case, we nevertheless find that appellant's involvement with illegal drugs indicates on his part a lack of trustworthiness incompatible with the objectives and needs of the agency. <span class="Italic">See Harrison v. Department of the Treasury,</span> 22 MSPR 462 (1984). This is particularly true in light of agency regulations governing employee standards of conduct. These regulations (Employee and Labor Relations Manual Part 661.55) provide that illegal use of drugs may be grounds for removal from the Postal Service. We note, moreover, that appellant's misconduct involved not just simple possession but the sale of marijuana and what purported to be cocaine to a confidential informant employed by the Postal Service. Such misconduct seriously undermined the degree of confidence that the agency could place in appellant. <span class="Italic">Jaworski v. Department of the Army</span>, 22 MSPR 499 (1984). Upon consideration of the totality of the evidence, including the extent of the media coverage and the nationwide scope of the agency's investigation into its drug problem, we conclude that the agency has established the required nexus between appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the service....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Even as to a WS-2 Housekeeping Aid Foreman, the Board sustained demotion to Housekeeping Aid for off-duty possession of and intent to sell cocaine. Nexus was established because the appellant occupied a position of trust--he was a supervisor--and the misconduct was "serious and felonious" (the appellant pled guilty to a felony charge). <span class="Italic">Hawkins v. VA</span>, 46 MSPR 484, 487 (1990); <span class="Italic">see Fuentes v. Dept. of Treasury</span> (Fed.

Cir. 1993), for the proposition that the nexus is indisputable between a charge of off-duty possession and use of illegal drugs and service efficiency). But a court suggested an absence of nexus between removal of a warehouse worker and off-duty use of marijuana--at least without some proof that the drug use had some effect on the individual on the job. <span class="Italic">See McLeod v. Dept. of Army</span>, 714 F.2d 918 (9th Cir. 1983) (noting the employee's good record and the lack of publicity of what the court characterized as a minor criminal offense).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Brooks-Hughes v. DOJ</span>, DC-0752-12-0803-I-1 (NP 7/2/2014), upheld removal based on a violation of a rule of the FBI precluding employees from engaging in a social, romantic or intimate relationship or association with a person the employee knew or should have known was involved in criminal activities. The appellant was fired because she was married to, and continued the marriage to, an individual she knew was, according to the case report, a habitual user or marijuana. Nexus was not challenged on PFR.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">With all the foregoing litigation over the effect of off-duty drug use on the continued employability of federal workers, it was no surprise when, in 1987, the Board retreated from its initial position in the <span class="Italic">Merritt</span> case, discussed earlier, that an agency had no reason to discipline employees for very limited use of marijuana off duty. <span class="Italic">Kruger v. DOJ</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 74-77 &#x0026; n.3 (1987). In <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>, the appellants were several correctional officers who smoked some marijuana outside a tavern. As correctional officers, they were responsible for ensuring that inmates did not obtain contraband and for controlling inmates and protecting federal property. Effectively overruling <span class="Italic">Merritt</span>, <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> determined that nexus may be based on off-duty conduct that is contrary to the mission of the appellant's employer:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board generally recognizes three independent means by which an <span id="Page_2293"></span>agency may show a nexus linking an employee's off-duty misconduct with the efficiency of the service: (1) a rebuttable presumption of nexus that may arise in "certain egregious circumstances" based on the nature and gravity of the misconduct; (2) a showing by preponderant evidence that the misconduct affects the employee's or his co-workers' job performance, or management's trust and confidence in the employee's job performance; and (3) a showing by preponderant evidence that the misconduct interfered with or adversely affected the agency's mission....&#8197;Although the Board has not heretofore explicitly recognized that nexus under the third category may be proven by showing that an employee engaged in off-duty misconduct that "is directly opposed to the agency's mission,"...we do so now.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants smoked marijuana outside a local public tavern, and they were observed in their misconduct by at least one co-worker. The position descriptions introduced by the agency and the affidavit of the warden of the correctional institution show that, as correctional officers, appellants have close contact with inmates and that they are responsible for protecting property and inmate safety, enforcing security policies, regulations, and laws (including the laws proscribing narcotics and contraband), and assisting with inmate rehabilitation.[2]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;In <span class="Italic">Merritt,</span> 6 MSPB 493, 6, MSPR 585, the appellant's off-duty use of marijuana occurred in the privacy of his own home rather than, as in the instant case, outside a local public tavern where appellants' misconduct was observed by at least one co-worker. Unlike the situation in the instant case, the agency in <span class="Italic">Merritt,</span> further, did not submit the employee's position description setting forth the duties and responsibilities of the position in order to enable the Board to determine that the performance of such duties and the agency's mission were antithetical to the off-duty use of marijuana. To the extent that the Board's legal analysis of the nexus issue in <span class="Italic">Merritt</span> did not explicitly recognize that nexus may be proven by showing that the employee's off-duty misconduct is antithetical to the agency's performance of its mission, as previously noted, we do so now in the instant case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants' off-duty misconduct could cause the public, and their co-workers, to question whether the drug laws were being properly enforced within the correctional facility. Clearly, the public's awareness of the use of unlawful drugs by correctional officers, even off-duty use, would detract from its confidence in the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, appellants' misconduct draws the quality of the agency's rehabilitative programs into question. Appellants' use of marijuana is antithetical to the agency's law enforcement and rehabilitative programs that they are responsible for monitoring.... We find that such public perceptions of appellants' misconduct would impair the efficiency of the agency by undermining public confidence in it, thereby making it harder for the agency's other workers to perform their jobs effectively, even though the misconduct might not affect appellants' job performance....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Appellants' evidence of satisfactory performance before and after their misconduct and the lack of evidence showing that their misconduct was publicized or a matter of notoriety within the community or their correctional institution, while relevant, do not rebut the inference that arises "from the relation between the misconduct and the agency's mission."... The agency is not required to demonstrate a specific impact on appellants' job performance or service efficiency before taking action.... Proof that the off-duty misconduct conflicted with the agency's mission suffices.... Likewise, when nexus has been established by such proof, there is no need to rely on a presumption.[3]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;To the extent that <span class="Italic">Merritt</span> implied that nexus can <span class="Italic">only</span> be shown by evidence of an actual impairment of service efficiency or by a rebuttable presumption arising from "egregious" conduct, it was in error.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board mitigated the removals to 60-day suspensions in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span>. It said of the President's 1986 initiative against drug use by federal employees (reprinted in Chapter 8, "<a href="0100-2023-15-283.html#sec8-281">Drug and Alcohol Offenses</a>"), 32 MSPR at 77:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under Executive Order 12,564, 51 Fed. Reg. 32,889 (1986), the President has directed agencies to "initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs and: (1) [r]efuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employment Assistance Program; or (2) [d]oes not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.... Appellants have expressed their willingness to obtain counseling and rehabilitation, and to refrain from future use of illegal drugs. Thus, we think that Executive Order 12,564 and legislation emphasizing rehabilitation, the Federal Employee Substance Abuse Education and Treatment Act of 1986, H.R. 5484, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., 132 Cong. Rec. H9534-35 (1986), reinforce our conclusion that removal is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Thompson v. DOJ</span>, 51 MSPR 43, 49-50 (1991), appeared to modify statements in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> concerning rehabilitation of law enforcement officers or others whose positions and responsibilities were unduly compromised by off-duty drug use. Under <span class="Italic">Thompson,</span> the Rehabilitation Act did not apply because the appellant was disqualified for accommodation if his offenses "strike at the core of his job and the agency's mission":</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he administrative judge rejected the agency's assertion that, under the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Hougens v. United States Postal Service</span>, 38 MSPR 135 (1988), the appellant is disqualified from holding the position of Recreational Specialist because of the inherent contradiction of his misconduct and his responsibility for the rehabilitation of inmates. The administrative judge based this finding on the Board's decision in <span class="Italic">Kruger v. Department of Justice</span>, 32 MSPR 71, 75 (1987), where the Board held that the off-duty possession and use of marijuana by correctional officers, while antithetical to the agency's mission, did not preclude those appellants from returning to their positions following a 60-day suspension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that the "qualified handicapped employee penalty mitigation" analysis in <span class="Italic">Kruger</span> is inapplicable to the question presented in accommodation cases under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act. The factors analyzed are different. In <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, the Board considered the employee's misconduct in light of the agency's mission, and determined that there was certain misconduct that, by its very nature, strikes at the core of the job or the agency's mission, or is so egregious or notorious that an employee's ability to perform his duties or to represent the agency is seriously hampered. <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, 38 MSPR at 144. Such misconduct takes the employee in question outside the scope of the legislation protecting alcoholic and drug abusing employees because such a person is consequently "not a 'qualified' handicapped individual." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 142. Such misconduct, however, does not necessarily require that the employee be removed from Federal service. This determination is to be based upon long-settled mitigation principles, beyond the misconduct itself, set forth in <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, we find that the appellant's DWI conviction and possession of an illegal drug (marijuana) renders him "disqualified" for accommodation because these offenses strike at the core of his job and the agency's mission. As a Recreation Specialist, employed by the Federal Prison System, the appellant is considered a law enforcement officer, has frequent and direct contact with prison inmates, and supervises their recreation and leisure time programs. These responsibilities for the security of the prisoners while assisting their rehabilitation necessitates that persons in such a position not violate laws against drunken driving or possession of illegal drugs. The essential integrity of the personnel in the Federal Prison System is flatly compromised whenever an employee violates Federal and state laws. We, therefore, conclude that the agency was not required to offer the appellant accommodation in the form of drug or alcohol rehabilitation before proposing his removal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Cox v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 97-3488), sustained removal of a postal inspector for drug involvement without analysis of its disqualifying effect under the Rehabilitation Act or ADA, but with deference to an employer's zero tolerance policy:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Eddie L. Cox (petitioner) appeals from the judgment of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), which became final on August 21, 1997, affirming the Postal Service's removal of him effective December 20, 1996 from his position as a Postal Inspector with the Postal Inspection Service's Birmingham, Alabama, duty station for the use of an illegal drug, cocaine....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">During a random drug test, the Postal Service found petitioner tested positive for cocaine use. Petitioner does not dispute this fact. Petitioner does argue, however, that his removal from Postal Inspector did not promote the efficiency of the service under 5 USC &#x00A7; 7513(a) (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB held that petitioner's removal promoted the efficiency of the service. Postal inspectors are required to enforce drug laws and must testify in federal and state courts in criminal cases concerning drug distribution. Therefore, the MSPB agreed with the Postal Service that the integrity of the law enforcement and judicial systems demands that postal inspectors remain drug free. Criminal prosecutions, the MSPB asserted, should not be compromised because a star prosecution witness, such as a postal inspector, abused illegal drugs. In fact, in this case, petitioner's drug abuse was reported to the U.S. Attorney's Office because he was scheduled to testify in upcoming criminal trials. Also, Postal Inspectors carry fire arms in discharging their duties. Therefore, the MSPB agreed with the Postal Service that tolerating drug use could cause severe harm and damage to life and property.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On appeal, Petitioner does not challenge that the Postal Service should have taken some disciplinary action against him; he asserts that the penalty, however, was too severe and not related to the efficiency of the service. For instance, petitioner alleges that the "zero tolerance" drug policy for those in positions such as Postal Inspector was not proved to be in effect by a written document. The written policy to which petitioner points to refute the alleged "zero tolerance policy is that a postal employee with a substance abuse problem is to be referred to counseling in the Employee Assistance Program or a similar program outside of the Postal Service, Petitioner also alleges that he could have been demoted to a less sensitive position and given an opportunity to deal with his substance abuse without removing him after eighteen years of service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the substantial evidence of record, the removal of petitioner, <span id="Page_2294"></span>a Postal Inspector charged with upholding the drug laws of the United States who is an admitted substance abuser, promotes the efficiency of the Postal Service. Petitioner's challenge to his alleged lack of knowledge of the "zero tolerance" drug policy or its existence is of no moment. The MSPB accepted testimony that a "zero tolerance" policy existed and that petitioner admitted that he knew of such a policy....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bland v. DHHS</span>, CH-0752-13-0078-I-1 (NP 2/7/2014), concluded that sufficient nexus existed to support removal of a chemist convicted of a misdemeanor when he used an improper prescription in an attempt to obtain medicine that contained codeine:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the administrative judge found, the misconduct adversely affected the appellant's job performance because it impaired his ability to testify as a credible witness in any possible court case. The appellant's assertion that the likelihood of his ever being called on to testify is small does not change the fact that his job description requires that he be available to testify in court proceedings. Further, the appellant's misconduct resulted in the agency terminating his security clearance to work with certain chemicals. Additionally, the appellant's misconduct was potentially damaging to the agency's reputation because it was publicly known. Even if the conviction was not reported in the media, as the appellant contends, it was a matter of record available to the public. Additionally, the conviction caused the agency to lose trust and confidence in allowing him continued access to toxic chemicals. The administrative judge properly found nexus between the appellant's misconduct and the efficiency of the service.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See Torres v. DOJ</span>, 343 Fed. Appx. 610, 613-14 (Fed. Cir. 2009 NP) (citing <span class="Italic">Baird v. Dept. of Army,</span> 517 F.3d 1345, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2008), for authority that an agency may adopt and enforce under the Drug-Free Federal Workplace Program as a condition of employment, a reasonable zero tolerance policy allowing an employee who refuses to submit to or fails a drug test to be removed).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Rehabilitation will not necessarily save the job of the casual drug user in a less sensitive position. <span class="Italic">Hebron v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 36 MSPR 554, 557 (1988), permitted removal of a GS-11 Air Conditioning Mechanic who used marijuana during his lunch hour:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the appellant was involved not only with the use and possession of an illegal drug, but also with twice selling the marijuana to a co-worker during the lunch hour at a park near the agency premises. Since the appellant and the co-worker returned to work after smoking marijuana, they necessarily carried the lingering effects of the drug with them when they returned to work. <span class="Italic">See Facer v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 33 MSPR 243, 248 (1987), <span class="Italic">remanded on other grounds</span>, <span class="Italic">Facer v. Department of Air Force</span>, 836 F.2d 535 (Fed. Cir. 1988).... That this use of an illegal drug affected the appellant's performance was established by the appellant's own testimony that he "felt good about himself" when he returned to work after having smoked marijuana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, we conclude that the fact that the appellant used the drug off the agency premises did not diminish the dangers and risks involved in the performance of his duties.... The agency presented evidence that the appellant was exposed to various hazards at work such as falls, burns, electrical shock, and chemical and radiation exposure. Thus, we find that the agency established that the appellant could endanger himself and others in performing his duties if impaired by drug use.</p>
