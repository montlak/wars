<h5 class="h5" id="sec6-74"><span class="space">a.</span> Planned Management Action</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Under <span class="Italic">Spicer v. DOD</span>, 59 MSPR 359, 362, 367 (1993), the AJ must carefully evaluate a sequence of events leading to classification and reshufflings of position descriptions to determine whether an elevation in grade was due to a classification action or a planned management action involving changes in duties. <span class="Italic">Spicer</span> considered, among other factors, whether a change in duties occurred from the time that the appellant held the position to the time the position was reclassified. The concept of "planned management action" may apply to a RIF: if the <span class="Italic">Russell</span> appeal arises out of a sequence of actions involving a RIF and the reevaluation of position grade levels as a result of the RIF, then the element of planned management action defeats Board jurisdiction over a <span class="Italic">Russell</span> claim of constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 40-41 (1996), <span class="Italic">followed in</span> <span class="Italic">Tuleja v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 681, 684 (1997), and <span class="Italic">Di Pietro v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 686, 689-90 (1997). <span class="Italic">See Baird v. Dept. of Army</span>, 517 F.3d 1345, 1350-51 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (remanding an appeal to the Board when the court concluded that the AJ erred by refusing to require the agency to comply with discovery requests for emails that may have contained communications showing that the adverse action decisional process was subject to inappropriate control at a level higher than the deciding official); <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 8 MSPR 170, 174, 7 MSPB 649 (1981) ("what constitutes relevant material in discovery is to be liberally interpreted"; <span class="Italic">Johnson</span> approved the denial of discovery requests that "were clearly not relevant to any...issue under appeal"); <span class="Italic">Ellis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 80 MSPR 321, 325 &#x00B6; 9 (1998) ("planned management action such as accretion of duties"); <span class="Italic">cf. Beck v. Dept. of Navy</span>, <a href="https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20210514269">997 F.3d 1171</a>, 1178 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (Judge Taranto concurring) ("The term 'accretion of duties' refers to a promotion that occurs via a noncompetitive process, in which an incumbent employee's position is 'classified at a higher grade because of additional duties and responsibilities.' <span class="Italic">Haywood v. Locke</span>, 387 F. App'x 355, 357-58 (4th Cir. 2010).").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit provided insight into the concept of planned management action, <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dept. of Army</span>, 323 F.3d 1042, 1044-46 (Fed. Cir. 2003):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The petitioner John F. Welch was a GS-13 Information Management Officer with the Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") in St. Paul, Minnesota. There were five such positions in the Corps's district area. In June 1997, the Corps conducted a "consistency review" of those positions which, after noting that one of them was classified GS-14 and the others GS-13, concluded that all of the positions were properly classified. Corps headquarters recommended that Welch's position be realigned so that he would report to the Deputy Commander rather than to a Special Assistant. Under the point system the Corps used in classifying positions, this realignment of Welch's reporting would increase his points sufficiently to qualify him for a grade GS-14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Effective March 1, 1998, Welch's position was realigned so that he reported to the Deputy Commander. In January 2000, a new position description was adopted for the GS-14 Information Management Officer position and the Corps announced a vacancy for that position. Welch and others applied, and someone other than Welch was selected. As the administrative judge stated, "[t]he agency then conducted a one-person reduction in force (RIF) by which [Welch] was released from his competitive level and assigned to the GS-12 position of Database Administrator effective December 12, 2000."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the context of this case, a critical element of the Board's concept of "constructive demotion" is, as the administrative judge recognized, that the employee's "former position was misclassified and should have been upgraded due to a classification error or a change in the classification standards (rather than due to a planned management action)." <span class="Italic">See Burrell</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. at 429. The Board's concept is that if the position should have been classified at a higher grade, but was not because of a classification error, the Board will treat the situation as if the position had been reclassified, so that the employee's continued classification at the lower grade is treated as a demotion, which the Board has jurisdiction to review. <span class="Italic">See Hogan v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). (The Board has no jurisdiction to review failure to promote, <span class="Italic">Ellison v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 7 F.3d 1031, 1034 (Fed. Cir. 1993), or classification decisions, <span class="Italic">Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd.</span>, 757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed. Cir. 1985)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case the Board properly concluded that Welch had not shown that he was constructively demoted when the Corps changed the classification of his position from GS-13 to GS-14 but failed to appoint him to the higher new position. As the Board ruled, the change in grade resulted from a planned management action to realign the position so that the incumbent would report to someone higher in the chain of command. For there to be a constructive demotion under the Board's standards, the higher grade must result from a classification error or a change in classification standards, and not from a planned management action. <span class="Italic">See Burrell</span>, 81 M.S.P.R. at 429.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_2045"></span>Here, the higher grade resulted not from any classification error, but from the change in the official to whom Welch reported, which in turn increased his classification points to bring his position into the next higher grade. Indeed, shortly before the Corps realigned his position, the "consistency review" had concluded that the five Information Management Officer positions, including Welch's, were properly classified.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Welch contends that his position was misclassified after March 1, 1998, when he began reporting to the Deputy Commander; and that therefore he was constructively demoted when he was not thereafter assigned to the new GS-14 position. The alleged misclassification, however, resulted not from a basic classification error but from the Corps's management decision to realign the position. It was such realignment, and not any classification error, that resulted in the higher grade for the position. The passage of the time required for the administrative creation of a new GS-14 position in place of the old GS-13 position did not mean that the old position was misclassified during the interval. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Dep't of Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ("[T]he Board here acted within its authority in concluding that the determination whether there had been a classification error was to be made with respect to the grade at which the position most recently had been classified, and that a classification error could not be established by showing that, because of an increase in duties, the position should have been upgraded through reclassification prior to the employee's reassignment.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Planned management action, consisting of intentional addition of duties to a position that is upgraded, was the rationale for the decision of the Federal Circuit affirming the Board's denial of jurisdiction in the <span class="Italic">Russell-</span>style appeal of <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 980, 981-93 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7212(3) and (4) (2000), the Board has jurisdiction over "reduction in grade" and "reduction in pay" cases. Drawing from these provisions, the Board has also assumed jurisdiction over "constructive demotion" cases, which can arise even without an actual reduction in grade or pay. <span class="Italic">See Hogan v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 218 F.3d 1361, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2000). For a constructive demotion claim, the employee must establish that: "(i) the employee was reassigned from a position which, due to the issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error, is entitled to a higher grade, and (ii) the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade." <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dep't of the Navy,</span> 106 F.3d 1582, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (internal citations omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A change in grade resulting from a planned management action, rather than a misclassification or reclassification based on new standards, does not constitute a constructive demotion. <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dep't of the Army,</span> 323 F.3d 1042, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2003). In Welch, a GS-13 position was realigned to a GS-14 position as a result of a decision to have the employee report to a more senior official.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1044. As this change in grade was the result of a planned management action rather than a misclassification or reclassification, this court affirmed the Board's conclusion that no constructive demotion occurred for the appellant, who had previously held the GS-13 position and was not appointed to the new GS-14 position.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> at 1045. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of the Interior,</span> 926 F.2d 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the appellant was appointed to a GM-13 Federal Aid Chief position in 1982, but after a "wide-scale reorganization" in 1987, the position was replaced by a new Deputy Assistant Regional Director-Federal Aid, a GM-14 position in 1988. The appellant sought, but did not receive, the GM-14 position. Instead the Department reassigned the appellant to a GS-13 Senior Staff Biologist position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1121. The Board found that the position was upgraded because of planned management action (addition of duties over time, reorganization) rather than the result of a classification error. This court affirmed: "The fact that [the appellant's] duties may have increased since 1982 is not inconsistent with the Board's finding that the higher grade given to the successor position in 1988, following the reorganization, resulted from planned management action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1125.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Mr. Beaudette's case, the administrative judge determined that "it is clear from the appellate record that the GS-13 Staff Assistant position was upgraded to that of GS-14 Technical Advisor by the addition of different and higher-graded duties, i.e. 'planned management action'...." Initial Decision, slip op. at 6. MSPB Chairman McPhie, concurring in the full Board's denial of Mr. Beaudette's petition for review of the initial decision, compared the various duties of the non-supervisory GS-13 position and the supervisory GS-14 position, explaining that "the GS-14 position has greater responsibilities than the GS-13 position, that it requires critical knowledge not required of the GS-13 position, and that, as an agency official testified, the agency has 'higher expectations' of the GS-14 Technical Advisors than it did of the GS-13 Staff Assistants." <span class="Italic">Beaudette v. Dep't of the Treasury,</span> No. DE-0752-04-0112-B-1, concurring op. at &#x00B6; 13 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 24, 2006) (McPhie, Chairman, concurring). Substantial evidence supports the administrative judge's conclusion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Beaudette asks this court to look to the grievance examiner's report, which concluded that Mr. Beaudette was essentially performing the duties of a GS-14 Technical Advisor, and that his duties had not changed substantially over time. The administrative judge considered the grievance examiner's findings, but still determined that the upgrade was the result of a planned management action. While Mr. Beaudette correctly points out that his supervisor conceded that this is not a case of accretion of duties over time, this distinction is unavailing as a planned management action may take many forms, including, as here, a decision to upgrade a position by intentionally adding new duties and greater responsibilities. This court cannot reweigh the evidence as Mr. Beaudette requests. This court instead reviews the findings of the Board.</p>

Dept. of Navy</span>, AT-0752-13-2973-I-1 (NP 9/30/2014) ("[W]hen reclassification of a position is the result of 'planned management action,' such as the addition of duties, a constructive demotion claim does not lie. <span class="Italic">Manlogon v.

<p class="Body-Text">A modification in agency pay practices, e.g., a change to a pay banding system, does not constitute a reclassification of a position supporting a constructive adverse action appeal by an employee who moved out of the position for what seemed a good reason at the time, and whose move was voluntary. The change in pay was a result of planned management action, not reclassification, <span class="Italic">Elmore v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 421 F.3d 1339, 1342-44 (Fed. Cir. 2005):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board developed the concept of "constructive demotion" to deal with a specific situation arising from an employee's reassignment. <span class="Italic">See generally Russell v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 6 M.S.P.B. 585 (1981). "[T]he Board normally lacks jurisdiction to review the reassignment of an employee who does not suffer a loss of grade or pay." <span class="Italic">Walker v. Dep't of the Navy</span>, 106 F.3d 1582, 1584 (Fed. Cir. 1997). However, cases have arisen where, although an employee was transferred without loss of grade or pay, the practical effect of such transfer was to deny the employee a promotion he would have received if he had not been transferred, i.e., where his former position was about to be reclassified to a higher grade. The Board accordingly concluded in <span class="Italic">Russell</span> that "where an employee is reassigned from a position which due to issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error is worth a higher grade, the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade, and where the employee who held that position is permanently reassigned to a position classified at a grade level lower than the grade level to which the employee would otherwise be promoted, then the employee is reduced in grade." 6 M.S.P.B. at 594-95.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As this court has stated, "[t]o establish a constructive demotion claim, the employee must demonstrate that (i) the employee was reassigned from a position which, due to the issuance of a new classification standard or correction of classification error, is entitled to a higher grade, and (ii) the employee meets the legal and qualification requirements for promotion to the higher grade. By meeting these requirements, the employee demonstrates that the previous position should have been classified at a grade or pay higher than that of the position to which the employee was reassigned; thus, the reassignment constituted a 'constructive' demotion." <span class="Italic">Walker</span>, 106 F.3d at 1584.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Hogan v. Department of the Navy</span>, 218 F.3d 1361, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 2000), this court explained that "constructive demotion cannot occur unless a position is reclassified to correct an error in the original classification, or a new classification standard has been issued[.]" <span class="Italic">See also Artmann v. Dep't of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1122-23 (Fed. Cir. 1991); <span class="Italic">Manlogon v. Envtl. Prot. Agency</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. 653, 657-58 (M.S.P.B. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is unclear whether the Federal Aviation Administration's new pay system for air traffic controllers, effective October 1, 1998, under which pay "bands" were substituted for the prior pay grades, constituted a "reclassification, or a new classification standard" under <span class="Italic">Hogan</span> for constructive demotion purposes. The new system was designed, not to correct classification errors, but to institute a new basis for determining pay. "For there to be a constructive demotion under the Board's standards, the higher grade must result from a classification error or a change in classification standards and not from a planned management action." <span class="Italic">Welch v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 323 F.3d 1042, 1045 (Fed. Cir. 2003). Unfortunately, the Board did not address that issue here.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In any event, Elmore has not shown that he was constructively demoted. An essential element of a "constructive demotion" is that the employee's transfer must have been involuntary. <span class="Italic">See Hogan</span>, 218 F.3d at 1364. The Board has further clarified that these constructive demotion cases "arise when an agency reassigns an employee out of a position" that has been or is being upgraded. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; <span class="Italic">see Manlogon</span>, 87 M.S.P.R. at 658. If an employee voluntarily seeks transfer out of a position that subsequently is reclassified to a higher grade, he cannot properly complain that his transfer was a demotion. <span class="Italic">Cf. Torain v. United States Postal Serv.</span>, 84 F.3d 1420, 1423 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (holding that no constructive demotion occurred where an employee, to avoid the possibility of reassignment, volunteered for a lower graded position before the agency took any action regarding his potential reassignment).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The "transfer" that Elmore contends was a "constructive demotion" was <span id="Page_2046"></span>not his initial temporary detail to Tamiami, but his subsequent November 1997 appointment to a permanent position there as a supervisory air traffic controller. Although Elmore's legal theory is not fully articulated, he apparently contends that if he had not been thus permanently assigned, he would have returned to his old position at Miami International immediately after his detail ended on October 6, 1997, and that when the new pay system was introduced a year later, the pay of his position at Miami would have increased significantly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nothing in the record, however, shows or even suggests that Elmore's assignment to his new permanent supervisory position at Tamiami was anything other than a voluntary act on his part. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a formal vacancy announcement for the supervisory air traffic controller position at Tamiami, which contained detailed instructions governing the submission of applications for the position. The Standard Form 50-B memorializing Elmore's appointment to the position stated that he was "SELECTED FROM" the foregoing vacancy announcement, and described the action being taken as "CHANGE TO LOWER GRADE." In other words, Elmore applied for and was selected for that position, which was graded lower than the position he had held at Miami International. Elmore's reassignment to the supervisory position at Tamiami therefore represented his own voluntary action. As the administrative judge concluded, in holding that Elmore had not shown that he was constructively demoted when he was thus reassigned, Elmore "was indeed changed to lower grade in November of 1997, but that demotion was actual, not constructive, and was effected at his own request pursuant to his application under the agency's career enhancement program to gain supervisory experience." <span class="Italic">Initial Decision</span> at 2.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Elmore contends that he "was compelled to accept the position since his supervisor made the assignment" and that he accepted it "out of fear of losing future career progressing opportunities." These allegations, however, do not contradict the evidence in the record that Elmore's assignment to the supervisory position at Tamiami resulted from a voluntary act on his part. His claims do not establish that his assignment was involuntary.<span class="Italic"> Cf. Torain</span>, 84 F.3d at 1421-23 (assignment was not involuntary where employee "requested and accepted" a lower-graded position based on the perceived "threat that he would be involuntar[ily] reassigned to another geographic location" at some future time).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since Elmore failed to make a non-frivolous allegation that he was subject to a constructive demotion, the Board correctly dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he was not subjected to any adverse action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Realignment of positions through RIF suggests planned management action, <span class="Italic">Pritchett v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 35, 39-41 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...For the reasons discussed below, however, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction, under 5 U.S.C. chapter 75, over a constructive demotion claim arising in the context of a valid RIF.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Marcoux v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 373, 377-80 (1994), the Board held that chapter 75 procedures are not applicable to "actions in the nature of a RIF." We find that logic and sound policy dictate that this holding in <span class="Italic">Marcoux</span> be applied in the context of a constructive demotion arising from a RIF. Appellants who have been actually, not constructively, demoted in a RIF are barred from using chapter 75 as an avenue of redress under <span class="Italic">Marcoux</span>. There is no principled reason to allow those appellants affected by a RIF who could make out an arguable claim of constructive demotion to have access to chapter 75 to challenge that demotion. We do not view drawing such a distinction and vesting that distinction with a greater set of rights as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Marcoux</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. at 380, that preference-eligible Postal Service employees would have appeal rights under 5 C.F.R. part 351 from RIF demotions. For the reasons discussed below, however, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction under the RIF procedures to adjudicate a constructive demotion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.202(c)(2), "[a] change to lower grade based on the reclassification of an employee's position due to the application of new classification standards or the correction of a classification error" is specifically excluded from the RIF regulations. This exclusion is applicable, on its face, to situations where an employee's position is reclassified downward due to the specified classification reasons. We find that the language of this exclusion may also be easily read to apply to constructive demotion situations, where the employee is reassigned away from a position that is reclassified upward due to the specified classification reasons and is thereby effectively demoted by being deprived of his right to occupy a higher-graded position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Artmann v. Department of the Interior</span>, 926 F.2d 1120, 1123 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court affirmed the Board's test "for determining whether a reassignment...constitutes a 'constructive demotion' in terms of whether there had been a classification error or a new classification standard [applied] ...." Thus, a constructive demotion occurs only where "the position's [original] classification...was the result of a classification error or...the creation of the new...position...was not the result of planned management action." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1123-24. As the result of the remedy of a classification error, an employee is placed in a lower grade than he would have otherwise occupied. This applies in the case of a constructive demotion as well as an actual demotion. Sound policy and logic dictate that the Board construe the exception found in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.202(c)(2) as applying to constructive demotions as well as to the traditional demotion resulting from a classification error.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the language of section 351.202(c)(2) is broad enough to encompass the concept of constructive demotion as expressed by the Board and affirmed by the Federal Circuit. In any case, even if the Board were to adopt a strict construction of this regulatory exception which viewed the upgrading of a position in the context of a RIF as part of a planned management action and not merely the remedy of some previous classification error, the appellant in this case could still not invoke the Board's jurisdiction. Under <span class="Italic">Artmann</span>, the upgrading of a position as part of a "planned management action" defeats any claim of "constructive demotion."</p>
