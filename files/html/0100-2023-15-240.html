<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-239"><span class="space">c.</span> OWCP Claim</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Misstatement of facts involving a compensation claim amounts to falsification for personal gain and constitutes a serious offense. <span class="Italic">Hubble v. DOJ</span>, 6 MSPR 659, 661, 6 MSPB 553 (1981). A false claim for compensation benefits and continuation of pay in lieu of sick or annual leave warranted dismissal. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 305, 306 (1983);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Bourm v. Dept. of Army,</span> 208 Fed. Appx. 911 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP) (dismissal for retention of OWCP benefits following return to work); <span class="Italic">Pierce v. DOD</span>, DC-0752-15-0355-I-1 (NP 9/6/2016) ("removal based on the charge that she knowingly made false statements with the intention of deceiving or defrauding the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs"); <span class="Italic">Daniels v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 272, 279 (1993) (failure to report outside employment or earnings in OWCP claim forms; OWCP's determination as to whether the employee was entitled to FECA benefits does not preclude the Board from addressing a charge of falsification; removal was sustained despite long service when the mail handler's conduct continued over two years), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, <span class="Italic">Daniels v. USPS</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3788); <span class="Italic">Listerman v. DOJ</span>, 31 MSPR 179, 182-83 (1986) (one charge involved misstatement of material facts to ensure workers' compensation payments). A falsification charge was proved for a CA-1 (OWCP claim) form even though the appellant did not recover money. Though the appellant's misrepresentation did not achieve its intended purpose, it did not diminish his culpability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Perez v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 32, 36 (1988). Obstruction of an OWCP-directed medical examination provided the basis for removal. <span class="Italic">Bahm v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 38 MSPR 627, 633 (1988) (an allegation of malingering).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the Department of Labor adjudicates OWCP claims, an agency is not foreclosed from taking action against an employee for submitting a false compensation claim. <span class="Italic">Crofoot v. GPO</span>, 21 MSPR 248, 253 (1984); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hanna v. Dept. of Labor</span> (Fed. Cir. 2001 NP No. 00-3240) (nexus sufficient between employment and a false OWCP claim to justify disciplinary action). Even a Labor Department finding of a work-related accident will not prevent the Board from sustaining a dismissal predicated on a false claim; it is immaterial, apparently, that the agency sought and failed to convince the Department of Labor that the claim was improper. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Minor v. MSPB</span>, 819 F.2d 280, 283 (Fed. Cir. 1987) ("Ms. Minor was...not separated because of her injury, but because of her falsification"; "Sec. 8128(b) does not prevent an employing agency from deciding, in an authorized adverse action, that the employee had received a compensation award through making a false claim for which removal is the appropriate penalty.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although there is authority that the agency cannot properly discipline an individual for filing a false OWCP claim should OWCP approve the claim after its own investigation, <span class="Italic">Hicks v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 18, 20 (1984), the Board avoids granting OWCP findings preclusive effect. In one false claim case, the employee allegedly frequently played golf while he received Compensation Act benefits for an injury inconsistent with his sport. The AJ concluded that the Board was precluded by 5 USC 8128 from reviewing the conduct predicating the removal, for under 5 USC 8128(b) the action of the Secretary of Labor on workmen's compensation cases is to be final and conclusive and not subject to review. The Board determined that the provision is designed to preclude judicial review and thereby speed up the compensation process. Although determination of appellant's entitlement to FECA benefits is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OWCP, the question of the appellant's fraudulent conduct is not. Knowingly and willfully making false statements in documents before a federal agency is a crime under 18 USC 1001. The employing agency can establish cause that will promote the efficiency of the service and remove an employee who fraudulently receives benefits. The Board noted that the agency had not opposed the appellant's OWCP claim and had not, therefore, put OWCP in a position of ruling on the truthfulness of appellant's assertions. Because the agency was not an adversary in the proceeding, it was not barred by <span class="Italic">res</span> <span class="Italic">judicata</span> from alleging the appellant obtained the benefits under false pretenses. <span class="Italic">Miller v. USPS</span>, 26 MSPR 210, 212-13 (1985), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Title 5 USC &#x00A7; 8128 states, in part:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;The action of the Secretary or his designee in allowing or denying a payment under this subchapter is--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;final and conclusive for all purposes and with respect to all questions of law and fact; and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;not subject to review by another official of the United States or by a court by mandamus or otherwise.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official erred in interpreting this section as a bar to the taking of the instant adverse action. The program which FECA establishes is similar in structure and policy to state workers' compensation programs. The system contains at its core an implicit bargain. Employees are granted surer and more immediate relief than they might obtain in a court proceeding. In return they forego the possibility of greater awards. <span class="Italic">United States v. Demko,</span> 385 U.S. 149, 87 S. Ct. 382, 17 L. Ed.2d 258 (1966). The section cited above, 5 USC &#x00A7; 8128(b), is included in that statutory scheme in order to eliminate the possibility of any judicial review. <span class="Italic">Gill v. U.S.</span> 641 F.2d 197 (5th Cir. 1981). The provision insures the finality of the administrative determination. It overreads that provision to extend its coverage to this pending action. The Board, in ruling on the appropriateness of the adverse action, is not being asked to strip the OWCP decision of its finality by reversing the determination allowing benefits. Instead, the Board is being asked to rule upon the issue of <span id="Page_2768"></span>whether the appellant committed fraudulent actions in obtaining those benefits. While the issue of appellant's entitlement to FECA benefits is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the OWCP, the issue of the appellant's fraudulent conduct in those proceedings is not. Therefore, we have not, in the past, hesitated to sustain a removal which was based upon the false representations made in OWCP proceedings by a successful claimant for FECA benefits. <span class="Italic">Brooks v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 13 MSPB 13, 14 MSPR 305 (1983). Knowingly and willfully making false statements in documents in a matter pending before a federal agency is a crime under 18 USC &#x00A7; 1001. In addition, the employing agency can establish cause that will promote the efficiency of the service and remove an employee who has fraudulently received benefits to which he was not entitled. <span class="Italic">Gordon v. Government Printing</span> <span class="Italic">Office,</span> 9 MSPB 6, 9 MSPR 354 (1982); <span class="Italic">Gamble v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 487, 6 MSPR 578 (1981).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our determination that the Board is not precluded by 5 USC &#x00A7; 8128(b) from deciding whether the appellant made false representations to the OWCP is buttressed by the nature of those proceedings. Title 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.140 provides that FECA proceedings "are intended to be nonadversary in character." Where, as here, the agency did not contest appellant's entitlement to benefits, the "claimant's employing agency shall not have the right...to actively participate in the claims adjudication process." 20 CFR &#x00A7; 10.140. Therefore, the OWCP did not have any occasion to rule on the truthfulness of appellant's assertions in an adversary proceeding. Moreover, the agency, not having been an adversary in that proceeding, should not be barred by the application of the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> from alleging that the appellant obtained the benefits at issue there under false pretenses.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Camenisch-Felts v. USDA</span>, 47 MSPR 493, 496-97 (1991), reiterated the nonbinding effect of OWCP determinations--an OWCP award that suggested appellant intentionally injured herself to gain benefits:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board is not bound by a decision of OWCP to award benefits and, in the context of a disciplinary action for making a false claim, may find that the employee obtained the benefits under false pretenses even though OWCP has accepted the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Minor v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 819 F.2d 280, 283 n.4 (Fed. Cir. 1987), citing <span class="Italic">Miller v. United States Postal Service</span>, 26 MSPR 210 (1985). While not binding, OWCP decisions constitute evidence that merits consideration. <span class="Italic">Cf. Herring v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> 40 MSPR 342, 346 (1989) (decisions by state unemployment tribunals are not binding on the Board but do constitute record evidence worthy of consideration).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the administrative judge should have accepted into the record, and afforded consideration to, the January 4, 1989, OWCP decision because its finding that the appellant pre-planned her July 1, 1988, work injury with the intent of gaining time off from work was directly relevant to the charge that, by intentionally falling, she planned and caused herself injury on that date. Nonetheless, the administrative judge's error was not harmful because the OWCP decision would not be sufficient to override his assessment of the live testimony with regard to the July 1, 1988, incident. <span class="Italic">See Benoist v. Department of Defense,</span> 40 MSPR 418, 426 (1989), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 895 F.2d 1420 (Fed. Cir.) (Table), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, __ U.S. __, 110 S. Ct. 2598, 110 L. Ed.2d 278 (1990). This is particularly true because the OWCP decision was issued without benefit of the appellant's reply to the agency's allegation that she pre-planned the injury. Thus, although the January 4, 1989, OWCP decision is relevant to the issues in this appeal, it lacks sufficient weight to warrant an outcome different from that of the initial decision....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">McCain v. USPS</span>, 57 MSPR 604, 610 &#x0026; n.6 (1993) (discipline upheld when the appellant overstated the extent of his injury; although he was entitled to OWCP benefits, he should not have precluded the assignment of limited duty by asserting that he was totally disabled); <span class="Italic">Wheeler v. Dept. of Army</span>, 47 MSPR 240, 245-46 (1991) (discharge of an employee who gave false information concerning his physical condition to doctors for the purpose of obtaining or continuing OWCP benefits; the employee was observed performing activities inconsistent with his stated complaints; the OWCP's determination that the appellant suffered a compensable injury did not preclude the Board from addressing whether the appellant intentionally provided false information to obtain compensation benefits); <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 43 MSPR 539, 543 (1990) (falsification charge against a temporarily totally disabled employee who falsely stated that she had no earnings from employment or self-employment).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The falsity of an OWCP claim is established if the appellant ought to know, has a duty to know, or has the means of knowing the truth. But if the appellant tries to complete the claim information and is confused and has a reputation for honesty, no fraud is made out if the appellant's belief regarding the degree of his disability is incorrect but not unreasonable. <span class="Italic">Thompkins v. USPS</span>, 23 MSPR 5, 9 (1984). The Board made the point in <span class="Italic">Quinn v. USPS</span>, 53 MSPR 671, 674 (1992), that with allegedly fraudulent claims for OWCP benefits, as in other situations involving false claims, intent to defraud is an element of proof that the agency bears if its charges are going to be sustained. Intent to defraud is negated if the appellant files the claim based on what the appellant considers to be expert advice from a union or agency representative. Falsification is not established if the appellant is seen performing activities inconsistent with his claimed injury while the appellant is waiting for a release from his physician so that he can return to work; as there is no fraud or manipulation, there is no offense warranting adverse action. <span class="Italic">Letcher v. USPS</span>, 22 MSPR 560, 563 (1984). If the appellant's activities are inconsistent with his presently stated medical conditions, however, an inference may be drawn that the appellant intentionally deceived the agency concerning a request for sick leave or compensation benefits. <span class="Italic">Heller v. Dept. of Army</span>, 36 MSPR 675, 680-81 (1988) (appellant likely knew he could perform light duty when he requested sick leave and did not tell the agency he would be playing in a band during that period).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an agency charges not only that an employee submitted false information to OWCP but also that the information was used to determine compensation entitlements, the agency must prove both parts of the unified charge. The agency fails to prove its charge if it shows the submission of false information but no use of that information by OWCP. <span class="Italic">Atwood v. Dept. of Army</span>, 50 MSPR 289, 291 (1991). [Refer to Chapter 14, "<a href="0100-2023-21-201.html#sec14-201">Restoration Rights Upon Recovery From Occupational Injury or Illness.</a>"]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, reaffirming the ability to remove an employee for misrepresentation as to a claim leading to compensation, determined that the employee may not indirectly attack that finding through an appeal from a denial of restoration rights, <span class="Italic">Hinojosa v. USPS</span>, 250 Fed. Appx. 350, 351-52 (Fed. Cir. 2007 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hinojosa was employed as a window clerk with the Postal Service in February 2003, when she was injured on the job. The Department of Labor's Office of Workers' Compensation Programs ("OWCP") subsequently determined that Ms. Hinojosa had suffered a work-related injury, and it paid her compensation beginning in April 2003. In June 2003, postal inspectors interviewed Ms. Hinojosa, and in September 2003, the Postal Service removed her from her employment based on charges of misconduct. In particular, the Postal Service based the removal action on charges that Ms. Hinojosa had misrepresented her medical condition and had provided false information during the course of the Postal Service investigation into her claim that her injury had left her disabled.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hinojosa filed a grievance to protest her removal, but the grievance was ultimately dismissed on grounds of untimeliness. Ms. Hinojosa then filed this action with the Merit Systems Protection Board seeking reinstatement to her job. She asserted that she was legally entitled to restoration after recovery from her medical condition. The Board dismissed her reinstatement action, holding that she was not entitled to restoration because she had not been removed as a result of a compensable injury. She now petitions this court for review of the Board's jurisdictional ruling.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board correctly held that because Ms. Hinojosa was not removed as a result of a compensable injury, she was not entitled to restoration to employment. Restoration rights arise when a federal employee who has been separated because of a compensable injury recovers from the condition that had kept the employee from working. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.301. Those rights apply as long as the employee is otherwise entitled to return to the job. In <span class="Italic">Minor v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 819 F.2d 280 (Fed. Cir. 1987), and <span class="Italic">Cox v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 817 F.2d 100 (Fed. Cir. 1987), this court held that an employee does not have restoration rights if the employee is removed for cause, and not as a result of the employee's compensable injury. In Minor, as in this case, the employee was removed for making false statements regarding the injury that resulted in the employee's absence from work. Although the false statements were related to the injury, they nonetheless qualified as an independent ground for the employee's removal. The court therefore held that the Board did not have jurisdiction to order the employee's restoration to employment. The same is true here, as Ms. Hinojosa was removed for reasons other than her inability to work because of the injury she suffered in the workplace. The grounds for removal in Minor and in this case are thus different from the ground for removal in <span class="Italic">New v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs</span>, 142 F.3d 1259 (Fed. Cir. 1998), where this court held that the employee's removal for refusing to return to work without a determination of suitability from OWCP was not a legitimate, independent ground for a "for cause" removal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Hinojosa argues that the Board's ruling means that, in cases such as this one, employees in her position will be accorded no opportunity to test the validity of the employer's charges that result in removal. That is not correct. While not all Postal Service employees have the right to Board review of "for cause" removal actions, they are all entitled to due process procedures within the agency. <span class="Italic">See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</span> 470 U.S. 532, 542-45 (1985). Moreover, many Postal Service employees, including Ms. Hinojosa, have rights under union collective bargaining agreements to grieve, and ultimately arbitrate, actions such as their removal. In this case, Ms. Hinojosa did seek review of her removal through a grievance and arbitration, but the arbitrator determined that her grievance was untimely and dismissed it on that ground. The <span id="Page_2769"></span>correctness of that ruling is not at issue in this case. Nonetheless, it is not the case, as Ms. Hinojosa suggests, that because of her injury she has been denied the right to a hearing on her removal. She enjoyed all the rights that an uninjured employee would have had--in this case, the right to internal due process protections and the right to grieve her removal. She simply failed to pursue her grievance rights on a timely basis. Thus, Ms. Hinojosa is not entitled to restoration to employment, because she was removed from her position for cause and not as a result of her injury, and because she failed in her effort to challenge the removal action directly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To the extent that Ms. Hinojosa argues that OWCP's determination that she is entitled to compensation should give her the right to restoration notwithstanding her "for cause" removal, that argument is unpersuasive. As this court held in <span class="Italic">Minor,</span> OWCP's findings do not foreclose the agency (and the Board) from concluding that an employee has made false representations regarding her medical condition and disciplining the employee on that ground. 819 F.2d at 283. The employee's remedy in such a case is to contest the removal action directly, not to attempt to challenge the removal action through a restoration proceeding.</p>
