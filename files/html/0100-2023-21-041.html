<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-41"><span class="space">c.</span> Postal Service: Different Craft</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">For Postal Service employees, disability retirement entitlement may not be defeated through reassignment of an employee to a position in a different craft, <span class="Italic">Komarek v. OPM</span>, 11 MSPR 118, 121 (1982):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 8337(a) currently provides in part that an employee cannot be considered disabled if he is qualified for reassignment, but that an employee of the Postal Service cannot be considered qualified for reassignment if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For Postal Service personnel, under 5 USC 8337(a), a CSRS provision cited in <span class="Italic">Komarek</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment described in that sentence if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The limitation on reassignments of Postal Service employees to avoid a disability retirement was elaborated on in <span class="Italic">Smith v. OPM</span>, 88 MSPR 35, 38 &#x00B6; 8 (2001), citing to the FERS statute that parallels the CSRS provision:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statute at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(2)(A) provides that an employee shall not be eligible for a disability retirement under FERS if, under conditions set forth in the statute, she declines a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the agency for which she is qualified. Section 8451(a)(2)(D), however, states that, for purposes of section 8451(a)(2)(A), "an employee of the United States Postal Service shall not be considered qualified for a position if such position is in a different craft or if reassignment to such position would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement covering the employee." In her argument before the administrative judge, the appellant referred to <span id="Page_4141"></span>the definition of "vacant position" contained in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.102, which incorporates the language of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a)(2)(D) quoted above.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bracey v. OPM</span>, 236 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, involving light duty assignments and disability retirement, was applied to the Postal Service in <span class="Italic">Ancheta v. OPM</span>, 95 MSPR 343, 344, 346-55 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2, 8-14, 18 (2003) (FERS), involving modified or "rehabilitation" positions:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial factual background of this case may be found in the Board's prior decision remanding the appellant's appeal to the regional office for further proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Ancheta v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 640 (2002). In its prior decision, the Board remanded the appeal for the purpose of, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, allowing further development of the record with respect to the question of whether the court's decision in <span class="Italic">Bracey v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 236 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2001), applies in the context of a disability retirement application filed by an employee of the U.S. Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 11. In <span class="Italic">Bracey</span>, the court held that an accommodation precludes disability retirement only if it (1) adjusts the employee's job or work environment, enabling him to perform the critical or essential duties of his current position of record, or (2) reassigns the employee to an established, vacant position at the same grade and pay. <span class="Italic">Bracey</span>, 236 F.3d at 1358-59, 1361. The Board noted, however, that much of the court's reasoning in <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> was based on portions of title 5, United States Code, related to grading and classifying positions, that do not apply to the Postal Service. Because the Board had not previously considered whether <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> applied with respect to a disability retirement decision involving a Postal Service employee, it instructed the administrative judge on remand to afford the parties an opportunity to address this issue and to request <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs from the Postal Service, its bargaining agents, and others, by publishing the request in the Federal Register. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 11.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To be eligible for a disability retirement annuity under the Federal Employees' Retirement System, an employee must have completed at least eighteen months of creditable civilian service, must be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in her position, and must not have declined a reasonable offer of reassignment to a vacant position in the agency at the same or greater grade or pay level in the employee's commuting area in which she is able to render useful and efficient service. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a); <span class="Italic">see also</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a). OPM's implementing regulations further require that the disabling medical condition be expected to continue for at least one year from the date the application is filed and that accommodation of the condition in the appellant's position be unreasonable. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a)(3), (4).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In our prior decision, we found that the record showed that the appellant timely filed her application for disability retirement and that she had completed at least eighteen months of creditable civilian service. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 6. We also found that because the duties of the MLC [modified letter carrier] position did not include delivering mail, the MLC position could not be viewed as an accommodation that enabled the appellant to perform the duties of her City Carrier position. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 604, &#x00B6; 10. Because the parties have provided no basis to question these findings, we reaffirm them under the law of the case doctrine. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 339 (1995) (the law of the case doctrine was developed to maintain consistency and avoid reconsideration of matters once decided during the course of a single continuing lawsuit; it thus regulates judicial affairs before final judgment, not preclusion by final judgment); <span class="Italic">Hoover v. Department of the Navy</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 545, 553 (1993) (there are three recognized exceptions to the law of the case doctrine: the availability of new and substantially different evidence; a contrary decision of law by controlling authority that is applicable to the question at issue; or a showing that the prior decision in the same appeal was clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the question of whether the MLC position constituted a "vacant position" within the meaning of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.103(a), OPM asserted that the Postal Service assigned the appellant to the MLC position pursuant to Postal Service regulations found in Section 546 of the ELM and in accordance with procedures established by the joint DOL/USPS Rehabilitation Program in conjunction with Handbook EL-505. <span class="Italic">See</span> &#x00B6; 4, <span class="Italic">supra</span>. In its prior decision, the Board confirmed that the Postal Service offered the appellant the "rehab job" of Modified Letter Carrier in accordance with the procedures of the joint DOL/USPS Rehabilitation Program. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 10. According to the portions of Handbook EL-505 OPM submitted with its brief, in identifying a modified job assignment under the Rehabilitation Program, the Postal Service is to consider possible placement of an injured employee in accordance with the following priorities:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Employee's current position. If the employee is a current employee (was never separated from the USPS rolls) and is capable of performing his or her core duties with only minor modification, assignment to the current position may be feasible. This type of accommodation is not considered a modified assignment, and the workhours are charged to the regular operation LDC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Reassignment to an existing position. If a current employee can no longer perform the core duties of his or her position but is capable of performing the core duties of another authorized position for which he or she is qualified, reassignment may be offered. Since the employee is performing the core duties of the position, the workhours are charged to the regular operation LDC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Residual vacancy. If a vacancy has been posted for bid or application and there are no successful bidders or applicants, both current and former employees may be offered a residual vacancy if they can perform the core duties of the position with only minor modification. Again, since the core duties are being performed, this is not considered a modified assignment and the workhours are charged to the regular operation LDC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--Modified assignment. If a current or former employee's restrictions prohibit accommodation as described in the categories above, individual tasks must be identified and combined to develop a modified assignment consistent with the employee's medical restrictions. These tasks are usually subfunctions and may be from multiple positions. The workhours for employees accommodated in modified assignments are charged to LDC 69.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the handbook suggests that the duties performed in a modified assignment, rather than constituting the "core duties" of any particular "position" within the Postal Service, are generally "subfunctions" which may be derived from multiple "positions." The handbook also suggests that an employee is offered a "modified assignment" only if the employee does not qualify for assignment to her former position, other existing positions, or a residual vacancy. Therefore, despite the fact that the Federal Circuit in <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> relied on provisions of title 5 that do not apply to the Postal Service to support its conclusion that a set of ungraded, unclassified duties that have been assigned to an employee on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis cannot be considered a "position" within the federal employment system, <span class="Italic">Bracey</span>, 236 F.3d at 1359, the Postal Service handbook supports a similar proposition: that individual tasks that do not constitute the core functions of an existing position, identified and combined to develop a modified assignment consistent with an injured employee's medical restriction, do not constitute a "position" as that term is used within the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the manner in which Section 546 of the ELM describes the agency's obligations to employees who have partially overcome an injury or disability also suggests that the work to which such employees may be assigned does not necessarily constitute the duties of a particular "position" within the Postal Service. The ELM states, "When an employee has partially overcome a compensable injury,[3] the Postal Service must make every effort toward assigning the employee to limited duty consistent with the employee's medically defined work limitation tolerance." ELM, &#x00A7; 546.142(a). In effecting a limited duty assignment of a current employee, the specifics of the assignment, such as the particular duties to be performed, the duty hours, and the facility to which the employee will be assigned, are determined based on whether adequate "work" or "duties" are available within the employee's work limitation tolerances, within the employee's craft, in the work facility to which the employee is regularly assigned, and during the hours when the employee regularly works. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> For example, the ELM provides that an employee may be assigned limited duty outside of the work facility to which the employee is normally assigned only if there is not adequate work within the employee's work limitation tolerances at the employee's facility, but every effort must be made to assign the employee to work within the employee's craft within the employee's regular schedule and as near as possible to the regular work facility. ELM, &#x00A7; 546.142(a)(4). The Postal Service's obligations to former employees are more limited:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">When a former employee has partially recovered from a compensable injury or disability, the Postal Service must make every effort toward reemployment consistent with medically defined work limitation tolerances. Such an employee may be returned to any position for which he or she is qualified, including a lower grade position than that which the employee held when compensation began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">ELM, &#x00A7; 546.142(b). Thus, while the ELM suggests that former employees may be reemployed in "positions," limited duty or rehabilitation assignments of current employees are dependent on the extent to which adequate "work" exists within the employees' work limitation tolerances. The fact that the ELM defines the Postal Service's obligations to current employees in terms of available "work," rather than in terms of available "positions" as it does with respect to former employees, suggests that the duties performed as part of a limited duty or rehabilitation assignment need not constitute the duties of a defined and existing "position" with the Postal Service.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The OPM regulations governing restoration to duty following recovery from a compensable injury define "partially recovered" <span id="Page_4142"></span>to mean "an injured employee, though not ready to resume the full range of his or her regular duties, has recovered sufficiently to return to part-time or light duty or to another position with less demanding physical requirements." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 353.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, although we find that many of the assertions OPM made in the brief it filed following the remand are supported by the record, we find that the evidence supporting its assertions does not lead to the conclusion that OPM draws from these assertions, i.e., that the "rehab position" to which the appellant was assigned prior to her removal was viewed as a separate position under Postal Service regulations. Instead, we find that the evidence supports the opposite conclusion, i.e., that the duties of the appellant's MLC assignment did not constitute a "position" under Postal Service regulations. For example, OPM asserted that the Postal Service assigned a grade, occupational code, level, step and salary to the MLC position it offered the appellant. Yet, in its prior decision in this case, the Board noted that the personnel action form documenting the appellant's removal from the Postal Service showed that she was separated from the position of "Carrier (City)," the position to which she was originally appointed in April, 1994. <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 10. The Board also noted that the grade and occupational code of the City Carrier and MLC positions were identical, and that there was no evidence in the record that proved the appellant was officially assigned to the "MLC position." <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 640, &#x00B6; 10, 15. Additional evidence in the record indicates that the step and salary the agency offered the appellant in the "rehab job offer" were identical to the appellant's step and salary level prior to her acceptance of the Postal Service's offer. Furthermore, the fact that the Postal Service assigned a special LDC to the modified assignment does not support the conclusion that the modified assignment constituted a separate "position." Rather, the description of the uses of LDC's in the EL-505 handbook suggests that the LDC code assigned to the appellant's modified assignment was used to track workhours that were performed by employees who were not assigned to "core duties" of an existing position. Finally, we reject OPM's argument that the fact that OWCP terminated the appellant's compensation benefits upon her assignment to the duties described in the "rehab job offer" supports the proposition that the appellant was reassigned to the "MLC position" before she was removed. The Board and the Federal Circuit have both recognized that OWCP could determine that duties to which an employee can be assigned may constitute "suitable work," the refusal of which would disqualify an employee from receiving further wage-replacement benefits under the OWCP regulations, even if such duties did not constitute a "vacant position" within the meaning of the OPM disability retirement regulations.<span class="Italic"> See Bracey,</span> 236 F.3d at 1359-60; <span class="Italic">Suter v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 88 M.S.P.R. 80, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9, 11 (2001). Therefore, based on the evidence of record, we find that the MLC duties to which the Postal Service assigned the appellant prior to her removal did not constitute a "position" within the meaning of the Postal Service regulations. Accordingly, we find that the administrative judge properly concluded that the appellant's position of record, i.e., the relevant position for disability retirement purposes, was the "Carrier (City)" position to which she was originally appointed in April, 1994.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we find that the duties described in the "rehab job offer" the appellant accepted did not constitute a "vacant position" as that term is defined in the OPM regulations implementing the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). These regulations define a "vacant position" to mean:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">an unoccupied position of the same grade or pay level and tenure for which the employee is qualified for reassignment that is located in the same commuting area and, except in the case of a military reserve technician, is serviced by the same appointing authority of the employing agency. The vacant position must be full time, unless the employee's current position is less than full time, in which case the vacant position must have a work schedule of no less time than that of the current position. In the case of an employee of the United States Postal Service, a vacant position does not include a position in a different craft or a position to which reassignment would be inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 844.102.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because we have determined that the duties described in the job offer did not constitute a Postal Service "position," these duties cannot constitute a "vacant position" within the meaning of the federal retirement regulations. As the Federal Circuit noted in <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> the statutory scheme established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8337(a), which is essentially similar to the statutory scheme established by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8451(a), would be unworkable if "vacant position" were defined to mean simply a set of duties selected on an <span class="Italic">ad hoc</span> basis to fit the needs of a particular employee.<span class="Italic"> Bracey,</span> 236 F.3d at 1359-60; s<span class="Italic">ee Marino v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 243 F.3d 1375, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (noting the essential similarity between disability retirement under CSRS and disability retirement under FERS). However, in the case of an employee offered a "modified assignment" in accordance with the provisions of the ELM and the DOL/USPS Rehabilitation Program, the duties of the assignment may be "subfunctions" culled from various positions that are tailored to the employee's specific medical restrictions. In addition, because the OPM regulations define a "vacant position" as an "unoccupied position," the regulations clearly contemplate that a "vacant position" must exist even when it is not filled by a particular employee. However, because the duties of a modified assignment are identified and combined to suit the specific medical limitations of a particular employee, the duties that make up such an assignment do not exist as an identifiable position when the employee for whom the assignment was created is not assigned to those duties. Therefore, despite the fact that the Postal Service may have a contractual duty to offer such an assignment to a compensably-injured employee, such an offer does not constitute "an offer of reassignment to a vacant position" within the meaning of the disability retirement regulations, and an employee's declination of such an offer does not disqualify the employee from eligibility for disability retirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, OPM denied the appellant's disability retirement application on the basis that she failed to establish that she was disabled from performing the duties of the MLC position prior to her removal. <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span>, 92 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6; 3. However, because we have determined that the record establishes that the relevant position for disability retirement purposes was the "Carrier (City)" position, rather than the MLC position, OPM did not consider the proper position in ruling on the appellant's application for disability retirement. However, in accordance with Licausi, the Board may consider the eligibility issue <span class="Italic">de novo</span>, and it is therefore unnecessary to remand this case to OPM for the issuance of a new reconsideration decision addressing the appellant's ability to render useful and efficient service in the relevant position. Instead, the administrative judge shall reopen the record and afford the parties the opportunity to submit additional evidence and argument regarding this issue. In addition, if the appellant requests an opportunity to present further testimony regarding her ability to render useful and efficient service in her position of record at the time of her removal, the administrative judge shall conduct a supplemental hearing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Applying <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> <span class="Italic">Starks v. OPM</span>, 96 MSPR 4, 7-10 &#x00B6; 9-15 (2004), determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After the AJ issued her initial decision in this case, the Board was presented with the question of whether<span class="Italic"> Bracey</span> applies to the Postal Service. In <span class="Italic">Ancheta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 92 M.S.P.R. 640 (2002), the Board considered the appeal of a City Carrier who sustained a work-related injury, began receiving Office of Workers' Compensation Programs' compensation for wage loss, accepted a "rehab job offer" of a Modified Letter Carrier (MLC) position, was later removed for misconduct, and then filed a FERS disability-retirement application. OPM found that <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span> failed to establish that she was disabled from performing the duties of the MLC position before her removal. The AJ affirmed, finding that the Postal Service had been able to accommodate her medical restrictions in the MLC position and that she did not show that she was unable to work in that position because of a disabling medical condition. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board summarized the court's findings in <span class="Italic">Bracey. Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8. It noted that the <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> court relied on 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 5101(2) in addressing the factors pertinent to the accommodation issue, but that the Postal Service is not covered by that section. Thus, the Board found that <span class="Italic">Ancheta</span> raised the issue of whether the<span class="Italic"> Bracey</span> analysis applied to a case where the employee was covered by a collective bargaining agreement that might bind the Postal Service in accommodating disabled employees. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the Postal Service offered Ancheta the rehabilitation job of MLC in accordance with the joint Department of Labor/U.S. Postal Service Rehabilitation Program; that the Postal Service assigned a grade, occupational code, level, step, and salary to the MLC position; that the job offer indicated that the position was "indefinite"; and that the job offer described the duties and Ancheta's medical restrictions. The Board noted, though, that although the grade and occupational code of the City Carrier and the MLC positions were identical, the duties of the MLC position did not include delivering mail. It therefore found that the MLC position could not be viewed as an accommodation that enabled Ancheta to perform the duties of her City Carrier position. It found that, apparently, the MLC position was "graded" and "classified," as those terms were used in <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> but that the record did not show whether the position was "devised to meet the needs of a particular employee who cannot perform the duties of his position," which <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> found did not qualify as a vacant position precluding disability retirement.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8, 10. Also, the Board found conflicting evidence on whether the reassignment to the MLC job was effected. Specifically, the Board noted that the personnel action form documenting Ancheta's removal showed that she was separated from the position of "Carrier (City)." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the parties had not addressed whether <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> should be applied to the Postal Service, and, if so, whether Ancheta's assignment to the MLC position qualified as a reassignment to a <span id="Page_4143"></span>vacant position under <span class="Italic">Bracey,</span> which then disqualified her for disability retirement. The Board thus remanded for the parties to address those issues, for the AJ and the Clerk of the Board to request <span class="Italic">amicus</span> briefs, and for the AJ to readjudicate the case.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> &#x00B6; 11. The Board found that, if the AJ determined that Ancheta's MLC position was properly viewed as a "vacant position" under the FERS disability-retirement regulations, either as defined in <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> or based on whatever legal standard the AJ found applicable, and Ancheta did not show that she was disabled from performing the duties of that position, the AJ should affirm OPM's reconsideration decision. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board found that the relevant position for determining whether an employee is entitled to disability retirement is her position of record, that is, the position to which she was last officially assigned before filing her disability-retirement application. It found that both OPM and the AJ implicitly assumed that the MLC position was Ancheta's position of record and addressed only her ability to perform in that position. However, the Board found no evidence that Ancheta was ever officially assigned to that position, so it concluded that the AJ must further address that issue on remand. The Board stated that, if the AJ determined that the MLC position was not Ancheta's position of record (i.e., not a "vacant position" to which Ancheta was reassigned), he should remand the appeal to OPM to determine whether Ancheta was disabled from performing her position of record. The Board stated that the AJ should give the parties an opportunity to address what position was her position of record.<span class="Italic"> Id.</span> &#x00B6; 15.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Following the remand, the AJ determined that the appellant had never been officially assigned to the MLC position and remanded the appeal to OPM for the issuance of a new reconsideration decision addressing the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement from the position of "Carrier (City)." <span class="Italic">Ancheta v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 6 (2003). OPM filed a petition for review of the AJ's remand order, arguing that the administrative judge erred in finding that the Postal Service did not assign Ancheta to the MLC position. <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 7. The Board affirmed the AJ's decision, finding that the appellant's placement in the MLC assignment did not constitute an assignment to a Postal Service "position." Although the Board did not specifically find that <span class="Italic">Bracey</span> applies in the context of a disability retirement application filed by a Postal Service employee, it interpreted Postal Service rules and regulations to reach a conclusion similar to the conclusion drawn by the court in <span class="Italic">Bracey:</span> that individual tasks that do not constitute the core functions of an existing position, identified and combined to develop a modified assignment consistent with an injured employee's medical restrictions, do not constitute a "position" as that term is used within the Postal Service. <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> 95 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we find it necessary to remand this appeal to determine whether the appellant's assignment to the Rehabilitation Letter Carrier position constituted a reassignment to a vacant position or an accommodation in the appellant's position of record. As previously noted, the AJ here found that the appellant's Rehabilitation Letter Carrier position included the duties of her official position of record, particularly casing and delivering mail. However, as in <span class="Italic">Ancheta,</span> the record does not establish that the Rehabilitation Letter Carrier position was the appellant's official position of record.</p>
