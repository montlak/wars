<p class="Body-Text">Permeating Board law concerning enforcement or rescission of settlements is the concept of the material breach, coupled with the existence of a meaningful remedy should the appellant seeks enforcement rather than rescission. <span class="Italic">Muzzipapa v. VA</span>, 63 MSPR 559, 562 (1994), stated the general principle:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is well settled that the law of contracts applies to cases involving settlement agreements. <span class="Italic">Bales v. Department of Transportation</span>, 54 MSPR 187, 197 (1992) <span class="Italic">citing</span> <span class="Italic">Greco v. Department of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Under contract law, substantial performance by one party is sufficient to require the other party to perform. Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 237, cmt. d (1981). Performance is considered substantial if there is no material failure of performance. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Significant to the material failure determination is the extent to which the injured party is deprived of the benefit which was reasonably expected from the contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at &#x00A7; 241.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 609, 614 &#x00B6; 10, 2010 MSPB 92 (2010) ("It is not enough, however, to show that a party has acted in a manner that is inconsistent with a settlement agreement term, but rather to prevail a party "must show material noncompliance" with a term of the contract.<span class="Italic"> Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A party's breach of an agreement is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development,</span> 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">Caston,</span> 108 M.S.P.R. 190, &#x00B6; 17."); <span class="Italic">Vance v.

USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 113, 115-16 &#x00B6; 4, 2008 MSPB 30 (2008) (restating test of material breach; delay in compliance is not alone a material breach); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">DeOcampo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 551 Fed. Appx. 1000, 1002-03 (Fed. Cir. 2014 NP) ("Mr. DeOcampo's contention that the Army did not pay him back pay within 60 days is not disputed. The Army concedes that it paid Mr. DeOcampo around 40 days late. However, the record shows that Mr. DeOcampo was continuously advised of the Army's efforts and that he received interest on the late payment to compensate for the delay. The Board correctly determined that the Army's minor delay in processing Mr. DeOcampo's payment does not constitute a material breach of the settlement agreement that warrants rescission. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lutz v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ('A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract.')."); Thompson v.

The agency agreed to settle a case based on the appellant's agreement to apply for disability retirement and the agency's agreement to cooperate and facilitate the acceptance of that application and the agency's agreement not to place negative statements in the supervisor statement accompanying the disability retirement application. The agency placed negative information in the supervisory statement, the appellant's application for disability retirement was denied, and the appellant petitioned for enforcement of the agreement.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Even assuming that the agency breached the settlement agreement, we disagree with the AJ that the agency's breach of paragraph 3c was a material breach. While an appellant has a right to agency compliance with the terms to which it agreed, only a material breach of a settlement agreement grants him the right to enforce or rescind that agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Bables v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The last issue addressed by the <span class="Italic">Herring</span> decision [<span class="Italic">Herring v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 90 M.S.P.R. 165 (2001)] was "whether the assumed breach harmed or reasonably could have harmed the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement." <span class="Italic">Herring</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. at 170. The Board relied on the record which established, as in the instant case, that the appellant's medical evidence did not provide a reasoned explanation of how his medical condition affected his specific work requirement and precluded him from carrying out the specific duties of his position. <span class="Italic">Herring</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. at 171. The Board found that the inadequacy of medical evidence, not OPM's possession of an agency document referencing appellant's removal, was the basis for OPM's denial of the appellant's disability retirement application. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Thus, the Board held, even if the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to request that OPM expunge documents referring to the removal, that the breach was not material. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we agree with the agency in the instant case that, even assuming that it breached the settlement agreement, the breach was not material because it did not affect the award of disability retirement benefits. The denial was based on the appellant's, not the agency's, conduct in not supplying OPM with any relevant and credible medical records establishing his disability. Whether or not the supervisory statement contained negative statements, OPM's determination denying the appellant's disability retirement application would have been the same because the appellant failed to supply the required medical documentation to support his claim of disability. Therefore, even assuming a breach, it was not material and thus the agency is in compliance.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit, concluding that the Board's approach in <span class="Italic">Lutz</span> fell short of proper interpretation of the agency's obligations under the agreement, remanded for consideration of the remedy, <span class="Italic">Lutz v. USPS</span>, 485 F.3d 1377, 1378-82 (Fed. Cir. 2007):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_5066"></span>Mr. Lutz was an EAS-15 Postmaster, employed by the agency at its Pleasant, Michigan, post office. In December of 2002, he was removed from the position of Postmaster, was demoted to the position of PS-4 Mailhandler, and was assigned to the Ann Arbor, Michigan, post office. This action followed the Postal District Manager's review of a proposal to fire Mr. Lutz based upon charges of failure to perform his assigned duties and misconduct.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lutz appealed the agency's action to the Board. Thereafter, on April 22, 2003, he and the agency negotiated a settlement resolving the appeal. The settlement agreement, which was made part of the record for enforcement purposes, <span class="Italic">Lutz v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, No. CH-0752-03-02200-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 22, 2003), states in relevant part as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Within 30 days of the date this Settlement Agreement is fully executed, Appellant agrees to take all necessary steps to apply for disability retirement with [the Office of Personnel Management]. The Agency agrees to take all necessary steps to cooperate and facilitate the acceptance of Appellant's application and agrees not to place negative statements in the supervisor statement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the settlement agreement, Mr. Lutz applied for disability retirement with the Office of Personnel Management ("OPM"). The Postmaster of the Ann Arbor post office submitted a supervisor's statement to OPM in connection with the application. The supervisor's statement included the following statements regarding Mr. Lutz:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Refused to work in his position as a mail handler. Brought in documentation from Dr. was sent to Fitness for Duty [("FFD")] and was found fit for duty. Refused to work still.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Sent to FFD [Fitness for Duty] and was found to have no issues. He however refused to work and claimed an accident.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">He supposedly hurt his back when working on carrier routed flats. This then resulted in lifting restriction which we would have kept. However he did not return to work due to other issues with MSPB settlements.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By letter dated February 19, 2004, OPM denied Mr. Lutz's application for disability retirement. The letter stated, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Your supervisor documents a deficiency in your performance and attendance as of January 2003. He noted that you refused to work in your position, and that you were sent to fitness for duty and found fit for full duty. He also noted that you had a lifting restriction which the Post Office would have kept, but you have not returned to work due to other issues with MSPB settlements. The medical evidence submitted also does not establish that your medical condition warrants continued restrictions from performing the critical or essential duties of your position, or exclusion from the workplace, altogether.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In summary, the evidence submitted does not establish that you have a disabling medical condition, and we cannot conclude from the documentation presented that you are disabled for useful and efficient service or that a continued absence from the work site is medically warranted. Thus, your request for disability retirement has been denied.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lutz petitioned for enforcement of the settlement agreement, claiming that the agency was in breach of the agreement by including negative remarks in the supervisor's statement submitted to OPM in support of the application for disability retirement. On May 6, 2004, the administrative judge ("AJ") assigned to the case determined that the agency had breached the settlement agreement by including negative remarks in the supervisor's statement. The AJ recommended that the Board order rescission of the settlement agreement and remand the case to the AJ for an adjudication of the agency's removal/demotion action. <span class="Italic">Lutz v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, No. CH-0752-03-02200-C-1 (M.S.P.B. May 6, 2004) ("<span class="Italic">AJ's Decision</span>").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The government filed a brief disagreeing with the AJ's recommendation, urging that the AJ erred when she found that the agency's breach was material. The Board agreed, holding that even if the agency had breached the settlement agreement by including negative remarks in the supervisor's statement--a determination the Board found it unnecessary to reach--any breach by the agency was not material because it did not affect the award of disability retirement benefits. The Board concluded that OPM's denial of Mr. Lutz's application was based on his failure to supply OPM with any relevant and credible medical records establishing his disability, and that OPM would have denied the application regardless of any allegedly negative remarks contained in the supervisor's statement. Accordingly, the Board dismissed the petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Lutz argues that the statements in the supervisor's statement were clearly negative and that their inclusion in the statement was a breach of the settlement agreement. He further argues that the Board abused its discretion by holding that the agency's breach was not material. He urges that the materiality of the negative statements is evident from the fact that OPM cited the statements in support of its denial of his application for disability retirement. The government counters that the Board was entitled to find that OPM rejected Mr. Lutz's application because he failed to provide evidence that he was disabled. Therefore, the government argues, the statements in the supervisor's statement were immaterial because they did not affect the success of Mr. Lutz's application. Finally, the government urges that if the Board is held to have erred in finding the remarks in the supervisor's statement immaterial, the case must be remanded to the Board for it to consider the question it bypassed--whether the statements constituted a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">"A settlement agreement is a contract, and its construction is a question of law which this court reviews <span class="Italic">de novo</span>." <span class="Italic">Lary v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 472 F.3d 1363, 1367 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (quoting <span class="Italic">Conant v. Office of Pers. Mgmt.</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2001)). In order to prevail, Mr. Lutz must show material non-compliance by the agency with the terms of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See Gilbert v. Dep't of Justice</span>, 334 F.3d 1065, 1071 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("A party breaches a contract when it is in material non-compliance with the terms of the contract."). While the question of whether a breach of contract is material is a mixed question of law and fact, where, as here, the facts are undisputed the determination of whether there has been material non-compliance with the terms of a contract necessarily reduces to a question of law. <span class="Italic">Lary</span>, 472 F.3d at 1367 (citing <span class="Italic">Gilbert</span>, 334 F.3d at 1071-72).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency explicitly agreed "not to place negative statements in the supervisor statement." However, the statements the agency included in the supervisor's statement are indisputably negative in tone, asserting that Mr. Lutz "refused" to work his position. Furthermore, the statements are rife with innuendo, stating that Mr. Lutz "claimed" an accident and "supposedly" hurt his back. In short, they imply that Mr. Lutz has no medical issues and was less than truthful in his disability claims. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the agency was foreclosed from employing such a negative tone in the supervisor's statement and from including statements that insinuated that Mr. Lutz faked an injury in order to refuse to work. The agency agreed to "take all necessary steps to cooperate and facilitate the acceptance of Appellant's application." The negative statements included in the supervisor's statement did not "facilitate the acceptance" of Mr. Lutz's application and were more likely to impede and prejudice the application than facilitate its acceptance. In short, the agency breached its obligation under the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining question is whether the Board correctly concluded that the breach was immaterial. "A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see also Lary</span>, 472 F.3d at 1367. In <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, we held that the Internal Revenue Service breached its obligation under a settlement agreement when it agreed to use its best efforts to effectuate an employee's application for disability retirement benefits, but instead, in response to the employee's disability application, submitted documents stating that the employee had no documented medical condition and repeated the charges that had led to the initial removal proceeding. 255 F.3d at 1376-77. We held the breach material because the documents and statements submitted to OPM prejudiced the disability proceedings. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential purpose of &#x00B6; 3c in the settlement agreement here was to accommodate Mr. Lutz's application for disability retirement. As in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, the negative statements contained in the supervisor's statements prejudiced the disability proceedings. OPM explicitly relied on the supervisor's statements as one of two factors in denying the request for disability retirement, the other factor being a lack of medical evidence to establish a disabling medical condition. This is evident from OPM's recitation of the supervisor's statements that Mr. Lutz refused to work in his position; that he was sent for a fitness for duty examination and found fit for duty; and that he had a lifting restriction the agency would have honored, but that it could not because he never returned to duty. While it is impossible to know precisely to what extent these statements colored the analysis of OPM, it is clear that the statements did discourage OPM's acceptance of Mr. Lutz's disability retirement application. Therefore, the breach was not immaterial, and the Board erred in dismissing Mr. Lutz's petition for enforcement. Accordingly, the Board's decision to the contrary is reversed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Typically, in cases where an agency breaches a settlement agreement, the agreement is rescinded and the original claim on appeal to the Board is reinstated for adjudication. This was the remedy recommended by the AJ. On appeal, Mr. Lutz requests that we adopt the recommendation of the AJ that the Board (i) order rescission of the settlement agreement and (ii) remand the case to the AJ for adjudication of his challenge to the <span id="Page_5067"></span>agency's removal/demotion action. In the alternative, Mr. Lutz requests that we remand the case to the Board for a further remand to OPM for a redetermination of his disability retirement claim based on a clean record, devoid of the negative remarks contained in the supervisor's statement previously submitted to OPM. We believe the best approach is to remand the case to the Board and to allow the Board to decide how to proceed, after giving the parties the opportunity to express their views, including their views on a remand to OPM should Mr. Lutz request that.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Following remand and consideration by the AJ, the Board determined that there was no effective remedy for Mr. Lutz, whose appeal was reinstated, <span class="Italic">Lutz v. USPS</span>, 108 MSPR 695, 699-700 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-14, 2008 MSPB 112 (2008):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When a party to a settlement agreement materially breaches the agreement, the non-breaching party may elect either to enforce the agreement or to rescind the agreement and reinstate the appeal. <span class="Italic">Marshall v. Department of the Army</span>, 105 M.S.P.R. 343, &#x00B6; 9 (2007). The choice of seeking enforcement or rescission of a settlement agreement belongs to the non-breaching party, and the breaching party does not have the right to select the remedy. <span class="Italic">Poett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 20 (2005). The appellant has not yet made an unequivocal election between the two remedies. Hence, notwithstanding the agency's unilateral attempt to effect specific performance, the appellant retains the right to choose rescission if he desires it.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We further find that there is no available enforcement remedy that would cure the agency's breach. Before the court, the appellant indicated that enforcement would entail remanding the case to OPM for reconsideration of his disability retirement application based on a clean record devoid of the negative statements in the initial supervisor's statement. <span class="Italic">See Lutz</span>, 485 F.3d at 1382. OPM is not a party either to the settlement agreement or this appeal, however. We therefore lack the authority, in the context of this case, to compel OPM to reconsider the appellant's application for disability retirement or to expunge the initial supervisor's statement from its records. <span class="Italic">See Coffey v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 77 M.S.P.R. 281, 286 (1998).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor may we adopt the appellant's other suggested remedy of reversing the agency's June 4, 2005 removal action. The appellant argues that this remedy would make him whole, reasoning that in the absence of the breach he would have been awarded disability retirement prior to June 4, 2005, and therefore the removal action would not have taken place. The record does not establish that OPM would have awarded the appellant disability retirement, however, had the agency complied with the settlement agreement in the first instance. <span class="Italic">See Lutz</span>, 485 F.3d at 1382 ("it is impossible to know precisely to what extent [the initial supervisor's statement] colored the analysis of OPM"). It is therefore possible that, even in the absence of the breach, the appellant would have remained employed and thus subject to a potential removal action. We thus find that the specific performance ordered in <span class="Italic">Lary</span> is not appropriate under the circumstances presented in this appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the absence of a viable enforcement remedy, and in accordance with the appellant's conditional election, we find that rescission of the settlement agreement is the appropriate remedy for the agency's noncompliance. <span class="Italic">See Poett</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 20.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ford v.

[Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-23-223.html#sec16-222">Annuity Issues</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a material breach of an agreement, the good faith of the agency is not a defense to the enforcement petition, as occurred when an improperly-coded SF-50 remained in a personnel file, <span class="Italic">Baker v. Dept. of Navy,</span> SE-0752-92-0220-X-1 (NP 5/26/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the "good faith" of the agency should be considered when deciding the issue of breach and asserts that the administrative judge's recommended decision is incomplete because it lacks a finding on this issue. In support, the agency cites the Board's regulations on compliance, in particular 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.183(a)(4), which, the agency claims, provides that a petition for enforcement will be denied where the judge finds that there has been compliance or a good faith effort to comply. Here, the agency argues there is compliance and that it acted in "good faith."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency's good faith effort to comply with a settlement agreement, however, is not alone sufficient to defeat a petition for enforcement. While it is true that a party may establish breach by showing that the other party to the contract acted in bad faith, a party may also establish breach by proving that the other party failed to comply with a contract provision in a way that was material, regardless of the party's motive. <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The agency's actions in this case demonstrate an effort to comply with the agreement by promptly cancelling the appellant's removal, coding his resignation as a voluntary action, and giving him, on at least one occasion, a neutral reference. Nevertheless, we concur in the administrative judge's conclusion that the reason given for the appellant's resignation, "AS A CONDITION OF A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT" on the SF-50 documenting his resignation constitutes a material breach of the "clean record" agreement, regardless of the agency's motives.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's argument that there has been no breach because there has been no showing that prospective employers have learned derogatory information and the possibility of disclosure is purely speculative, appears to be based on two incorrect assumptions: (1) that the language on the SF-50 does not constitute a disclosure; and (2) that the appellant has not shown that harm resulted from the language.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the language on the SF-50, the agency argues that the words should not be read as a breach because the appellant himself used the words in his September 29, 1992 letter to the agency and they should therefore be viewed as inoffensive. The record, however, does not suggest that the appellant approved the language at issue. As the appellant notes, the letter in which he used the language at issue addressed the settlement of his removal appeal. Given that the letter stated that its purpose was to offer the appellant's resignation as a condition of the parties' previous agreement and that the letter cited the case caption and docket number of the appeal, it is not reasonable to assume that the appellant approved the reference to an agreement on his SF-50. Indeed, the appellant's response to the Recommendation confirms that he did not intend that the agreement be referenced on the SF-50.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency also argues that the reference to "A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT" is neither negative nor derogatory and that the reason for providing an explanation for the resignation was based on an OPM requirement that the agency provide a reason for the resignation in the remarks section of the SF-50. As the administrative judge noted, however, the agency was able to describe the reason for the appellant's separation without reference to an agreement. For example, the record shows that the agency, on the Standard Form 1150 pertaining to leave data, described the separation as "RESIGNATION--TO PRIVATE EMPLOYMENT." Thus, the fact that the agency had to provide a reason for the appellant's resignation does not require that the reason be stated "AS A CONDITION OF A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the fact that the SF-50 did not specifically state that the agreement in question settled a removal action, does not, as the agency suggests, preclude a finding of breach. Nor do we find persuasive the agency's argument that the term "agreement" on the appellant's SF-50 may be read as referring to an agreement to take LWOP for a certain period of time. We find that the link between the appellant's resignation and a previous agreement raises a question about the nature of his resignation, a question a potential employer would be very likely to ask and a question that the appellant may be unable to answer honestly without losing the value of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, to the extent that the agency is arguing that there was no harm because there is no showing that the SF-50 was shown to other individuals, it is unnecessary to establish actual harm in order to prove breach of a nondisclosure agreement. <span class="Italic">See Poett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 17 (2005). The appellant bargained for removal from his OPF and "other personnel records" of all evidence relating to his removal. We agree with the administrative judge that this provision was a matter of vital importance and that the agency materially breached that provision by its reference on the SF-50 to the appellant's resignation as "A CONDITION OF A PREVIOUS AGREEMENT."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Galloway v. USDA</span>, 398 Fed. Appx. 591, 596-97 (Fed. Cir. 2010 NP), assessed what the court viewed as the practical impact of the breach on the settlement's overall objectives:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the settlement agreement required the agency to provide any requested information within five working days, the delay in providing the information regarding Mr. Galloway's last day of pay does not require rescission of the settlement agreement. First, it is clear that the primary benefits of the agreement for Mr. Galloway were receiving the lump sum payment and securing the agency's assistance in order to obtain disability retirement benefits. The agency paid the lump sum, promptly responded to OPM's requests, and provided both Mr. Galloway and OPM with contacts for any follow-up requests. Mr. Galloway subsequently received his full disability retirement benefits, retroactive to his last day of pay. While the settlement agreement contemplated a quick and accurate response from the agency, we agree with the Board that the agency's mistake regarding the last day of pay was not a material breach because it did not "relate[ ] to a matter of vital importance, or go[ ] to the essence of the contract." <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dep't of Housing &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997); <span class="Italic">see Diehl v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 620, 624 (1999). The delay in providing that information did not significantly deprive Mr. Galloway of the benefit he reasonably expected from the agreement, <span class="Italic">see Corsiglia v. U.S. Postal Serv.</span>, 69 M.S.P.R. 5, 11 (1995), to the extent that it would justify allowing Mr. Galloway to rescind the agreement (even assuming that, given the choice, he would elect rescission and the accompanying surrender of the benefits he has received under the agreement). Therefore, we agree that the agency substantially complied <span id="Page_5068"></span>with the settlement agreement and that the Board properly denied relief on Mr. Galloway's petition for enforcement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">More recently, the Board examined the materiality of the breach with regard to the terms of the settlement rather than the collateral consequences of the breach, as in <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 113 MSPR 609, 625-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 37-38, 2010 MSPB 92 (2010) (on further review, <span class="Italic">Young v.

Cir. 2012 NP) (following remand, <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, AT-0752-09-0177-C-2 (NP 1/9/2015), <span class="Italic">post</span>), concerning the possible breach of a settlement when an agency provided some documentation to a psychiatrist conducting an independent medical examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In finding that the agency did not materially breach the settlement agreement by disclosing documents to Dr. Ruth, the administrative judge found it relevant, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, that Dr. Ruth did not consider any of the records he received from the agency in formulating his opinion that the appellant is not fit to return to duty. Whether Dr. Ruth considered the agency's documents in formulating his opinion is not, however, dispositive in determining if the agency materially breached the agreement. Instead, the pertinent question in determining whether the agency's breach is material is whether its actions, i.e. its disclosures to Dr. Ruth, relate to a matter of vital importance or go to the essence of the settlement agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Eagleheart,</span> 110 M.S.P.R. 642, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (although the agency's failure to timely process a PS-50 to reflect the appellant's resignation for personal reasons did not have a material effect on the appellant's ability to secure employment with a different federal agency, the agency's action still constituted a material breach of the agreement because the major benefits sought by the appellant included, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, a clean personnel file showing that he had voluntarily resigned for personal reasons); <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-11 (1998) (the agency materially breached a settlement agreement when it failed to clear the appellant's personnel records of any reference of its attempt to involuntarily remove the appellant, even though the breach did not result in a monetary loss, because the purpose of this provision of the settlement agreement was to ensure that such information was kept confidential).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the material benefit sought by the appellant is the opportunity to have an independent psychiatric fitness for duty examination. Thus, there appear to be at least two scenarios in which the agency's disclosure of documents to Dr. Ruth could constitute a material breach of the agreement. If the administrative judge finds that the term "independent medical examination," as agreed to by the parties, prohibits the agency from disclosing any documents concerning the appellant to Dr. Ruth, then the agency's mere act of disclosing these documents constitutes a material breach of the settlement agreement. Alternatively, even if the parties understood and agreed that the agency's standard practice is to disclose additional documentation to the physician conducting the independent fitness for duty examination, the agency may have breached the agreement if the documents it disclosed to Dr. Ruth are not consistent with the scope and type of documents that it routinely provides in such circumstances. Under that scenario, the agency's disclosures deprived the appellant of an "independent" medical examination. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Pierson v. Department of the Army,</span> 86 M.S.P.R. 203, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-4 (2000) (adopting the administrative judge's findings that the agency breached a settlement agreement because it "violated its duty to fulfill its contractual obligations in good faith" when it provided "misleading and irrelevant" information to the psychiatrist conducting the independent medical examination and the documents provided significantly affected the psychiatrist's findings and recommendation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">On further review, in <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 117 MSPR 211, 217-18 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 17-20, 2012 MSPB 2 (2012) (aff'd, <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 494 Fed. Appx. 65 (Fed. Cir. 2012 NP)), involving an agency's noncompliance with a provision of an agreement setting the conditions for a medical examination of the appellant, the Board said of the improper disclosure by the agency of information to the medical provider conducting the examination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In cases involving disclosures of information in violation of a settlement agreement, the Board has consistently held that an appellant need not show actual harm, such as a failure to obtain a position or other form of monetary loss, in order to establish that a nondisclosure provision has been materially breached. <span class="Italic">See Doe v. Department of the Army</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 160, &#x00B6; 10 (2011); <span class="Italic">Allison v. Department of Transportation</span>, 111 M.S.P.R. 62, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-17 (2009); <span class="Italic">Poett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 17 (2005). In this case, as acknowledged by the agency, the independence of the medical examination is of vital importance to the agreement. We therefore find that the agency's release of medical records concerning the appellant to the examining psychiatrist, by itself, constitutes a material breach of the agreement. We will not require the appellant to prove actual harm, i.e., to also prove that her examining psychiatrist actually considered, read or reviewed the offending records he admittedly received from the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We ORDER the agency to allow the appellant to submit to a new independent medical examination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In accordance with the settlement agreement, the appellant may choose to select a Board-certified forensic psychiatrist jointly with the agency, in which case the agency must bear the cost of the examination, or to submit to an examination by a Board-certified forensic psychiatrist of her choosing, for which the appellant must bear the cost. With respect to this new examination, we also ORDER the appellant to comply with her obligations under the agreement, including providing the releases of medical information specified in the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency may communicate with the examining psychiatrist to the extent necessary to provide the job requirements and standards that the appellant must meet to be deemed medically capable of returning to her former position. The agency is otherwise precluded, however, from presenting information regarding the appellant for consideration and evaluation by the examining psychiatrist. In the event that the new examining psychiatrist concludes that the appellant may return to work in her regular Rural Carrier position in the Columbia, Tennessee Post Office, the agency must reinstate the appellant to this position, with appropriate back pay and benefits, retroactive to the date on which she would have been reinstated under the terms of the settlement agreement if the April 2009 psychiatric examination results had reflected such a conclusion.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">...In his IRA appeal, the appellant identified the August 2007 reprimand as one of the personnel actions that the agency allegedly took against him in retaliation for making protected disclosures. The settlement agreement specifically called for the agency to rescind the reprimand and remove all references thereto from his OPF. We therefore find that the removal of the reprimand from the appellant's OPF went to the essence of the contract and that the agency's failure to timely remove the reprimand was therefore a material breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Kitt</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-3, 9, 11 (finding that the agency materially breached a settlement agreement by retaining a record of the appellant's removal despite a provision in the agreement requiring it to change the removal to a 30-day suspension). Because the agency breached a material provision of the settlement agreement, the appellant is not required to establish that the breach caused him actual harm. <span class="Italic">See Mullins</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 11 (the breach was material not because it resulted in a monetary loss but because the breached provision was material to the agreement).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">While an appellant has a right to agency compliance with the terms to which it agreed, only a material breach of a settlement agreement grants her the right to enforce or rescind that agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Mullins v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 79 MSPR 206, 212 (1998). A breach is material if it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Department of Housing &#x0026; Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997). The appellant has not explained how the matters about which she complains constitute material breaches of the agreement and, as to the first and second, we find no indication that they are. The appellant's removal appeal was dismissed as settled on January 29, 1999. The payment of $25,000.00 was made to her on March 18, 1999. It was, therefore, 3 days late. Moreover, the amount of information the appellant was required to place on the SF-52 was both minimal and easily known to her, consisting of her name, date of birth, Social Security Number, the reason for her resignation request, and its effective date. Absent a showing that she was prejudiced in any way by these facts, we find that she has not pointed to a material breach in either regard.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the failure to purge the document, as noted above, the agency has explained that it did not know how it was placed in the file, which had previously been purged, that it had now been removed, and that it would take additional steps to assure compliance with that term. The appellant has not taken issue with any of these specific claims, asserting only that the document was in her file when it should not have been. That the agency has cured the breach does not mean that there was not one. <span class="Italic">See Mullins,</span> 79 MSPR at 211. Nonetheless, there is no indication in the record and no claim by the appellant that she was in any way prejudiced by it with respect to an employment or other inquiry, that the document was disseminated in any way, or that any noncomplying document remains in her record. Moreover, she stated below her desire to enforce, not rescind, the agreement, and on petition for review, although she asks the Board to rewrite the agreement and award her damages, she is very clear that she wants the remaining portions of the settlement, <span id="Page_5069"></span>including the expungement provision, "to be enforced strongly, effective immediately." The actions the appellant asks the Board to take are not within its authority. <span class="Italic">See Rodriguez v. Department of Justice,</span> 84 MSPR 685, 689 (2000) (the Board may not modify a material term in a settlement agreement); <span class="Italic">Smith v. Department of the Army,</span> 72 MSPR 676, 679 (1996) (the Board lacks authority to award damages for breach of a settlement).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the circumstances, we find that there is no remedy that the Board can now provide for the appellant. Apparently, the agency is currently in full compliance with the expungement provision of the agreement and intends to remain compliant, and absent any harm, there is no corrective action the Board may order to enforce the term or compensate for any temporary noncompliance. We conclude that the matters raised, therefore, are moot under the particular facts of the case. <span class="Italic">See Uhlig v. Department of Justice,</span> 83 MSPR 29, 31 (1999); <span class="Italic">Currier</span> <span class="Italic">v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 191, 197 (1996) (an appeal is moot where there is no effective relief the Board can grant; to moot an appeal, the relief already obtained by the appellant need not be "fully satisfactory"). We point out that, should the appellant's future review of her OPF reveal any offending documents, she may refile her petition for enforcement. Accordingly, we deny her request for corrective action at this time.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure to correct some prior documentary references to an appellant's removal was inconsequential, or nonmaterial, <span class="Italic">Herring v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 90 MSPR 165, 169-71 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-15 (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]ince it appears that, after the settlement agreement was entered into, OPM had documents in its possession that referenced the appellant's removal, there is still a question of whether the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to correct those documents to reflect that the appellant had resigned. We need not reach this question, however. For even assuming the agency so breached the agreement, we find, for the reasons stated below, that the breach was not material and that the agency is in compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If the Board finds that an agency breached a term of a settlement agreement, the next consideration is whether that breach was a material one, which allows the nonbreaching party to elect between rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of his appeal or, alternatively, enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">Wonderly v. Department of the Navy,</span> 68 MSPR 529, 532 (1995); <span class="Italic">Sena v. Department of Defense,</span> 66 MSPR 458, 465 (1995). Here, the appellant has requested that his appeal be reinstated, which would require a finding that the breach was material. A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Sena</span>, 66 MSPR at 465. <span class="Italic">See also Thomas v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, it is clear from the settlement agreement that the appellant's goal in agreeing to resign in exchange for purging his records was two-fold: to purge adverse information from the records that may affect future employment prospects, and to correct information that may affect the award of disability retirement and OWCP benefits. These are matters of vital importance; they go to the essence of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 130 F.3d 1031, 1032-33 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (<span class="Italic">King I</span>). With respect to the matter of future employment prospects, there is no evidence that any prospective employer obtained any record referencing the appellant's removal before it was corrected. Thus, even assuming the agency breached the settlement agreement by not timely correcting the documents referencing the appellant's removal, there is no evidence that this breach adversely affected the appellant's future employment prospects. As to the agreement's concern for future employment, the assumed breach, therefore, was not material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This conclusion finds support in a later decision of the Federal Circuit's concerning the <span class="Italic">King</span> case, cited above. On remand from the court's 1997 decision, the Board found that any breach of the settlement agreement's expungement provision was not material, and the appellant was therefore not entitled to rescind the agreement<span class="Italic">. King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 80 MSPR 466 (1998) (Table). On appeal from that decision, the court agreed and affirmed the Board's decision dismissing the appellant's compliance case. <span class="Italic">King v. Department of the Navy,</span> 178 F.3d 1313 (1999) (Table) (<span class="Italic">King II</span>). The court concluded that: (1) materiality depends on the nature and effect of the violation in light of how the particular contract is viewed, bargained for, entered into, and performed by the parties; (2) the retirement record referencing the appellant's removal which the Navy did not purge was not the type of record a potential employer would likely seek in the course of making an employment decision; and (3) and the appellant failed to present evidence that anyone from whom she sought work sought or obtained any record subject to the expungement provision of the settlement agreement. We find the court's reasoning persuasive and apply it to this ease. Here, as in <span class="Italic">King II,</span> we find it unlikely that any potential employer sought OPM's retirement records, which contained a document referencing his removal, and the appellant has presented no evidence that any potential employer obtained any records that were subject to the expungement provision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The remaining issue is whether the assumed breach harmed or reasonably could have harmed the appellant's entitlement to disability retirement. The agency has submitted a corrected copy of the SF-3112B, which was forwarded to the appellant's representative rather than OPM at the appellant's request. The agency has also submitted a copy of the initial decision that sustained OPM's reconsideration decision denying the disability benefits that the appellant sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The initial decision sustaining OPM's reconsideration decision specifically states that although the record showed that the appellant had been removed, a new SF-50 in the record represented that he had resigned. The initial decision noted that OPM had found "that appellant had not established that he was unable to perform the duties of his Recreation Aide position prior to his separation," and affirmed OPM's decision, finding that the appellant's medical evidence "does not provide a reasoned explanation of how his medical condition affected his specific work requirement and precluded him from carrying out the specific duties of his position." Thus, regardless of whether OPM had the document referencing the appellant's removal at the time of its reconsideration decision, it appears that the decision did not rely on the appellant's removal in denying the appellant's disability retirement application. Nor did the administrative judge, in sustaining OPM's reconsideration decision rely on the removal. Indeed, he made express reference to the new SF-50 showing that the appellant had resigned. In these circumstances, we find that OPM's possession of the uncorrected documents did not affect the ultimate denial of the appellant's application for disability retirement benefits. Thus, even assuming that the agency breached the settlement agreement by failing to request that OPM expunge these documents, that breach was not material because it did not affect the award of disability retirement benefits. We therefore find that the agency is IN COMPLIANCE the provision in Paragraph 2d of the settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A coding to a personnel action in an electronic timekeeping file was not of sufficient materiality to detract from the agency's compliance with the terms of a settlement that required the agency to rescind an action in <span class="Italic">Abram v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, AT-0752-16-0589-C-1 (NP 1/23/2023):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...In August 2016, the parties executed a settlement agreement providing that, in exchange for the appellant's withdrawing her appeal, the agency agreed to "fully rescind" the suspension, restore all back pay, including overtime pay and leave that would have accrued during the suspension period, and "adjust any administrative personnel actions to reflect what would have otherwise occurred but for the suspension," including, but not limited to, a within-grade increase (WIGI) or step increase....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Here, the pertinent provision of the settlement agreement provides that the agency is to "[f]ully rescind the Appellant's 20-day suspension[.]" The agreement does not specify how rescinding the suspension is to be effected, much less specify which documents or files are to be altered or removed to effect the rescission. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our reviewing court has opined that, in the context of a settlement agreement rescinding an adverse action and expunging records related to that adverse action, to "rescind" is to "destroy" and "erase" the adverse action and the reasons for it from the appellant's "professional record" with the agency. <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d at 1376. In applying our reviewing court's precedential decisions regarding such agreements, also known as "clean record" agreements, we have construed the agreements to require the agency to expunge documents related to the adverse action from "all personnel records that are officially kept," and to not disclose such documents to third parties, even if the settlement agreement did not explicitly set forth these requirements. <span class="Italic">Torres v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 110 M.S.P.R. 482, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10-11 (2009) (discussing the Board's application of the standards set forth in <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d 1371, and <span class="Italic">Pagan v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We have extended these requirements to settlement agreements that require the agency to cancel or rescind the adverse action but are silent as to expunging records related to the action, as is the agreement here. <span class="Italic">See Kitt v. Department of the Navy,</span> 116 M.S.P.R. 680, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 8-10 (2011) (overruling <span class="Italic">Cutrufello v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 99 (1992), as contrary to <span class="Italic">Conant</span>, 255 F.3d 1371). Despite the lack of provisions regarding expunging records in the settlement agreement at issue, the agreement necessarily required that records regarding the suspension be expunged from the appellant's personnel records for her to receive "that for which [she] bargained." <span class="Italic">Pagan</span>, 170 F.3d at 1372. Thus, if an entry in the agency's electronic time and attendance record system, which is the agency's official time and attendance record, is a personnel record, the agency's failure to remove the original entry recording the appellant's suspension in her time and attendance records would constitute a breach of the agreement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency's inaction constituted a breach of the settlement <span id="Page_5070"></span>agreement, the breach was not a material one. For the appellant to prevail in a compliance action, she must show not only that the agency acted in a manner that is inconsistent with a term of the settlement agreement, but that there was material noncompliance with a settlement term. <span class="Italic">See Lutz v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2007). A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.; <span class="Italic">Flores v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 9 (2010). A party may establish such a breach of an agreement "by proving that the other party failed to comply with a provision of the contract in a way that was material, regardless of the party's motive." <span class="Italic">Flores</span>, 115 M.S.P.R. 189, &#x00B6; 9 (citing <span class="Italic">Link v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 51 F.3d 1577, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1995)).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It is undisputed that the agency removed references to the suspension from the appellant's official personnel file and corrected her time and attendance records such that the hours for which she was recorded as in a suspension status were changed to reflect that she was in a work status. However, the agency did not change the original suspension entry in the appellant's time records, citing its document retention policy. Thus, a numerical code remained in the historical data of the agency's electronic time and attendance records that showed the appellant in a suspension status for each of the 3 weeks in which she was originally in a suspension status. The agency averred that the entry would be removed from the agency's records in accordance with its document retention policy, which provided that time and attendance source records may be destroyed after a Government Accountability Office audit or 6 years, whichever occurred sooner. The agreement does not identify the relevance of correcting this historical data to rescinding the suspension, and the parties differ in their interpretation of the data's import; thus, we look to extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent at the time they executed the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Conant</span>, 255 F.3d at 1376; <span class="Italic">Sweet v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 28, &#x00B6; 15 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Prior to executing the settlement agreement, the agency moved to dismiss the initial appeal because it had rescinded the suspension action; however, the appellant disputed that the agency had fully rescinded the suspension because it had not "restor[ed] the appellant's back pay, overtime pay, and any other benefits lost as a result of the agency's adverse action." The resulting settlement agreement included provisions specifically addressing the agency's restoring back pay, overtime pay, leave, and a WIGI or step increase. Thus, at the time the agreement was executed, the parties appear to have been primarily concerned with restoring benefits the appellant had lost during the suspension, and there is no dispute that she received the benefits owed to her. In addition, although not stated in the agreement, we have found that individuals often pursue the expungement of an adverse action to avoid any effect it may have on future employment. <span class="Italic">Modrowski v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 97 M.S.P.R. 224, &#x00B6; 11 (2004); <span class="Italic">see King v. Department of the Navy</span>, 130 F.3d 1031, 1033-34 (Fed. Cir. 1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">According to an email exchange involving agency human resources employees that was entered into the record below, the historical data in question may only be reviewed by the appellant's immediate supervisor and the agency's payroll agent. The appellant does not dispute this statement but alleges that anyone that her supervisor designates to input time records, such as a timekeeper, will have access to the historical data, and the new supervisor to which she has been assigned may see the data. Regardless, those who may view the data are limited to those with a need to know about the appellant's time records, and there is no evidence that a future employer would be able to view the data. Thus, the historical data does not affect the appellant's future employment, nor does it affect the restoration of lost benefits contemplated by the agreement. We conclude that the historical data remaining in the appellant's time and attendance records does not go to the essence of the agreement between the parties and thus does not constitute a material breach of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Barnett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 113 F. App'x 908, 909-11 (Fed.

Although the AJ correctly interpreted the agreement to require the agency to provide an updated and timely-issued PS-50, she found that the agency's delay in processing the PS-50 to reflect the appellant's voluntary resignation for personal reasons did not constitute a material breach of the agreement because the delay did not have a material effect on the appellant's ability to secure employment with the VA. In this case, the agency's breach of the agreement would be material because it relates to a matter of vital importance and goes to the essence of this contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas,</span> 124 F.3d at 1442.

Here, the provision at issue was material, and the appellant would not be required to establish that the breach had an effect on his ability to apply for, or obtain, other employment<span class="Italic">. See Mullins</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 11.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Burke v.

Therefore, there is no meaningful relief the Board can provide, and the appellant's petition for enforcement regarding the removal of the reprimand from his OPF is moot. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Bables v.

<p class="Body-Text">The agency's violation of a "clean paper" settlement or a neutral reference provision will ordinarily be a material breach without a showing of actual harm, <span class="Italic">Allison v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">A breach is material when it relates to a matter of vital importance, or goes to the essence of the contract. <span class="Italic">Thomas</span>, 124 F.3d at 1442; <span class="Italic">see also Sena v. Department of Defense</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 458, 465 (1995). The Board has repeatedly held that an agreement to deny future employers knowledge of the agency's removal action towards an employee is of vital importance. <span class="Italic">Mullins v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 79 M.S.P.R. 206, &#x00B6; 10 (1998); <span class="Italic">see also Sena,</span> 66 M.S.P.R. at 466; <span class="Italic">Del Balzo v. Department of the Interior,</span> 60 M.S.P.R. 659, 665 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the instant case, the clean reference went to the essence of the contract. The appellant was not given attorney fees, back pay, or other remuneration. Even his Official Personnel File was only slightly modified. Thus, the agency's breach was material.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency asserts that the breach should not be considered material because "the Appellant has provided no evidence to show any actual harm" caused by the agency's breach. However, in cases involving disclosure of information, an "appellant need not show actual harm, such as a failure to obtain a position or other form of monetary loss," in order to establish that a settlement agreement provision has been materially breached. <span class="Italic">Poett v. Department of Agriculture</span>, 98 M.S.P.R. 628, &#x00B6; 17 (2005). In this case, given the content and context of the settlement agreement, the FAA materially breached the settlement agreement and the appellant is not obligated to prove the extent of the harm caused by the breach in order for the Board to find the breach material.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_5071"></span>But reference to a removal in OPM records was deemed immaterial as to an employee who retired following settlement of his appeal. The reference would likely not affect the future of an individual who was retired and not actively seeking employment, <span class="Italic">Modrowski v. VA</span>, 97 MSPR 224, 228 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-12 (2004):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the agency's actions in this case did constitute a breach of the party's settlement agreement, there is a question regarding whether the breach is a material one which would allow the appellant to elect between rescission of the agreement and reinstatement of his appeal or, alternatively, enforcement of the agreement. <span class="Italic">See Herring</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 165 &#x00B6; 11; <span class="Italic">Wonderly v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 529, 532 (1995). Based on the language of the settlement agreement, the appellant's purpose in bargaining for expunging references to the removal from his records was to allow him to retire from the federal service effective December 28, 1999. MSPB Docket No. CH-0752-98-0126-M-2, Initial Appeal File, Tab 20. In addition, while not stated in the settlement agreement, individuals often pursue expungement of references to an adverse action in order to ease the search for employment with other federal agencies and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant retired effective December 28, 1999, as contemplated by the settlement agreement. Furthermore, retirement records are not generally consulted or referenced during the hiring process, and the appellant has not alleged that his records have been consulted or referenced. Thus, we conclude that any breach of the settlement agreement is not material. <span class="Italic">See Herring</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 165 &#x00B6; 12.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When the settlement agreement provided that any breach of the agreement rendered the appeal subject to reinstatement, materiality of a breach, involving improper retention in the OPF of materials that should have been expunged, should not have been an issue, <span class="Italic">Gillespie v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 168 Fed. Appx. 421, 423 (Fed. Cir. 2006 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Both parties agree that the Board erred by requiring Ms. Gillespie to prove, as a condition for obtaining reinstatement of the appeal from her removal action, that the breach of the settlement agreement was material. We accept the parties' joint position with respect to that issue.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A settlement agreement is a contract. <span class="Italic">Greco v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 852 F.2d 558, 560 (Fed. Cir. 1988). In construing a contract, we look to the terms of the agreement to determine the intent of the parties at the time they contracted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Ordinarily, an examination of whether a breach is material is required to justify rescission as a remedy. <span class="Italic">See Christopher Village, L.P. v. United States</span>, 360 F.3d 1319, 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2004); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. Dep't of Hous. &#x0026; Urban Dev.</span>, 124 F.3d 1439, 1442 (Fed. Cir. 1997). In this case, however, the parties expressly agreed in the settlement agreement that in the event of any breach, the prior appeal would be subject to reinstatement at the behest of the nonbreaching party. Because the agreement specifically provided for reinstatement of the appeal as a remedy for any breach by the agency, the administrative judge should not have inquired into the materiality of the breach as a prerequisite for granting the remedy of reinstatement of the appeal. This is not to say that any technical departure from the strict terms of the agreement, no matter how trivial, would necessarily have required reinstatement of the appeal, but in this case the agency's noncompliance was not trivial. Accordingly, we hold that the administrative judge erred in denying Ms. Gillespie's petition for reinstatement of her prior appeal based on his conclusion that the agency's breach was not material, and we vacate the Board's order and remand with instructions to reinstate Ms. Gillespie's appeal from the removal action.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Corsiglia v. USPS</span>, 69 MSPR 5, 11 (1995), analyzed the substantiality of compliance with an agreement during an enforcement proceeding:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also reject the agency's contention that the appellant failed to meet the 12-months work requirement because of a possible week or two of unemployment between Sentry and its successor Uni-Guard, where he correctly anticipated continued employment. Any gap in his employment would not be a material failure of performance since it is not one which would significantly deprive the agency of the benefit it reasonably expected from the agreement. <span class="Italic">See</span> Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#x00A7; 237 cmt. d (1981). We find that the appellant has substantially complied with the 12-month work requirement.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the agency also asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant fulfilled his obligation under paragraph 6B to maintain satisfactory participation in an outpatient substance abuse rehabilitation program. The agency contends that the appellant had a duty to consent to the release of additional documentation by the rehabilitation program because of discrepancies between two of the computer printouts which he provided and that full participation in the program required that the appellant attend every session, which concededly he did not. The discrepancies cited by the agency are trivial in nature. The agency has cited no error in the administrative judge's findings that the appointments for treatment sessions were regularly scheduled over the year and that the appellant participated in 52 of 54 scheduled sessions. The agreement requires the appellant to maintain satisfactory and full participation. In the absence of more specific language, we see no basis for the agency's assertion that the appellant was required to attend every session. The administrative judge correctly found that the appellant fulfilled the requirements of paragraph 6B.</p>
