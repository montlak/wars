<h3 class="h3" id="sec8-4"><span class="space">A.</span> DEFENSE TO STATUTORY VIOLATION; THE CONTRACT PERMITS THE AGENCY TO ACT: <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">IRS</span></span></h3>
<p class="noindent">We begin with a defense to a ULP involving bargaining obligations and then discuss the substance of the violation. The agency may have statutory obligations to the union, e.g., required notice and an opportunity to bargain over substance or impact of changes in working conditions, official time allocations, involvement in formal discussions, and other matters discussed in this chapter, and violation of those obligations may result in an unfair labor practice case against the agency. Liability for what would otherwise be a ULP may be avoided if the agency demonstrates that its contract with the union permitted the conduct alleged to have constituted the ULP. The defense of contractual authority to act was developed in a case that applies broadly to unfair labor practice allegations, including but not limited to bargaining obligations. Bargaining obligations may also be subject to the "covered by" doctrine, discussed below.</p>
<p class="noindent">We trace the development of a defense by management to a ULP charge--that the action complained of, involving a statutory right that could be protected through the ULP process, was permitted by the contract--and as the defense is examined, so too is considered whether, when, and how the ULP hearing process or the contract grievance and arbitration process will be used to interpret the contract that is offered as a defense to the alleged ULP.</p>
<p class="noindent">A statutory violation may be raised under the FLRA ULP or contract grievance process. In a ULP case involving an agency's denial of official time entitlement through unilateral changes in working conditions, <span class="Italic">PTO and POPA</span>, 39 FLRA 1477, 1483 (1991), observed that:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[E]ven if the dispute over official time raised an arbitral issue under the parties' agreement, we note that, under section 7116(d) of the Statute, the Union had an option of raising the issue as an unfair labor practice under the Statute or as a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure, but not under both procedures. The Union elected to raise the issue as an unfair labor practice issue under the Statute. The Union was not required to raise the issue as a grievance under the negotiated grievance procedure and, in view of its election, cannot be required to pursue arbitration to resolve the dispute over official time.</p>
<p class="noindent">If statutory rights are violated a ULP proceeding is appropriate, even though a contract right could be implicated. The refusal to supply information within the scope of &#x00A7; 7114(b)(4) was a violation of &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 7116(a)(1), (5), and (8), irrespective of whether this refusal also might be a violation of the agreement of the parties. <span class="Italic">DMA Aerospace Ctr., St. Louis and NFFE Local 1827</span>, 21 FLRA 595, 703-07 (1986) (ALJ Decision). An employer found that it committed a ULP when it switched the shifts of some employees and erroneously relied upon its contract to defend the practice. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Air Force, Nellis AFB and AFGE Local 1199</span>, 41 FLRA 1011, 1028 (1991). In <span class="Italic">VAMC, Boise and AFGE Local 1273</span>, 40 FLRA 992, 997-98 (1991), the agency committed a ULP when it refused to negotiate over the number of union negotiators who would receive official time during midterm negotiations. Although the meaning of existing contract language was debatable, there was no clear and unmistakable waiver of the bargaining right. Responsibility for dues withholding was a statutory right rather than a contract issue in <span class="Italic">IRS, Springfield Dist. and NTEU Chap. 43</span>, 41 FLRA 376, 377-78 (1991). The same approach was followed concerning an allegation that the agency failed to bargain over a change in practice involving delivery of paychecks. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Enlisted Records and Evaluation Ctr., Ft. Benjamin Harrison, and AFGE Local 1411</span>, 41 FLRA 885, 896-99 (1991) (Proposal 2) (overcoming the defense that a related provision in the contract barred the ULP cases), <span class="Italic">modified on other grounds</span>, 48 FLRA 31 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA initially held that if a dispute concerning the proper level of bargaining depended on interpretation of a contract, a ULP complaint would not be entertained; the grievance procedure was to be used to resolve the dispute. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 33 FLRA 105, 114 (1988). On reconsideration of <span class="Italic">Marine Corps</span>, FLRA decided that the agency unlawfully refused to bargain. The reconsideration decision, <span class="Italic">Marine Corps and AFGE Local 2317</span>, 42 FLRA 3, 9 (1991), explained that FLRA's analysis changed from barring a ULP in the event of differing and arguable interpretations of terms of negotiated agreement to barring a ULP only if the collective bargaining agreement presented a clear and unequivocal waiver of a statutory bargaining right:</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The complaint alleged that the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) by refusing to recognize Cleveland Harris as a steward-at-large of Chapter 198 of the Union.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1"><span id="Page_1197"></span>The Agency and the Union are parties to a collective bargaining agreement which contains a negotiated grievance procedure.&#x2003;Article 9 of this agreement deals, in part, with the designation of stewards and other individuals who may act for the Union in grievance meetings and in other matters.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1986, an Agency employee, Cleveland Harris, acting as president of Chapter 198 of the Union, advised the Agency's Los Angeles chief of labor relations that Harris was designating himself as a steward under Article 9 of the parties' collective bargaining agreement for all "organizational segments within Chapter 198. Eventually, Harris left the Agency's employment, but remained the president of Chapter 198.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 19, 1987, Harris wrote a letter to the Agency's district director for Los Angeles indicating that he remained the "Steward at Large-EEO" and wished to have access to unit employees and "potential EEO Complainants" who needed his representation. He requested either that he be given a small conference room in a non-restricted area of each of the posts of duty represented by the Union or that unit employees be provided with sufficient official time, including travel time, to meet with him off-site.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The labor relations chief of the Agency's Los Angeles District responded to Harris' letter by advising the Union that the Agency would no longer recognize Harris "in any capacity as a steward-at-large" or as a steward because Article 9 of the parties' agreement requires that stewards must be bargaining unit employees. The Agency in its response acknowledged Harris' status as chapter president and indicated the conditions under which Harris could gain access to employees in his capacity as chapter president. Subsequently, the Agency permitted Harris to engage in representational functions as chapter president "or as a personal representative for an individual who has filed an EEO complaint," but limited his participation in grievance processing to Step 4 of the procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Judge first resolved the extent of the Respondent's alleged refusal to recognize Harris. The Judge found that Harris had been permitted to engage in all the representative functions of a chapter president except those which the Respondent contended are reserved for stewards who must be bargaining unit employees. After considering the Agency's response to Harris, the contract language to which the response referred, and the uncontradicted testimony, the Judge concluded that the Respondent's alleged refusal to recognize Harris encompassed only Harris' representative activities in grievance proceedings. He found no evidence that the Respondent had restricted Harris or intended to restrict him in any other way.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On the merits of the allegation, the Judge determined that the implication of a number of decisions of the Authority was that disputes over the designation of grievance representatives are matters of contractual rights and responsibilities rather than statutory rights. He rejected the theory that the Authority currently views the right to designate grievance representatives as a statutory right subject to surrender only by a clear and unmistakable waiver. He further found the Respondent's claim, that in order for a chapter president to act as steward in a grievance proceeding under the parties' collective bargaining agreement, the chapter president must be a unit employee, to be a plausible interpretation of the agreement. Accordingly, the Judge concluded that the case should be treated as a contract dispute rather than as an unfair labor practice, and he recommended that the complaint be dismissed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We agree with the Charging Party that this case presents the question of what approach should apply to address cases that involve an alleged statutory violation and allegations that the parties' collective bargaining agreement permits the action that is alleged to constitute an unfair labor practice. We also agree that the approach to these cases has broad legal and policy implications.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Initially, we reject an approach that would dismiss complaints alleging the violation of a statutory right based on a finding that the parties have proffered differing and arguable interpretations of the collective bargaining agreement. We agree with the Charging Party that this analysis would permit a respondent to violate protected rights based solely on an "arguable" or "plausible" interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement without any necessity of proving that its interpretation is correct. Clearly, such an approach penalizes aggrieved parties, who are, under section 7116(d) of the Statute, then precluded from filing a grievance. Thus, they would have no further avenue of relief and potential improper actions would go unremedied. It is well established that national labor policy disfavors the waiver of statutory rights. <span class="Italic">For example, Chesapeake &#x0026; Potomac Telephone Co. v. NLRB,</span> 687 F.2d 633 (2d Cir. 1982). We find that the use of a "differing and arguable" analysis in cases involving statutory rights abrogates important rights granted by the Statute and, consequently, is inconsistent with the purposes and policies of the Statute. To the extent that decisions of the Authority have applied this analysis to alleged violations of statutory rights, such decisions will no longer be followed. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California,</span> 33 FLRA 626, 641-42 (1988).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A union's right to designate its own representatives is a statutory right. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7114; <span class="Italic">American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1738, AFL-CIO,</span> 29 FLRA 178, 188 (1987) (agencies and unions have the right to designate their respective representatives when fulfilling their responsibilities under the Statute). The established approach employed by the Authority to resolve defenses based on a collective bargaining agreement to alleged interference with statutory rights is to determine whether the charging party has clearly and unmistakably waived its statutory right. <span class="Italic">Department of the Air Force, Scott Air Force Base, Illinois,</span> 5 FLRA 9 (1981). We will continue to apply such an analysis, even in cases where the parties' agreement contains some reference to the matter at issue. <span class="Italic">See, for example, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California,</span> 39 FLRA No. 97 (1991) (nothing in parties' agreement or bargaining history established clear and unmistakable waiver of union's right to bargain about changes in performance standards); <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy, Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Georgia,</span> 39 FLRA No. 91 (1991) (<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany</span>) (nothing in parties' agreement or bargaining history established clear and unmistakable waiver of union's right to bargain over issues presented involving the impact and implementation of details); <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Treasury, Customs Service, Washington, D.C.,</span> 38 FLRA 770, 784-85 (1990) (nothing in bargaining history or plain language of contractual provisions supported conclusion that union waived its right to bargain over proposed changes).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, when the language of the parties' collective bargaining agreement or the bargaining history to the agreement demonstrates that the charging party clearly and unmistakably waived its statutory right, we will find that the agreement permitted the respondent's actions and we will dismiss the complaint. <span class="Italic">See, for example, U.S. Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps (MPL), Washington, D.C.,</span> 38 FLRA 632 (1990) (based on bargaining history, Authority found union waived its right to disclosure of unit employees' home addresses); <span class="Italic">Bureau of Indian Affairs, Phoenix Area Office, Phoenix, Arizona,</span> 32 FLRA 903 (1988) (by entering into the memorandum of agreement, the union clearly and unmistakably waived its right to the requested information).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">C. Application of the Standard to This Case</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We conclude that neither the language of the parties' collective bargaining agreement nor the bargaining history to the agreement demonstrates that, by agreeing to the various provisions of Article 9 of the collective bargaining agreement, the Union clearly and unmistakably waived its statutory right to designate its representatives. In this regard, we agree with the Judge's findings that the Respondent's reading of the relevant provisions "is not the only plausible interpretation," and that "the bargaining history of these provisions...would support the parties' respective positions." In such circumstances, it cannot be shown that the parties' agreement specifically addresses the issue of whether a steward-at-large must be a unit employee. <span class="Italic">See Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany,</span> 39 FLRA No. 91, slip op. at 8. And, in the absence of conclusive evidence in the bargaining history that the parties intended such a result or any evidence that would support a finding of an express waiver, we conclude that the Union did not clearly and unmistakably waive its right to designate its representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Respondent violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Statute when it refused to recognize Cleveland Harris as a steward-at-large of the Union....</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA's special treatment of statutory violations <span class="Italic">vis-a-vis</span> contract violations was rejected by the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429, 431-41 (D.C. Cir. 1992), concluding the position was untenable. FLRA's "clear and unmistakable" analysis transformed a dispute over contract language into an unfair labor practice. The court observed that the situation would become most difficult in cases involving alleged refusals to bargain: contract language is ambiguous and the union would always prevail in a ULP based upon a change in working conditions without bargaining, leading to "an endless duty to bargain on the part of the agency, with a resultant evisceration of the FSLMRS's policies of contractual stability and repose":</p>
<p class="noindent-1">At issue in this case is an unfair labor practice charge asserted against the IRS by the National Treasury Employees Union ("NTEU"), which represents certain of the agency's employees. The relationship between the IRS and the NTEU is governed by a collective bargaining agreement known as "NORD II" (hereinafter, "Agreement"). The Agreement contains, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, certain rules regarding who can represent bargaining unit employees on behalf of the union in grievance proceedings and other matters. Article 9, section 1 of the Agreement provides, in part, as follows:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">A.&#x2003;Unless otherwise expressly stated, wherever in this article the term "steward" is used, it shall include assistant chief stewards, chief stewards, chapter presidents, joint council chairpersons, and any other individuals authorized by the Union in advance to act on its behalf.</p>
<p class="noindent-2"><span id="Page_1198"></span>B.&#x2003;The union may designate stewards to act on its behalf in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="noindent-3">...</p>
<p class="noindent-3">2.&#x2003;all stewards, <span class="Italic">except chapter presidents</span> and chief stewards, must be bargaining unit employees of the appointing office in which they serve....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Disputes arising under Article 9 are subject to the grievance and arbitration provisions contained in the Agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In 1986, Cleveland Harris, the President of NTEU Chapter 198, informed the IRS that he was designating himself "as Steward for...[a]ll organizational segments within Chapter 198...per the provisions of NORD II, Article 9." Harris was an IRS employee and bargaining unit member at the time he designated himself as a steward. Harris subsequently left the employ of the IRS, but he remained President of Chapter 198.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On October 19, 1987, Harris wrote to the IRS, informing the agency that he "remain[ed] the Steward At Large--EEO of the Los Angeles Joint Council" and demanding access to employee worksites for purposes of carrying on his representational activities. The IRS responded on November 5, 1987, and rejected Harris' request; relying on the fact that Harris was no longer employed by the agency, the IRS refused to recognize him "in any capacity as a steward-at-large" or "as a steward for any organizational segment." The IRS's action was based upon its interpretation of Article 9, section 1(B)(2) of the Agreement, which, in its view, required stewards to be bargaining unit employees. Although the IRS refused to recognize Harris as a steward, it continued to recognize his status as President of Chapter 198 and agreed to permit him limited access to IRS facilities for purposes of discharging his duties in that capacity.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The NTEU took a different view of section 1(B)(2) of Article 9 of the Agreement. It read the phrase "except chapter presidents and chief stewards" as a limiting clause, <span class="Italic">exempting</span> persons in those positions from the general rule that stewards must be bargaining unit employees. Unable to persuade the IRS that its reading of the collective bargaining agreement was correct, the union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Authority, asserting that the IRS had interfered with its right under the FSLMRS to select its own bargaining representatives.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On administrative appeal, the Authority reversed the ALJ's decision<span class="Italic">. IRS</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1573-75. The Authority framed the issue presented as "what approach should apply to address cases that involve an alleged statutory violation and allegations that the parties' collective bargaining agreement permits the action that is alleged to constitute an unfair labor practice." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1573. In answering this question, the Authority first rejected the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach followed by the ALJ, reasoning that the approach</p>
<p class="noindent-2">would permit [an agency] to violate protected rights based solely on an "arguable" or "plausible" interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement without any necessity of proving that its interpretation is correct. [In addition], such an approach penalizes aggrieved parties, who are, under section 7116(d) of the Statute, then precluded from filing a grievance....&#8197;To the extent that decisions of the Authority have applied this analysis to alleged violations of statutory rights, such decisions will no longer be followed.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority went on to find that the appropriate analysis was whether the NTEU had <span class="Italic">clearly and unmistakably waived</span> its right to designate its own bargaining representatives. Citing its decision in <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. 1126 (1991), <span class="Italic">rev'd</span> <span class="Italic">sub</span> <span class="Italic">nom</span>. <span class="Italic">Department of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 962 F.2d 48 (D.C. Cir. 1992), the Authority held that the dispositive inquiry was not what Article 9 of the contract meant; rather, the dispositive question was whether "the language of the parties' collective bargaining agreement or the bargaining history to the agreement demonstrates that [the NTEU] clearly and unmistakably waived its statutory right." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1574. Adopting the ALJ's findings that both Article 9 and its bargaining history were ambiguous, the Authority held that because the IRS's reading of Article 9 was "not the only plausible interpretation"--that is, <span class="Italic">because the Agreement was subject to differing and arguable interpretations</span>--there had been no "clear and unmistakable waiver" of the NTEU's statutory right to choose its bargaining representatives. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1575 (internal quotations omitted). Accordingly, the Authority held that the IRS had violated the Statute and ordered the agency to recognize Cleveland Harris as a steward-at-large. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 1575-76.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A reviewing court will defer to the Authority's interpretation of the FSLMRS if that interpretation is "reasonable and defensible." <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S. Ct. 439, 444, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983). Application of this standard of review does not mean, however, that judicial review is <span class="Italic">pro forma</span>. Where an Authority decision is found to be "'incompatible with either the terms or the purpose of the controlling statute,'" it will not withstand a petition for review. <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Navy v. FLRA</span>, 952 F.2d 1434, 1439 (D.C. Cir. 1992)....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The issue presented for review in this case is narrow.&#x2003;The IRS accepts the Authority's determination that Article 9 of the parties' Agreement does not effect a "clear and unmistakable waiver" of the NTEU's right to designate its own bargaining representatives; thus, the agency agrees that the petition for review must be denied if the FLRA's method of analyzing this case is permissible. The Authority, for its part, concedes that the IRS's interpretation of Article 9 is at least arguably correct; thus, the FLRA agrees that the agency would prevail in an unfair labor practice proceeding under the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis applied by the ALJ. The only issue, then, is whether the Authority committed legal error in applying a so-called "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach in deciding this case.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The IRS argues that the Authority's "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis is impermissible because it constitutes an unexplained departure from the Authority's prior cases and because it produces results at odds with the terms and policies of the FSLMRS. We agree, and therefore we vacate the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> and remand for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is well-established that where an agency departs from its prior cases, it must do so pursuant to reasoned decisionmaking....&#8197;This case poses a classic example of an unexplained departure from precedent.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In a series of decisions in the mid-1980s, the FLRA developed a "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis for addressing unfair labor practice cases, like <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, in which an agency raises a provision of the applicable collective bargaining agreement as a defense to an alleged unfair labor practice. Under this approach, the Authority asked whether the agency's interpretation of the disputed contractual provision was "arguably" or "plausibly" correct. If the agency could show that its reading of the provision was colorable, the Authority would dismiss the unfair labor practice complaint and refer the parties to arbitration for a definitive interpretation of their contract. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, Cal.</span>, 33 F.L.R.A. 626, 639-42 (1988) ("<span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base</span>")....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Indeed, in one such case, the Authority summarily affirmed a decision in which the ALJ applied the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach on facts indistinguishable from those of the case at bar. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration, Baltimore, Md.</span>, 22 F.L.R.A. 91, 91-92, 113-14 (1986) (upholding ALJ's application of "differing and arguable interpretations" approach where agency refused to recognize individual designated as representative by union).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The "differing and arguable interpretations" approach was eminently sensible because it properly took account of the "strong Congressional policy favoring arbitration" in public sector labor relations. <span class="Italic">Overseas Educ. Ass'n v. FLRA</span>, 824 F.2d 61, 63 (D.C. Cir. 1987). Under the FSLMRS, it is the arbitrator, and not the FLRA, who is the principal interpreter of collective bargaining agreements. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Karahalios v. Defense Language Inst.</span>, 821 F.2d 1389, 1392 (9th Cir. 1987) ("Congress showed a strong preference for keeping the interpretation and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements within the process of arbitration....")...&#8197;In cases like the one at bar, in which an agency raises a provision of the collective bargaining agreement as a defense to an unfair labor practice charge, the issue upon which the alleged unfair labor practice rises or falls is <span class="Italic">the meaning of the language of the agreement</span>. If the agency's interpretation is correct, then there has been no unfair labor practice because the agreement authorized the disputed agency action. In applying the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach, the Authority properly recognized that, where a case turns on the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, a definitive construction of the agreement should be obtained from the arbitrator--the tribunal primarily responsible for discharging that task under the FSLMRS.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the case at bar, the Authority departed from its "differing and arguable interpretations" method of analysis. In its place, the Authority adopted a test which looks only to determine whether the disputed contractual language embodies a "clear and unmistakable waiver" of the statutory right at issue. If the disputed language is in any manner unclear or ambiguous, then the unfair labor practice claim will be upheld. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1573-75. In other words, under its new "clear and unmistakable waiver" test, the FLRA does not interpret the collective bargaining agreement to decide whether the agency's defense is valid, nor does it refer the case to arbitration for a definitive construction of the agreement; rather, the Authority simply decides whether the contractual language is less than crystal clear, and, if it is, then the union prevails on the ground that there has been no "clear and unmistakable waiver" of the underlying statutory right.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In effect, then, the Authority's newly adopted "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis turns the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach on its head--under the new rule, if the collective bargaining agreement is subject to differing and arguable constructions, then it is <span id="Page_1199"></span>the union, not the agency, which prevails before the Authority, <span class="Italic">regardless of what the true meaning of the agreement is</span>. Thus, in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority held that the agency had committed an unfair labor practice <span class="Italic">precisely because</span> Article 9 of the Agreement was susceptible to differing and arguable interpretations....&#8197;This makes no sense.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In its decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, and in its brief to this court, the Authority advanced two justifications in support of its abandonment of the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach in favor of its new "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis. Neither of these justifications withstands scrutiny.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority first contends that if it analyzed cases such as the one at bar as disputes over contract interpretation--instead of applying its "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis--then an agency could "violate protected rights based solely on an 'arguable' or 'plausible' interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement without any necessity of proving that its interpretation is correct." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 39 FLRA at 1573. This contention is utterly specious, because it is simply not true that the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach permits an agency to prevail against a union without proving the correctness of its reading of the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis, when an agency defends against an unfair labor practice charge on the basis of a contractual provision--and the agency's reading of the provision is at least arguably correct--then the dispute goes to arbitration. There, the agency must prove to the arbitrator that its interpretation of the contract is, in fact, correct. If the agency succeeds in this endeavor, the arbitrator will hold for the agency and deny relief to the union, which would likewise be the proper result in an unfair labor practice proceeding. On the other hand, if the agency fails to sustain its burden of proof, the arbitrator will hold for the union and order appropriate relief. In most, if not all, cases, the relief granted by the arbitrator will be the same as that which the Authority would grant upon finding an unfair labor practice. For example, in the case at bar, the relief that an arbitrator would have given upon rejecting the IRS's position with respect to Article 9 presumably would have been an award requiring the agency to recognize Mr. Harris as a steward--precisely the same relief ordered by the FLRA. Thus, it is simply nonsensical to maintain, as the Authority does, that the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis permits an agency to violate employee rights on the basis of an unproven interpretation of the contract.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's second proposed justification for abandoning the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach is that the approach unfairly "penalizes aggrieved parties, who are, under section 7116(d) of the Statute, then precluded from filing a grievance." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. at 1573. The gist of this contention is that if a union brings an unfair labor practice charge before the Authority, and the Authority decides to dismiss the complaint in favor of arbitration, then the union would be precluded by section 7116(d) from actually proceeding to arbitration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We find the Authority's second justification to be as unpersuasive as the first. Section 7116(d) of the FSLMRS provides, in part, that "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice...<span class="Italic">but not under both procedures</span>." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(d) (1988). The purpose of the section is to permit an aggrieved party to choose between the arbitrator and the Authority in appropriate cases, but to prevent the party from having two bites at the adjudicatory apple by "relitigat[ing]...the same issue in a different forum." <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, United States Marine Corps Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.</span>, 37 F.L.R.A. 1268, 1274 (1990) ("<span class="Italic">Department of the Army</span>")....&#8197;The "differing and arguable interpretations" approach is entirely consistent with this purpose, because, under that approach, the substance of an aggrieved party's claim is litigated <span class="Italic">in only one forum</span>. Thus, it is simply incorrect to maintain, as the Authority does, that the approach violates section 7116(d)'s proscription against duplicative proceedings. Indeed, we find it most surprising that the Authority even advances this contention, given that it has followed the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach in numerous cases without expressing a whit of concern over possible conflict with section 7116(d).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Far from supporting the Authority's decision to abandon the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach, section 7116(d) actually undermines that decision, for the Authority's new "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis contravenes the policies underlying that provision. As noted above, section 7116(d) permits an aggrieved union or employee whose complaint is capable of being characterized as either a contractual violation or a statutory violation to elect whether to bring the claim as a grievance or an unfair labor practice charge....&#8197;By providing for a <span class="Italic">choice</span> of forum, section 7116(d) assumes that a similar analytical approach would be followed--if not the same result reached--by both the arbitrator and the Authority with respect to matters over which there is concurrent jurisdiction....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Under the approach adopted by the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, however, the results reached in the two fora in cases like the one at bar will be markedly different: an arbitrator would construe the contractual language to determine which party's interpretation of the contract is correct, while the Authority would look only to see if the contractual provision upon which the agency relies is in any way ambiguous and, if such is the case, sustain the unfair labor practice charge. Thus, under the new "clear and unmistakable waiver" regime, section 7116(d)'s promise of a <span class="Italic">choice</span> of forum is illusory because there is no reason for a union ever to choose arbitration, where it will have to litigate the meaning of the contract, instead of proceeding before the Authority, where to prevail it need only show that the contractual language is other than crystal clear. Such a result flies in the face of Congress's intent in enacting section 7116(d). Nor can the Authority's result be squared with the FSLMRS's strong policy in favor of private dispute resolution....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In short, of the two justifications offered by the Authority for its abandonment of the "differing and arguable interpretations" approach, the first is unfounded and the second actually supports the opposite result. It follows that the Authority has failed to advance any appropriate justification for its change in approach, and that remand is required.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition to constituting an unexplained departure from its prior analytical method, the "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach adopted by the Authority in this case is internally inconsistent and produces results at odds with the policies of the FSLMRS. That circumstance provides a second ground upon which the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> must be vacated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a preliminary matter, we note that the Authority takes the position that, under section 7116(d) of the Statute, it is empowered to hear cases like the one at bar notwithstanding the fact that such cases turn upon an interpretation of the underlying collective bargaining agreement. That the Authority has this power is not self-evident because, as noted above, it is the arbitrator who is the principal interpreter of collective bargaining agreements under the FSLMRS. Nonetheless, for purposes resolving this case, we assume without deciding that it is within the Authority's competence to interpret a collective bargaining agreement where necessary to resolve an unfair labor practice claim....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Assuming that the Authority has the discretion to hear cases like the one at bar, we conclude that it abused that discretion in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> by reaching a result that is illogical on its own terms. The Authority acknowledged in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, and again at oral argument, that the statutory right at issue in this case--the union's right to choose its own bargaining representatives--is a right that may be altered or surrendered through collective bargaining....&#8197;In other words, the Authority agrees with the IRS that where a collective bargaining agreement limits who may serve as a union representative, the union must abide by those limitations. The Authority further concedes that if the IRS's interpretation of the negotiated agreement in this case is correct--that is, if Article 9 of the Agreement means that Mr. Harris in ineligible to serve as a steward--then the Agreement governs and the IRS is entitled to prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Despite these concessions, the Authority adopted an approach in this case which fails to address the dispositive issue--<span class="Italic">what the Agreement means</span>. Instead, under its "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach, the Authority simply looks for an ambiguity in the contractual language. And if there is such an ambiguity--as surely there almost always is in any written contract--then the union prevails because it is deemed not to have "clearly and unmistakably waived" its statutory right. This approach is illogical on two fronts: it first transforms a dispute over contract interpretation into an unfair labor practice case, and then resolves the case without ever answering the interpretative question that spawned the dispute in the first place.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's approach defies not only logic but also the FSLMRS, because it produces results that cannot be squared with the policies of the Statute. Congress's intent in enacting the FSLMRS was to establish a collective bargaining regime in which agencies and unions would reach binding and stable collective bargaining agreements....&#8197;The so-called "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach adopted in <span class="Italic">IRS</span> undermines the collective bargaining regime established by Congress by effectively relieving one party of its contractual obligations. Under the Authority's approach, the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement will be enforced--at least insofar as matters implicating statutory rights are concerned--only if they are crystal clear, reflect no facial ambiguities and precisely cover the matter at issue....&#8197;Since this will rarely be the case, given the frailty of human drafters and the complexity of most public sector collective bargaining agreements, the result often will be to prevent the agency from enforcing the restrictions on union "rights" for which it has bargained, and to which the union has agreed. Thus, in many cases, the provisions of the parties' agreement will be rendered a nullity, in direct contravention of the FSLMRS's policies of contractual stability and repose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority attempts to defend its "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach on the ground that the approach is somehow necessary to <span id="Page_1200"></span>adequately protect "employee rights,"...but this view is unfounded and, even from the union's perspective, exceedingly myopic. Stable and enforceable collective bargaining agreements protect the interests of the agency and bargaining unit employees alike. Indeed, such agreements provide a far more effective bulwark for protecting employees' interests than do the relatively abstract statutory entitlements defined by the Authority in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>. By applying its "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach out of purported concern for the preservation of "statutory rights"--and thereby undermining the stability of the very collective bargaining process those rights exist to nourish--the Authority guards the building blocks of collective bargaining at the expense of the edifice itself. This result is in the long-term interest of neither party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As unfortunate as the results produced by the Authority's "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach are in this case, they are dwarfed by the consequences that will follow if the Authority extends the approach to refusal to bargain cases in which a contract provision is raised as a defense. In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, there is, at least arguably, a statutory right to be vindicated apart from the terms of the negotiated agreement. In the refusal to bargain context, however, the resolution of the unfair labor practice claim is <span class="Italic">entirely</span> a matter of contract interpretation, because whether there is a duty to bargain depends solely upon what the contract means. Under the Authority's "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach, the union would almost invariably prevail in duty to bargain cases, because it almost always could find some ambiguity in the relevant contractual language. The result would be an endless duty to bargain on the part of the agency, with a resultant evisceration of the FSLMRS's policies of contractual stability and repose.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the Authority found that the agency had committed an unfair labor practice based upon an application of its "clear and unmistakable waiver" approach. For the reasons explained above, we hold that the Authority committed legal error on several grounds: the Authority has failed to provide any reasoned justification for its departure from its prior "differing and arguable interpretations" approach; the "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis is illogical and internally inconsistent; and the results that flow from the new test contravene the policies of the FSLMRS. Because <span class="Italic">IRS</span> was decided under this flawed and impermissible approach, we must vacate the Authority's decision and remand for reconsideration.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On remand, the Authority should decide whether to return to the "differing and arguable interpretations" methodology or to adopt some other approach that is consistent with the FSLMRS and this opinion. The Intervenor suggests that the Authority may not have intended that the "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis applied here should extend to duty to bargain disputes. Subsequent cases suggest that the Authority has not adhered to the limitation suggested by the NTEU; furthermore, even with such a limitation, it is far from clear that the approach adopted here will survive scrutiny in <span class="Italic">any</span> case of this sort. In any event, we leave it to the FLRA in the first instance to consider whether the duty to bargain context is distinguishable from the circumstances of this case and, if so, what analysis should apply in such cases.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Fourth Circuit joined the D.C. Circuit analysis in setting aside <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 43 FLRA 318 (1991), based on FLRA's application of the "clear and unmistakable" approach, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA v. FLRA</span>, 976 F.2d 229, 230-35 (4th Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">on remand</span>, <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE</span>, 47 FLRA 1167 (1993)):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case involves a dispute between the Federal Labor Relations Authority (the "FLRA" or the "Authority") and the Social Security Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (the "SSA") regarding the standard that should be applied when assessing whether the parties' collective bargaining agreement has waived certain of the SSA employees' statutory rights. We find that the "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis, employed in this case by the FLRA, impermissibly biased the interpretation of the relevant collective bargaining agreement against the SSA and, accordingly, we vacate the order of the FLRA, deny the FLRA's cross-petition for enforcement, and remand the case to the FLRA for further proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On June 22, 1989, Keith Wooten, the union representative of SSA workers in Riverside, California, received an oral warning for distributing labor relations materials to the desks of employees during working hours. A management representative told Wooten that this distribution violated Article 12, Section 2A of the national collective bargaining agreement between SSA and the American Federation of Government Employees (the "Union"). Article 12, Section 2A of the agreement provides, in part:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Official publications of the Union may be distributed on SSA property by union representatives during the non-duty time of the union representatives who are distributing and the employees receiving the materials. Distribution shall not disrupt operations.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To fully understand the nature of the dispute between the SSA and the Union in this case, it is necessary to appreciate the interplay between the language of the collective bargaining agreement and the background statutory rights accorded to the Union representatives. In the absence of the collective bargaining agreement, statutory protection for the distribution of union materials would normally be limited to distribution of materials in non-work areas during non-duty hours. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7131(b); <span class="Italic">General Services Administration</span>, 27 FLRA 643, 645 (1987). However, more extensive rights within the scope of statutory protection can be established by an employer's practices with regard to non-union communications. According to the FLRA, if an employer makes an avenue of communication open to non-union sources, the employer cannot discriminate against the union in the use of those communication channels....</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed in this case that SSA allowed distribution to employees' desks, during work time, of non-union related communications. As a result, resolution of this dispute ultimately depends on whether Article 12, Section 2A of the collective bargaining agreement is read to restrict the union's distribution rights that would otherwise be established by the agency's practice with regard to non-union communications, or whether the collective bargaining agreement contemplates the accrual of such rights in addition to the rights explicitly conferred by the text of the agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On July 14, 1989, Wooten filed a grievance, seeking a retraction of the oral warning he had been given for the distributions during working hours. On November 29, 1989, the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge, alleging that management had interfered with and coerced the Union in violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7116(a)(1) by treating Wooten disparately from persons distributing non-union communications. The FLRA Administrative Law Judge (the "ALJ") dismissed the Union's complaint, holding that the issue was purely a matter of contractual interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and that, under the precedent of the FLRA, "even an employer agency's denial of employees' statutory rights is a matter for grievance and arbitration procedures rather than unfair labor practice procedures, if that denial is based on a plausible interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement."</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA overturned the ALJ's analysis and ruled in favor of the Union. It based this action on its intervening decision in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, 39 F.L.R.A. 1568 (1991), which rejected the principle that "differing and arguable" or "plausible" interpretations of a collective bargaining agreement were sufficient to force the FLRA to decline jurisdiction in favor of arbitral resolution of a dispute. Instead, the FLRA held that when statutory rights of the Union were involved, the dispute was a potential unfair labor practice within the jurisdiction of the FLRA. The FLRA took the position that the proper inquiry was whether the union has "clearly and unmistakably" waived the employees' statutory rights. In this case, the FLRA held that Article 12, Section 2A of the collective bargaining agreement could not be interpreted as a "clear and unmistakable" waiver of those distribution rights created by the SSA's practice of allowing non-union distribution of materials during working hours. Accordingly, the FLRA ordered the SSA to cease and desist from interfering with the distribution, during duty time, of union materials.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">SSA filed a timely petition for review in this court of the FLRA order.&#x2003;The FLRA filed a cross-application for enforcement. After the SSA filed its initial brief in this matter, and one day prior to the FLRA's filing of its initial brief, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed the FLRA's decision in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service, Washington, D.C.</span>, upon which the FLRA had based its decision in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA</span>, 963 F.2d 429 (D.C. Cir. 1992). ("<span class="Italic">IRS</span>"). Notwithstanding this development, the FLRA stands by its reasoning in <span class="Italic">IRS, Washington, D.C.</span>, and urges this court to disregard the holding of the D.C. Circuit.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">While generally the FLRA's interpretation of the Federal Service Labor Management Relations Statute (the "FS Labor Statute") is entitled to deference by reviewing courts when "reasonable and defensible," <span class="Italic">Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms v. FLRA</span>, 464 U.S. 89, 97, 104 S. Ct. 439, 444, 78 L. Ed.2d 195 (1983), we agree with the D.C. Circuit that the FLRA's "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis, as it has been applied to cases of this type, "defies common sense." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, at 431. As the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> opinion points out, under the standard adopted by the FLRA, "the FLRA never resolves the one issue it concedes to be dispositive--what the language of the contract means." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Instead, in this case, as in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the FLRA argues that there is a statutory right, concedes that there is language in the collective bargaining agreement directly bearing on the exercise of that right, and then holds that since there are conflicting plausible interpretations of the agreement, there can be no "clear and unmistakable waiver" of the statutory right, and therefore that the employing agency must lose the dispute. We believe, as the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> court held, that tipping the balance so severely in favor of the Union when interpreting the language of a collective bargaining agreement impermissibly undermines the integrity of the collective bargaining process, a process that Congress sought to advance through passage of the FS Labor Statute. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 USC 7101(a) (outlining Congressional findings on the benefits of collective <span id="Page_1201"></span>bargaining). Accordingly, we reject the FLRA's application of the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In an effort to define precisely our difficulty with the FLRA's analysis in this case, let us first state our agreement with the general proposition that waivers of statutory rights must be "clear and unmistakable." <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Metropolitan Edison Co. v. NLRB</span>, 460 U.S. 693, 708, 103 S. Ct. 1467, 1477, 75 L. Ed.2d 387 (1983). Were we in the position of evaluating the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard purely in the abstract, without any concrete applications by the FLRA to give the standard substance, we would likely find the standard to be a legitimate means of interpreting collective bargaining agreements. However, as a Supreme Court justice has recently remarked, "The meaning of any legal standard can only be understood by reviewing the actual cases in which it is applied." <span class="Italic">Planned Parenthood v. Casey</span>, __U.S.__, __ n.6, 112 S. Ct. 2791, 2843 n.6 (1992), 120 L. Ed.2d 674, 743 n.6 (Stevens, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). We cannot grant deference to the FLRA's recent application of the "clear and unmistakable waiver" test, as epitomized by the present case and <span class="Italic">IRS, Washington, D.C.</span>, because we find that the FLRA has used the test to avoid analysis of relevant contractual language.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The mere assertion of a colorable argument by the Union regarding the meaning of a provision of the collective bargaining agreement cannot, by itself, be sufficient to allow the Union to prevail in an unfair labor practice dispute. Instead, we believe the FLRA is obligated to utilize standard methods of contractual interpretation to assess whether there has, in fact, been a waiver of a statutory right. If, among the differing interpretations of a contractual provision, the interpretation asserted by an employing agency, that the provision waives a statutory right, is more plausible than the alternative interpretations, the employing agency must be entitled to prevail.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Our decision today is limited to a holding that the method of analysis that the FLRA has sought to implement, the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard, is, in its application, unacceptably skewed against the employing agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The FLRA contends that the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard is necessary to protect the rights of bargaining unit employees. According to the FLRA, in the absence of the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard, "a respondent to an unfair labor practice charge could violate protected statutory rights with impunity merely by proffering an interpretation of an existing agreement that was plausible, but without having to demonstrate that the interpretation was correct or even that it is more plausible than alternative interpretations." This argument is based on erroneous assumptions. In the first place, it assumes that the FLRA would have to dismiss the charge if it found that the parties had offered "differing and arguable" interpretations of the contract. As explained above, it has been the practice of the FLRA, at least in some instances, to dismiss unfair labor practice charges in such situations, in favor of arbitration. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group</span>, 30 FLRA at 331. However, this practice is entirely a self-imposed deferential doctrine, not compelled by any statutory command. In fact, by the express terms of 5 USC 7116(d), an employee is accorded jurisdiction before the FLRA for such claims. According to that provision, "issues which can be raised under a grievance procedure may, in the discretion of the aggrieved party, be raised under the grievance procedure or as an unfair labor practice [before the FLRA]." <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">NLRB v. C &#x0026; C Plywood Corp.</span>, 385 U.S. 421, 428, 87 S. Ct. 559, 564, 17 L. Ed.2d 486 (1967) (acknowledging that NLRB had jurisdiction to analyze collective bargaining agreement "so far as was necessary to determine" that Union did not waive statutory rights).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Even if the FLRA elects to continue its practice of dismissing unfair labor practice charges in situations where the parties advance "differing and arguable" interpretations of a collective bargaining agreement, the rights of aggrieved employees will still be fully protected. Contrary to the FLRA's argument, the mere assertion by an agency of a "plausible" interpretation of the contract will not insulate the agency from review of that interpretation. The agency must still convince an arbitrator that its interpretation is indeed correct. The implicit assumption of the FLRA is that if an employee brings an unfair labor practice charge before the FLRA and the FLRA dismisses the charge because there exist "differing and arguable" interpretations of the contract, the employee will be precluded, on the basis of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>, from seeking arbitration on the claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">American Fed'n of Gov't Employees, Local 1411 v. FLRA</span>, 960 F.2d 176 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (arbitration of employee's grievance barred by dismissal of an earlier-filed unfair labor practice charge, despite the fact that the charge had been dismissed on procedural grounds without a full hearing on the merits). This assumption is incorrect. As the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> court held, an unfavorable decision, even on procedural grounds, is completely distinguishable from dismissal "<span class="Italic">pursuant to a deferral policy adopted by the Authority</span>." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, at 437 n.9. In the present case, should the FLRA decide to dismiss the case in favor of arbitration based on the existence of "differing and arguable" interpretations of the collective bargaining agreement, the Union would not be barred, by having brought the prior unfair labor practice charge, from contesting the meaning of the agreement in an arbitration proceeding.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In sum, we hold that the decision of the FLRA must be reversed because the "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis employed by the FLRA caused the FLRA to give insufficient weight to the terms of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the parties. On remand, the FLRA can choose to follow its past practice of deferring "differing and arguable" interpretations of the collective bargaining agreement to resolution by arbitration. In the alternative, the FLRA can, by articulating reasonable grounds for departing from past decisions such as <span class="Italic">22nd Combat Support Group</span>, choose to resolve the dispute as an unfair labor practice under its own jurisdiction. If the FLRA chooses the latter course, however, it may not analyze the contract language under the "clear and unmistakable waiver" standard in its present form. That standard, in its past application by the FLRA, has been shown to be too easily manipulated against the employing agency. As stated in <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, the only way the choice of forum provision contained in section 7116(d) can have meaning is if "a similar analytic approach [is] followed...by both the arbitrator and the Authority with respect to matters over which there is concurrent jurisdiction." <span class="Italic">IRS</span>, at 438. Otherwise, there would be no incentive for an employee to ever choose arbitration as a means of dispute resolution, and the statutory choice of forum provision would be reduced to a nullity.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA reconsidered its position on remand of the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> case from the D.C. Circuit in <span class="Italic">IRS and NTEU</span>, 47 FLRA 1091, 1091, 1103-11 (1993), still considering the rights of the union official seeking to perform the responsibilities of a steward back in 1987 (by the time the case was decided in 1993, FLRA reported that the retired employee was no longer available to serve as steward, but that did not moot the case). FLRA decided that when faced with a ULP asserting a statutory violation, defending by an assertion that a contract permitted the conduct, FLRA would resolve the contract issue itself through its own process of contract interpretation. FLRA rejected an approach that deferred or referred the matter to a labor arbitrator:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case is before the Authority pursuant to a remand from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service v. FLRA,</span> 963 F.2d 429 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (<span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span>). The court vacated the Authority's decision in 39 FLRA 1568, in which we found that the Respondent had violated section 7116(a)(1) and (5) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute), and the court remanded the case for further proceedings. The parties filed supplemental statements on remand. We have decided to remand the matter to an administrative law judge to determine the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and to issue a recommended decision and order resolving the complaint accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">VI.&#x2003;Analysis and Conclusions</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case provides us with an opportunity to reexamine the Authority's approach to resolving defenses, based on a collective bargaining agreement, to alleged interference with statutory rights. On reexamination, we conclude that in unfair labor practice cases, such as this one, where the underlying dispute is governed by the interpretation and application of specific provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement, we will no longer apply the "clear and unmistakable waiver" analysis. We have carefully examined the court's decision in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> and the parties' statements on remand. We have formulated a new approach to these cases that will carry out the purposes and policies of the Statute. We now hold that when a respondent claims as a defense to an alleged unfair labor practice that a specific provision of the parties' collective bargaining agreement permitted its actions alleged to constitute an unfair labor practice, the Authority, including its administrative law judges, will determine the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement and will resolve the unfair labor practice complaint accordingly.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In adopting this approach, we reaffirm our rejection of the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis, as that analysis was applied by the Authority. We reiterate our objections to returning to such an analysis, as stated in our decision in <span class="Italic">IRS,</span> 39 FLRA at 1573. In particular, we reject the position of the Respondent that it is appropriate to dismiss a complaint alleging a violation of a statutory right even where there is no other forum in which to determine the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement and to resolve the allegation. Moreover, because the courts in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">HHS v. FLRA</span> misconstrued the Authority's application of the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis, we do not view those decisions as supporting an approach that would require the dismissal of an unfair labor practice complaint without further determining the meaning of the provision of the agreement that gave rise to the dispute. As acknowledged by all the parties in this case, the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> misconstrued the Authority's application of the "differing and arguable interpretations" analysis when the court stated that on dismissal these <span id="Page_1202"></span>cases were "refer[red]...to arbitration for a definitive interpretation of the[&#8197;] contract." 963 F.2d at 434. To the contrary, under the Authority's established interpretation of section 7116(d) of the Statute, the issue raised as an unfair labor practice was precluded from being raised in arbitration. For example, <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Administration Medical Center, Newington, Connecticut and National Association of Government Employees, Local R1-109,</span> 36 FLRA 441 (1990). Furthermore, a grievance likely would have been untimely under the applicable collective bargaining agreement. Accordingly, such cases were neither referred nor deferred. For example, in each of the cases cited by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA,</span> 963 F.2d at 434, the decision and order was a simple dismissal of the complaint. <span class="Italic">Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, California,</span> 33 FLRA 626, 642 (1988); <span class="Italic">Internal Revenue Service,</span> <span class="Italic">Washington, D.C.,</span> 27 FLRA 664, 675 (1987) ("The complaint is dismissed insofar as it relates to the Respondent's refusal to negotiate over those proposals found to concern disputes over the interpretation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement...."); <span class="Italic">Department of Health and Human Services, Social Security Administration,</span> 23 FLRA 422, 425 (1986). No additional action was ordered or anticipated.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In adopting an approach in which the Authority will determine the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, we confirm the Authority's jurisdiction and power to interpret collective bargaining agreements to the extent necessary to resolve an unfair labor practice case. Section 7105(a)(2)(G) and (I) of the Statute grants the Authority the power to resolve unfair labor practice complaints and to take such other actions as are necessary and appropriate to effectively administer the Statute. Moreover, section 7116(d) expressly authorizes an aggrieved party to raise an issue before the Authority whenever that issue could be raised either as an unfair labor practice or as a grievance. Clearly, even though a mere breach of a collective bargaining agreement is not an unfair labor practice under the Statute, the Authority is authorized to construe a collective bargaining agreement in order to decide an unfair labor practice case.<span class="Italic"> HHS v. FLRA,</span> 976 F.2d at 234 n.4 ("[W]e cannot see how the FLRA's jurisdiction in this area can be denied."). We note that in the private sector the courts have acknowledged that the NLRB is authorized to interpret collective bargaining agreements when necessary to resolve an unfair labor practice claim. <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; C Plywood,</span> 385 U.S. at 428; <span class="Italic">Local Union 1395, IBEW v. NLRB,</span> 797 F.2d 1027, 1030 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (<span class="Italic">Local Union 1395, IBEW</span>). We acknowledge that the Statute endorses arbitration as an effective means of resolving disputes. Nonetheless, Congress saw fit, through the clear language of section 7116(d), to grant jurisdiction to the Authority to resolve the same types of disputes when they are alleged as unfair labor practices. Moreover, the Authority is a tribunal that is familiar with collective bargaining and the interpretation and application of collective bargaining agreements. As pointed out by the General Counsel and the Charging Party, the Authority has developed skill and experience in dealing with collective bargaining agreements because of the duties and responsibilities of the Authority under the Statute in relation to collective bargaining and collective bargaining agreements. In particular, unlike the NLRB, the Authority resolves negotiability disputes filed under section 7105(a)(2)(E) of the Statute and resolves exceptions to arbitration awards filed under section 7122(a) of the Statute. We find it unmistakable, as did the Fourth Circuit, that the Authority's power is not subordinate to, or dependent on, the arbitral process.[3]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[3]&#x2003;In finding the Authority's power to be unmistakable, we reject the Respondent's claim that <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; C Plywood</span> should not be viewed as support for the jurisdiction of the Authority to interpret collective bargaining agreements. Although, as noted by the Respondent, the Supreme Court acknowledged in its decision that the applicable collective bargaining agreement contained no arbitration provision, the existence of an arbitration provision does not prevent the NLRB from interpreting a collective bargaining agreement. For example, in <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Huttig Sash &#x0026; Door Co.,</span> 377 F.2d 964 (8th Cir. 1967), the court ruled that the lack of an arbitration provision in<span class="Italic"> C &#x0026; C Plywood</span> was not "controlling" and specifically applied <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; C Plywood</span> and <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Acme Industrial Co.,</span> 385 U.S. 432 (1967) to hold that "of itself, neither the presence of a problem of contract interpretation nor the presence of an arbitration provision in the contract deprives the Board of jurisdiction." 377 F.2d at 969. <span class="Italic">See also Office and Professional Employees International Union, Local 425, AFL-CIO v. NLRB,</span> 419 F.2d 314 (D.C. Cir. 1969).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We reject the Respondent's claim that merely because the parties incorporate a statutory right in a collective bargaining agreement, the Authority's jurisdiction to resolve unfair labor practice complaints involving that right is supplanted by the coverage of the negotiated grievance procedure. Unlike the private sector, arbitration in the Federal sector is not the product of the parties' mutual voluntary agreement. Under section 7121 of the Statute, every collective bargaining agreement must contain a grievance procedure that provides for binding arbitration of all disputes within its coverage that are not satisfactorily settled. Thus, there is no basis in the Federal sector for viewing an arbitration clause as constituting a waiver of the right to file an unfair labor practice charge with respect to matters also covered by the grievance procedure. If such were the case, the choice given to the aggrieved party to raise issues either as an unfair labor practice or as a grievance would be illusory. Certainly, the collective bargaining agreement may affect the scope of the statutory right and for that reason, as found by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA,</span> the unfair labor practice complaint cannot be resolved without determining the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement. Furthermore, because it is the primary responsibility of the Authority to resolve unfair labor practices, we believe that the Authority is in a position to determine the effect of contract rights on statutory rights by determining the meaning of any contract provision raised as an affirmative defense to an alleged violation of the Statute. For these reasons, we do not believe that Congress intended the statutory mandate of a grievance procedure that provides for binding arbitration to supplant the Authority's unfair labor practice jurisdiction for matters also covered by the grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In confirming that, in general, the jurisdiction of the Authority to resolve unfair labor practice complaints and the jurisdiction of arbitrators to resolve grievances under the negotiated grievance procedure are, as described by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA,</span> "concurrent," 963 F.2d at 438, we have strong reservations as to whether section 7116(d) would permit a deferral policy similar to that of the NLRB under <span class="Italic">Collyer.</span> Although we recognize that both the D.C. Circuit and the Fourth Circuit have expressly rejected the claim that section 7116(d) prevents the Authority from adopting a deferral policy, we are reluctant to reverse the Authority's longstanding interpretation of section 7116(d) as precluding a deferral policy in the Federal sector because the Statute provides a choice to the aggrieved party. <span class="Italic">For example, Department of the Treasury, United States Customs Service, Region IV, Miami, Florida,</span> 19 FLRA 421, 422 n.5 (1985); <span class="Italic">Federal Aviation Administration, Spokane Tower/Approach Control,</span> 15 FLRA 668, 669 (1984). We note, in this regard, that all the parties in this case agree with this interpretation. <span class="Italic">See also Hammontree v. NLRB,</span> 925 F.2d 1486, 1494 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (<span class="Italic">en banc</span>) (<span class="Italic">Hammontree</span>) (suggesting that a statute would preclude deferral of an unfair labor practice only if it "authorize[d] the complainant to choose one cause of action--either contractual or statutory--and nullif[ied] the other."). Nevertheless, because of the view of the courts in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> and <span class="Italic">HHS v. FLRA</span>, for purposes of determining what approach we would take in these cases, we have assumed that the Authority could exercise its discretion and judgment to adopt a deferral or referral policy similar to the policy adopted by the NLRB under <span class="Italic">Collyer.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the question presented for our determination is whether, as a matter of discretion and judgment, we should defer or refer to arbitration those cases whose resolution turns on the meaning of provisions of the parties' collective bargaining agreement or whether the Authority itself should determine the meaning of the relevant provisions. In answering this question, we must reconcile two important statutory policies: (1) the policy of the Statute favoring the exercise of jurisdiction by the Authority to protect statutory rights and resolve unfair labor practice complaints; and (2) the policy of the Statute encouraging arbitration as a means of resolving labor disputes. In our view, the purposes and policies of the Statute are best served and accommodated if the Authority exercises its jurisdiction to resolve these unfair labor practice cases by determining the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Specifically, we are persuaded that the Authority should resolve the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement in these cases to better preserve and protect the rights granted by the Statute to employees, unions, and agency employers. We must be mindful that it is the primary responsibility of the Authority to protect statutory rights. Thus, we believe that the Authority must be protective of its jurisdiction to resolve unfair labor practice complaints in order to be available to resolve fundamental questions of statutory policy.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Significantly, our approach respects the aggrieved party's choice of the Authority pursuant to section 7116(d) of the Statute. Clearly, there are numerous variables and considerations that can influence the choice of forum under section 7116(d). In our view, aggrieved parties are in a better position than the Authority to weigh these advantages and disadvantages. One consideration that may weigh in favor of choosing the Authority as a forum for the resolution of unfair labor practices, particularly with respect to continuing violations, is the availability of temporary relief under section 7123(d) of the Statute when a complaint is issued. Another consideration is that the Authority's decision in an unfair labor practice proceeding is subject to direct judicial enforcement under section 7123(b) while an arbitrator's decision is subject to enforcement only if an unfair labor practice charge is filed for failure to comply with the award. In this regard, we also note the Charging Party's concern about the availability of judicial review of arbitration awards under section 7123(a). There is also the consideration of filing periods. Grievances generally must be filed more quickly than unfair labor practice charges, which under section 7118 of the Statute must usually be filed within 6 months of the alleged unlawful conduct. Furthermore, there are differences in the formality and procedures of the unfair labor <span id="Page_1203"></span>practice process as compared to the arbitration process that legitimately may cause the aggrieved party to prefer one over the other. In addition, we share the concern that Member Jenkins of the NLRB had about relinquishing jurisdiction to "an arbitrator whose decision by definition has no precedential value[.]" <span class="Italic">Collyer,</span> 192 NLRB at 851 (Jenkins, Member, dissenting). We believe that the parties and the process are both better served by the stability provided by the Authority's precedential decisions.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We also are persuaded that the Authority should provide its expertise and its investigative and legal resources to charging parties who have exercised their rights to choose a Federal agency, rather than an arbitral hearing, as the forum for resolution of such disputes. Furthermore, recourse to the Authority will avoid the delay in the vindication of statutory rights that would be caused by a deferral or referral to arbitration. In declining to adopt a deferral or referral policy, we also have been influenced by our serious concern over the cost of arbitration. As the D.C. Circuit has acknowledged, "[p]re-arbitral deferral might constitute an effective denial of any remedy if, for example, arbitration of the dispute would impose an undue financial burden upon one of the parties." <span class="Italic">Local Union No. 2188, IBEW v. NLRB,</span> 494 F.2d 1087, 1091 (D.C. Cir. 1974). With an agency shop prohibited in the Federal sector, <span class="Italic">National Treasury Employees Union and U.S. Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service,</span> 38 FLRA 615, 625 (1990), the reality of the Federal sector is that the potential for an undue financial burden in imposing arbitration of unfair labor practice charges on unions is considerably greater than in the private sector. As noted by both the General Counsel and the Charging Party, the cost of arbitration for a matter deferred or referred to arbitration might be a significant barrier to many Federal unions. Consequently, in many cases, the Authority may be the only effective means available to charging parties to vindicate statutory rights.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In addition, retention of the entire case by the Authority has the virtue of administrative simplicity. Obviously, a deferral or referral policy would be complicated by the numerous exceptions that would need to be established for cases for which deferral or referral would be inappropriate or inadvisable. A policy of retention also avoids complications caused by the inevitable questions in complex cases of what matter is being referred or deferred and how that matter is to be processed. In addition, it is a policy that, at least, has the acceptance of the General Counsel and the Charging Party. In contrast, we note that none of the parties in this case or in <span class="Italic">HHS v. FLRA</span> favors adoption of a deferral or referral policy. We fail to see the wisdom in exercising our discretion to impose on the parties a policy that none has requested and that none wants.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">An approach in which the Authority will interpret the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement also is responsive to the criticisms of the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA</span> regarding the Authority's previous handling of such cases. If the Authority resolves the meaning of the parties' agreement, the Authority will be addressing the dispositive issue in this type of case. Thus, the Authority will preserve the integrity of collective bargaining agreements and respect the actual meaning of a parties' agreement. In resolving the unfair labor practice complaint, the Authority will enforce any applicable rights and obligations to which the parties have agreed in their collective bargaining agreement. By this approach, we support the stability and repose encouraged by the Statute and provide an effective bulwark for protecting the interests of agency employers, unions, and employees. Furthermore, we assure the promise of section 7116(d) of a meaningful choice of forums, as discussed by the court in <span class="Italic">IRS v. FLRA.</span> The court explained that by providing for a choice of forum, section 7116(d) assumes that a similar analytical approach would be followed by both the arbitrator and the Authority with respect to matters over which there is concurrent jurisdiction. 963 F.2d at 438. When the Authority resolves the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, that approach is similar to the approach an arbitrator would follow if the aggrieved party had chosen to raise the issue under the negotiated grievance procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, the basis for deferral or referral in the Federal sector is not nearly as compelling as in the private sector. The NLRB's plurality opinion in <span class="Italic">Collyer</span> relied on the statutory policy expressed in section 203(d) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 173(d), which encourages the parties to resolve their disputes through the "method agreed on by the parties[.]" We do not read the Statute as providing a counterpart to section 203(d). Although the Statute certainly encourages the use of arbitration, we do not find that "Congress has expressly legislated a preference for the use of private remedies, whenever feasible, before the resort to public remedies." <span class="Italic">Hammontree,</span> 925 F.2d at 1497. In fact, section 7116(d) suggests that the Statute is neutral in this regard by expressly providing the aggrieved party with a choice. Consequently, one of the prudential considerations strongly supporting the NLRB's policy of deferral is absent in the Federal sector.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">To assure the intent of Congress in providing for a meaningful choice of forums under section 7116(d), we hold that the Authority in resolving these cases will apply the same standards and principles in interpreting collective bargaining agreements as applied by arbitrators in both the Federal and private sectors and the Federal courts under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 185. As part of these standards, we note, for example, that "collective bargaining agreements must be read in light of the realities of labor relations and considerations of federal labor policy, which make up the background against which such agreements are entered." <span class="Italic">Local Union 1395, IBEW,</span> 797 F.2d at 1033 (citations omitted). The focus will be on the interpretation of the express terms of the collective bargaining agreement. <span class="Italic">HHS v. FLRA,</span> 976 F.2d at 235. Nevertheless, the meaning of the agreement must "[u]ltimately...depend[&#8197;] on the intent of the contracting parties." <span class="Italic">Local Union 1395, IBEW,</span> 797 F.2d at 1034 (quoting <span class="Italic">Gateway Coal Co. v. UMW,</span> 414 U.S. 368, 382 (1974)). The parties' intent must be given controlling weight, "whether that intent is established by the language of the clause itself, by inferences drawn from the contract as a whole, or by extrinsic evidence." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 1036. In giving controlling weight to the intent of the parties, caution should be exercised so that such intent "is not...discerned by reference to 'abstract definitions unrelated to the context in which the parties bargained,' especially where bargaining history is crucial to an understanding of that intent." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> (quoting <span class="Italic">C &#x0026; C Plywood,</span> 385 U.S. at 430; citation omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">We note that, in these cases, once the General Counsel makes a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that a respondent's actions would constitute a violation of a statutory right, the respondent may rebut the General Counsel's showing of a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case. This may be done by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the parties' collective bargaining agreement allowed the respondent's actions. <span class="Italic">For example, Action,</span> 26 FLRA 299, 301 (1987). Furthermore, in determining the meaning of the collective bargaining agreement, the administrative law judge should consider, as necessary, any alleged past practices relevant to the interpretation of the agreement. In cases where the judge's interpretation of the meaning of the parties' collective bargaining agreement is challenged on exceptions, the Authority will determine whether the judge's interpretation is supported by the record and by the standards and principles of interpreting collective bargaining agreements applied by arbitrators and the Federal courts.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying this approach in this case, we have determined to remand this case to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for assignment to an administrative law judge. The judge assigned this case should give the parties an opportunity to provide evidence and testimony on the meaning of Article 9 of NORD II. The judge should then determine whether Article 9 allowed the Respondent to refuse to recognize Cleveland Harris as a steward-at-large, and the judge should resolve the unfair labor practice complaint accordingly.</p>

<p class="noindent">There is little definition of what constitutes arbitration "standards and principles" of contract interpretation. Contract definitions and bargaining history will be considered. In the absence of either, an ALJ was justified in looking to OPM literature for definition of "detail" as that term was employed in a contract. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Border Patrol Livermore Sector and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 58 FLRA 231, 232 (2002). But applying the <span class="Italic">IRS</span> decision, FLRA interprets contract articles as it thinks arbitrators would, referring, as some arbitrators do, to seminal works on the subject. <span class="Italic">DOJ, INS and AFGE Nat'l Border Patrol Council</span>, 52 FLRA 256, 261-62 (1996), applied a contract provision concerning mid-term bargaining obligations:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...Accordingly, if the 'views' referenced in Article 3, section G do not encompass "proposals," then it is not clear that the Union has any contractual entitlement to submit proposals at all. Such a construction of the parties' agreement would clearly produce a harsh and inequitable result, and, to this extent, would be inconsistent with the standards and principles of interpreting collective bargaining agreements applied by arbitrators and the Federal courts. <span class="Italic">See</span>,<span class="Italic"> e.g.</span>, O. Fairweather, <span class="Italic">Practice and Procedure in Labor Arbitration</span>, 177 (3d ed. 1991); Elkouri and Elkouri, <span class="Italic">How Arbitration Works</span>, 342 (4th ed. 1985).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...When possible, arbitrators and the Federal courts will attempt to construe ambiguous language in one provision of an agreement so as to be compatible with the language in other provisions of the agreement. Fairweather at 176; Elkouri at 352. Construing the reference to "views" in the first paragraph as encompassing "proposals" makes the two paragraphs compatible; adopting the General Counsel's interpretation does not.</p>
