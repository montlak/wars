<h5 class="h5" id="sec15-155"><span class="space">b.</span> Articulated Analysis Required</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">An AJ who decides to cut fees is required to explain what is taking place and why it is being done. The reductions are not to be arbitrary or unreasoned. <span class="Italic">Rose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 14 (1991). <span class="Italic">Fagan v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 29 MSPR 64, 65 (1985), explained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To support his fee request, appellant's counsel submitted a detailed accounting of his billed hours....&#8197;However, she found the total hours billed excessive because the merits of the appeal, which involved the denial of a within-grade salary increase, were not complex. In making this determination, the presiding official noted that she had carefully reviewed counsel's Itemized Schedule of Services Performed and Time Expended. Aside from her general statement that counsel charged more than was reasonable in preparation and research time, she did not specify the particular hourly charges which were excessive. We find that the presiding official erred in failing to more specifically identify which hourly charges were excessive and by what amount they were reduced.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit restricted unrestrained fee cutting in <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. MSPB</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 194 (Fed. Cir. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court addressed the issue of billable hours in the context of a district court's determination of a reasonable fee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The party seeking an award of fees should submit evidence supporting the hours worked and rates claimed. Where the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The district court should also exclude from this initial fee calculation hours that were not "reasonably expended."...&#8197;Cases may be overstaffed, and the skill and experience of lawyers vary widely. Counsel for the prevailing party should make a good-faith effort to exclude from a fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise unnecessary, just as a lawyer in private practice ethically is obligated to exclude such hours from his fee submission. "In the private sector, 'billing judgment' is an important component in fee setting. It is no less important here. Hours that are not properly billed to one's <span class="Italic">client</span> also are not properly billed to one's <span class="Italic">adversary</span> pursuant to statutory authority."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433-34 (1983).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a party submits a request for an award of fees, the presiding official must make a determination whether the hours claimed are justified....&#8197;Like a district court judge entertaining a request for statutory fees, the presiding official "has to make a judgment--considering the nature of the case and the details of the request, taking evidence if need be, and defending his judgment in a reasoned (though brief) opinion--on what the case should have cost the party who submitted the request."...&#8197;Accordingly, in the factual situation presented here we <span id="Page_4703"></span>apply to the Board decision the following standard another circuit court applies to its district courts:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The hours claimed need not be automatically accepted by the district court, but to the extent that hours are rejected, the court must indicate some reason for its action, so that we may determine whether the court properly exercised its discretion or made an error of law in its conclusion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[W]e hold that if a district court decides to eliminate hours of service adequately documented by the attorneys, it must identify those hours and articulate its reasons for their elimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Northcross v. Board of Educ.</span>, 611 F.2d 624, 636-37 (6th Cir. 1979), <span class="Italic">cert.</span> <span class="Italic">den.</span>, 447 U.S. 911 (1980). We leave for another day whether the Board must identify the eliminated hours in a different factual situation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Heiar v. Crawford County, Wisconsin</span>, 746 F.2d at 1204 (suggesting not worth judge's time where small amount of $1,000 requested); <span class="Italic">New York Ass'n for Retarded Children v. Carey</span>, 711 F.2d 1136, 1140-41, 1146 (2d Cir. 1983) (unrealistic to expect trial judge to evaluate every entry in voluminous application requesting $2.5 million for 16,410 hours).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no suggestion here that the documentation of hours claimed was inadequate. Nor is there any indication that the government offered any evidence or reasoned analysis in support of its contention that the number of hours claimed was excessive; there is not even any evidence of the amount of time the government spent on the case. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sierra Club v. EPA</span>, 769 F.2d 796, 807 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Rather, the presiding official was apparently trying to "impose fair standards of efficiency and economy of time....&#8197;In making this determination, I am also weighing the time claimed against my expertise and experience, the experience of counsel and the complexity of the case."...&#8197;Courts have recognized the importance of similar considerations....&#8197;Nevertheless, that did not relieve the Board from providing "a concise but clear explanation of its reasons."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead of such an explanation, the presiding official all too often here simply concluded that certain hours claimed were excessive. Similarly, the Board, reviewing a disallowance of hours which the presiding official failed to so much as comment on, stated merely that "the record suggests duplicative effort."...&#8197;Conclusory remarks like those are wholly inadequate under the required standard. Accordingly, on remand the Board will examine the record, take evidence if need be, and make its determination supported by a concise but clear <span class="Italic">explanation</span> of its reasons for any reduction of the hours awarded from those claimed in each of the four phases.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board provided guidance to AJs regarding their practice of trimming counsel's hours, <span class="Italic">Harris v. USDA</span>, 33 MSPR 237, 240-41 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]e find that the administrative judge erred in reducing the number of hours claimed by the appellant....&#8197;[T]he administrative judge reduced the 189.03 hours he found that Mr. Chapman claimed for the initial litigation of the case to 66.83 hours; the 72.15 hours for filing the petition for review to 50 hours; and the 29.75 hours for work on the attorney fees motion to 20 hours.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The rationale provided by the administrative judge for these substantial reductions does not satisfy the standard established in <span class="Italic">Northcross v. Board of Education</span>, 611 F.2d 624, 636-37 (6th Cir. 1979)...and approved in <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 191 (Fed. Cir. 1986)....&#8197;In <span class="Italic">Northcross</span>, the court held that if a judge decides to eliminate hours of service adequately documented by an attorney, he must identify those hours and articulate his reasons for their elimination. Here, Mr. Chapman described each service provided and identified the date, hours, and charge for the service. The administrative judge generally discussed some activities by Mr. Chapman which he believes were non-productive....&#8197;[H]e did not specifically identify which hours claimed...for these services were not justified. Rather, he simply concluded that the time spent for these activities was excessive and substituted round figures for the amounts charged which, in his judgment, represent a reasonable amount of time for these activities.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We...find that the 289.43 hours claimed are reasonable. We note that the appellant's case has a lengthy history before the Board--the appellant appealed his removal over four years ago and the Board has already issued two opinions and remanded the appellant's case to its regional office twice....&#8197;[The] fee submission...is itemized appropriately and contains no obvious duplication or padding. Therefore, we conclude that the administrative judge's decision to reduce these hours is not supported.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 307 (1996) ("While the appellant could have sent a one-sentence letter to the deciding official explaining that he had filed his tax returns and was due a refund, as the administrative judge suggested, this does not mean that the drafting of a more involved letter setting forth a possible reason for mitigating the removal, and the attendant time spent on the consultation between counsel and client, was unreasonable.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of a remand caused by the AJ's improper reduction of compensable hours is <span class="Italic">Hand v. Dept. of Army</span>, 56 MSPR 334, 337-38 (1993):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The appellant further asserts that the administrative judge erroneously denied certain hours that were specifically identified, and improperly denied other hours without sufficient explanation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In reaching her conclusion, the administrative judge first identified 68 hours claimed for work performed on specific dates between September 16, 1989, and February 14, 1990, and explained why the appellant was entitled to only 32 of these claimed hours. Included in these hours was a February 7, 1990, claim of 8 hours of legal research for the 47-page post-hearing brief. The administrative judge allowed only 4 of the claimed hours, finding that the brief consisted mostly of arguing the facts and did not reflect extensive research. We disagree. Not only is 8 hours a reasonable figure for the preparation of such a lengthy brief, but arguing the facts is particularly crucial at the trial level, where facts are found, and for the most part, remain unchanged by reviewing bodies. We, therefore, allow all of the 8 hours claimed for this work.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">After deducting the disallowed 36 hours from the 407 requested hours, the administrative judge found that the remaining 371 hours were excessive, and that only 240 hours could be approved for the time in question, in light of the nature of the charges at issue, and the complexity of the discrimination issue. We find that the administrative judge erred in this regard because she did not specify which of these disallowed 131 hours represented an inefficient or unproductive use of time. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Robinson v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 37 MSPR 547, 553 (1988). Further, to the extent that the administrative judge stated generally that the charges were simple and the issues were not complex, such conclusory statements are insufficient to justify a general reduction of the number of hours claimed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Crumbaker v. Merit Systems Protection Board</span>, 781 F.2d 191, 195 (Fed. Cir. 1986), <span class="Italic">modified</span>, 827 F.2d 761 (Fed. Cir. 1987). We, therefore, conclude that remand is necessary for the administrative judge to specifically identify the hours she deems excessive and the reasons for her conclusions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has also requested additional attorney fees for 15 hours spent in preparing the instant petition for review, and 3 hours for work done in response to the agency's motion to disqualify his representative. Because we are unable at this time to determine the extent to which the appellant will prevail on the basis of this petition for review, a ruling on the appellant's entitlement to an award of reasonable attorney fees for the time spent preparing the petition must await the outcome of this case on remand.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also find, however, that the appellant is entitled to an award of attorney fees for the 3 hours of work done in responding to the agency's motion to disqualify his representative. This work was done in response to a specific objection raised by the agency, which could not have been anticipated by the appellant before receipt of the agency's filing. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Rose v. Department of the Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 5, 16-17 (1991). We further note that the appellant has prevailed with respect to this issue....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When an AJ concludes that time or fees are excessive because a case is simple, the Board prefers a more realistic, analytical approach to the complexities of personnel litigation, <span class="Italic">Taylor v. DOJ</span>, 69 MSPR 299, 305-06 (1996):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also disagree with the administrative judge's conclusion that the issues in the case were simple. While the fundamental legal issue of mitigation of a penalty is neither novel, <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>, 5 MSPB 313, 5 MSPR 280, 306 (1981), nor complex in and of itself, this case involved an extensive and detailed factual record. Furthermore, the final Board decision on the merits discusses in depth the appellant's interpretation of the charge in light of tax law, as well as the numerous mitigating factors that the appellant brought to the attention of the deciding official, the administrative judge, and, ultimately, the full Board. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 MSPR at 686. In this connection, we note (as does the appellant) that the agency's response to the appellant's petition for review on the merits is over 45 pages long, and contains citations to 42 cases and 151 footnotes. While prolixity in pleadings is not always relevant in assessing the complexity of a case, we believe that, here, the length of, and degree of detail in, the agency's response to the appellant's petition for review on the merits, illustrate well the overall complexity of the appeal.</p>
