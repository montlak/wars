<h4 class="h4" id="sec2-188"><span class="space">1.</span> Union Merger; Change in Affiliation</h4>
<p class="noindent">The question of what constitutes a nominal certification change in the context of union mergers was addressed in <span class="Italic">Fla. NG, St. Augustine, Fla. and NAGE Local R5-107</span>, 25 FLRA 728 (1987). Apparently two locals merged into Local R5-107. The acquired Local, R5-120, sought by amendment of a certification to change its name on the certification to Local R5-107. The regional director dismissed the union petition, determining that to ensure the amendment based on a merger of locals accurately reflected the desires of the membership, procedures established under Executive Order 11491, described in <span class="Italic">VA Hosp., Montrose</span>, 4 A/SLMR 859 (1974), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 3 FLRC 259 (1975), <span class="Italic">post</span>, must be followed. FLRA declined to reconsider the regional decision, 25 FLRA at 729:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The unpublished decision of the Authority in <span class="Italic">U.S. Army Research and Development Command</span>, Case No. 2-AC-1 (July 30, 1980), supports the application of such procedures to a merger of locals of the same national union. Moreover, the private-sector practice is to apply generally the same procedures to both mergers and affiliation changes. The National Labor Relations Board has generally applied, with court approval, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">NLRB v. Commercial Letter, Inc.</span>, 496 F.2d 35 (8th Cir. 1974), the same procedures to mergers as it has applied to changes in affiliation, <span class="Italic">for example</span>, <span class="Italic">F.W. Woolworth Co.</span>, 268 NLRB 805, 806 (1984).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="Italic">VA Hosp., Montrose</span>, 4 A/SLMR 859 (1974), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 3 FLRC 259 (1975), considered a request for a change of affiliation, initiated by a majority of the members of Carpenters Local 2440, who wished to switch to AFGE and become AFGE Local 2440. The transfer had the approval of both national unions. The local officers, who were to remain the same, continued to hold regular meetings with the employer, and they continued to represent the interests of unit members. The Assistant Secretary declined to approve the AFGE petition for amendment of recognition, <span class="Italic">Montrose</span>, 4 A/SLMR at 860:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">[I]n order to assure that an amendment for certification or recognition conforms to the desires of the membership, the following steps, at a minimum, should be taken: (1) a proposed change in affiliation should be the subject of a special meeting of the members of the incumbent labor organization, called for this purpose only, with adequate advance notice provided to the entire membership; (2) the meeting should take place at a time and place convenient to all members; (3) adequate time for discussion of the proposed change should be provided, with all members given an opportunity to raise questions within the bounds of normal parliamentary procedure; and (4) a vote by the members of the incumbent labor organization on the question should be taken by secret ballot, with the ballot clearly stating the change proposed and the choices inherent therein.</p>
<p class="noindent">The membership referenced in <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> is the membership of the union, not the entire bargaining unit membership. <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Navajo Area and Nat'l Council of Bureau of Indian Affairs Educators</span>, 34 FLRA 428 (1990). The petition to amend the certification is to be filed by the union whose certification is to be changed, not by a gaining entity, <span class="Italic">Army Reserve Command, 88th Reg'l Support Command and AFGE Local 2144</span>, 53 FLRA 1174, 1177-79 (1998):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A petition to amend a certificate to reflect a union's change in affiliation may only be filed by the organization that is the exclusive representative (the incumbent). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, 52 FLRA at 782; <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of Defense, National</span> <span class="Italic">Guard Bureau, New York National Guard, Division of Military and Naval Affairs, Latham, New York</span>, 46 FLRA 1468, 1473-74 (1993) (<span class="Italic">National Guard</span>). In <span class="Italic">National Guard</span>, for example, the Authority held that a local union did not have standing to file a petition to amend the certification relating to its unit where its parent national union was certified as the exclusive representative, even though the local union alleged that it had been acting as the exclusive representative. Similarly, in <span class="Italic">EPA</span>, the Authority held that petitions to amend certification may only be filed on behalf of an incumbent union by one who has authority to act for it. 52 FLRA at 782 (dismissing the petition to amend certification based on the finding that because a trusteeship had been properly imposed by the national union, the Local President did not have any authority to file the petition).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, only an authorized agent of the incumbent labor organization--AFGE, Local 1882--has standing to file a petition to amend the incumbent's certification.[5] <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 52 FLRA at 782; <span class="Italic">National Guard</span>, 46 FLRA at 1473. There is no assertion by Local 2144 and nothing in the record indicating that at the time the petition was filed by the President of Local 2144, that individual was authorized to file the petition on behalf of Local 1882. <span class="Italic">Cf</span>. <span class="Italic">U.S. Department of the Army, Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island</span>, <span class="Italic">Illinois</span>, 46 FLRA 76, 82 (1992) (although the individual filing the amendment petition held a position in the non-incumbent labor organization, at the time the petition was filed, he was the acting vice president of the incumbent and had authority to act on its behalf). As the President of Local 2144 had no standing to file the petition to amend certification, it must be dismissed.[6]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[5]&#x2003;[T]he representation regulations were revised in 1996. However, there is nothing in the revised regulations indicating that a non-incumbent labor organization now has authority to act on behalf of an incumbent. <span class="Italic">See EPA</span>, 52 FLRA at 782; <span class="Italic">National Guard</span>, 46 FLRA at 1473. Moreover, the Authority never indicated in issuing the new regulations that it intended those revisions to have the effect of permitting a non-incumbent labor organization to file a petition such as the one in this case. <span class="Italic">See</span> 60 Fed.

<p class="noindent-2">[6]&#x2003;Having resolved AFGE, Local 1882's application for review on the grounds discussed above, we do not address the Union's additional arguments. In particular, given the posture of this case, we do not herein reach the question of whether <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> procedures are appropriate for accomplishing a change in affiliation from one local union to another of the same national or international union, or if so, how they would apply.</p>

FLRA concluded that the <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> procedures apply to mergers under the Statute. The units in <span class="Italic">Fla. NG</span> were not consolidated. "Consolidation of existing bargaining units is accomplished through procedures which are different from those used in this case." <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> does not apply to changes in affiliations that affect representational responsibilities across, rather than within, units. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">NAGE/SEIU Local 5000 and VA</span>, 52 FLRA 1068, 1081-82 &#x0026; n.13 (1997), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Bureau of Indian Affairs, supra</span>, 34 FLRA at 446, quoted the decision of the Supreme Court in <span class="italic">NLRB v. Fin. Inst. Employees of Am., Local</span> 1182, 475 U.S. 192, 202 (1986), explaining the rationale for the election procedure required for changes in affiliation:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Of course, as is the case with any organizational and structural change, a new affiliation may substantially change a certified union's relationship with the employees it represents. These changed circumstances may in turn raise a "question of representation," if it is unclear whether a majority of employees continue to support the recognized union. Thus, in these situations, the affiliation implicates the employees' right to select a bargaining representative, and to protect the employees' interests, the situation may require that the Board exercise its authority to conduct a representation election.</p>
<p class="noindent">A change of affiliation is conducted unit by unit. A single local may represent two units, for example, units of professional and nonprofessional employees, under a single negotiated agreement. The Montrose requirements must be met as to each unit that is subject to the petition to amend the certificate of recognition. <span class="italic">See Dept. of Interior, BLM Phoenix, Ariz. and NFFE Local 376</span>, 56 FLRA 202, 204-06 (2000). Under <span class="italic">Dept. of Interior</span>, supra, if investigation of the petition to amend the certificate reveals that a question concerning representation exists, for example, if one of the units involved appears to be defunct, the regional director may direct a hearing and election. Id. at 206-07. "A change in affiliation affects the designation of the exclusive representative for an existing unit--the internal organization of the union--and does not change the scope of the bargaining unit in any way." <span class="italic">NAGE/SEIU Local 5000 and VA</span>, 52 FLRA 1068 (1997), <span class="italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that <span class="Italic">Montrose</span> requirements are met, there is no time limit for the unit to subsequently file a request for amendment of its certification as exclusive representative, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Army, Ft. Detrick and AFGE Local 2484</span>, 62 FLRA 407, 407-10 (2008):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In June 2003, Local 2484 sent a notice to each of its members stating that a special meeting of Local 2484's members would be held to discuss and vote on whether Local 2484 should "merge" with Local 1923. The following month, Local 2484 held a meeting of the members in its five bargaining units to discuss and vote on whether it should affiliate with Local 1923. Twenty-seven members attended the meeting. The members <span id="page_177"></span>unanimously voted in favor of affiliation by secret ballot. According to the RD, the President of Local 2484 provided undisputed testimony that "members of each of the five bargaining units at issue...voted. More than two years later, Local 2484 filed a petition to amend its certification to reflect the change in its affiliation from Local 2484 to Local 1923. The petition, as amended at the hearing, covers the five bargaining units represented by Local 2484 at the Agency.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Citing<span class="Italic"> NLRB v. Financial Institution Employees of America, Local 1182, </span>475 U.S. 192 (1986) (<span class="Italic">Fin. Inst. Employees</span>)<span class="Italic">, </span>the RD stated that a change in an exclusive representative's affiliation is an internal union matter, unless the change alters the representative's relationship with members of the bargaining unit such that a question concerning representation (QCR) is raised (i.e., a question whether a majority of the bargaining unit supports the exclusive representative). The RD further stated that the Court identified two conditions that are necessary in order for an exclusive representative to change affiliation through a vote by its members: (1) due process (i.e., whether members of the exclusive representative have an adequate opportunity to vote on the change); and (2) evidence of substantial continuity between the exclusive representative as it existed before and as it exists after the change in affiliation (i.e., whether the procedures followed by, and the autonomy of, the exclusive representative's officers are the same before and after the change). <span class="Italic">See id.</span> at 7-8 (citing <span class="Italic">Fin. Inst. Employees</span>, 475 U.S. at 198-200).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Applying these conditions, the RD found that Local 2484 had satisfied both of them. With respect to the first condition, the RD concluded that the change in affiliation satisfied due process because it was accomplished in a manner consistent with the procedural criteria for changing affiliation first stated in <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration Hospital, Montrose, New York, </span>4 A/SLMR 858 (1974), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 3 FLRC 259 (1975) (<span class="Italic">Montrose</span>). With respect to the second condition, the RD concluded that there was evidence of substantial continuity between Local 2484 as it existed before, and as it exists after, the change in affiliation. In this regard, the RD found that there was no material change in the autonomy or control of the day-to-day operations of Local 2484. The only change cited by the RD was the elimination of the position of President, Local 2484. The RD further found that the officers of Local 2484 "have retained their authority and discretion to deal with management concerning matters affecting employees in each unit" and serve on the Executive Board of Local 1923.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD also rejected the Agency's argument that the petition filed by Local 2484 was untimely because it was filed more than two years after the vote to change affiliation. Based on the record, the RD found that there was no evidence that a QCR existed or that a reasonable doubt existed about the majority status of Local 1923 or any of the affected bargaining units. In so finding, the RD acknowledged that the petition had been filed more than two years after the members voted to change affiliation and that there had been "some unspecified amount of turnover" in the bargaining units since the vote. The RD further rejected the Agency's reliance on the Statute, the Authority's Regulations, and the Office of General Counsel Representation Proceedings Case Handling Manual in support of its argument that the petition was untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Based on his findings, the RD concluded that Local 2484 satisfied the conditions necessary to affiliate with Local 1923. Accordingly, the RD granted Local 2484's petition to amend its certification.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">A.&#x2003;The RD did not err in finding that Local 2484's petition was timely.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The procedures for filing a petition to amend an existing certification of an exclusive representative are set forth in &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) of the Statute. Under that section, the Authority is required to investigate the petition and, if it finds that a QCR exists, then the Authority is required to conduct an election on the question, as appropriate. <span class="Italic">See </span>5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2). Neither &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2), nor the implementing regulations set forth in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.28, set forth a time limit for filing a petition to amend a certification of an exclusive representative.[4]</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[4]&#x2003;In circumstances not relevant here, we note that &#x00A7; 7111(b) bars a representation election in the same unit for a twelve-month period. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7111(b) ("An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any appropriate unit or in any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding 12 calendar months, a valid election under this subsection has been held.")</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The RD rejected the Agency's argument that the petition filed by Local 2484 was untimely because it was filed more than two years after the vote to change affiliation. Although the Agency concedes that there is no statutory or regulatory time limit for filing a petition to amend a certification to reflect a change in affiliation, the Agency argues that the Authority should rule that such a petition must be filed within sixty calendar days of the date of the vote to change affiliation to ensure that the wishes of the members of the exclusive representative are accurately reflected when the petition is filed. In support, the Agency argues that, in the absence of a statutory or regulatory time limit for filing a petition to amend a certification to reflect a change in affiliation under &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2), the Authority should look to "similar mandates" in other sections of the Statute, such as the fifteen-day time limit in &#x00A7; 7117(c)(2)(A) for filing negotiability appeals and the six-month time limit in &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) for filing unfair labor practice (ULP) charges. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="noindent-1">Contrary to the Agency's argument, the fact that Congress included time limits for filing ULP charges and negotiability petitions, but did not include a time limit for filing petitions to amend a certification under &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2), supports a presumption that Congress did not intend a time limit for that filing. If, as the Agency maintains, Congress intended a time limit for filing a petition to amend a certification under &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2), then Congress could have easily made that clear. <span class="Italic">See BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp.</span>, 511 U.S. 531, 537 (1994) (citing<span class="Italic"> City of Chicago v. Envtl. Def. Fund</span>, 511 U.S. 328, 338 (1994)) ("[I]t is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another[.]"). Consequently, the statutory provisions relied on by the Agency undermine, rather than support, its position.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Further, the absence of a time limit in &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2)<span class="Italic"> </span>is consistent with the nature of the matters at issue, which are not time-sensitive. In this regard, &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) requires an inquiry by the Authority that focuses on whether a QCR exists at the time of the investigation. Consistent with this statutory scheme, the Authority's practice in representation cases requires an assessment of the record based on the circumstances existing at the time of the hearing. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of the Air Force, 82nd Training Wing, 361st Training Squadron, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md., </span>57 FLRA 154, 157<span class="Italic"> </span>(2001) (Authority bases unit determinations on duties actually assigned to employees at the time of a representation hearing, rather than on plans to assign the duties in the future); <span class="Italic">Def. Logistics Agency, Def. Supply Ctr. Columbus, Columbus, Ohio</span>, 53 FLRA 1114, 1123 (1998) (Authority does not require that the impact of job changes on bargaining units must be immediately raised or waived); <span class="Italic">Dep't of the Army, Headquarters, Fort Dix, Fort Dix, N.J</span>., 53 FLRA 287, 295 (1997) (bargaining unit certifications do not become stale over time if they continue to accurately describe the organization and employees). In contrast, the time limits set forth in &#x00A7; 7117(c)(2)(A) for negotiability appeals and in &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) for ULP charges reflect that those procedures are time-sensitive and should be timely resolved. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Air Force Flight Test Ctr. Edwards Air Force Base, Cal.</span>, 55 FLRA 116, 120 (1999) (intent of &#x00A7; 7118(a)(4)(A) is to foster stable collective bargaining relationships and prevent the litigation of stale charges); <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 3407</span>, 41 FLRA 265, 270 (1991) (citing<span class="Italic"> NFFE, Local 1167 v. FLRA</span>, 681 F.2d 886, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1982)) (&#x00A7; 7117(c)(2) "sets rigid time limits for filing a union appeal, an agency explanatory statement and a union response" which "must be strictly observed"). Unlike negotiability appeals and ULP charges, the procedures to file a petition to amend a certification are not time-sensitive and require an inquiry by the Authority that focuses on the existing circumstances at the time of the investigation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In support of its position that a time limit is necessary, the Agency also contends that the petition to amend the certification filed by Local 2484 does not reflect the current wishes of the members of Local 2484 and notes that, after the vote to change affiliation, petitions were filed to seek representation elections among employees in bargaining units represented by Local 2484. However, all of these issues may be raised and resolved in another &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2) proceeding, as they relate to the issue of whether a QCR exists.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the RD investigated and addressed the Agency's claim that the employees no longer wished to be represented by Local 2484. Although the RD acknowledged that the petition was filed more than two years after the members voted to change affiliation and that there has been some turnover in the bargaining units since the vote, the RD nonetheless concluded that there was no evidence either that a QCR existed, or that a reasonable doubt existed about the majority status of Local 1923 or any of the affected bargaining units. The Agency does not argue that the RD erred in this regard. Thus, the Agency has not demonstrated that a time limit is necessary for filing a petition under &#x00A7; 7111(b)(2).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Therefore, consistent with the discussion above, we conclude that the Agency has failed to establish that the RD erred in failing to dismiss Local 2484's petition as untimely.</p>
<p class="noindent">Individuals affected by an affiliation change have standing to request review of a regional director's decision to amend a unit certification to reflect the change in affiliation, <span class="Italic">VA and Nat'l Nurses United</span>, 65 FLRA 259, 262-63 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">NNU argues that the Applicants lack standing to seek review of the RD's decision because they do not qualify as "parties" under &#x00A7; 2422.31(a) of the Authority's Regulations. However, the Authority rejected this argument in <span class="Italic">United States Department of the Navy, Human Resources Service Center Northwest, Silverdale, Washington, </span>61 FLRA 408 (2005) (<span class="Italic">Navy</span>).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">Navy</span>, an agency employee filed an application seeking review of an RD's decision that clarified several bargaining units following an agency reorganization. The union challenged the applicant's standing to file the petition, arguing that he was not a party under the Authority's <span id="page_178"></span>Regulations. <span class="Italic">See Navy, </span>61 FLRA at 409. The Authority found that the applicant had standing to file the application for review under &#x00A7; 7105(f) of the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute (the Statute) as an "interested person." <span class="Italic">See Navy, </span>61 FLRA at 410-11.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7105(f) of the Statute provides that "the Authority may, upon application by any interested person filed within 60 days after the date of the action," review actions of the RD in representation matters. Since the applicant in <span class="Italic">Navy </span>was an agency employee, and since that employee's exclusive representative was changed as a result of the decision, the Authority found that he was an interested person under the Statute and that he therefore had standing to file the application for review. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>Similarly, here, as the Applicants are employees whose exclusive representative was changed as a result of the RD's decision, we find that the Applicants are interested persons under the Statute and that they therefore have standing to file applications for review.</p>
