<h5 class="h5" id="sec2-104"><span class="space">a.</span> Delay Not Excused</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Negligence by an appellant or an attorney does not constitute good cause for extending a filing deadline. <span class="Italic">McBurnett v. Dept. of Army</span>, 37 MSPR 395, 397 (1988) (involving an appeal that was a day late); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Slade v. USDA</span>, DE-0752-15-0536-I-1 (NP 2/24/2016) (six-day delay not excused by calendaring error of counsel). If an employee disregards time requirements for a Board appeal that are set out in clear language and relies on others to perfect his appeal, he does so at his own risk. <span class="Italic">Myers v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1984 NP No. 84-1048). If the issue is timeliness, clients are bound by the neglect of their counsel. <span class="Italic">Phillips v. USPS</span>, <span id="Page_1013"></span>695 F.2d 1389 (Fed. Cir. 1982); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Cox v. ITC</span>, 4 MSPR 191, 194, 4 MSPB 272 (1980) (excusing a brief filing delay based on a regulatory ambiguity but noting that the delay would not have been excused on the basis that the appellant's counsel was conducting a trial immediately before the filing deadline). The error of counsel does not excuse a preliminary step in filing an appeal, e.g., requesting timely reconsideration by OPM of a retirement determination. <span class="Italic">Azarkhish v. OPM</span>, 915 F.2d 675 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Incorrect information from appellant's counsel concerning the date for filing an appeal does not constitute good cause for waiving the time limit for the appeal. Because the appellant voluntarily selected his representative, he cannot avoid the consequence of his choice; he takes responsibility for his representative's errors. <span class="Italic">Sepillo v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 416, 419-20 (1988) (appeal delayed by three years was not excused because of a delay in the agency communicating with the appellant's prior representative; the appellant's failure to notify the agency that he was no longer represented does not constitute excusable neglect); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Morse v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 15 MSPR 414, 416-17 (1983) (appellant did not demonstrate that he was misled by the agency as to the deadline for filing an appeal from an indefinite suspension; "that appellant may have been misinformed by his counsel does not constitute a basis for finding good cause").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Failure of a union representative, just as the failure of an attorney, to advise or represent an appellant properly does not excuse the untimely filing of an appeal. <span class="Italic">Harris v. MSPB</span> (Fed. Cir. 1986 NP No. 86-506);<span class="Italic"> see</span> <span class="Italic">Webb v. MSPB</span>, 70 F.3d 104, 106 (Fed. Cir. 1995) ("Neither advice from a union representative nor changes in union staffing constitute good cause requiring the board to excuse late filing."); <span class="Italic">Hill v. USPS</span>, 38 MSPR 339, 341 (1988) ("any erroneous advice from his union representative in this matter would not constitute good cause for waiving the filing deadline"); <span class="Italic">Hewitt v. IRS</span>, 20 MSPR 505, 506 (1984) (insufficient to rely upon a union representative to process the appeal when the agency informed the appellant of the right to appeal and the time for doing so); <span class="Italic">Raynor v. FAA</span>, 12 MSPR 56, 58 (1982) (appellant failed to provide evidence of mishandling of the appeal by his union); <span class="Italic">Donovan v. FAA</span>, 11 MSPR 605, 608 (1982) (alleged reliance on the union to file the appeal did not excuse an eight-day delay); <span class="Italic">Hales v. FAA</span>, 12 MSPR 48, 50 (1982) (appellant's allegation that he relied on his union to file an appeal is insufficient when the record contained no information from the union concerning any appeal purportedly filed on the appellant's behalf, and the record did not contain a copy of the alleged appeal or an affidavit from the appellant or any information regarding the form, contents, or date of an appeal).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a union provides the appellant with bad information concerning his appeal rights, no good cause exists for extending the time for filing an appeal; the union is responsible for providing proper advice. <span class="Italic">Shrider v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...It is well settled that a person is bound by the consequences of his representative's conduct, which includes both his acts and omissions....&#8197;Rowe cannot escape the consequences of the lateness of his appeal [by four days] that was filed by his union attorney after the deadline, even though Rowe himself acted in good faith in relying on the advice and actions of his attorney....&#8197;After all, as the saying goes, "It was his head that was on the chopping block," and not his attorney's.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="italic">Broadhead v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, DC-0432-17-0126-I-1 (NP 11/9/2022), declined to excuse a delayed appeal by reason of miscommunications with counsel:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appeal would have been due 30 days after the September 16, 2016 effective date of the removal, or on October 16, 2016. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.22(b). However, because this date fell on a Sunday, the appeal was due on the next business day, which was October 17, 2016. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.23. The appellant did not electronically file his appeal until November 15, 2016. Thus, as the administrative judge found, the appeal was 29 days late. The appellant does not challenge this finding on review. Instead, he asserts that the administrative judge should have found that he demonstrated good cause for his delayed filing.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To determine whether an appellant has shown good cause for his untimeliness, the Board will consider the length of the delay, the reasonableness of his excuse and his showing of due diligence, whether he is proceeding <span class="italic">pro se</span>, and whether he has presented evidence of the existence of circumstances beyond his control that affected his ability to comply with the time limits or of unavoidable casualty or misfortune which similarly shows a causal relationship to his inability to timely file his petition. <span class="italic">Moorman v. Department of the Army</span>, 68 M.S.P.R. 60, 62-63 (1995), <span class="italic">aff'd</span>, 79 F.3d 1167 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (Table).

<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge found that the appellant's argument regarding a miscommunication with his attorneys did not constitute good cause for waiving the filing deadline because the agency informed the appellant of the filing deadline, it was incumbent upon him to monitor the appeal process, and there was no indication from his attorneys that his appeal had been filed. The appellant asserts that he acted with due diligence by pointing to the following unrebutted evidence: (1) on October 11, 2016, six days before his appeal was due, he provided his removal letter to his attorney; (2) upon providing the removal letter, he asked the attorney if he needed to do anything else, and she told him that he did not; and (3) it did not become apparent to him that the appeal had not been filed until after the attorney contacted him on November 9, 2016, regarding filing a designation of representative form.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant has a personal responsibility to monitor the progress of his appeal at all times and not to leave the matter entirely in the hands of his representative. <span class="italic">White</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 312, &#x00B6; 12. Thus, absent a specific showing that the appellant actively monitored the progress of his appeal but his representative thwarted his diligent efforts to pursue the appeal, the appellant cannot blame his representative's alleged negligence in seeking to excuse a filing delay. <span class="italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency notified the appellant of the filing deadline, and he does not dispute that he was aware of the deadline. The record also reflects that the appellant did not actively monitor his appeal. In his affidavit, the appellant indicated that when he emailed his attorney on October 11, 2016, he was under the impression that she would file his appeal by the deadline (October 17, 2016). He further stated that he did not contact his <span id="Page_1014"></span>attorneys or inquire about the status of his appeal by any means until he responded to an email from one of the attorneys on November 10, 2016. Under these circumstances, his miscommunication with his attorneys does not constitute good cause for the filing delay.[2] <span class="italic">See White</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 312, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 10, 13 (finding no good cause shown for the 5-day delay in filing the appeal because the appellant did not show that he tried to contact his representative before the filing deadline or otherwise make any effort to ensure that his appeal was filed on time, he did not contact the Board to request an extension, and he did not explain why his representative's illness prevented him from filing on time); <span class="italic">Strong v. Department of the Navy</span>, 86 M.S.P.R. 243, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4, 11-12 (2000) (finding that the appellant did not establish good cause for the 12-day delay in filing his petition for review because he initially discussed filing the petition with his attorney, he contacted the attorney's office to see if he needed to do anything else, and he made no further attempts to contact his attorney before the filing deadline).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;As the administrative judge stated, even though the appellant's representatives appear to claim responsibility for the untimely filing, this does not constitute good cause because the appellant is personally responsible for prosecuting his appeal. <span class="italic">See Retzler v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with the administrative judge that the 29-day delay is significant, and the appellant was not proceeding <span class="italic">pro se</span>, which are factors weighing against a finding of good cause for the delay. <span class="italic">See Laboy v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 103 M.S.P.R. 570, &#x00B6; 9 (2006) (finding that the appellant failed to establish good cause for the untimely filing of her petition for review by almost 1 month because the delay was not minimal, she was represented by an attorney, and she did not explain how her attorney's injury and recuperation prevented her from requesting an extension); <span class="italic">De Vaughn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 96 M.S.P.R. 427, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6, 8 (2004) (concluding that the appellant did not show good cause for the over 1-month delay in filing his petition for review in part because he was represented on review, even though he was <span class="italic">pro se</span> below); <span class="italic">Edeburn v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 486, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 15-16 (2004) (finding that the appellant did not demonstrate good cause for the 8-day delay in filing her appeal when, among other things, she was represented and received ample notice of the time requirements for filing an appeal in the agency's decision letter). Thus, we agree with the administrative judge's decision that the appellant has not demonstrated good cause for his untimely appeal.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Federal Circuit did not originate the rule that the client suffers for the errors of counsel. The Supreme Court recognized the problem, <span class="Italic">Link v. Wabash R.R. Co.</span>, 370 U.S. 626, 633 (1962):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is certainly no merit to the conclusion that dismissal of petitioner's claim because of his counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily chose the attorney as his representative in the action, and he cannot avoid the consequences of the acts or omissions of this freely selected agent. Any other notion would be wholly inconsistent with our system of representative litigation in which each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered to have notice of all facts notice of which can be charged upon the attorney.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But there was a persuasive dissent in <span class="Italic">Link</span>, <span class="Italic">id.</span> at 647:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While there may be some clients sophisticated enough in the affairs of the world to be able to select the good from the bad among this mass of lawyers throughout the country, this unfortunately cannot always be the case. The average individual called upon, perhaps for the first time in his life, to select a lawyer to try a lawsuit may happen to choose the best lawyer or he may happen to choose one of the worst. He has a right to rely at least to some extent upon the fact that a lawyer has a license. From this he is also entitled to believe that the lawyer has the ability to look out for his case and that he should leave the lawyer free from constraint in doing so. Surely it cannot be said that there was a duty resting upon Link, a layman plaintiff, to try to supervise the daily professional services of the lawyer he had chosen to represent him....&#8197;Why should a client be awakened to his lawyer's incapacity for the first time by a sudden brutal pronouncement of the court: "Your lawyer has failed to perform his duty in prosecuting your case and we are therefore throwing you out of court on your heels"? So far as this record shows, the plaintiff never received one iota of information of any kind, character or type that should have put him on notice as an ordinary layman that his lawyer was not doing his duty.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">It may not be of much importance to anyone other than the plaintiff here and his family whether this case is tried on its merits or not. To my mind, however, it is of very great importance to everyone in this country that we do not establish the practice of throwing litigants out of court without notice to them solely because they are credulous enough to entrust their cases to lawyers whose names are accredited as worthy and capable by their government. I fear that this case is not likely to stand out in the future as the best example of American justice.</p>
