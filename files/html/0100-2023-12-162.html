<h4 class="h4" id="sec5-161"><span class="space">6.</span> Filing by Mail</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">5 CFR 1201.4 (2022), providing definitions, states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(l)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Date of filing</span>. ...The date of filing by mail is determined by the postmark date; if no legible postmark date appears on the mailing, the submission is presumed to have been mailed five days (excluding days on which the Board is closed for business) before its receipt....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's website states that as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic and disruption of government operations and personnel, <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/index.htm">https://www.mspb.gov/index.htm</a>:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_1739"></span>Because there may be delays in receipt of paper submissions and issuance of paper orders, notices, and decisions during this period, we strongly encourage the use of e-Appeal Online for both new and pending cases, and by all parties in order to avoid such delays.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A PFR that is filed by mail is filed on the date that it is mailed. <span class="Italic">Almazan v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 318, 320 n.2 (1985). The dating of a PFR does not establish the date of filing. <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Dept. of Army</span>, 1 MSPR 749, 750, 2 MSPB 156 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Woods v. VA</span>, CH-0731-13-0268-I-1 (NP 6/20/2014) ("Nevertheless, a 'filing must involve something more than the appellant placing a date on his petition.' <span class="Italic">Rodriguez v. Department of the Army</span>, 1 M.S.P.R. 749, 757 (1980)."). If there is some question at the Board's central office of when or how the PFR is received, the Board may obtain for the record a statement from its own employee concerning the filing or lack of filing of the PFR. <span class="Italic">Aragon v. DOJ</span>, 25 MSPR 637, 638 (1985). Except for faxed or personally delivered PFRs, the issue in the many cases litigating the timeliness of a PFR is the date that it was actually placed in the mails controlled by the U.S. Postal Service, the so-called "mailstream." The PFR has to make it into mails. Near misses do not count. Completing the PFR and allowing it to sit in an outgoing mail box in an office will not satisfy the mailing requirements imposed by Board regulations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Zicht v. DHHS</span>, 56 MSPR 9, 10 (1992) (relying on <span class="Italic">Garrett v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 32, 34 (1991)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Because many PFRs are submitted through the regular mail, the practice of the Board is to accept the postmark as the date of filing. <span class="Italic">Garrett v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 5 MSPR 50, 51, 5 MSPB 127 (1981); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Beer v. Dept. of Army</span>, 2 MSPR 53, 56 n.2, 2 MSPB 226, 227 n.2 (1980) (postmark date as date of filing of PFR). The date is determined by examining the envelope containing the PFR sent to the Board; nothing in the regulations states that for a PFR to be timely filed, the appellant's service copy must also be postmarked by the date an initial decision becomes final. <span class="Italic">Purdy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 53 MSPR 693, 696 (1992). If a franked envelope is postmarked, the date of the postmark is the date of filing. <span class="Italic">Sugden v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 144, 145 (1989); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Patterson v. USPS</span>, 5 MSPR 406, 407 n.1 (1981) (noting that under prior regulations certified mail was required, but that the Board's practice has been to accept the postmark date as the date of filing since many petitions are submitted through regular mail).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the postmark is illegible or missing, the Board presumes the PFR to have been filed five days prior to its receipt. <span class="Italic">Davis v.

The five-day rule prevails over a certificate of service showing service on the last day that filing would have been timely, even if the opposing representative receives the document within a period of time that would suggest that the PFR was, in fact, timely filed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 425, 426 (1989). It was concluded that a certificate of service showing service a day after the last day for filing the PFR rebutted the five-day rule that would otherwise have made the submission timely. <span class="Italic">Rencevicz v.

USPS</span>, 61 MSPR 84, 87 (1994) (if the certificate of service shows a filing date later than that calculated under the five-day rule, the certificate's date apparently controls (involving a response to the show cause order on an interim relief issue)). An unpostmarked (franked) PFR received by the Board is presumed, unless there is other evidence concerning the mailing, to have been mailed five days prior to the date of receipt. <span class="Italic">Dickinson v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 3 MSPR 240, 244, 3 MSPB 335 (1980), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Foley v. OPM</span>, 28 MSPR 291, 294 n.2 (1985) (franked envelope); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Clarke v. DHHS</span>, 48 MSPR 566, 569 (1991) (agency PFR was delivered to the regional office, the envelope was missing, and presumed to have been mailed five days prior to its receipt; the certificate of service corroborated the presumed filing date). But the five-day rule operates only as to items submitted without proper postmarks. If a postmarked submission is untimely filed, it does not become timely because it would have been timely had it been received by the Board without a postmark<span class="Italic">. See</span> <span class="Italic">Davis v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 38 MSPR 592, 595 (1988); <span class="Italic">Armstrong v. OPM</span>, 36 MSPR 37, 41 (1987) (PFR untimely based on a postmark even though it was received by the Board within five days of the finality date of the initial decision).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the mailed PFR is meter-marked, the meter date ordinarily controls if there is no conflicting postmark, but the Board may require further information about the circumstances of meter-marked mail if the delivery seems unduly delayed. <span class="Italic">Cleger v. USPS</span>, DA-0752-12-0107-A-1 (NP 7/2/2014), rejected a PFR mailed and meter-marked as untimely when the circumstances of mailing were not adequately explained to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ordinarily, if a piece of mail only bears a private meter mark and is not machine-cancelled by the U.S. Postal Service, the private meter mark is considered the date of filing. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Department of the Army</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 161, 163 (1993); <span class="Italic">see Hunt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 381, 383 (1989) ("[O]nly where a mailpiece bears the incorrect metered date will it be run through a canceling machine to show the proper date."). However, the Clerk of the Board (Clerk) did not receive the appellant's petition for review until September 9, 2013, 25 days after August 15, 2013, which far exceeds the due course of the mails and raises doubt as to whether the petition was mailed on the privately-metered date. <span class="Italic">See Smith v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 789 F.2d 1540, 1542 n.2 (1986) (finding that 16 days is far more than the due course of the mails); <span class="Italic">cf. Mack v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 54 M.S.P.R. 572, 575 (1992) (where the appellant alleged that he mailed his petition for review a month before the date it was postmarked, the Board considered that it received the petition for review 2 days after the postmark date, which was consistent with a finding that the petition for review was not mailed until the date it was postmarked).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When a party shows by preponderant evidence that a pleading was properly addressed to the Board with postage prepaid and placed into the U.S. Postal Service mail stream, it is treated as filed on the date it was placed into the U.S. Postal Service mail stream, regardless of when the Board receives it. <span class="Italic">See Gaydon v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 198, 202 (1994). The appellant has made no such showing in this case. The Clerk issued an Order to Show Cause ordering the parties to produce all evidence they possess regarding the date that the copy of the appellant's petition for review sent to the Board was placed into the mail stream. The Clerk explained that mail is placed into the U.S. Postal Service mail stream by being deposited in a U.S. Post Office or post office box, and noted that any statement provided in response to the Order must provide specific details concerning the mailing. In response, the appellant's counsel provided a declaration,[3] made under penalty of perjury, wherein she asserted that on August 15, 2013, she "placed postage onto" the appellant's petition for review and "placed it into the mail system."[4] Despite the clear instructions in the Clerk's Order, the declaration contains no specific details concerning the mailing, such as how the petition for review was placed into the mail stream, i.e., by being deposited in a U.S. Post Office or post office box, <span class="Italic">Raphel v. Department of the Army</span>, 50 M.S.P.R. 614, 617 (1991), or where it was placed into the mail stream. <span class="Italic">See Gaydon</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. at 202 (the appellant's mere assertion that he mailed his petition for review on a particular date, without any specific details concerning the mailing, was insufficient to establish that he timely placed the petition into the U.S. Postal Service mail stream). The appellant produced neither the certified mail receipt for the mailing, nor the green return receipt postcard confirming delivery, both of which the Clerk requested in the Order to Show Cause.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant's counsel incorporates into her declaration the contents of a November 12, 2013 declaration she attached to the appellant's reply to the agency's response to his petition for review. We have not considered the November 12 declaration because the appellant's reply was untimely filed and the appellant has not shown good cause for the delay. We note that the Clerk's Order to Show Cause specifically cautioned the appellant that the Board had not yet determined whether it would consider his reply.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The appellant argues that his petition for review was accompanied by a certificate of service establishing the date of mailing. However, the Board is not listed as a recipient on the certificate of service, and the certificate appears to be inaccurate because the envelope in which the agency received the appellant's petition for review bears an August 30, 2013 cancellation postmark, so we do not find it to be of probative value.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that the agency provided the U.S. Postal Service certified mail tracking report for the copy of the petition for review sent to the Board, which indicates that the mailpiece was not first processed until August 30, 2013, 15 days after the appellant claims to have mailed it. We find it highly unlikely that mail processing would be delayed by 15 days.[5] The agency also provided a declaration made under penalty of perjury by the supervisor of distribution operations at the North Texas Processing &#x0026; Distribution Center (P&#x0026;DC),[6] who states that mail is collected on the same day it is deposited into the mail stream and is then processed during the overnight tour, which begins that day and ends the following morning. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at 11-12.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The appellant provides U.S. Postal Service reports indicating that the U.S. Postal Service as a whole experiences mail processing delays. Many of these reports are from 2008 and 2009, so we fail to see their relevance in this case, which concerns a pleading mailed in 2013. These reports also do not provide any information regarding average mail delays, so we discern no basis to conclude that certified mail pieces generally go unprocessed for over 2 weeks. Regardless, as previously stated, the appellant has not provided specific details concerning the mailing of his petition for review to the Board, so we cannot conclude that we did not receive it until nearly a month after it was purportedly mailed solely because of mail delays. <span class="Italic">Cf. Suratos v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 56 M.S.P.R. 201, 203 (1993) (where the appellant did not allege that he mailed his appeal early enough to be timely but for a mail delay, his general claim of a mail delay was insufficient to establish that his mail was affected by a mail delay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;Mail from the appellant's counsel's zip code is processed at the North Texas P&#x0026;DC.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we dismiss the petition for review as untimely filed because the preponderance of the evidence belies the appellant's claim that the petition for review was timely mailed; the Board received the appellant's petition for review well beyond the expected time period <span id="Page_1740"></span>considering the due course of the mails, the certified mail tracking report indicates that the mail was not processed until more than 2 weeks after it was purportedly mailed, and the appellant failed to provide any specific details or evidence concerning the mailing despite being ordered to do so. This is the final decision of the Board regarding the timeliness of the petition for review. The initial decision remains the final decision of the Board regarding the appellant's motion for attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If there is a conflict between the date on metered mail and a USPS canceling machine date, the cancelation is the date of filing, for the Postal Service only postmarks metered mail if it is determined to bear an incorrect date. <span class="Italic">Ford v. USPS</span>, 47 MSPR 24, 25 (1991) (PFR); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McKee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, DC-315H-12-0763-I-1 n.2 (NP 10/31/2013) (rejecting agency argument that a PFR was not postmarked--"Metered mail is only postmarked if, upon examination, it is determined to bear an incorrect date. <span class="Italic">Hunt v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 41 M.S.P.R. 381, 383 (1989). <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 64 M.S.P.R. 242 (1994), which the agency cites, is inapplicable because it involved an envelope that was metered but later postmarked. <span class="Italic">Cf. Hall v. Department of the Army</span>, 59 M.S.P.R. 161, 163 (1993) ('If a piece of mail is not machine-canceled by the Postal Service and only bears a meter mark because, upon examination, the Postal Service has determined that the mail bears the correct metered date, the meter mark is ordinarily the date of filing.')");<span class="Italic">Travis v. USPS</span>, 51 MSPR 53, 54 (1991) (PFR: postmark controls over metered-mail mark); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Hunt v. USPS</span>, 41 MSPR 381, 383 (1989) (timeliness of the appeal). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 52 MSPR 83, 85 n.* (1991) (metered date accepted as filing date instead of postmark when postmark was entered at city distant from appellant's residence). Sometimes the Board cannot determine what information is conveyed by a postmark. The Board then refers to the <span class="Italic">Postal Operations Manual</span> to determine what it all means. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Adamov v. Marine Corps</span>, 41 MSPR 275, 278 (1989).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A piece of metered mail that is not canceled by a postmark with another date is deemed posted on the metered date; the agency will not avoid the date on the envelope by explaining that the mail was set out for collection within the agency on an earlier date. <span class="Italic">Hall v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 161, 163 (1993). If there is a conflict between a USPS meter mark and a subsequent USPS hand cancelation, the cancelation controls unless there is a sworn explanation from the appellant. <span class="Italic">Butler v. USPS</span>, 43 MSPR 237, 239 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 242, 245 (1994) (explaining that an appellant can rebut a presumption created by a cancelation mark (conflict with a metered mail mark) by an affidavit or a statement signed under the penalty of perjury establishing, through detailed explanations of the circumstances of mailing, that, despite the postmark date, the pleading was actually placed in the Postal Service mail stream before the filing deadline); <span class="Italic">Parten v. OPM</span>, 59 MSPR 119, 121 n.* (1993) (meter date of February 16, a post office mark of February 17; February 16 was accepted as the date of filing when an affidavit of the appellant's representative stated that the PFR was given to the mailman on February 16 and the mailman's affidavit corroborated his receipt of the mail on that day); <span class="Italic">Sacchino v. EPA</span>, 57 MSPR 469, 471 (1993) ("When an envelope contains conflicting postmarks, one of which is a metered mark and the other is a cancellation mark of the U.S. Postal Service, the cancellation mark controls.... Here the appellant has submitted no affidavit or statement signed under penalty of perjury...explaining why the presumptions set forth in the regulations about the dates of filing should not apply."); <span class="Italic">Toney v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 20 MSPR 497, 498 n.* (1984) (appellant demonstrated (through means unstated) that the PFR was erroneously postmarked and was timely received by the Board within the period allowed for receipt of an unpostmarked PFR); <span class="Italic">Kirkman v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 12 MSPR 53, 54 (1982) (PFR was accepted after it was timely posted but the postmark was delayed by the Postal Service; due diligence warranted acceptance of the PFR).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board expects that if one relies on certified mail to prove the timeliness of a PFR, a certified mail return receipt must be produced to show when the petition was mailed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Jordan v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 64 MSPR 242, 245-46 (1994). The Board then appears to accept the date of mailing as the filing date as long as the certified mail number on the envelope arriving at the Board's office matches the number of the receipt. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Altieri v. DLA</span>, 50 MSPR 82, 84 (1991). <span class="Italic">Schaefer v. USPS</span>, 42 MSPR 592 (1989), involved a lost PFR. The appellant's former representative filed an affidavit stating that he could testify to having mailed a timely PFR. The representative provided a receipt for certified mail with a handwritten notation that the receipt concerned the appellant's PFR, mailed to MSPB headquarters, and stamped with a July 29, 1988, Bethesda, Maryland, postmark. The Board noted that no amount was entered showing that the sender paid a fee for mailing the certified letter. The appellant did not submit a copy of the PFR allegedly timely filed and the appellant did not submit a return receipt for certified mail. The agency submitted an affidavit from its designated representative stating that the representative did not receive, nor was there an agency record of receipt of, the PFR or the certificate of service required for all pleadings by MSPB regulation. Concluding in <span class="Italic">Schaefer</span> that had the PFR been timely filed it would have been "most unlikely for both the agency and the Board not to have received a copy of the petition for review or the certificate of service," the Board decided that the appellant had not met his burden of demonstrating timely filing and that by waiting almost six months before inquiring as to the status of the PFR, the appellant did not exercise due diligence in filing the petition.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should a petition be mailed and then be returned to the appellant for lack of sufficient postage, it appears that the Board calculates the filing date from the time the Postal Service receives the properly posted letter, although <span class="Italic">Lowry v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 540 (1988), was less than clear on the point. In <span class="Italic">Lowry</span> the Board could not rely on the internally contradictory certificate of service and the appellant offered "no probative evidence to show when it was originally mailed or to otherwise support the appellant's general contention that he mailed it in a timely fashion." <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fayhee v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 41 MSPR 131, 132 (1989) (cross-petition was accepted although the initial mailing was returned for insufficient postage; the fact that the base post office mailed the PFR with insufficient postage was beyond the agency's control); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Scillion v. DHHS</span>, 45 MSPR 521, 524 (1990) (metered postage entry determines the filing date; it is immaterial that the PFR packet is damaged in route and delayed in delivery); <span class="Italic">Conley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 19 MSPR 492, 493 (1984) (postmark controls the filing date even if the Board rejects an appeal because there is postage due on the envelope). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Lowry v. USPS</span>, 36 MSPR 540, 542-43 (1988) (reopening the appeal but rejecting as untimely a PFR allegedly returned to the appellant for insufficient postage; evidence was unpersuasive concerning how the PFR was first mailed).</p>
