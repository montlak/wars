<h3 class="h3" id="sec7-100"><span class="space">C.</span> AGENCY CONSIDERATION OF PAST DISCIPLINE</h3>
<p class="Body-Text">Agencies often seek to justify adverse action on the basis of current charges coupled with references to past discipline imposed against the employee. Reliance on past discipline is mitigation in reverse. Past discipline is an aggravating factor, and it can make a significant difference in an appeal. <span class="Italic">See Ferguson v. USPS</span>, 19 MSPR 52, 55 (1984) ("Notwithstanding the relatively minor nature of the current sustained charge against appellants, when coupled with past disciplinary records which indicate unreliability and a failure to comply with agency regulations, the Board finds that the penalty of removal does not exceed the limits of reasonableness under all relevant circumstances in these cases."). We use the term "past discipline" with a caveat: the Board has considered discipline arising out of an offense unrelated to the appeal, imposed after the events leading to the appealed action, to show the reasonableness of the appealed action. <span class="Italic">See Meads v. VA</span>, 36 MSPR 574, 583-84 (1988) (reprimand imposed after the conduct leading to removal could not be used to demonstrate a lack of rehabilitative potential, but it was evidence of disciplinary action against the appellant as well as evidence of the appellant's work record). [Refer earlier discussion in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-057.html#sec7-56">Potential for Rehabilitation</a>," concerning the potential for rehabilitation as a mitigating factor.] Past discipline that was settled can be referenced as evidence of a warning of desired or prohibited conduct. [Refer earlier in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-061.html#sec7-60">Notice of Rule or Policy</a>"; refer later in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-14-111.html#sec7-109">Discipline Imposed After the Appealed Adverse Action</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Past discipline not subject to adjudication during the course of an appeal can properly be considered only with a sustained current charge to determine the severity of the penalty. <span class="Italic">Cordeiro v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 103, 104, 7 MSPB 590 (1981); <span class="Italic">see Douglas v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 23 MSPR 540, 541 (1984) ("[b]ecause the present charges were not proven, appellant's past record cannot be considered."). No adverse action will be sustained on the basis of a past offense alone if the current charge is not sustained. <span class="Italic">Lee v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 355, 6 MSPB 303 (1981); <span class="Italic">cf</span>. <span class="Italic">Seevers v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 21 MSPR 246, 247 (1984) (no prejudice to appellant when the AJ considered past offenses as part of current charges; the current charge itself warranted removal). The agency may not rely on the appellant's past disciplinary record to prove its present charge; the past record can only be considered as to the reasonableness of the penalty for presently sustained charges. <span class="Italic">Raines v. USPS</span>, 32 MSPR 56, 58 (1986). An indefinite suspension is not a disciplinary action that can be relied upon by the agency in selecting a penalty. <span class="Italic">See Farris v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 299, 302 n.2 (1985). An oral admonishment, although a first step in progressive discipline, was not considered a prior disciplinary offense, although it was notice that there could be future discipline were the conduct referenced in admonishment repeated. <span class="Italic">Douglas v. DOJ</span>, DC-0752-17-0130-I-1 (NP 11/10/2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Now revoked by President Biden, President Trump's May 25, 2018, Executive Order 13,839 ("Executive Order Promoting Accountability and Streamlining Removal Procedures Consistent with Merit System Principles") at <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles">https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/06/01/2018-11939/promoting-accountability-and-streamlining-removal-procedures-consistent-with-merit-system-principles</a>, provided direction to agencies concerning consideration of past discipline:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sec. 2. Principles for Accountability in the Federal Workforce.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(b)&#x2003;Supervisors and deciding officials should not be required to use progressive discipline. The penalty for an instance of misconduct should be tailored to the facts and circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(c)&#x2003;Each employee's work performance and disciplinary history is unique, and disciplinary action should be calibrated to the specific facts and circumstances of each individual employee's situation. Conduct that justifies discipline of one employee at one time does not necessarily justify similar discipline of a different employee at a different time--particularly where the employees are in different work units or chains of supervision--and agencies are not prohibited from removing an employee simply because they did not remove a different employee for comparable conduct. Nonetheless, employees should be treated equitably, so agencies should consider appropriate comparators as they evaluate potential disciplinary actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(d)&#x2003;Suspension should not be a substitute for removal in circumstances in which removal would be appropriate. Agencies should not require <span id="Page_2413"></span>suspension of an employee before proposing to remove that employee, except as may be appropriate under applicable facts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(e)&#x2003;When taking disciplinary action, agencies should have discretion to take into account an employee's disciplinary record and past work record, including all past misconduct--not only similar past misconduct. Agencies should provide an employee with appropriate notice when taking a disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="Body-Text">The Board's approach to the use of past discipline was explained in <span class="Italic">Bolling v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 9 MSPR 335, 338-40 (1981), concluding it would consider a challenge to past discipline imposed with defined due process protections only if it is shown to be "clearly erroneous" in the sense that it leaves the Board with the "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." The Board adopted guidance in the Civil Service Commission's (later OPM's) and (now defunct) Federal Personnel Manual requiring written notice of the action, an opportunity to dispute the action through review before an official other than the one who took the action, and that the action was a matter of record:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition, appellant attempts to argue the merits of the prior disciplinary actions which were used to support the penalty of removal. Prior to the passage of the...Reform Act...the scope of review of prior disciplinary records in adverse action appeals was contained in the Federal Personnel Manual at FPM Supp. 752-1, S4-3b(1):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Special situations. (1) Reference to past disciplinary record. When an employee has been subjected to disciplinary action for one or more past offenses and the agency uses his disciplinary record as part of the basis for a current adverse action against him, the specificity and detail required of the agency--and also the extent of review and consideration required of either the agency or the Commission on appeal--depend on whether the past disciplinary action meets three criteria: First, the employee was informed of the action in writing; second, the employee was given an opportunity to dispute the action by having it reviewed, on the merits, by an authority different from the one that took the action; and third, the action was made a matter of record. The difference in treatment, depending on whether these criteria are or are not met, is as follows: (a) If all three of the above criteria are met, the "specificity and in detail" requirement is satisfied by the agency's setting forth the nature of the action, the date it was effected, and the offense for which it was administered. (Example: "You were given a written reprimand on (date) for disorderly conduct.") On appeal, if the employee takes issue with the merits of the past action, the documentary record of the past action--i.e., the written notification of the action and any supporting documentation; the employee's reply, if any; and the record of any agency administrative proceeding held in connection with the action--will be reviewed to determine the validity of that action as one of the reasons for the current action. It will be found a valid reason unless, upon review, the agency or the Commission determines the disciplinary action was unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious. (This does not mean that the employee is entitled to "hash over" the record of the past action in his hearing on the current action. He is entitled only to express his views on the propriety of the past action and to have the record of that action reviewed by the appellate body). If the employee does not raise an issue about the past action, only the occurrence of that action need be verified. A cited disciplinary action will be found a valid reason if it is in fact a matter of record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In conformity with this provision, the practice of the Civil Service Commission...was to give a challenged past record a full, <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review if the three criteria were not met, but a limited review of the record if they were. This practice has been considered and applied by the courts. <span class="Italic">Swentek v. United States</span>, 658 F.2d 791, 228 Ct. Cl. 468 (1981); <span class="Italic">Henckle v. Campbell</span>, 462 F. Supp. 1286 (D. Kan. 1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question now presented is what scope of review the Board should adopt in this matter. The Reform Act effected no substantive changes in the area of the proper scope of review of challenged prior disciplinary records.... Additionally, as has been noted, the former FPM provision utilized the standard "unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious." The Supreme Court has held that in order to determine whether an action was arbitrary or capricious, "the court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment." <span class="Italic">Citizens to Protect Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe</span>, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). The Board has interpreted "clear error of judgment" to mean "clearly erroneous," and has held that "a determination is 'clearly erroneous' when although there is evidence to support it, the [Board] ...is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed." <span class="Italic">Douglas v. Veterans Administration</span>,...5 MSPR at 302.... In the Board's opinion, this scope of review strikes a reasonable and workable balance between the competing interests involved in the instant situation. On the one hand, an appellant is not allowed to relitigate issues that either were, or could have been, thoroughly litigated previously. On the other hand, agencies are not able to utilize clearly erroneous prior actions as aggravating factors so as to enhance the penalties imposed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, the Board holds that where the three criteria set forth at the former FPM Supp. 752-1, S4-3b(1), <span class="Italic">supra</span>, are met, the challenged prior disciplinary actions will receive only a limited review. Such a review will be limited to the record, and no new evidence or argument, other than appellant's reasons for the challenge, will be admissible. As a standard, the Board holds that such a challenged prior action will be discounted only if it is "clearly erroneous" in the sense that it leaves the Board with the "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed."</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Bolling</span> relied on <span class="Italic">Howard v. Dept. of Army</span>, 6 MSPR 205, 206, 6 MSPB 180 (1981):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hen appellant contested in his appeal the charges underlying the most recent of the prior disciplinary actions, the agency failed to submit any evidence supporting the underlying charges.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official, citing <span class="Italic">Henckle v. Campbell,</span> 462 F. Supp. 1286 (D. Kan. 1978), articulated the following rule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Three elements are necessary for the unchallenged citation of a past disciplinary record for use by an agency in determining the appropriate penalty for a current offense: the employee must have been informed of the action in writing; the action must be a matter of record; and the employee must have been permitted to dispute the charges to a higher level than the authority that imposed the discipline. If any of these elements is missing, the employee must be allowed to challenge the past record citation at the hearing before the Board.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(initial decision issued April 17, 1980 at 3). The agency challenges the presiding official's ruling on the basis that it restates FPM Supp. 752-1 S4-3(b)(1) and FPM Supp. 752-1 was revoked February 2, 1979, pending issuance of a revised FPM Ch. 752 consistent with the provisions of the newly enacted Civil Service Reform Act, Pub. L. 95-454, 92 Stat 1111 (1978).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board notes initially that the revised FPM Ch. 752 3-3e(3), transmitted by FPM Ch. 752-11 dated August 5, 1980, cites the <span class="Italic">Henckle</span> decision and provides that an agency may consider prior disciplinary actions, "if the employee has been given the entitlement to a full review of the prior disciplinary action, i.e., due process..." (emphasis added.)</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">More importantly, however, the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 U.S.C. 7513, 7701, did not diminish an employee's right to dispute the agency's charges in an adverse action proceeding. Fundamental fairness requires that the Board not rely on charges which have never been proven. Where a employee has previously been afforded the protection of due process in a prior disciplinary proceeding, the merits of the charges underlying the prior disciplinary actions need not be relitigated. However, where the employee has not had a prior opportunity to dispute the charges and where, as in this appeal, the agency puts on no proof with respect to the prior disciplinary action, that action may not properly be considered in reviewing a penalty.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> was <span class="Italic">Henkle v. Campbell,</span> 462 F. Supp. 1286, 1298 (D. Kan. 1978), <span class="Italic">aff'd, Henkle v. Campbell,</span> 626 F.2d 811 (10th Cir. 1980), setting out the practice as to prior discipline under the FPM:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Plaintiff alleges that he was denied due process because the two reprimands dated January 4, 1977, were considered in his termination. His position is that consideration of these two reprimands did not satisfy the Commission criteria contained in FPM Supp. 752-1, Section S4-3(b)(1), that therefore he did not prepare to respond to the reprimands at the May 24, 1977, hearing, and thus he did not have an opportunity to answer and was thus denied due process. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The two reprimands were listed in the Notice of Proposed Action as "elements of your past record [which] will be considered in arriving at a decision if the charges[1A and 1B] are sustained."... The next question is whether plaintiff was afforded his right to have these reprimands set out "specifically and in detail" as required by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7512. The agency has set out standards for this determination in FPM Supplement 752-1. S4-3(b)(1), Special Situations, provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">When an employee has been subjected to disciplinary action for one or more past offenses and the agency uses his disciplinary record as part of the basis for a current adverse action against him, the specificity and detail required of the agency--and also the extent of review and consideration required of the Commission on appeal--depend on whether the past disciplinary action meets three criteria: First, the employee was informed of the action in writing; second, the employee was given an opportunity <span id="Page_2414"></span>to dispute the action by having it reviewed, on its merits, by an authority different from the one that took the action; and third, the action was made a matter of record. The difference in treatment, depending on whether these criteria are or are not met, is as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a) If all three of the above criteria are met, the "specifically and in detail" requirement is satisfied by the agency's setting forth the nature of the action, the date it was effected, and the offense for which it was administered....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b) If all three of the above criteria are not met, the "specifically and in detail" requirement is not satisfied unless the agency sets forth the particulars of the offense for which the discipline was administered, in the same manner as it must set forth the particulars of an offense for which no discipline was administered. On appeal, the employee is entitled to have the past offense investigated, reviewed, and considered in the same manner as an offense for which no discipline was administered. In other words, there is no difference whatever in this case between the treatment of the past record element and the treatment of a current instance of wrongdoing.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board's adherence to <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> was reconfirmed in <span class="Italic">Holland v. DOD</span>, 83 MSPR 317, 321-22 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-8 (1999), adding that the AJ should do no more if past discipline is not challenged than to confirm that it exists:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...<span class="Italic">Bolling</span> addressed the Board's scope of review of a prior disciplinary record that is challenged on appeal. It did not directly address situations, as here, where, after reviewing the record we conclude the appellant never challenged on appeal the validity of the prior disciplinary record on which the agency relied in determining the penalty. Regarding situations such as this, <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> quoted with apparent approval the rule set forth in the former FPM that, where an appellant does not challenge the past disciplinary record, "only the occurrence of that action need be verified." Here, the appellant never challenged the validity of the prior disciplinary record on which the agency relied in determining her penalty, and the record evidence confirms the occurrence of the prior disciplinary actions for rude and discourteous behavior.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore agree with the agency's argument on review that the administrative judge erred by applying the <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> criteria to discount the appellant's prior disciplinary record. <span class="Italic">Cf. Lockridge v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 72 MSPR 613, 626 (1996) (where an appellant challenges a prior disciplinary action, the Board's review of the action is limited to the criteria set forth in <span class="Italic">Bolling</span>), <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 121 F.3d 727, 1997 WL 452796 (Fed.

Toth v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 76 MSPR 36, 40 (1997) (although the appellant did not specifically challenge the prior disciplinary action, the Board found that it could not be considered as to the penalty, in light of "the complete lack of record evidence upon which to determine whether the <span class="Italic">Bolling</span> criteria were met and the uncertainty about whether the suspension was 2 or 7 days long").</p>
