<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-90"><span class="space">1.</span> <span class="Bold"><span class="Italic">Ignacio</span></span></h4>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 16 MSPR 530 (1983), involved an appellant who suffered a disabling injury to his leg while serving in the military before his agency employment. He was hired as a distribution clerk by the Postal Service. A few months later he was reassigned to a letter carrier position. Several years later, after the appellant had taken a considerable amount of sick leave, his physician reported that the appellant's physical condition significantly limited his ability to perform as a full-time letter carrier. The agency then proposed his removal for inability to perform his job and because continued employment could aggravate the preexisting disability. When the removal decision letter was issued, employee requested and was denied reassignment either to a light duty position in the carrier craft or to a position in the clerk craft he held when initially employed. The AJ decided that the appellant was the victim of disability discrimination. The appellant could have performed work in his former clerical position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board concluded that to determine whether there was reasonable accommodation, it is necessary that the record contain information about the legitimate job requirements and complete duties, responsibilities, and qualifications of the employee's position; only with this information can it be determined if with reasonable accommodation--e.g., job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules--the appellant can perform the primary duties and responsibilities of his job. If with reasonable accommodation, the appellant could have performed his duties, then he would be a qualified disabled person and, under those circumstances, the agency would be required to reasonably accommodate the appellant's disability unless the agency could demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program or would require the agency to violate its collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> focused on the accommodative aspect of the appellant's case. The Board first determined that the collective bargaining agreement did not mandate a permanent light duty assignment. There was no evidence that the agency's position concerning the negotiated agreement was a pretext for discrimination. Then the Board turned its attention to the suggestion that the appellant be reassigned to a position in the clerk craft, stating the issue to be whether an agency is required to reassign a disabled employee to meet its obligation to reasonably accommodate him, a question the Board decided against the appellant. Finding the statement of purpose in the Rehabilitation Act, 29 USC 794a(a)(1) ("In fashioning an equitable or affirmative action remedy...a court may take into account the reasonableness of the cost of any necessary work place accommodation, and the availability of alternatives therefor or other appropriate relief in order to achieve an equitable and appropriate remedy.") to be insufficient to provide guidance concerning reassignment rights, the Board examined the then-current EEOC regulations requiring that a disabled employee be able to perform the essential functions of the position in question to be classified as a qualified disabled person. The issue was whether the "position in question" was limited to the position occupied by the appellant at the time of his removal or whether it included other positions. Because the EEOC regulation addressed the "position" and not "positions" in question, the reading of the regulation adopted by MSPB involved only the position last occupied. The Board rejected a broader interpretation of the statute and constructions placed upon the regulation by other agencies, including OPM, as outdated or beyond their area of expertise. With a restrictive reading of the EEOC regulation, and with no other EEOC interpretation aside from a decision stating that reassignment is not precluded as a reasonable accommodation, the Board concluded that reassignment to another position was not mandatory. The Board decided, in the alternative, that assuming that the agency was required to consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, reassignment of the appellant would violate the negotiated agreement between the agency and the union and would therefore be an undue hardship on the operation of the agency program<span class="Italic">. Id.</span> at 543</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Board Member Devaney dissented in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>. He argued that the restrictive interpretation of the EEOC regulation offered by the Board disregarded the intent of the Rehabilitation Act and EEOC regulations. He observed <span id="Page_3500"></span>that the regulations administered by EEOC were issued initially by the Civil Service Commission and that the Commission urged agencies to consider reassignment as a means of accommodation. OPM adopted the CSC interpretation in FPM Letter 751-2 (2/3/83) and in its <span class="Italic">Handbook on Reasonable Accommodation</span> (March 1980). He also explained that to qualify for a disability annuity under 5 USC 8337(a), an employee must not be able to perform in his position and may not qualify for reassignment to a vacant position permitting him to perform useful service--a situation creating difficulties for an employee fired for physical inability to perform a job and rejected for disability retirement because he was not assigned to a vacant position he could perform.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Mr. Ignacio took his case to the EEOC. That agency issued its decision on September 4, 1984 (EEOC No. 03840005). The EEOC decision gave a slightly different version of the facts than that recorded by MSPB. Mr. Ignacio had injured his leg, with a resultant permanent disability, before he entered the Postal Service. The employer knew of his medical history and hired him as a distribution clerk. For reasons not disclosed by the record, the appellant was converted to a letter carrier. Two years later, he experienced difficulties with his leg and became unable to work on permanent regular duty. Medical treatment improved the appellant's ability to work so that he could deliver mail on flat but not hilly terrain. The Postal Service declined to reassign Mr. Ignacio to light duty or to return him to the clerical position he had previously held.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC decided that the factual record developed and maintained by the Board was deficient in content and organization, but the Commission went ahead to analyze reassignment rights under the then-governing regulations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Consideration must now be given to the issue of reassignment. [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)] states that a qualified handicapped person is "...a handicapped person who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question." The Board found that reassignment was not, as a general principle, a means of reasonable accommodation. The Board reaches this conclusion by focusing upon the word "position" and finding that the singular use of this noun dictates that its meaning is limited to the last position held. The Commission holds that the word "position" as well as the phrase "position in question" under our regulations encompass a broader meaning when applied to factual situations such as this. Specifically, we hold that the "position in question" is not limited to the position occupied or held by the complainant, but also includes the position the complainant could have held as a result of reasonable accommodation. The Commission has previously held that reasonable accommodation <span class="Italic">may</span> <span class="Italic">include</span> [<span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR [1614.203(c)(2)] reassignment to another position although not specifically listed in the regulation. The touchstone for determining whether a particular personnel action or device is appropriate is determined by its reasonableness. It may well be the case that reassignment is eminently more reasonable and less onerous from an agency's perspective than job restructuring or any other action that is specifically listed in [29 CFR 1614.203(c)(2)(ii).]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission is mindful that the Board reached its contrary conclusion by assessing whether or not reassignment, as an accommodation, was, in fact, required of a Federal agency. Looking to Sec. [1614.203(c)(2)] for assistance, the Board interpreted this section as exclusively enumerating the ways an agency could accommodate a handicapped employee. The Commission, however, finds that the list provided therein includes the enumerated suggestions as illustrative "but <span class="Italic">shall</span> not be limited" to this itemization. The Commission also finds that reasonable accommodation must be a logical adjustment made to a job and/or work environment that enables a qualified handicapped person to perform....&#8197;As such, the list of possible means of accommodation is infinite and can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, it is important to consider both the legislative history and Congressional mandates of the Rehabilitation Act on Federal agencies. The legislative history of the Rehabilitation Act shows that Congress expected and fully intended that the Federal government was to be a model employer of the handicapped, taking affirmative action to hire and promote the disabled. S. Rep. No. 93-318, 93d Cong., 2d Sess, at 49 (1973). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">also</span>, [29 CFR 1614.101].The Rehabilitation Act requires all government agencies of the executive branch and the Postal Service to establish comprehensive affirmative action plans for hiring, <span class="Italic">placing</span>, and advancing handicapped individuals (emphasis added). By the 1978 amendments to the Act, Congress made it clear that non-discrimination against the handicapped was an "obligation" on the part of the Federal government, not a "gratuity." <span class="Italic">Shirey v. Devine</span>, 670 F.2d 1188 (D.C. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reassignment as a means of reasonable accommodation is consistent with the case law. The Rehabilitation Act "impose[s] a duty upon federal agencies to structure their procedures and programs so as to ensure that handicapped individuals are afforded equal opportunity in both job assignment and promotion." <span class="Italic">Ryan v. FDIC</span>, 565 F.2d 762 (D.C. Cir. 1977). In another case, the same court found that the federal employer failed to make adequate affirmative <span class="Italic">reassignment</span> <span class="Italic">efforts</span> for a handicapped employee. <span class="Italic">Doe v. Hampton</span>, 566 F.2d 265 (D.C. Cir. 1977). (emphasis added). The obligation of the federal employer is not merely the employment of a handicapped person but an appropriate placement of such an employee. In other words, the federal employer has a continuing obligation to the handicapped employee after hiring him.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">EEOC discounted agency arguments that reassignment of Mr. Ignacio would violate the agency collective bargaining agreement with its union. EEOC found no evidence of a contract violation and went on to hold that federal law (relating to accommodation) is paramount, superseding the collective bargaining agreement:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Whereas the rights and obligations of a negotiated agreement conferred on employees collectively...foster the process of bargaining and may be relinquished by the parties for economic benefits, the Rehabilitation Act concerns individual rights and cannot be supplanted by the terms of a negotiated agreement. To hold otherwise would permit parties to bargain away the rights granted by the Rehabilitation Act and ultimately defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind the Rehabilitation Act. Petitioner is asserting a statutory right independent of the negotiated agreement. The tension between contractual and statutory objections must be resolved in favor of the protections granted handicapped persons under the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Commission sent the case back to the MSPB under 5 USC 7702(b)(5)(B) for Board consideration of the Commission holdings. The Board could not agree with the result. In <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 28 MSPR 337 (1985), the MSPB stated its disagreement with the EEOC determination that the Rehabilitation Act mandates consideration of reassignment. The appeal was certified to the Special Panel under 5 USC 7702(d). Member Devaney again dissented in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, 28 MSPR at 341:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In Greek mythology, the King of Crete commissioned the great architect and inventor, Daedalus, to construct a special place of confinement for the Minotaur from which escape would be impossible. Daedalus built the Labyrinth. Once inside one would travel endlessly along its twisting paths without ever finding the exit. The Athenian hero Theseus entered the maze with a ball of thread which he fastened on the inside of the entrance way and then unwound as he went forward. After slaying the monster, Theseus retraced his steps by following the thread which guided his way out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Theseus escaped the Labyrinth, but even he would be hard pressed to find his way through the convoluted maze of overlapping jurisdiction which marks the mixed case area where federal discrimination law and personnel law intersect.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Special Panel met, deliberated, and decided the 1980 removal case in February of 1986. <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, Special Panel 1 (Board representative Ellingwood dissenting from the Panel's majority decision). After extensive discussion of its jurisdiction and review standards, and after an elaborate analysis of the respective expertise of MSPB and EEOC, the Panel announced its decision, sustaining EEOC's requirement of reassignment as an accommodation, <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 30 MSPR 471, 485-87 (Spec. Pan. 1986):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC does not rely upon its interpretation of civil service law as the necessary premise for its conclusion....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Indeed, the MSPB's finding that the EEOC's decision was "therefore <span class="Italic">dependent</span> on the Rehabilitation Act and the EEOC's implementing regulations found at [29 CFR 1614.203] " states the proper basis for EEOC's decision....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The question of whether reassignment must be considered as a means of reasonably accommodating handicapped employees was answered affirmatively by the EEOC in this case as a matter of discrimination law. For the MSPB to find that absent an express reference to reassignment in the Act such a conclusion is "overbroad" is for the MSPB to engage in an interpretation of the Rehabilitation Act itself. Apart from the fact that this is not within the MSPB's area of expertise, the MSPB is not authorized by &#x00A7; 7702 to take issue with EEOC decisions which in the MSPB's view misinterpret the Rehabilitation Act....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The MSPB may not force review on the merits of EEOC decisions based on discrimination law with which it disagrees by categorizing those decisions as falling within 5 USC 7702(c)(2). This would amount to an abuse of the appellate procedures outlined in &#x00A7; 7702. The Panel will not countenance abuse of this process by the MSPB or the EEOC. The EEOC likewise may not apply discrimination law under &#x00A7; 7702(b) to overturn a decision of the MSPB where the EEOC's interpretation or application of the law is so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law. Either scenario would upset the balance &#x00A7; 7702 was intended to strike.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore find that the MSPB's characterization of the EEOC's decision as constituting an incorrect interpretation of civil service law is erroneous. Unless an EEOC decision depends upon civil service law for its support, or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, it does not rise to the level of conflict with civil service law contemplated in 5 USC &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2)(A), and will not be disturbed by the Panel.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Having found that the EEOC's decision does not constitute an incorrect <span id="Page_3501"></span>interpretation of civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive, it remains for us to determine whether there is any reasonable basis for the EEOC's decision. We find that although there is room for disagreement on the merits, a reasonable basis for the decision does exist. The EEOC interpreted its own regulations in this instance, concluding that the list of accommodations...should be construed as including reassignment. <span class="Italic">See</span> [29 CFR 1614.203(c)(2)].We have not been apprised of any provision of law which would render such an interpretation unreasonable or preclude the possibility that reassignment is within the scope of reasonable accommodation. In fact, the EEOC advances its own reasons why such an interpretation is indeed reasonable. Whether it is the most reasonable or the only reasonable interpretation is irrelevant, since we need only find, as we have, that the EEOC's interpretation is reasonable and consistent with the Rehabilitation Act and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board elaborated on the <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> requirements in <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 636, 638-39 (1987), as it remanded the appeal for analysis by the AJ of whether the appellant's position could be restructured to meet his disabling back problems:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>...the Special Panel found that an agency must consider reassignment as a reasonable accommodation of a qualified handicapped employee. In doing so, it adopted the decision of the...EEOC....&#8197;The EEOC had held that the phrase "position in question" in [29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6)], which provides in part that a qualified handicapped person is one who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question, is not limited to the position occupied or held by the complainant. Rather, it also includes the position the complainant could have held as a result of reasonable accommodation by reassignment....&#8197;Because a handicapped employee must be considered "qualified" if he can perform the essential functions of a reassigned position with a reasonable accommodation,[2] we find that the agency is required to consider whether other positions identified by the appellant could be restructured to accommodate his handicap.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[2]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. United States Postal Service</span>, 6 MSPR 637, 645-46 (1981) (if an appellant is capable of performing the essential functions of his position, based on the legitimate requirements of the position, with reasonable accommodation by the agency and without endangering the health and safety of himself or others, he meets the requirements of a "qualified handicapped person" under 29 CFR 1613.702(f)). We note that in this case, the administrative judge first found that the appellant was not a qualified handicapped individual and then discussed the agency's attempts to accommodate him by reassignment. Under <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet</span>, she should have considered whether the appellant could be reasonably accommodated by reassignment before determining whether the appellant met the definition of a qualified handicapped individual. Because she in fact considered reassignment, however, this particular error did not affect the outcome of the case.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After remand, the Board decided that Mr. Boomer was the victim of disability discrimination and entitled to a back pay remedy, <span class="Italic">Boomer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 540, 543-44 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The proper framework for analyzing the back-pay issue here was set forth in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 35 MSPR 55 (1987). There, the Board attempted to reconcile the Back Pay Act's "ready, willing and able" standard with the agency's obligations under the Rehabilitation Act. Under <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, an agency previously found to have failed to accommodate must show "that it has some substance to its defense," <span class="Italic">id</span>. at 64, by demonstrating that accommodation would not have been possible or that there is evidence the appellant could not have worked with a reasonable accommodation before the appellant is required to prove his ability to work. Only if the agency overcomes this hurdle, is the appellant required to show the ability to work during the period. Even then, however, all he would have to show is that he could, indeed, have worked, <span class="Italic">if accommodated. See generally, Lamb v. Department of the Navy,</span> 41 MSPR 79, 83-85 (1989) (employee failed to show that agency could accommodate her handicap--allergy to a wide range of chemical substances--and thus failed to sustain burden of proving that she was ready, willing and able during period for which she sought back pay).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record reflects that, although it was undisputed that the appellant was unable to work in his former position as a Sandblaster, he showed that he would have been able to resume work in a less arduous position or be reassigned, as an accommodation for his injury. <span class="Italic">See Royal v. United States Department of the Air Force,</span> 21 MSPR 609, 611 (1984) (the agency failed to rebut the appellant's showing that, without unduly burdening the agency's accomplishment of its mission, other employees could assist him in the lifting of heavy items). In particular, he showed that he could be reassigned to one of the vacant mail clerk or messenger positions....&#8197;Therefore, the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant could "not work in any position during the period in question."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, because of the agency's failure to act in accordance with its obligation, the appellant is not in the same position he would have been in had he not been wrongfully discharged. <span class="Italic">See Kerr v. National Endowment for the Arts,</span> 726 F.2d 730, 733 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (if an employee has been wrongfully removed, he is entitled to be returned as nearly as possible to the <span class="Italic">status quo ante</span>). Thus, the agency acted improperly in not providing the appellant with the back pay he was owed. Accordingly, the Board finds that since the appellant was ready, willing and able to perform, with accommodation, he is entitled to back pay, with an offset for the OWCP payments he has already received.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">For those interested in the culmination of the <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> litigation, spanning 1980 through 1987, review the back pay and compliance litigation described in <span class="Italic">Ignacio v. USPS</span>, 35 MSPR 55 (1987). The Board has followed <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> with some reluctance, noting in <span class="Italic">Ellis v. USPS</span>, 37 MSPR 503, 507 (1988), that, notwithstanding the Special Panel's position in <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, many federal courts have rejected the position that reassignment is an accommodation that an agency should make in appropriate circumstances. Clearly, prior to <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span>, the Board's position was that if an appellant could not perform the duties of his permanent position with accommodation, he was not a qualified disabled employee entitled under the Rehabilitation Act to placement in other positions that he could perform; the agency could demote the employee, but the employee had no claim, aside from agency regulations, that would entitle him to a position higher than the job held through demotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Quintanilla v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 26 MSPR 690, 691 (1985). <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> changed that result by changing the concept of a "qualified handicapped employee" to one who cannot perform, due to a disability, in one position, but who can perform in another position.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The EEOC reentered the picture with a regulatory interpretation of what the Rehabilitation Act requires by way of reassignment efforts. The Commission regulation provided, at 29 CFR 1614.203(g) (2001):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">(g)&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Reassignment</span>. When a nonprobationary employee becomes unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation due to a handicap, an agency shall offer to reassign the individual to a funded vacant position located in the same commuting area and serviced by the same appointing authority, and at the same grade or level, the essential functions of which the individual would be able to perform with reasonable accommodation if necessary unless the agency can demonstrate that the reassignment would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. In the absence of a position at the same grade or level, an offer of reassignment to a vacant position at the highest available grade or level below the employee's current grade or level shall be required, but availability of such a vacancy shall not affect the employee's entitlement, if any, to disability retirement pursuant to 5 USC 8337 or 5 USC 8451. If the agency has already posted a notice or announcement seeking applications for a specific vacant position at the time the agency has determined that the nonprobationary employee is unable to perform the essential functions of his or her position even with reasonable accommodation, then the agency does not have an obligation under this section to offer to reassign the individual to that position, but the agency must consider the individual on an equal basis with those who applied for the position. For the purpose of this paragraph, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall not be considered qualified for any offer of reassignment that would be inconsistent with the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The 1999 regulation was displaced in 2002 with ADA regulations at 29 CFR 1630.2 (2022) with reference to reassignment as one means of accommodation:</p>

USPS</span>, 85 MSPR 494, 497 &#x00B6; 6 (2000) (noting an EEOC regulation and stating that "the agency's failure to meet its obligation prior to removing, or, as here, suspending, the employee from her position does not relieve the appellant of her burden of ultimately showing before the Board that such positions existed and were available").</p>
