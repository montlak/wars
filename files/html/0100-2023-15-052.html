<h5 class="h5" id="sec8-53"><span class="space">b.</span> Longer AWOL</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Although removal is a reasonable penalty for excessive unauthorized absence when the employee has lengthy service and no prior discipline, <span class="Italic">Jefferies v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 78 MSPR 255, 262-63 (1998), lengthy AWOL can be mitigated. An employee AWOL from March 28 through June 15 was removed, but the Board mitigated the removal to a 60-day suspension because the appellant, although a supervisor whom the agency may hold to a higher standard of conduct, was 67 years old, suffered various physical problems, had 1,000 hours of accumulated sick leave, sought sick leave, did not (because of out-of-state medical treatment) receive several of the agency's requests for medical documentation, lost her home to fire while she was seeking medical treatment, and had 37 years of service. <span class="Italic">Mann v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 265, 267-68 (1985). What appeared to amount to six weeks of AWOL (while the appellant was attending a custodial drug rehabilitation program) resulted in mitigation of a removal to a 30-day suspension. There was no prior discipline; the employee was previously dependable, and there was no showing that the absence caused the agency undue hardship or that the employee lacked rehabilitative potential. Nine days of AWOL did not warrant removal for an employee with long service, good performance, and good rehabilitative potential that was not considered by the agency's deciding official; a 60-day suspension was imposed by the Board. <span class="Italic">Robb v. DOD</span>, 77 MSPR 130, 137-38 (1997). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. VA,</span> CH-0752-14-0185-I-1 (NP 6/11/2015) (40 day absence warranted removal; mitigation set aside: "We find that the deciding official's consideration of the appellant's condition was appropriate. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Tate v. Department of Defense</span>, 57 M.S.P.R. 180, 190 (1993) (considering in the penalty analysis the appellant's lack of rehabilitation potential due to his refusal to seek treatment); <span class="Italic">see also</span> <span class="Italic">Bishopp v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 75 M.S.P.R. 33, 41 (1997) (noting that the appellant's failure to bring her mental health condition to the agency's attention and the fact that she initially did not cooperate in seeking treatment could indicate a lack of rehabilitative potential)," removal sustained following Federal Circuit remand, <span class="Italic">Purifoy v. VA</span>, CH-0752-14-0185-M-1 (NP 5/16/2022)). An AWOL charge is mitigated if the violation was a strictly technical failure to obtain advance approval for leave with no indication of exigency or other circumstances that would lead to denial of the requested leave. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Gatling v. NTSB</span>, 17 MSPR 43, 47 (1983).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Other AWOL charges are occasionally excused or the resulting discipline is mitigated. Removal was reduced to a 30-day suspension for an appellant guilty of a series of <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> offenses leading to a charge of being away from a working area during working hours. The appellant was required to perform in a highly structured industrial setting where minor violations of procedures were reasonably foreseeable. There was no demonstration that the infractions resulted in loss of productivity or endangerment to other employees. An employment record of over four years suggested that the employee could continue to contribute to the mission of the agency. <span class="Italic">Blade v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 82, 85, 7 MSPB 573 (1981). Pain resulting from an injury, leading to time off for treatment, mitigated AWOL when the appellant's attendance was not critical and the employee's past work record was excellent. <span class="Italic">Beasley v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 631, 637-38 (1987); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Howard v. USPS</span>, 72 MSPR 422, 427 (1996) (mitigating removal to a 60-day suspension of an employee with a long service record and very little past discipline when the employee, charged with sleeping on duty, was using a prescription drug that caused drowsiness); <span class="Italic">Williams v. GSA</span>, 14 MSPR 281, 282-83 (1982) (removal of a federal protective officer who was "unfit for duty" and who missed one day's work was mitigated to a suspension because of the appellant's attempts at rehabilitation from alcoholism, his personal problems (family illness), and the appellant's attempts to secure leave for the time he was off work); <span class="Italic">Platt v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 495, 496-97 (1981) (removal was mitigated to a 21-day suspension for an appellant who slept on duty to alleviate pain from an on-the-job injury and who was charged with leaving the agency premises without permission to visit his congressional office to deal with the claim he had pending concerning that <span id="Page_2496"></span>injury); <span class="Italic">McArthur v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 303, 305-06 (1981) (mitigating an AWOL removal when the appellant had a legitimate need for leave and had a sufficient leave balance, but the agency apparently denied the leave for a lack of documentation that the Board seemed to think was unnecessary). <span class="Italic">But see</span> <span class="Italic">Young v. USPS</span>, 79 MSPR 25, 40 (1998) (although the death of a parent and the need to take time to put the decedent's affairs in order would ordinarily be a mitigating factor in an AWOL case, mitigation was not appropriate when the appellant did not keep the agency informed of the circumstances or advise the agency that she would need additional time off); <span class="Italic">Goulet v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 37 MSPR 492, 495-96 (1988) (sustaining removal of a pipefitter apprentice for, among other charges, leaving the shipyard without permission; prior disciplinary record).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">When a table of penalties allowed anything from a reprimand to a 14-day suspension for a second offense of AWOL for more than eight hours, removal was set aside when a period of about a week of AWOL resulted from incarceration. The agency failed to establish unusual circumstances warranting departure from the penalty guide. <span class="Italic">Williams v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 347, 350 (1987). But AWOL for over five months as a result of incarceration was resoundingly held to be just cause for removal in <span class="Italic">Gibbs v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 33 MSPR 261, 264 (1987). When the agency improperly relied on an incident of past discipline to support a particular level of penalty under its table of penalties, the Board reevaluated the removal and substituted a suspension, noting: "[N]either the agency's table of penalties, nor its deciding official, would call for the penalty of removal, if faced with an accurate account of the appellant's prior disciplinary record. We find that it is not reasonable to continue to adhere to a penalty that the agency imposed on the basis of faulty information, after that error has been revealed during the course of the Board's hearing." <span class="Italic">Winston v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 96, 102 (1991); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">McArthur v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 8 MSPR 303, 305 (1981), <span class="Italic">supra</span> ("[T]he agency...relied upon disciplinary actions 'outside the normal reckoning period' when arriving at the decision to remove the appellant[.]").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">AWOL of less than two months warranted reduction of removal to a 60-day suspension for an employee who presented evidence of a personality problem and mental impairment. The emotional disorder did not preclude the employee from complying with leave requirements, but the impairment was a mitigating factor--albeit one known to the agency only after the appeal--along with an otherwise long and honorable service record that warranted reduction in the penalty. <span class="Italic">Ajanaku v. DOD</span>, 44 MSPR 350, 356 (1990); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lewis v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 51 MSPR 475, 385-86 (1991) (removal was mitigated to a suspension because, although the appellant had a poor leave record, his AWOL was caused by a personal emergency; his leave record had improved, showing rehabilitative potential; the agency did not show that the offense harmed the agency's mission or adversely affected the appellant's ability to perform his duties); <span class="Italic">Montalvo v. USPS</span>, 50 MSPR 48, 51 (1991) (mitigating to suspension a removal based on the failure to maintain a regular work schedule and AWOL: the appellant's absences occurred when she was suffering from severe, medically-related emotional problems, some requiring medication and hospitalization). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Pitsenberger v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 9 MSPR 403, 408 (1982) (alleged short-term emotional disturbance was insufficient to warrant mitigation of the removal of a high-level employee for an unauthorized absence; the position involved substantial responsibility and trust).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">That the employee has a leave balance does not necessarily excuse AWOL, <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 112 MSPR 288, 292-93 &#x00B6; 9, 2009 MSPB 185 (2009):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, even if the appellant had 40 hours of annual leave as he asserts, such fact does not necessarily mean that the agency would have approved its use on the occasions at issue here. Nor does it change the fact that the appellant repeatedly failed to follow leave requesting procedures. Accordingly, we discern no error in the arbitrator's finding that the agency established a nexus between the charges and the efficiency of the service.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">De</span> <span class="Italic">minimis</span> charges aside, AWOL is generally not condoned. The Board considered AWOL of two months to be very serious despite problems at the work site that included isolation of the appellant by her coworkers, unclear lines of supervisory authority, lack of experience in supervision, and failure of management to provide meaningful assistance to the appellant. The job tensions did not excuse the conduct. Removal was sustained. <span class="Italic">Marty v. DHHS</span>, 8 MSPR 231, 233-34, 7 MSPB 700 (1981). A similar result was reached in <span class="Italic">Ramos v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 539, 540 (1984): the presence of job tensions, including discriminatory conditions, did not justify AWOL. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ajanaku v. DOD</span>, 44 MSPR 350, 353 (1990) (mere presence of job tensions will not justify AWOL). If an employee's past work history shows no indication that his misconduct, e.g., excessive absence, will improve, there is no basis for mitigation of a removal. <span class="Italic">Huston v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 6 MSPR 260, 264, 6 MSPB 223 (1981).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board will consider as a mitigating factor whether the appellant's medical condition or medications contributed to her inability to follow leave-requesting procedures. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sherlock v. GSA</span>, 103 MSPR 352, 2006 MSPB 277 (2006) (removal for AWOL and failure to follow procedures for requesting leave). The Board considers prior discipline. Mitigation was inappropriate for three days of AWOL. No explanation for the absence was given and there was a prior disciplinary record for the same offense. The prior discipline demonstrated an attempt to rehabilitate the employee through progressive discipline; repetition of the offense demonstrated that future rehabilitation was unlikely. <span class="Italic">Spates v. Dept. of Army</span>, 20 MSPR 133, 134 (1984); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Adams v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 112 MSPR 288, 296-98 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 19-21, 2009 MSPB 185 (2009) (despite improved attendance, a prior history of leave problems weighed against mitigation of a removal based in part upon more recent AWOL); <span class="Italic">Merchant v. USPS</span>, 52 MSPR 330, 334 (1992) (AWOL: "The record of progressive discipline...demonstrates that sanctions less severe than removal have not been successful in modifying the appellant's conduct, nor can such lesser sanctions be expected to serve to deter such conduct in the future."); <span class="Italic">Thomas v. OPM</span>, 47 MSPR 369, 374 (1991) ("Where an employee is on notice that the agency considers her leave usage excessive and the employee has a prior disciplinary record of leave infractions, removal is an appropriate penalty."); <span class="Italic">Cook v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 34 MSPR 26, 29 (1987) (several instances of AWOL justified a removal after counseling and a prior disciplinary settlement for similar misconduct); <span class="Italic">Soriano v. VA</span>, 9 MSPR 602, 604 (1982) (three instances of AWOL justified the removal of a housekeeping aide with a short service record and a "vitriolic" relationship with coworkers).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There was little potential for rehabilitation for an employee who could not justify the use of sick leave while on a leave restriction letter and whose leave record did not improve during the restriction period. <span class="Italic">Kean v. Dept. of Army</span>, 24 MSPR 226, 228 (1984). <span class="Italic">Griffin v. Dept. of Army</span>, 15 MSPR 738, 740 (1983), reversed an AJ's mitigation of removal to a 10-day suspension. Because it was the third offense of AWOL, the AJ improperly considered only the mitigating circumstances of the appellant's job performance. The employee was on notice of the nature of the misconduct, she had a past record of AWOL, and the penalty was in line with the agency table of penalties.

Dept. of Transp</span>., 76 MSPR 126 (1997), under "<a href="0100-2023-19-044.html#sec12-44">Religion</a>" for the defense of disparate treatment to an AWOL case and failure to provide accommodation as a result of the conflict between religious and job attendance obligations.]</p>
