<h4 class="h4" id="sec13-86"><span class="space">1.</span> Exhaustion of Remedies; Amendment of Appeal</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The IRA appeal divorced from an otherwise appealable action depends on prior resort to OSC. <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. MSPB</span>, 953 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1992); <span class="Italic">Mullins v. DOJ</span>, 57 MSPR 496, 501 (1993) (remanding for a determination of whether and when the appellant actually filed an OSC complaint); <span class="Italic">Knollenberg v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 47 MSPR 92, 96-97 (1991) (appellant failed to complain to OSC of nonselection for a specific position); 5 CFR 1209.5(a) (2022). "To satisfy the exhaustion requirement of 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3), an appellant must give OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation which might lead to corrective action." <span class="Italic">Schaeffer v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 86 MSPR 606, 613 &#x00B6; 8 (2000) (<span class="Italic">Schaeffer</span> overruled as to the determination that an IRA appeal would cover an alleged involuntary retirement, since the involuntary retirement is an appealable constructive action, <span class="Italic">Covarrubias v. SSA,</span> <a href="https://www.mspb.gov/decisions/precedential/COVARRUBIAS_JOANNA_SF_1221_09_0133_W_1_OPINION_AND_ORDER_500317.pdf">113 MSPR 583</a>, 587 n.2, 2010 MSPB 90 (2010), <span class="Italic">Covarrubias in turn overruled by Colbert v. VA</span>, 121 MSPR 677, 684 n.5, 2014 MSPB 80 (2014)). Without an otherwise appealable action, allegations of whistleblowing disclosures that were not brought to OSC cannot be considered in an IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Shively v. Dept. of Army</span>, 59 MSPR 531, 538 (1993); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Page v. Dept. of Navy,</span> 101 MSPR 513, 516 n.4, 2006 MSPB 93 (2006) ("Although the appellant argues that he made additional disclosures, we have not considered them because he did not show that he raised them before OSC."). An appellant may not raise with the Board through an IRA case a personnel action, e.g., a performance appraisal, presented to OSC for investigation but withdrawn from the OSC investigation and not reinstated with OSC before the initiation of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Campo v. Dept. of Army</span>, 93 MSPR 1, 5 &#x00B6; 11 (2002). But the appellant may bring to the Board a matter, e.g., a pending reassignment, after OSC was effectively notified of the pending action and after OSC issued its closeout letter, even though the date of the closeout letter precedes the effective date of the reassignment. <span class="Italic">Schmittling v. Dept. of Army</span>, 92 MSPR 572, 584 &#x00B6; 27 (2002).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">After OSC evaluates a complaint and decides to take no action on it, OSC provides to the complainant a preliminary determination letter explaining its decision and allowing the complainant a set period to respond to that letter and provide reasons that OSC overlooked or argument as to why OSC should take up the case. Assuming no further substantive involvement by OSC, two more letters go to the complainant in the normal course: one letter states that OSC will take no action on the complaint; the second letter explains that the complainant has sought relief from OSC and that OSC is notifying the complainant of his right to file an IRA appeal with MSPB within a set period of time, usually 65 days. The latter letter is usually provided by the appellant to OSC as proof of exhaustion of the OSC remedy. A complainant may decide not to respond to the preliminary determination letter. The response is permissive. A failure to respond is not a failure to exhaust remedies that precludes MSPB jurisdiction over the subsequent IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Chambers v. DHS</span>, 2022 MSPB 8, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5-8 (2022).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Exhaustion of OSC remedies is jurisdictional and may be raised <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> by the Board, by its AJ, or by either party at any time during a Board proceeding. If jurisdiction is raised by the AJ, however, the AJ should inform the appellant of what he must show to establish Board jurisdiction over his IRA appeal. Normally, evidence of exhaustion of remedies should first be presented to the AJ. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Engler v.

<p class="Body-Text">The exhaustion requirement was briefly summarized with reference to a stay application in <span class="Italic">Lozada v. EEOC</span>, 45 MSPR 310, 312-13 (1990), involving an appellant who claimed that her demotion was threatened in retaliation for prior appeals to the Board:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...Neither a proposed nor a "threatened" demotion is directly appealable under 5 USC 7512 or 4303.... An employee may nevertheless request a stay of a proposed or "threatened" personnel action, including a demotion, under the Whistleblower Protection Act where the action was based upon whistleblowing activities as defined by 5 USC 2302(b)(2)(8).... In order to do so, however, the employee must first have sought corrective action from the Special Counsel, and must have exhausted those proceedings. 5 USC 1214(a)(3); 5 CFR 1209.5(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the appellant has not even alleged that she sought corrective action from the Special Counsel. We therefore find that, since the appellant failed to raise a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction, the administrative judge properly denied her request for a hearing....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The requirement that OSC remedies be initially exhausted in an IRA case means only that the case must remain with OSC for the shorter of 120 days or the time it takes OSC to act or affirmatively state that it will not act on a case. Historically, the chances that OSC will act in less than 120 days on an IRA case are slim, meaning that most IRA cases will move to the Board at the instance of the appellant and without the active involvement of OSC.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The submission to OSC that fulfills the exhaustion requirement for an IRA must be as a complaint that a whistleblower disclosure caused a personnel action adverse to the appellant. It is not sufficient that there be only a covered disclosure be made to OSC for the purpose of having OSC refer the disclosed condition to the responsible agency for investigation. OSC can be used as a conduit for whistleblowing disclosures through its disclosure unit. Or it can be employed as an entity to receive a complaint from an employee or applicant for employee of reprisal based upon a prior whistleblowing disclosure. The latter contact to OSC, not the former, exhausts the IRA process for later resort to the MSPB through an IRA appeal. One must use the proper OSC form, now an OSC-14, or check the proper box on the OSC website, "Prohibited Personnel Practice," submit the digital version of the OSC-14 to launch an IRA case that can be subsequently appealed to the Board.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Clemente v. DHS</span>, 101 MSPR 519, 521-25 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-13, 2006 MSPB 83 (2006), explained the distinctions between an IRA-style complaint to the OSC, now ordinarily made through the OSC Form OSC-14, and a disclosure made to OSC for purposes of referral for external investigation, ordinarily also now made on the OSC-14 form, and sometimes made, through electronic filing, on a combined form (the nomenclature of OSC forms has changed over the years):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OSC has several powers and functions, including protecting employees, former employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214, receiving and investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices, and "receiv[ing], review[ing], and where appropriate, forward[ing] to the Attorney General or an agency head under section 1213, disclosures of violations of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1212(a). A "prohibited personnel practice" is defined at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b), and includes under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8) taking or failing to take, or threatening to take or fail to take, a personnel action because of a disclosure of information of wrongdoing as described above. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(a)(1).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Sections 1213 and 1214 of Title 5, United States Code, are respectively entitled, "Provisions relating to disclosures of violations of law, gross mismanagement, and certain other matters," and "Investigation of prohibited personnel practices; corrective action." Under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(b), whenever OSC receives a disclosure of information from an employee which the employee reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety, OSC shall review such information and determine whether there is a substantial likelihood that the information discloses <span id="Page_3785"></span>such wrongdoing. If OSC makes a positive determination, it shall transmit the information to the appropriate agency head and generally require that the agency head conduct an investigation and submit a written report. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(c). Any such report shall include a description of any action taken or planned as a result of the investigation, such as restoration of any aggrieved employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(d). OSC shall transmit a copy of the report to the complainant, and the complainant may submit comments. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(e)(1). OSC shall then transmit the report, the complainant's comments, and any comments or recommendations by OSC, to the President and the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the agency which the disclosure involves. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(e)(3). If OSC does not transmit the information to the agency head, OSC shall inform the individual of the reasons why the disclosure may not be further acted upon and other offices available for receiving disclosures, should the individual wish to pursue the matter further. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1213(g)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">By contrast, OSC shall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and investigate the allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice had occurred, exists, or is to be taken. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(A). No later than ten days before OSC terminates any investigation of a prohibited personnel practice, OSC shall provide a status report of the proposed findings of fact and legal conclusions, and afford the person an opportunity to submit written comments about the report. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(1)(D). If OSC terminates an investigation, it shall prepare and transmit to any person on whose allegation the investigation was initiated a written statement notifying the person of, among other things, the reasons for terminating the investigation and a response to any comments submitted. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(2)(A). An employee, like the appellant, may seek corrective action from the Board by filing an IRA appeal under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1221 if the employee "seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8)" from OSC, OSC notifies the employee that an investigation concerning such employee has been terminated, and either no more than sixty days have elapsed since notification was provided to such employee that the investigation was terminated, or 120 days after seeking corrective action from OSC the employee has not been notified by OSC that OSC shall seek corrective action on behalf of the employee. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant submitted to OSC on or about October 11, 2002, a Form OSC-12, entitled "Disclosure of Information." The first page of the form notified the appellant that the OSC Disclosure Unit serves as a secure channel that can be used to make disclosures, that OSC does not have the authority to investigate the disclosures that it receives, and that it will refer protected disclosures that establish a substantial likelihood of wrongdoing to the appropriate agency head, require the agency head to conduct an investigation, and submit a written report on the findings of the investigation. The form explains that, if OSC finds no substantial likelihood that the information discloses wrongdoing, OSC must inform the whistleblower of the reasons, and direct the whistleblower to other offices available for receiving disclosures.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the Form OSC-12 includes a section for whistleblowers to provide details regarding their disclosures, it does not include a corresponding space for setting forth personnel actions, or otherwise solicit information relating to prohibited personnel practices. The appellant alleged in a narrative on his Form OSC-12 that he complained to two superiors that "they should have implemented some intra-office procedures to handle anti-terrorism cases, as outlined in various INS [Immigration &#x0026; Naturalization Service] policy memorandums," that he filed an equal employment opportunity (EEO) complaint against them based on racial discrimination, and that after an EEO counselor met with the superiors "regarding the matters alleged in my complaint," one of the superiors ordered him to appear at a management inquiry/investigation and provide testimony under oath relating to an apparent discrepancy in hours he worked. The appellant appears to have alleged in the narrative additional disclosures to OSC, consistent with the purpose of Form OSC-12, by asserting that one of the superiors: (1) Refused to observe his <span class="Italic">Miranda</span> rights; (2) placed him in apprehension of a physical attack; (3) took his testimony under oath without proper legal authority; (4) engaged in disparate treatment based on race in disciplinary matters; and (5) deliberately misused his authority to intimidate staff. The only possible connection alleged by the appellant between a disclosure and a potential personnel action is his assertion that, "I believe their intent is to revoke my security clearance and take disciplinary action against me for complaining about their failure to establish anti-terrorism procedures and for filing an EEO case against them."[*] The appellant concluded by writing that, "I believe the reprisal will get worse, and that I will be subjected to constant harassment, retaliation, and abuse of authority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;Even assuming that the appellant's disclosure of information to OSC, filed on Form OSC-12, was intended to constitute a complaint of a prohibited personnel practice, he did not allege that a protected disclosure was a contributing factor in a personnel action. The appellant's disclosure of information to the wrongdoers would not constitute a protected disclosure, <span class="Italic">see Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001), and reprisal for filing an EEO complaint is a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(9), not 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(8). Even assuming that these disclosures were protected, the appellant's mere speculation that the agency intended to revoke his security clearance and discipline him in the future does not constitute a personnel action, or even a threatened personnel action. <span class="Italic">See Slake v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 53 M.S.P.R. 207, 215-16 (1992) (the Board may not assert jurisdiction over all stages in the stream of proceedings leading to a personnel action); <span class="Italic">Godfrey v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 45 M.S.P.R. 298, 303-04 (1990) (finding no evidence that Congress intended to extend the right to bring an IRA appeal based solely on generalized assertions and fears unsupported by reference to any specific matter).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a March 8, 2004 letter, the Chief of OSC's Disclosure Unit informed the appellant that the Disclosure Unit had a severe backlog of cases for several years and had been unable to act upon the appellant's allegations in a timely manner. OSC informed the appellant that it would take no further action on the allegations, but that he could report the information to his agency's Office of Inspector General. The letter further informed the appellant that, "[I]f you have not already received an OSC Form 11 to file a prohibited personnel practice complaint, you may print one from OSC's website," and that, "[s]hould you have any questions regarding filing a prohibited personnel practice complaint, please contact the Complaints Examining Unit."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the appellant has not exhausted his administrative remedy because he did not allege whistleblower reprisal before OSC with respect to the potential personnel actions he raises in this appeal, thereby giving OSC a sufficient basis to pursue an investigation that might have led to corrective action. <span class="Italic">See Langer v. Department of the Treasury</span>, 265 F.3d 1259, 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (the appellant failed to exhaust his OSC remedy with respect to a particular disclosure because he did not specify to OSC that the disclosure was a "WPA action," rather than simply a wrongful personnel action); <span class="Italic">Finston v. Health Care Financing Administration</span>, 83 M.S.P.R. 100, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 7-10 (1999) (a complaint to OSC alleging a violation of 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(b)(4) did not constitute exhaustion of OSC proceedings regarding whistleblower allegations). OSC's regulations provide that, with an exception not applicable here, "Form OSC-11 ('Complaint of Possible Prohibited Personnel Practice or Other Prohibited Activity') must be used to file all such complaints." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1800.1(c)(1). Individuals who file disclosures of information, by contrast, are encouraged to use Form OSC-12. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1800.2(b)(1). There is no indication that the appellant ever filed an OSC Form-11 or otherwise sought corrective action from OSC for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8). <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). Because OSC did not, therefore, notify the appellant that an investigation concerning a prohibited personnel practice was terminated, the sixty-day time limit set forth at 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(A)(ii) never started, and this appeal should not have been dismissed as untimely filed under that time limit. Similarly, because the appellant has not shown that his October 11, 2002 Form OSC-12 constituted a request for corrective action, 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3)(B), which permits the filing of an IRA appeal with the Board 120 days after seeking corrective action from OSC, does not apply in this case.</p>

Importantly, OSC's letter did not provide the appellant with Board appeal rights.").</p>

<p class="Body-Text">If the appellant exhausts OSC remedies as to one set of personnel actions based on a set of allegedly protected disclosures and loses his case before the Board as to those events and actions, he may litigate another case based on the same disclosures but involving different personnel actions if the OSC remedy was pursued as to those personnel actions and if the appeal is timely. <span class="Italic">Groseclose v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 111 MSPR 194, 205-06 &#x00B6; 29, 2009 MSPB 66 (2009), explained, as it permitted litigation of a successive appeals involving different actions and the same disclosures:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note that the administrative judge applied the doctrine of <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> to bar the appellant from relitigating claims raised in his prior IRA appeal. <span class="Italic">Res judicata</span> precludes parties from relitigating issues that were, or could have been, raised in a prior action, if: (1) The prior judgment was rendered by a forum with competent jurisdiction; (2) the prior judgment was a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the same cause of action and the same parties or their privies were involved in both cases. <span class="Italic">See Peartree v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 66 M.S.P.R. 332, 337 (1995). The Board had jurisdiction in the appellant's prior IRA appeal and issued a final judgment on the merits, which the Federal Circuit affirmed. <span class="Italic">See Groseclose</span>, 277 Fed. Appx. 1019; <span class="Italic">Groseclose</span>, MSPB Docket No. SF-1221-06-0368-W-1 (Initial Decision, Apr. 15, 2007); <span class="Italic">id.</span> (Final Order, Sept. 19, 2007). Therefore, we agree with the administrative judge that <span class="Italic">res judicata</span> bars the appellant from relitigating those claims that were subject to the final judgment in his prior IRA appeal. However, it does not appear that the appellant is actually attempting to relitigate any of the claims that were resolved in his prior IRA appeal. Although some of the alleged protected disclosures in the present joined appeal were also raised in the prior IRA appeal, the appellant is alleging that new personnel actions were taken in retaliation for those (and other) alleged disclosures, and therefore the same cause of action is not involved in both cases. Accordingly, we find that the appellant's claims in the joined appeal are not barred by <span class="Italic">res judicata</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The counterpoint to <span class="Italic">Groseclose</span> is that unless an allegation is first presented to OSC, it cannot be pursued with MSPB, even as an amendment to an appeal underway challenging another action that may be related to but is not identical with the action sought to be added through amendment of the Board appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Ward v. MSPB</span>, 981 F.2d 521 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (discussed later in this chapter, "<a href="0100-2023-20-125.html#sec13-121">Pleading to OSC</a>"). <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Fritz v. DHHS</span>, 87 MSPR 287, 293 n.1 (2000) (declining to accept the appellant's argument that a "continuing violation" occurred "each time the agency sought to enforce a policy or decision with which he disagrees"). The Board does not recognize a futility doctrine to excuse the OSC exhaustion requirement. <span class="Italic">Schell v. DOD,</span> CH-3443-09-0126-I-2 (NP 10/29/2010) ("Further, the appellant cites no authority for his argument, and we have found no precedential authority holding that an appellant can be excused from demonstrating the jurisdictional requirement of OSC exhaustion by asserting futility.").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In <span class="Italic">Onasch v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 63 MSPR 158, 164(1994), the appellant complained to OSC about reprimands and a reassignment and brought the allegations to the Board, along with another concern about a performance appraisal. The appraisal issue could not then be heard, however, because it was not brought to the attention of OSC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board does not have jurisdiction to consider the performance appraisal issued in April 1993, however, because the appellant did not show that she exhausted her remedy with the OSC with regard to it. The OSC issued its termination letter in January 1993, before the performance appraisal was issued, and thus could not have considered it with her other allegations. The appellant has not shown that she subsequently brought it to the OSC for investigation. The appellant's argument that she should not be required to bring each new allegation of reprisal to the OSC when a pending IRA stems from a common nucleus of facts is not availing. The statute specifically requires an appellant to exhaust the remedy with the OSC before proceeding to the Board when the personnel action in question is not otherwise appealable. 5 USC &#x00A7; 1214(a)(3). While the OSC considered whether the change in duties and a reprimand were not taken in reprisal for whistleblowing, it did not investigate the circumstances surrounding the 1993 performance appraisal....</p>

The appellant further contended before the Board that she is entitled to protection as a perceived whistleblower because the Warden believed that she wrote an anonymous letter to the OIA disclosing the Warden's alleged failure to report the incident of workplace violence. None of these disclosures, however, provides a basis for Board jurisdiction over the appellant's IRA appeal.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In her response to the administrative judge's September 3, 2003 order, the appellant claimed that, during the week of October 2, 2000, Mr. Powers "asked [her] if she knew of [the Warden's] misuse of government vehicle[s] and government funds" for the funeral of a former agency employee. She stated that she "verified with him" that the allegations of the Warden's misconduct were true. On review, the appellant claims that "she advised [Mr. Powers] of pertinent facts regarding [the Warden's] misuse of a government vehicle, misuse of government funds, and abuse of authority."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our review of the appellant's complaint before OSC, however, reveals that she never informed OSC of any conversation that she ever had with Mr. Powers, let alone the conversation she described in her appeal. Further, she did not even name Mr. Powers as an individual to whom she made any disclosures in the section of the OSC complaint form requesting that <span id="Page_3787"></span>information. On the contrary, in a letter submitted by the appellant to OSC in further support of her claims, the appellant explained that Mr. Powers had learned of the Warden's alleged misuse of government funds from other agency employees and stated that she "did not report the misuse of funds because [she] knew several staff members had reported it." In light of these representations, the appellant clearly failed to exhaust her remedy before OSC with respect to this alleged disclosure. <span class="Italic">See Ellison</span>, 7 F.3d at 1037.[1]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;Because we find that the appellant did not raise her alleged disclosure to Mr. Powers before OSC, it is unnecessary to determine whether the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant did not make a nonfrivolous allegation of a "protected disclosure" under the WPA.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, we find that the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's argument that she was perceived as a whistleblower. Again, our review of the record indicates that the appellant never raised this argument in her complaint before OSC. <span class="Italic">See Ward v. Merit Systems Protection Board,</span> 981 F.2d 521, 526 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (in an IRA appeal, the Board may consider only those charges of whistleblowing that the appellant asserted before OSC); <span class="Italic">Redschlag v. Department of the Army</span>, 89 M.S.P.R. 589 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 95, 102-03 (2001) (the appellant failed to establish IRA jurisdiction over certain allegations concerning personnel actions the agency took against her where she failed to identify her whistleblowing disclosures in her complaint to OSC), <span class="Italic">review dismissed,</span> 32 Fed. Appx. 543 (Fed. Cir. 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, with respect to the appellant's alleged protected disclosure regarding the Warden's failure to report workplace violence, we find that, while the appellant sufficiently identified this disclosure before OSC, the administrative judge correctly concluded that it did not constitute a nonfrivolous allegation of a "protected disclosure." Under the Whistleblower Protection Act, when an employee reports or states that there has been misconduct by a wrongdoer to the wrongdoer, the employee is not making a "protected disclosure" of misconduct. <span class="Italic">Huffman v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 263 F.3d 1341, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, we affirm as modified the initial decision dismissing the appellant's IRA appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Turner v. VA</span>, 96 MSPR 476, 478 &#x00B6; 5 (2004), provides an example of the necessity for sequential OSC complaints and Board appeals:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his petition for review, the appellant presents evidence purportedly showing that the agency has issued new threats of discipline in reprisal for his whistleblowing activities. However, the Board lacks jurisdiction to consider the appellant's new allegations of reprisal because the Board has jurisdiction over an IRA appeal only if the appellant has first exhausted his administrative remedies before OSC<span class="Italic">. See Yunus v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 242 F.3d 1367, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). An appellant has not exhausted his remedy with OSC when he has not raised with OSC the personnel action that he is appealing to the Board<span class="Italic">. See Roach v. Department of the Army</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 464 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (1999); <span class="Italic">Onasch v. Department of Transportation</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 158, 164 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If earlier whistleblowing allegations are determined to be in the Board's jurisdiction, later whistleblowing complaints may raise the earlier allegations in addition to allegations of subsequent (or distinct) reprisals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Powers v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 97 MSPR 554, 560 &#x00B6; 14 (2004). But if the appellant files sequential OSC complaints and appeals, the Board may apply collateral estoppel to bar litigation of later appeals if, during an initial appeal, the appellant loses on a dispositive issue common to all the appeals, such as whether a protected disclosure occurred that led to the series of events generating the sequential OSC complaints and appeals. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Moss v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 82 MSPR 309, 313-14 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 12-13 (1999). [Refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-090.html#sec4-91">Previous Determinations of Disputed Facts, Issues, Claims: <span class="Italic">Res Judicata</span>, Collateral Estoppel, and Law of the Case--The Doctrines</a>" for appeals that raise, or could raise, whistleblower reprisal defenses; refer to Chapter 4, "<a href="0100-2023-11-123.html#sec4-124">Whistleblowing Prohibited Personnel Practice Complaint or Appeal</a>"; refer to <span class="Italic">Sabersky v. DOJ</span>, 91 MSPR 210 (2002).]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board construes OSC exhaustion with recognition of its internal procedures and deferral policy concerning complaints that raise EEO allegations. In <span class="Italic">McDaid v. DHUD</span>, 46 MSPR 416, 418 n.2 (1990), OSC notified the appellant that "as a matter of policy...EEO reprisal complaints were more appropriately resolved through the EEO process." The Board concluded that the appellant exhausted his administrative remedies with OSC as to his retaliation complaints. [Refer in this chapter to "<a href="0100-2023-20-071.html#sec13-68">OSC Deferral Policy on EEO Charge</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Sooner or later, OSC, the Board, or the Federal Circuit will recognize that resources can be saved and whistleblowing can be more effectively, certainly more quickly, redressed through the concept of a continuing violation or the recognition of like or related claims, much the same as is now applied by EEOC in its management of discrimination and reprisal cases. 29 CFR 1614.106(d) (2022). Then, once a retaliatory personnel matter is brought to the attention of OSC, other personnel matters that are reasonably close in time and reasonably like or related to the reprisal specifically addressed in the OSC complaint can be raised with the Board after OSC has had the opportunity to investigate the underlying matter brought to its attention. Until then, appellants and the Board will be faced with consecutive IRA appeals that evolve from one underlying personnel problem coupled with spinoff actions that must be sequentially brought to OSC and appealed to the Board.<span class="Italic"></span></p>
