<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-130"><span class="space">7.</span> Failed Rehabilitation Attempt</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">Assuming an obligation to rehabilitate an employee, the employee will not avoid discipline should the rehabilitation prove unsuccessful. "[t]he requirement upon the agency to reasonably accommodate an employee's alcoholism disability does not obligate an agency to indefinitely tolerate misconduct or inefficiency stemming from an alcoholic condition." <span class="Italic">Smith v. USPS</span>, 14 MSPR 656, 658 (1983), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 323, 325 (1986). The employee must recognize the problem and accept assistance from the agency. <span class="Italic">Miller v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 26 MSPR 297, 297 n.* (1985) (agency met its accommodative responsibility by offering rehabilitation; the appellant refused treatment); <span class="Italic">McClarty v. USPS</span>, 15 MSPR 199, 201 (1983). <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, 5 MSPR 138, 140, 5 MSPB 200 (1981), noted:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 4561, federal agencies have a responsibility to provide appropriate prevention, treatment, and rehabilitative services for alcoholism and alcohol abuse among its employees. The statute prohibits an agency from denying or depriving employment based solely on the ground of prior alcohol abuse or alcoholism. Nonetheless, the agency is clearly not prohibited from removing an employee who cannot properly function in his employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 42 USC &#x00A7; 4561(c)(1), (d); <span class="Italic">Spragg v. Campbell,</span> 466 F. Supp. 658 (D.S.D. 1979).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Davis</span> determined that an agency provides reasonable accommodation for an alcoholic employee if a supervisor refers the individual to an agency physician, counsels the employee, and admits him into a detoxification program abandoned by the employee prior to official release; and if the employee then essentially declines or fails to respond to additional offers of assistance. The agency has not removed the employee because he was an alcoholic. He was removed because he was unable to function in his position. <span class="Italic">Davis v. VA</span>, <span class="Italic">supra</span>, 5 MSPR at 140-41; <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Ernest v. VA</span>, 27 MSPR 44, 45 (1985) (employee was repeatedly counseled concerning attendance deficiencies, was granted leave for two extended periods of treatment, and was progressively disciplined when he continued alcohol-related misconduct); <span class="Italic">Murphy v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 477, 481 (1982) (removal was warranted when absenteeism continued after four years of rehabilitation); <span class="Italic">McKoy v. FCC</span>, 10 MSPR 221, 225 (1982) (disruptive behavior: "[t]he agency attempted to aid appellant by providing frequent personal counseling by management officials, referring her to established agency employee counseling services, and attempting to satisfy her request for a job transfer. However, appellant failed to cooperate with the agency's attempt to assist her and the agency was unable to find a position to which it could reasonably reassign her."); <span class="Italic">Womack v. VA</span>, 10 MSPR 75, 77 (1982) (appellant was admitted into a treatment program under an agreement with the agency to attend group therapy once a week for 13 weeks following discharge from an in-patient program; he was then properly discharged for AWOL occurring after he left treatment); <span class="Italic">Magill v. GSA</span>, 9 MSPR 148, 149 (1981) (agency properly removed an employee who cooperated with rehabilitative advice and services; despite the appellant's best intentions, he could not be rehabilitated and kept returning to prior habits).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although cases involving failed rehabilitation efforts generally involve removal for misconduct that occurs during or after rehabilitation, nothing requires an agency to remove the employee. In <span class="Italic">Burkwist v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 26 MSPR 427, 430 (1985), the agency granted the appellant sick leave to attend a private drug abuse program. His return to work was conditioned on successful completion of the program. When he violated the conditions of that program through an incident of drug use, the agency imposed, and the Board sustained, a 90-day suspension for violation of the rules of the program during off-duty hours.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An agency need not consider an appellant's entry into a rehabilitation program after his removal. <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 323, 325 (1986); <span class="Italic">Kincheon v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 6 MSPR 17, 19, 6 MSPB 29 (1981) (appellant's entry into rehabilitation two months after her removal was not relevant to the removal appeal), <span class="Italic">followed</span>, <span class="Italic">Campbell v.

<p class="Body-Text">Under decisions predating <span class="Italic">Hougens</span>, assuming that an employee was given the opportunity to obtain rehabilitation, an agency was not precluded from removing an employee suffering from an alcoholic condition who was offered or received rehabilitation and who was then unable to correct his deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Nash v.

The dismissal of a federal civilian employee who could not properly function in his employment because of alcoholism or alcohol abuse was not prohibited if alcohol reduced the employee's dependability and the appellant received rehabilitative assistance.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...Appellant had been referred to the agency's alcohol rehabilitation program approximately 2 years before he was removed, and evidence in the form of 48 leave slips reveals that the agency frequently allowed him to seek the help of medical and/or psychiatric personnel at the agency rehabilitation facility during working hours. The dismissal of a federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment because of alcoholism or alcohol abuse is not prohibited. 42 USC &#x00A7; 4561. In the instant case appellant's use of alcohol clearly reduced his dependability. He received rehabilitative assistance, and accordingly it was not improper for the agency to invoke regular disciplinary procedures when he failed to respond to rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Davis v.</span> <span class="Italic">Veterans Administration,</span> 5 MSPB 200, 5 MSPR 138 (1981); <span class="Italic">Spragg v.

Agency personnel testified without rebuttal that appellant's services were sorely needed because of a heavy workload and that his frequent absences interfered with the agency's mission.

<p class="Body-Text">The requirement that an agency reasonably accommodate an employee's alcoholism disability does not obligate an agency indefinitely to tolerate misconduct or inefficiency stemming from an alcoholic condition. Repeated misconduct and failure at rehabilitation is sufficient reason for removal of an alcoholic employee. <span class="Italic">Atkins v.

An agency need not permit AWOL stemming from an alcoholic condition after rehabilitation has been tried and has failed. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 30 MSPR 323, 325 (1986). An agency does not discriminate on the basis of alcoholism if it enrolls an employee in a rehabilitation program, the employee fails to participate, the employer warns the employee that severe consequences will follow repeated instances of reporting to work under the influence of alcohol, and the employee is later removed for that misconduct after having had prior discipline for similar misconduct. <span class="Italic">Hairston v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 16 MSPR 440, 443 (1983). If an appellant sought and obtained rehabilitative assistance, and discontinued that assistance as no longer needed, removal for repeatedly reporting to work under the influence of alcohol will be sustained if the penalty is otherwise consistent with the agency table of penalties, for the chances of rehabilitation are minimal. <span class="Italic">Randall v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 18 MSPR 485, 486 (1983) (removal of a painter, who worked on scaffolding, for reporting for duty under the influence of an intoxicant; a history of prior discipline).

<p class="Body-Text"><span id="Page_3559"></span>An agency provided reasonable accommodation to an alcoholic employee when, after it developed a rehabilitation program, the supervisor consulted with the agency EAP counselor to facilitate appellant's transition back to the office after a period of hospitalization.

Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">post</span>.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit expressed greater interest than the Board in ongoing, successive rehabilitative efforts. <span class="Italic">Whitlock v. Donovan</span>, 598 F. Supp. 126, 128-29 (D.D.C. 1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 790 F.2d 964 (D.C. Cir. 1986), involved an alcoholic employee, a GS-6 supervisor, who was terminated from his federal employment because his condition caused him to be frequently and unexpectedly absent from work and eventually seriously interfered with the otherwise satisfactory performance of his duties. Judge Gesell said of the employee's condition:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An alcoholic has a disease. He is the victim of a handicap which becomes progressively worse unless successfully treated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The nature of the intervening therapy provided varies considerably. There is peer support such as provided by Alcoholics Anonymous and many types of counseling which employ intensive outpatient therapy or a mixture of in-patient care for a period of time followed by careful monitoring on an out-patient basis. All programs require continuous counseling after the initial detoxification....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the federal employee who is an alcoholic, the court determined that the Rehabilitation Act was intended to make the federal government a "leader" or "model employer" of the disabled. Federal agency employers are required to make "reasonable accommodation" to the limitations of a disabled employee unless the agency can show such accommodation would impose an "undue hardship" on its operations. The Comprehensive Rehabilitation Act went further and required not just accommodation but establishment by federal agencies of an alcoholism treatment program. 42 USC 290dd-1(a) .The court stated, 598 F. Supp. at 130-31:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Act also provides that "[n]o person may be denied or deprived of Federal civilian employment...solely on the ground of prior alcohol abuse or prior alcoholism." 42 USC 290dd-1(c)(1). While the Act states that "[T]his section shall not be construed to prohibit the dismissal from employment of a Federal civilian employee who cannot properly function in his employment," 42 USC 290dd-1(d), the legislative history indicates that dismissal was intended to apply only to employees who refused treatment altogether or who had repeatedly failed in treatment.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The legislative history quoted by the court included a reference to the Senate Report accompanying the legislation, 598 F. Supp. at 131 n.8:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Government employees with alcohol problems should be dismissed only if they have refused to accept adequate and appropriate treatment offered to them, and have subsequently failed to function properly in their positions. Employees accepting such treatment, but still having difficulty in meeting their responsibilities, should be offered the option of going on sick leave at times of crisis. An employee who has accepted treatment should be dismissed for medical reasons only when he has been granted sick leave, treatment has repeatedly failed, and he is clearly not capable of meeting the demands of his job.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Reviewing OPM regulations, the court observed, 598 F. Supp. at 132:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Personnel regulations governing handicapped employees who can no longer perform their job duties are, of course, applicable to employees handicapped by alcoholism. In such cases, where the agency cannot reasonably accommodate an employee and at the same time keep him at work, the agency is obligated by [Ch. 339-1-3(b) of] the Federal Personnel Manual to consider:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;A liberal grant of leave without pay when paid leave is exhausted and the disability is of a remediable nature and likely to respond to treatment and hospitalization. Many mental and emotional disorders, formerly considered completely disabling, now fall in this category in view of the dramatic medical advance made in treatment and rehabilitation of these conditions in recent years.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The court stated in footnote 12 of its opinion that although the FPM is not couched in mandatory language, "it is clear an agency may not ignore the alternatives spelled out in the Federal Personnel Manual and has the burden of justifying its decisions not to accommodate where the employee has produced evidence that accommodation was feasible."</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Of greatest importance to the judicial analysis of the alcoholism discrimination legislation were Judge Gesell's conclusions concerning continued treatment and accommodation, 598 F. Supp. at 134:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Since it is recognized that relapse is predictable in treatment of alcoholics, an agency is not justified in automatically giving up on an employee who enters treatment but who subsequently relapses. In such a case, the agency may follow through with discipline short of removal. However, the agency is obligated before removing the employee from its work force to evaluate whether keeping the employee presents an undue hardship under [29 CFR 1614.203(c)].If removal seems to be the only feasible option, the agency is obligated to conduct a formal evaluation, including a fitness for duty examination if necessary, to confirm whether the employee's alcoholism disease is in fact responsible for the employee's poor performance. If so, the agency must offer leave without pay if the employee will seek more extensive rehabilitative therapy that seems promising....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board did not greet <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> with joy. In an oblique commentary on the <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> opinion, the Board implicitly validated an Army regulation providing that "[O]nce an adverse action has been initiated against an employee who previously refused rehabilitation assistance or did not successfully complete rehabilitation, the proposed adverse action need not be delayed as a result of the employee's subsequent request for rehabilitation." <span class="Italic">Sheen v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 32 MSPR 595, 597 (1987) (implicitly rejecting the <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> firm choice doctrine); <span class="Italic">Burchell v. Dept. of Army</span>, 29 MSPR 366, 370 (1985). The Board suggested in <span class="Italic">Burchell</span> that the agency need not continue to place the burden of appellant's absences on its other employees by requiring them to work double shifts, or on itself by having to pay overtime to those employees who must replace the appellant. In <span class="Italic">McClain v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 653, 656 (1988), the Board incorrectly disclaimed <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> by observing that the Federal Circuit, not the D.C. Circuit, provided controlling precedent for the Board. The Board should look to the regional circuit courts for controlling precedent on EEO issues; the Federal Circuit has no jurisdiction over EEO issues. <span class="Italic">McClain v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 37 MSPR 653, 656-57 (1988), reviewing an arbitration award, declined to follow <span class="Italic">Whitlock</span> and the FPM provisions it embraced as to the firm choice doctrine. <span class="Italic">McClain</span> instead noted that the agency satisfied its obligation to accommodate the appellant since the appellant's former supervisor referred him to the agency EAP for help with his stress and alcohol abuse. Appellant, who was referred by EAP to a psychiatrist to coordinate his participation in a treatment program, failed to cooperate in that program.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Board is as unforgiving in drug cases as in alcohol cases of employees who relapse following rehabilitation attempts. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 50 MSPR 69, 72-73 (1991), reviewed a case involving an agreement by the agency to hold a probationer's termination in abeyance to allow him to participate in a one-year drug treatment program. The agreement was conditioned on compliance by appellant with all terms of the treatment program. Half a year after beginning outpatient treatment, the appellant used a small quantity of proscribed drugs and then tested positive on a drug screening test. The agency removed the appellant for illegal drug use, an action the Board sustained:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant began his course of rehabilitative treatment on May 26, 1989. He subsequently violated the terms of the program by taking a puff on a marijuana cigarette and by ingesting cookies laced with marijuana. The appellant's January 2, 1990, urinalysis consequently tested positive for marijuana. Because the appellant had been warned that his failure to comply with the terms of the treatment program would result in his discharge, we find that the agency properly removed him for illegal drug use based on his admitted use of marijuana and the positive drug test....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 174, 176 (1988), to find that the agency had failed to provide the appellant with a reasonable period of time to demonstrate successful rehabilitation before initiating an adverse action against him. The administrative judge's reliance on <span class="Italic">Hodge</span> was misplaced, however, as the facts of that case clearly distinguish it from the instant appeal. In <span class="Italic">Hodge</span>, the agency proposed the appellant's removal, then granted him leave and allowed him to enter a rehabilitation program. The appellant successfully completed <span id="Page_3560"></span>the program and returned to work. Approximately two weeks later, the agency removed the appellant for the misconduct that had occurred <span class="Italic">prior to</span> his entrance into the rehabilitation program. The Board held that, under these circumstances, the agency could not effect the appellant's removal without allowing him a reasonable opportunity of more than two weeks to demonstrate that he was successfully rehabilitated. By contrast, the appellant here was removed for misconduct (i.e., using illegal drugs) that occurred over seven months after his rehabilitation program began.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we find that the agency's decision to remove the appellant was consistent with Executive Order 12564 and with the General Notice of Implementation of Drug Testing under the Navy's Drug Free Workplace Program....&#8197;Paragraph 9 of the Notice states that all employees were expected to refrain from drug use and that disciplinary action up to and including removal would be initiated for any employee failing to refrain from illegal drug use after counseling and/or rehabilitation....</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Johnson</span> was followed in <span class="Italic">Burrell v. DLA</span>, 58 MSPR 372, 379 (1993), resolving that removal was a reasonable penalty for a single relapse of drug use during a rehabilitation program.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although an agency need not extend repeated rehabilitative offers, a last-minute offer by the agency should be honored by the agency. The Board noted in <span class="Italic">Chaplin v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 35 MSPR 639, 642 (1987), involving an offer of rehabilitative assistance made during the notice period of a Chapter 43 performance-based removal and accepted by the employee--after the employee rebuffed earlier offers of assistance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the agency could not effect the action without allowing appellant to complete the rehabilitation program. Although the agency was not obligated to make its last offer of assistance because appellant had repeatedly rejected all of the agency's previous offers, <span class="Italic">see Reynolds v. Department of Labor</span>, 5 MSPB 228, 5 MSPR 174 (1981), once the agency made that additional offer, and appellant enrolled in the program, the agency must provide appellant with the chance to complete it and demonstrate acceptable performance. <span class="Italic">See Keels,</span> 9 MSPR at 21.[1] We, therefore, conclude that the administrative judge correctly determined that the agency action could not be sustained because appellant established the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion, we emphasize that appellant's entitlement to the opportunity to complete treatment and demonstrate acceptable performance rests solely upon the agency's tender and appellant's acceptance of an additional offer of rehabilitation made during the notice period. Where an agency otherwise fulfills its responsibilities under <span class="Italic">Ruzek,</span> and the employee refuses to accept the offer for rehabilitation, the employee may not evade a later justified adverse action by alleging alcoholism and requesting rehabilitation absent an additional agency offer. Thus, to the extent that cases such as <span class="Italic">Noe v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 28 MSPR 86, 89 (1985), and <span class="Italic">Keels</span> suggest that employees may always raise their handicap of alcoholism in response to a proposed adverse action and receive the opportunity to complete treatment, regardless of the agency's previous offers of rehabilitative assistance and the employee's rejection of these offers, they are hereby modified in accordance with this decision.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Chaplin</span> was reaffirmed, <span class="Italic">Hodge v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 39 MSPR 174, 176-77 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board has recently held that, regardless of whether an agency's offer to accommodate an employee's alcoholism through rehabilitative assistance is obligatory under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, once accepted, the agency must provide the employee with a reasonable period of time to demonstrate successful rehabilitation before taking an adverse action. <span class="Italic">See Chaplin v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 35 MSPR 639, 641 (1987).[*]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[*]&#x2003;In reaching this conclusion in <span class="Italic">Chaplin,</span> the Board emphasized that the appellant's entitlement to the opportunity to complete treatment and demonstrate acceptable performance rested solely upon the agency's tender and the appellant's acceptance of the offer of rehabilitation made during the notice period. The Board stated that where an agency otherwise fulfills it accommodation responsibilities, and the employee refuses to accept the offer of rehabilitation, the employee may not evade a later justified adverse action by alleging alcoholism and requesting rehabilitation absent an additional agency offer. <span class="Italic">Chaplin,</span> 35 MSPR at 642 n.1.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the present case, although the agency had previously provided the appellant with both rehabilitative assistance and the opportunity to demonstrate success, the appellant is again entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate success because the agency had provided him with an additional opportunity for rehabilitation prior to removing him. As the administrative judge found, the agency had previously referred the appellant to an alcohol rehabilitation program in 1985. After the appellant committed the misconduct at issue in this case, however, the agency again referred the appellant to a rehabilitation program. Although the agency denied the appellant's request for leave to enter the rehabilitation program prior to issuing the appellant's notice of proposed removal, it later granted the appellant leave and allowed him to enter the program after issuing the proposal notice. Despite the appellant's satisfactory completion of the program, the agency removed him approximately two weeks after his discharge from the program for misconduct occurring prior to his enrollment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under these circumstances, the agency could not effect the appellant's removal without allowing him a reasonable opportunity of more than just two weeks to demonstrate that he was successfully rehabilitated. Although the agency was not obligated under the 1973 Rehabilitation Act to make its last offer of assistance, once it made that offer, and the appellant enrolled in the program, the agency had to provide him first with the chance to complete it and also demonstrate his successful rehabilitation. <span class="Italic">See Chaplin</span> at 642. We, therefore, conclude that the agency's precipitous removal action can not be sustained because the appellant established the affirmative defense of handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Although the agency need not provide a series of rehabilitative opportunities to the appellant, successive or distinct disabilities may require successive accommodation, <span class="Italic">Faber v. Dept. of Army</span>, 38 MSPR 315, 319-21 (1988):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A distinction must be made between an offer of rehabilitative assistance for a handicapping condition which has not been accommodated, and re-enrollment in a program for a condition which has already been accommodated....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the totality of facts in this case, we find that the medical documentation submitted by the appellant's physician prior to the removal proposal established a combined handicap of alcoholism and manic depression which created a new agency obligation to accommodate....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Contrary to the agency's contention, it was the diagnosis of a combined handicap rather than a change in treatment of a previously accommodated handicap which obligated the agency to accommodate the appellant. Although there was some distinction between the medical conclusions of the appellant's psychiatrist and the agency doctor as to the primary and secondary nature of the handicaps and when they should have been diagnosed, both essentially testified that the appellant had two diseases which must be treated as a combined handicap. We recognize that the testimony as to the need for simultaneous treatment is unavoidably intertwined with the testimony as to concomitant illnesses, but the record establishes a newly diagnosed combined handicap and it is that handicap rather than a mere change in treatment which requires accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge correctly held that the agency erred in removing the appellant prior to the completion of the agreed upon rehabilitation plan. The appellant's treatment contract with the agency was for the combined handicaps which had not been accommodated previously and he must be provided with a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate successful rehabilitation with respect to such dual handicaps. <span class="Italic">See Averill v. Department of</span> <span class="Italic">the Navy,</span> 30 MSPR 327, 333-34 (1986); <span class="Italic">McClarty v. United</span> <span class="Italic">States Postal Service,</span> 15 MSPR 199, 201-02 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">At the time the appellant's removal was proposed, he had participated in the rehabilitation program for seven months and was making "excellent" progress. In addition, the appellant was allowed to return to work after his incarceration and he continued to participate in the program and was sober. The agency has not disputed the appellant's adherence to the terms of his treatment contract.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency's regulation AR 600-85, paragraph 5-5, regards ADAPCP rehabilitation assistance, and is not relevant to the finding of discrimination in this case. As stated above, there is no dispute that the appellant's alcoholism had been accommodated. The reenrollment provision of the regulation does not speak to the agency's duty to accommodate the appellant's newly diagnosed dual handicap of manic depression and alcoholism.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the administrative judge properly analyzed the appellant's situation under the applicable federal law and correctly concluded that the appellant is a qualified handicapped person and that the agency failed to accommodate his handicapping conditions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Stalkfleet v. United States Postal Service,</span> 6 MSPB 536, 6 MSPR 637, 647 (1981). Accordingly, the appellant's removal cannot stand. 5 USC &#x00A7; 7701(c)(2)(B).</p>
