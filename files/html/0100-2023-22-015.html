<h4 class="h4" id="sec15-16"><span class="space">2.</span> Other Relief</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">The amount of money involved in a winning case need not be enormous to provide entitlement to fees; the fees may dwarf the recovery, <span class="Italic">Woodall v. FERC</span>, 33 MSPR 127, 131-32 (1987):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Sterner v. Department of the Army</span>, 711 F.2d 1563, 1567-68 (Fed. Cir. 1983), the court held that the "extent of a party's victory" is clearly relevant to the interest of justice requirement set out in 5 USC 7701(g)<span id="Page_4547"></span>(1). The agency contends that the extent of the appellant's victory in the instant case was <span class="Italic">de minimis</span> because the amount of back pay he received following the Board's reversal of the four-month suspension was small. Specifically, the agency contends that "after over four years of litigation, he benefited by about $1800."...&#8197;The agency's position that the small amount of the appellant's back pay award severely diminishes the extent of his victory is puzzling, if not unfathomable. Such a rule would clearly penalize employees who succeed in mitigating their damages by securing other employment following a suspension or removal, or employees who receive a retirement annuity, since outside earnings and retirement benefits must be deducted from their back pay awards, as they were in the appellant's case....&#8197;There is no legally supportable basis for such a "Catch-22" rule which would have the practical effect of requiring employees who are often in dire financial need to forego either employment opportunities or retirement benefits so that their back pay awards may be as large as possible in the event they prevail in their appeals and seek attorney fees. Consequently, we find that the amount of the appellant's back pay award has no relevance to the question of the extent of his victory in determining his entitlement to attorney fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Determining the extent of a party's victory requires a consideration of such factors as whether the appellant succeeded in having the action mitigated as opposed to reversed; if the action mitigated, whether the penalty is major or minor; and the gravity and circumstances of the sustained charges. <span class="Italic">VanFossen v. MSPB</span>, 788 F.2d 748, 751 n.7 (Fed. Cir. 1986); <span class="Italic">Sterner</span>, 711 F.2d at 1569-71. In the instant case, the merits of the agency's suspension action were not determined by the Board, but the appellant succeeded in having the enforced leave, which covered nearly four months, completely reversed. On that basis, we find that the extent of the appellant's victory was significant.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">In an IRA case (not involving backpay but brought under the fee provision of the WPA), although the appellant did not prevail on several of his claims, he prevailed because he obtained some relief he sought--elevation of a performance rating, <span class="Italic">Smit v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 61 MSPR 612, 617-19 (1994):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant need not prevail on every claim that he brings in order to be entitled to attorney fees. <span class="Italic">See Texas State Teachers Association v. Garland Independent School District</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 789, 109 S. Ct. 1486, 1492, 103 L. Ed. 2d 866 (1989);<span class="Italic"> Morey v. Department of the Navy</span>, 55 MSPR 604, 606 (1992). In the ordinary adverse action appeal involving a single agency action, an appellant's partial success is usually the result of a settlement or mitigation of the penalty. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Hutchcraft v. Department of Transp.</span>, 55 MSPR 138, 141-42 (1992), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 996 F.2d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (Table); <span class="Italic">Buonamano v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 44 MSPR 24, 26-27 (1990). In such cases, the Board weighs the significance of the relief obtained against that sought.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find, however, that in an IRA appeal involving multiple personnel actions, each of which could have been appealed separately, an appellant may be the prevailing party in any one of the claims. In <span class="Italic">Hensley v. Eckerhart</span>, 461 U.S. 424, 433, 103 S. Ct. 1933, 1939, 76 L. Ed.2d 40 (1983), the Court held that a plaintiff may be considered the prevailing party for attorney fees purposes if he succeeds on any significant issue in litigation which achieves some of the benefit the parties sought in bringing the suit. Although the decision in <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> was reached before the passage of the WPA, we find it instructive for the purposes of interpreting the term "prevailing party" in statutes like the WPA which use language similar to the attorney fee provision of the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976 (42 USC &#x00A7; 1988). <span class="Italic">See Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 433 n.7, 103 S. Ct. at 1939 n.7. The court clarified <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> in <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Association</span>, 489 U.S. at 789, 109 S. Ct. at 1492, indicating that if the plaintiffs had prevailed on one claim but the case was remanded on other issues, they would have been the prevailing party and entitled to attorney fees for that claim. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">id</span>., at 790-91, 109 S. Ct. at 1492-93. Just such a result would obtain if the appellant had chosen to bring separate IRA appeals on each of the three personnel actions and had won any of them. He would be the prevailing party as to the claim on which the administrative judge ordered corrective action. We see no reason to deny him that status when he chooses to pursue his claims together. To do otherwise would only encourage fragmentation of causes of action which are more efficiently adjudicated together.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Supreme Court further expounded on <span class="Italic">Hensley</span> and <span class="Italic">Garland</span> in <span class="Italic">Farrar v. Hobby</span>, __ U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 566, 573, 121 L. Ed.2d 494 (1992), stating that a "plaintiff 'prevails' when actual relief on the merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the defendant's behavior in a way that directly benefits the plaintiff." The agency argues here that the appellant did not receive a significant part of the relief sought regarding the 1989 performance appraisal because he sought a rating of "outstanding" and the administrative judge found that he would have received a rating of "excellent" in the absence of the reprisal. "Excellent" is the rating between "outstanding" and "fully successful." We find that receiving a higher performance appraisal than the one given to him in retaliation for his protected activity constitutes obtaining substantially all of the relief sought regarding the 1989 performance appraisal and meets the definition of "prevailing" enunciated in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 573.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A performance appraisal is properly based on a fair, impartial evaluation of an employee's work. It can have a significant effect on an employee's career. For instance, an employee's placement on a retention register for the purpose of conducting a reduction-in-force takes into account the performance appraisal. An employee rated "excellent" will precede an employee rated "fully successful" even though the two have equal tenure of employment. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.501. Also, an employee rated "excellent" may receive a performance award while one rated "fully successful" might not. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 430.502. A performance award is afforded due weight when an employee is rated and ranked for a promotion. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 430.503. The performance rating may also be used as a basis for approving training, rewarding, reassigning, and promoting. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 CFR &#x00A7; 430.201(b)(4). The appellant could quite conceivably also benefit from a higher performance rating if he seeks employment in another agency or outside Federal service.[3] Thus, we find that the appellant is the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The value of the relief obtained is not diminished by the agency's allegation that it destroyed the 1989 performance appraisal in the ordinary course of business without correcting it first and providing the appellant with a copy in November 1992 after the initial decision on the merits of the appeal became final. This matter is addressed in a decision regarding the appellant's petition for enforcement in <span class="Italic">Smit v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Treasury</span>, 59 MSPR 327 (1993).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Citing <span class="Italic">Hensley</span>, 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S. Ct. at 1941, the Court in <span class="Italic">Farrar</span>, __ U.S. at __, 113 S. Ct. at 574, found that, once a plaintiff meets the threshold requirement of being a prevailing party, the extent to which he prevailed is the most critical factor to consider in determining reasonable attorney fees. Likewise, the Board has held that, when more than one claim for relief is made and the claims involve a common core of facts or are based on related legal theories, the fee determination should reflect the significance of the overall relief obtained in relation to the hours reasonably expended. <span class="Italic">See Rothschild v. Department of Housing and Urban Development</span>, 54 MSPR 238, 242 (1992). The three claims in the instant appeal involved a common core of facts relating to the appellant's status as a whistleblower. His claims of reprisal were all based on the same whistleblowing activity. The question remains whether the fee award should be reduced because the corrective action ordered was significantly less than what he sought.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A party prevailed who won an appeal challenging a constructive suspension but who did not win the associated removal appeal. <span class="Italic">Barson v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 22 MSPR 303, 307 (1984) (despite the confusion created by an ATC strike, the error of improper suspension was avoidable and fees were awarded for the portion of the appeal concerning the suspension). A remand to an agency to reconsider the appellant's assignment rights as a result of a RIF did not establish the appellant as a prevailing party, for he remained without substantive relief. After the agency's action on the assignment rights issue, the appellant might then enjoy prevailing party status, when and if he secured employment through the assignment right, but until that point his fee petition was premature, <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 104 MSPR 22, 23-26 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-13, 2006 MSPB 320 (2006) (following remand, <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 108 MSPR 404, 2008 MSPB 69 (2008)):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...After holding a hearing, the administrative judge found that the agency had violated RIF regulations governing the consideration of an employee's qualifications for RIF assignments. In the initial decision, the administrative judge ordered the agency to consider the appellant's qualifications for assignment to two higher-graded positions and, if he was "found qualified for one of the identified positions, the agency [was] ordered to cancel the appellant's demotion and place him in one of those positions or a position of like grade, pay, tenure, and commuting area."...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish entitlement to an award of attorney fees, an appellant must show that: (1) He was the prevailing party; (2) he incurred attorney fees pursuant to an existing attorney-client relationship; (3) an award of fees is warranted in the interest of justice; and (4) the amount of fees claimed is reasonable. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1); <span class="Italic">Social Security Administration v. Price</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 8 (2003), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 398 F.3d 1322 (Fed. Cir. 2005). Upon review of the record, we find that the appellant's motion for attorney fees is premature and, therefore, must be dismissed.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the United States Supreme Court emphasized in <span class="Italic">Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources</span>, 532 U.S. 598 (2001), a party may be considered to have prevailed under a fee-shifting statute that requires prevailing party status only if the party obtained an "enforceable judgment[&#8197;]" resulting in a "'material alteration of the legal relationship'" between the parties. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 604 (quoting <span class="Italic">Texas State Teachers Association v. Garland Independent School District</span>, 489 U.S. 782, 792 (1989)). The Board has expressly adopted this standard for purposes of attorney fee motions under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7;<span id="Page_4548"></span> 7701(g)(1). <span class="Italic">See Cole v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-7 (2001); <span class="Italic">Sacco v. Department of Justice</span>, 90 M.S.P.R. 37, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 9-10 (2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In the initial decision, the administrative judge stated that the final Board decision at the merits phase of the case resulted in a material alteration of the parties' legal relationship; however, this finding was purely <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> and unconvincing. The appellant filed the underlying appeal with the objective of obtaining a position at a higher grade than the one in which he was placed during the RIF. To date, the appellant has not achieved that objective; he remains exactly where he was when he filed the underlying appeal. Thus, the appellant has not prevailed. <span class="Italic">See Kye v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 399, &#x00B6; 10 (1999) (denying motion for attorney fees where appellant had not yet obtained any of the relief sought in the appeal).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, an award of attorney fees by the Board is not warranted in the interest of justice. An attorney fee award may be warranted in the interest of justice when, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>: (1) The agency engaged in a prohibited personnel practice; (2) the agency action was clearly without merit or wholly unfounded, or the employee was substantially innocent of the charges; (3) the agency initiated the action in bad faith; (4) the agency committed a gross procedural error; or (5) the agency knew or should have known that it would not prevail on the merits. <span class="Italic">Allen v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 420, 434&#8209;35 (1980); <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7701(g)(1). To determine whether payment of fees is warranted in the interest of justice, the Board will consider all of the relevant circumstances set forth in the record of the underlying appeal. <span class="Italic">Price</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 337, &#x00B6; 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge found the interest of justice standard met on the ground that the agency committed "gross procedural error." However, for an agency's procedural error to be considered "gross," thereby supporting a finding that recovery of attorney fees is in the interest of justice, the procedural irregularity must have been "more than simple harmful error," <span class="Italic">Olson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 62 M.S.P.R. 261, 265, <span class="Italic">dismissed</span>, 39 F.3d 1195 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Table); rather, the error must have resulted in "prejudice and burden" to the appellant, <span class="Italic">Swanson v. Defense Logistics Agency</span>, 35 M.S.P.R. 115, 118 (1987). At this point, it cannot be found that the appellant was at all prejudiced by the agency's error, nor can it be found that he has established any other basis upon which an award of attorney fees is warranted in the interest of justice.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In light of the circumstances presented in this appeal, the appellant's motion for attorney fees is premature. The administrative judge's initial decision at the merits phase of the case left out the final step: a determination of whether the agency's error in conducting the RIF prejudiced the appellant's substantive rights. The administrative judge should have asked the parties to submit evidence on the issue, and should then have included a finding on the issue in his initial decision. <span class="Italic">See Hill v. Department of Commerce</span>, 25 M.S.P.R. 205, 208 (1984) (the Board will not reverse a RIF action on the merits, even where the agency made an error in its application of the RIF regulations, if the agency shows that its error did not adversely affect the appellant's substantive entitlements); <span class="Italic">see also Schroeder v. Department of Transportation</span>, 60 M.S.P.R. 566, 578-79 (1994) (at the merits phase of a set of consolidated RIF appeals, the Board found that the agency erred in how it devised competitive levels but did not automatically reverse the RIF actions; instead, the Board remanded the appeals for presentation of evidence and argument on whether the agency's error adversely affected the appellant's substantive entitlements).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Neither party filed a petition for review of the administrative judge's initial decision at the merits phase of the case, so the Board did not have an opportunity to direct the administrative judge to make a finding on whether the agency's error affected the appellant's substantive entitlements. As a result, what appears to be a final decision on the merits of a controversy leaves a fundamental question unresolved, namely, whether the appellant should receive any meaningful relief. <span class="Italic">See Kye</span>, 82 M.S.P.R. 399, &#x00B6; 10.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We disagree with the dissent's suggestion that we are "recharacteriz[ing]" the findings in the final decision on the merits. That decision found that the agency erred in not evaluating the appellant's qualifications for higher-graded positions. The substantive entitlement at stake in this case, however, is the right to be <span class="Italic">assigned</span> to a particular position <span class="Italic">if qualified</span>, <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 351.702, not merely to have one's qualifications evaluated. The final decision on the merits does not find that the agency's error prejudiced the appellant's substantive entitlement, so defined, and the lack of such a finding is determinative of the appellant's motion for attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because the administrative judge postponed, to the compliance phase, resolution of the final issue on the merits of the underlying appeal, resolution of the appellant's motion for attorney fees must also be postponed. Accordingly, the initial decision is VACATED, and the appellant's motion for attorney fees and expenses is DISMISSED. The appellant may refile his motion for attorney fees within 30 days of a final decision in the pending enforcement proceeding if, at that time, he believes he can satisfy the criteria for an award of attorney fees.</p>

Dept. of Army</span>, SF-1221-10-0374-A-1 (NP 7/31/2013) (appellant did not prevail in his IRA case; no fees were awarded based upon the successful challenge to a settlement agreement leading to reinstatement of the appeal: "Moreover, the Board does not determine prevailing party status on a line-item basis. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Driscoll</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 662, &#x00B6; 9.

The remand to the administrative judge for a jurisdictional determination did not make Mr. Rodriguez a prevailing party eligible to recover legal fees or costs.").</p>
