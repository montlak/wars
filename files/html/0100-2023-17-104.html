<h5 class="h5" id="sec9-102"><span class="space">a.</span> Issues of Jurisdiction, Sovereign Immunity, Constitutional Law</h5>
<p class="noindent">Although it is the practice that objections based on alleged violations of law and regulation must be first raised with the arbitrator before they will be considered on exceptions, <span class="Italic">see</span>, <span class="Italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor, MSHA and AFGE Nat'l Council of Field Labor Locals</span>, 61 FLRA 232, 235 (2005), in 2005 FLRA carved out a major exception to its policy. <span class="Italic">USDA, Food &#x0026; Consumer Serv. and NTEU Chap. 265</span>, <a href="https://www.flra.gov/decisions/v60/60-176.html">60 FLRA 978</a>, 980-81 (2005), determined that an agency could raise for the first time in an exception a statutory jurisdictional bar against the subject matter of the grievance--in <span class="Italic">NTEU Chap. 265, </span>an issue involved in a grievance involving a claimed temporary promotion that related to the classification of the grievant's position:</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute because the award concerns a classification matter. In response, the Union maintains that this issue was not raised before the Arbitrator and should not be considered by the Authority under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations. In considering the Union's argument, we take this opportunity to review our precedent on whether a party's failure to raise a claim that &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute bars an arbitrator from addressing a grievance precludes the Authority from addressing such a claim on exceptions to an award. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that exceptions asserting that an award is contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c) are properly before the Authority for resolution whether or not the exceptions concern arguments that were raised in arbitration proceedings.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 7121(c) states that negotiated grievance procedures "shall not apply with respect to any grievance concerning--</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(1)&#x2003;any claimed violation of subchapter III of chapter 73 of this title (relating to prohibited political activities);</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(2)&#x2003;retirement, life insurance, or health insurance;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(3)&#x2003;a suspension or removal under section 7532 of this title;</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(4)&#x2003;any examination, certification, or appointment; or</p>
<p class="noindent-2">(5)&#x2003;the classification of any position which does not result in the reduction in grade or pay of an employee.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Stated otherwise, &#x00A7; 7121(c) sets forth "mandatory exclusions" from the scope of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 260</span>, 52 FLRA 1533, 1537 (1997). Parties may not include such matters in their negotiated procedures. <span class="Italic">Id. </span>On its face, then, &#x00A7; 7121(c) limits the availability of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures and, by doing so, renders unlawful an award concerning any of the matters enumerated therein. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of Transportation, Federal Aviation Admin.</span>, 59 FLRA 579 (2004) (arbitrator's determination that grievance was arbitrable found inconsistent with &#x00A7; 7121(c)(2) and award was set aside).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States EEOC, Memphis District Office, Memphis, Tenn</span>., 18 FLRA 88, 89 (1985) (<span class="Italic">EEOC</span>), the Authority addressed for the first time a union's claim that an agency was "estopped from contending" in its exceptions that an award was deficient as contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) "because it failed to comply with the parties' collective bargaining agreement as to when arbitrability issues must be raised." <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, 18 FLRA at 89 n.2. The Authority found that "because section 7121(c)(5) precludes grievances concerning classification and because the [a]gency has timely filed an exception contending that the award was precluded on that basis, the [a]gency's exception is not barred and is properly before the Authority for resolution under the Statute." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> did not refer to &#x00A7; 2429.5.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Subsequently, in <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Golden Gate Nat'l Recreation Area, San Francisco, Calif</span>, 55 FLRA 193 (1999) (<span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>), the Authority effectively overruled <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> without citing it. In <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, the agency had not argued to the arbitrator, as it had in its exceptions to the Authority, that the grievance was precluded by &#x00A7; 7121(c)(3), which, like &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), is one of the mandatory exclusions from the scope of negotiated grievance procedures. Finding that the issue presented related to the arbitrability of the grievance, the Authority held that the issue "clearly could, and should, have been presented to the [a]rbitrator[,]" and the Authority declined to consider the exception under &#x00A7; 2429.5 of our Regulations. <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, 55 FLRA at 195. The Authority stated that, while the Authority's subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the Authority's proceedings, the agency was "not questioning the jurisdiction of the Authority to issue a decision resolving its exception. Instead the [a]gency [was] questioning for the first time in its exception the jurisdiction of the [a]rbitrator to resolve the grievance." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> The Authority did not further explain the basis for its decision.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Authority's holding in <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span> has been applied subsequently in several decisions. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Soc. Sec. Admin., Balt., Md.</span>, 57 FLRA 690, 694 (2002) (&#x00A7; 2429.5 bars agency claim that arbitrator made classification determination in violation of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5), where agency did not make the argument before the arbitrator); <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of the Army, Dugway Proving Ground, Dugway, Utah</span>, 57 FLRA 224, 227 (2001) (same). Those decisions cited <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, without additional explanation.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">On consideration of the language of the Statute and the precedent cited above, we believe that the Authority's earlier approach in <span class="Italic">EEOC</span>, rather than its subsequent approach in <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, is consistent with the text and intent of &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute. <span class="Italic">EEOC</span> recognizes that, pursuant to &#x00A7; 7121(c), arbitrators have no authority to rule on grievances that are mandatorily excluded from the scope of negotiated grievance procedures.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In our view, permitting the application of &#x00A7; 2429.5 to bar consideration of whether an arbitrator has subject matter jurisdiction over a grievance in conformance with &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute, as the Authority did in <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, runs afoul of the express terms of &#x00A7; 7121(c). <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span> improperly <span id="page_1853"></span>confers statutory jurisdiction on an arbitrator to resolve a proceeding that is barred by the Statute from occurring in the first place. Put simply, a party's failure to present an issue to an arbitrator cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute. Rather, consistent with the approach taken by the Authority prior to <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span>, where an issue is presented to the Authority concerning a statutory exclusion under &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute, the Authority is required to address that statutory issue, regardless of whether the issue was also presented to the arbitrator.[8] <span class="Italic">See EEOC</span>, 18 FLRA at 89 n.2 (the Authority held that the exception that award was contrary to &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) was not barred and properly before the Authority because &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) precludes grievances concerning classification). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Devine v. Levin</span>, 739 F.2d 1567, 1570 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (The court held that "[i]t was the arbitrator's duty, just as it is th[e] court's duty, to consider a jurisdictional question regardless of when it [i]s raised during the proceeding.").</p>
<p class="noindent-2">[8]&#x2003;Of course, parties' and arbitrators' resources are more efficiently used when jurisdictional issues concerning &#x00A7; 7121(c) that can be presented to an arbitrator are, in fact, presented to the arbitrator. Nonetheless, for the reasons stated above, a party's failure to do so cannot serve to confer jurisdiction on an arbitrator to resolve an issue that he or she is precluded by &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute from considering at all.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, consistent with the foregoing, we will address the Agency's &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) exception in this case. To the extent that the Authority's decisions in <span class="Italic">Golden Gate</span> and similar cases involving &#x00A7; 7121(c) claims are inconsistent with today's decision, they will no longer be followed.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">United States Dep't of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Serv., Dallas, Tex.</span>, 60 FLRA No. 176 (May 31, 2005) (<span class="Italic">FCS)</span>, an agency did not raise a claim before an arbitrator that &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute barred the arbitrator from addressing a grievance, but then filed an exception to the award with the Authority raising this argument. The Authority reviewed its precedent on whether a party's failure to raise a claim before an arbitrator that &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute bars the arbitrator from addressing a grievance precludes the Authority from addressing such a claim on exceptions to an award. For the reasons explained therein, the Authority concluded that such exceptions are properly before it for resolution even though the exceptions concerned arguments that were not raised before the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">This case presents a different but related issue.&#x2003;In this case, the Agency argued before the Arbitrator that &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) barred the Arbitrator from addressing the grievance but does not make that argument in its exceptions to the Authority. The issue before the Authority is whether, in these circumstances, the Authority may raise <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> and address the question of whether &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) barred the Arbitrator from addressing the grievance. For the reasons set forth below, we find that the Authority may do so.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">...</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the &#x00A7; 7121(c) issue was presented to the Arbitrator, but was not presented to the Authority in the Agency's exceptions. Nonetheless, just as a party's failure to present an issue to an arbitrator cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute, a party's failure to present an issue to the Authority where the case is before the Authority on exceptions cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In this regard, even in the absence of an exception challenging an arbitrator's jurisdiction, the Authority has held in a number of other instances that an arbitrator lacked jurisdiction over a grievance and that the resulting award is therefore deficient. For example, in <span class="Italic">NLRB</span>, 35 FLRA 1116, 1124 (1990), the award concerned the reprimand and the removal of an employee who was a non-preference eligible, excepted service employee. The Authority found that, "[a]though not raised by the parties," it had to "first decide whether the [a]rbitrator had jurisdiction to resolve the grievances as to the reprimand and the removal...." 35 FLRA at 1124. The Authority concluded that the grievant's removal was "a matter which is outside the scope of the negotiated grievance procedure and is not properly subject to arbitral review. In short, the [a]rbitrator had no jurisdiction as a matter of law to determine the merits of the grievant's removal." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Accordingly, the Authority found that this aspect of the award was contrary to law and set it aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> also <span class="Italic">AFGE, Local 916</span>, 47 FLRA 150, 153 (1993) ("The issue of an arbitrator's jurisdiction under law to hear a grievance is properly considered by the Authority, regardless of whether it has been raised by the parties.").</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, in <span class="Italic">Dep't of Health and Human Services, Soc. Sec. Admin</span>., 15 FLRA 714, 715-16 (1984), the grievance concerned the termination of a probationary employee. The arbitrator found that the grievance was arbitrable, and denied the grievance on the merits. Although no party challenged the arbitrator's determination that the grievance was arbitrable, the Authority <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span> determined that the award was contrary to law because Congress did not intend that procedural protections for probationary employees be established through collective bargaining under the Statute. Accordingly, the Authority found that the award was contrary to law and set it aside, even where no party had challenged the arbitrator's finding that the grievance was arbitrable.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In each of these instances, Congress made it clear that grievances could not be filed concerning certain subject matters. Consequently, in each instance, the Authority set aside arbitrators' awards resolving those grievances, despite the fact that no exceptions on the jurisdictional point were filed by any party.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Similarly, Congress has made it clear that grievances concerning the enumerated matters in &#x00A7; 7121(c) are excluded from arbitration procedures. Consistent with Authority precedent, these statutory exclusions apply irrespective of whether a party makes such a claim before the Authority. To hold otherwise would be inconsistent with clearly expressed congressional intent to bar grievances over such matters altogether.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">As a result, the Authority has jurisdiction to address the effect of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) upon this case, and we will address, <span class="Italic">sua sponte</span>, that issue.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span id="page_1854"></span><span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Labor and AFGE Local 12</span>, 70 FLRA 903, 904 (2018) (Member DuBester dissenting) ("The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law but does not specifically challenge the arbitrability of the grievance. However, the award 'cannot stand if [the arbitrator] lacked jurisdiction to resolve the [grievance] in the first place.'

<p class="noindent-1">It is undisputed that the Agency did not raise &#x00A7; 7116(d) before the Arbitrator.

<p class="noindent">A classification issue could first be raised in agency exceptions because it was jurisdictional in the context of a case involving the question of whether grievants should be paid for performing higher-level work, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 78,</span> 63 FLRA 567, 570-571 (2009):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is deficient because it concerns a classification matter under &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) of the Statute, which can be raised before the Authority regardless of whether it was raised before the Arbitrator. In response, the Union contends that the Agency waived the classification issue by limiting the matter at arbitration and agreeing through a stipulation that the issue did not involve classification under the CBA.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">When an exception involves an award's consistency with law, the Authority reviews any question of law raised by the exception and the award <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">See NTEU, Chapter 24,</span> 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995) (citing <span class="Italic">United States Customs Serv. v. FLRA,</span> 43 F.3d 682, 686-87 (D.C. Cir. 1994)). In applying the standard of <span class="Italic">de novo</span> review, the Authority assesses whether an arbitrator's legal conclusions are consistent with the applicable standard of law. <span class="Italic">See United States Dep't of Def. Dep'ts of the Army and the Air Force, Ala., Nat'l Guard, Northport, Ala.,</span> 55 FLRA 37, 40 (1998).

<p class="noindent-1">In <span class="Italic">FCS,</span> the Authority stated that:</p>
<p class="noindent-2">&#x00A7;&#x2003;7121(c) sets forth "mandatory exclusions" from the scope of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 260,</span> 52 FLRA 1533, 1537 (1997). Parties may not include such matters in their negotiated procedures. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> On its face, then, &#x00A7; 7121 (c) limits the availability of negotiated grievance and arbitration procedures and, by doing so, renders unlawful an award concerning any of the matters enumerated therein.</p>
<p class="noindent-2">...</p>
<p class="noindent-2">Put simply, a party's failure to present an issue to an arbitrator cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121 (c) of the Statute. Rather,...where an issue is presented to the Authority concerning a statutory exclusion under &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute, the Authority is required to address that statutory issue, regardless of whether the issue was also presented to the arbitrator.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">60 FLRA at 980, 981 (footnote omitted).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">In the instant case, the parties stipulated that the case "involves Article 16 higher[-]graded duties issues and not Article 26 classification issues." Based on this stipulation, the Union argues that the Agency waived its right to raise the classification issue in its exceptions. However, regardless of the Agency's stipulation, just as a party's failure to present an issue to an arbitrator cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute, a party's stipulation that a grievance before an arbitrator does not involve a classification issue, where the case is before the Authority on exceptions, cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute. Consistent with Authority precedent, these statutory exclusions apply irrespective of whether a party makes such a claim before the Authority. Similarly, a party's stipulation that a grievance before an arbitrator does not involve a classification issue, where the case is before the Authority on exceptions, cannot have the effect of creating jurisdiction in an arbitrator over a matter that Congress expressly excluded in &#x00A7; 7121(c) of the Statute.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Accordingly, the Authority has jurisdiction to address the effect of &#x00A7; 7121(c)(5) upon this case.</p>
<p class="noindent">If an exception is couched in terms of sovereign immunity, FLRA apparently may consider the exception even if the issue was not first raised with the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">DOJ, Bureau of Prisons, FCI Milan and AFGE Local 1741,</span> 63 FLRA 188, 189-90 (2009), explained in the context of an award of back pay:</p>

FLRA, </span>521 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir. 2008).<span class="Italic"> </span>Accordingly, we resolve the claim on the merits. In this regard, the Authority reviews questions of law raised by an arbitrator's award and an exception to it <span class="Italic">de novo</span>. <span class="Italic">NTEU, Chapter 24</span>, 50 FLRA 330, 332 (1995).

In making this determination, the Authority defers to the arbitrator's underlying factual findings. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">It is clear that a Federal agency is subject to a monetary claim only if the statute on which the claim is based unambiguously establishes a waiver of sovereign immunity permitting such claim.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">See Lane v. Pena</span>, 518 U.S. 187 (1996). However, it is equally clear that the Back Pay Act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., United States Dep't of HHS</span>, 54 FLRA 1210, 1217 (1998).</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Here, the Agency's claim that the award is inconsistent with the principle of sovereign immunity is expressly an extension of, and depends on, its exception that the Arbitrator failed to satisfy the requirements of the Back Pay Act. That is, the Agency does not claim that the Back Pay Act does not apply to it. In fact, the Agency's argument that the award fails to satisfy the causal-connection requirement of the Back Pay Act assumes that the Act applies.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Consistent with the foregoing, the Agency's claim that the award fails to satisfy the causal-connection requirement of the Back Pay Act is barred by &#x00A7; 2429.5 of the Authority's Regulations. Accordingly, as the Agency's sovereign immunity claim depends on its claim that the award fails to satisfy one of the requirements of the Back Pay Act, the sovereign immunity claim is denied.</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[70]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Agency argues that the award is contrary to law because the remedy does not fall within the BPA's waiver of sovereign immunity. The Agency's first sovereign-immunity argument is that the "[t]he provisions of 5 <span id="page_1855"></span>U.S.C. &#x00A7; 6101 regarding consecutive days off or set start times do not provide employees with an entitlement to monetary compensation" for purposes of the BPA. In support of this claim, the Agency cites <span class="Italic">Sanford v. Weinberger</span>[73] for the proposition that "overtime pay, or any monetary remedy, is not appropriate in the case of [&#x00A7;] 6101(a)(3) violations." In Sanford, the court noted that a "fundamental precept of law holds that no monetary damages can be awarded against the United States unless some provision of law commands the payment of same."[75] And, the Agency argues, "[n]either [&#x00A7;] 6101, nor its associated regulations, oblige the Agency to provide backpay or any other monetary remedy for its scheduling deviations from consecutive days off or the same start times."</p>

<p class="noindent-2">[75]&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Sanford</span>, 752 F.2d at 639.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">But the Agency's argument is unavailing. When a party's sovereign-immunity claim depends on an argument that an arbitration award is contrary to the BPA, and the Authority finds that the award is consistent with the BPA, the Authority denies the sovereign-immunity claim.[77] Consistent with our finding above that the award is consistent with the BPA, the Agency's first sovereign-immunity claim does not show that the award is contrary to law.</p>

<p class="noindent-1">The Agency also argues that awarding the grievants backpay would violate the U.S. Supreme Court's decision concerning sovereign immunity in <span class="Italic">United States v. Testan</span>.[78] In <span class="Italic">Testan</span>, federal employees claimed that they should receive backpay as compensation for the alleged misclassification of their positions,[79] but the Court found that the employees had no "substantive right...to backpay" under the BPA "for the period of their claimed wrongful classifications."[80] The Authority has previously held that <span class="Italic">Testan</span> is inapposite to backpay claims that are not based on alleged classification errors.[81] Consequently, as the employees here are not seeking backpay due to classification errors, the Agency's argument regarding <span class="Italic">Testan</span> does not demonstrate that the award is contrary to law.[82]</p>

<p class="noindent">A constitutional issue may be raised for the first time through exceptions. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">DHHS, SSA, Baltimore and AFGE Local 1336</span>, 37 FLRA 766, 770-71 (1990) (First Amendment challenge to disposition of grievance complaining of agency harassment of union official; also considering First Amendment issue raised, apparently for first time, in exceptions challenging lawfulness of award). <span class="Italic">But see NAGE and Dept. of Navy, Reg'l Force Protection San Diego</span>, 60 FLRA 35, 39 (2004) ("There is no evidence in the award or the record that the Union's argument, that the Agency's actions in suspending the grievant violated the grievant's due process rights, was presented to the Arbitrator. As the issue relates to the procedures the Agency utilized before the grievance procedure was invoked, the issue could and should have been presented to the Arbitrator.").</p>
<p class="noindent">Although the issue of whether the arbitrator has jurisdiction to hear a grievance may be raised with FLRA irrespective of whether the parties litigated that issue before the arbitrator, it is good practice to bring those arguments first to the attention of the arbitrator. <span class="Italic">AFGE Local 916 and Dept. of Air Force, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Ctr., Tinker AFB</span>, 47 FLRA 150, 153 (1993).</p>
<p class="noindent">If a jurisdictional issue is to be raised on a reconsideration request, there must be adherence to FLRA's procedural requirements concerning reconsideration requests, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Interior, Nat'l Park Serv. and AFGE Local 3145</span>, 64 FLRA 940, 941-42 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The Union argues that the Authority should reconsider <span class="Italic">Interior</span> and dismiss the Agency's exception on jurisdictional grounds. The Authority has held that issues regarding Authority jurisdiction may be raised at any stage of the Authority's proceedings. <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, IRS, Nat'l Distrib. Ctr., Bloomington, Ill.,</span> 64 FLRA 586, 589 (2010). However, the Authority has clarified that this principle permits parties to raise jurisdictional arguments "without regard to exhaustion requirements[&#8197;]"--i.e., without regard to whether they were raised in proceedings below--and not "without regard to procedural requirements." <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Air Force, Aerospace Maint. &#x0026; Regeneration Ctr., Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Tucson, Ariz.,</span> 64 FLRA 355, 358 n.6 (2009) (Member Beck concurring in part and dissenting in part). Thus, the Union's request for reconsideration is required to comply with the Authority's procedural requirements, including 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.17.</p>
<p class="noindent-1">Section 2429.17 of the Authority's Regulations requires parties to file motions for reconsideration of an Authority decision "within ten (10) days after service of the Authority's decision[.]" 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 2429.17. The Union's request that the Authority reconsider <span class="Italic">Interior</span> was not filed within ten days after service of the Authority's decision in <span class="Italic">Interior</span> and, thus, is untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the request.</p>
<p class="noindent">FLRA treated the issue of the timeliness of exceptions as one of jurisdiction, <span class="Italic">Dept. of Treasury, IRS and NTEU Chap. 43</span>, 64 FLRA 586, 589 (2010):</p>
<p class="noindent-1">The second issue is a matter that the Union could have raised, but did not raise, in its opposition. Nevertheless, the second issue addresses the timeliness of the exceptions, which is a jurisdictional issue that may be raised at any stage of the Authority's proceedings. <span class="Italic">See Bremerton Metal Trades Council,</span> 59 FLRA 583, 584 (2004) (timeliness of exceptions is jurisdictional); <span class="Italic">U.S. Dep't of the Interior, Nat'l Park Serv., Golden Gate Nat'l Recreation Area, S.F., Cal.,</span> 55 FLRA 193, 195 (1999) (jurisdictional issues may be raised at any stage). As such, we consider the submission with respect to that issue as well.</p>
