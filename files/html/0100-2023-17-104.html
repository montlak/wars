<h4 class="h4" id="sec10-105"><span class="space">2.</span> RIF as Adverse Action</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">A RIF is an administrative procedure to eliminate jobs and reassign or separate employees who occupied abolished positions. A RIF is not an adverse action against a particular employee, but is directed solely at an agency position. <span class="Italic">James v. Von Zemenszky,</span> <a href="https://openjurist.org/284/f3d/1310/james-v-von-zemenszky">284 F.3d 1310</a>, 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (citing <span class="Italic">Huber v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 284, 286 (Fed. Cir. 1986)). A RIF used to remove or demote an employee for reasons personal to the employee will be set aside as a disguised, procedurally defective adverse action. RIF procedures are applied only for reasons that are not personal to the employee or employees affected. <span class="Italic">Liguori v. U.S. Military Academy</span>, 4 MSPR 6, 8, 4 MSPB 100 (1980) (citing <span class="Italic">Fitzgerald v. Hampton</span>, 467 F.2d 755 (D.C. Cir. 1972)); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Gabriel v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 108 MSPR 186, 189 &#x00B6; 9, 2008 MSPB 39 (2008) (remanding to an arbitrator whether a RIF was taken for reasons personal to the grievant and therefore constituted an adverse action; citing <span class="Italic">Gandola v. FTC,</span> 773 F.2d 308, 312 (Fed. Cir. 1985); <span class="Italic">LaMell v. Armed Forces Retirement Home,</span> 104 MSPR 413, 417-18 &#x00B6; 11 (2007); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Dept. of Army,</span> 62 MSPR 393, 399 (1994)).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If the reasons asserted for a RIF, e.g., fiscal necessity, are bogus, and if there is evidence that the RIF was structured for reasons personal to the appellant, the RIF will be set aside. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Washington v. Garrett</span>, 10 F.3d 1421 (9th Cir. 1993) (directing remedy but remanding the case to trial court for factfinding on racial discrimination claims); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Buckler v. Fed. Retirement Thrift Inv. Bd.</span>, 73 MSPR 476, 490-91 (1997) (if the agency shows that it decided to abolish a position for legitimate management reasons, a RIF is <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> even though the employee affected by the RIF may have had problems with performance or conduct; there was no evidence of bad faith or an underhanded scheme to get rid of the appellant). [Refer to biased proposing officials in <a href="0100-2023-17-001.html#sec10-1">Chapter 11</a> "Harmful Error."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An appellant's allegation that a RIF was a subterfuge to conceal his demotion goes directly to the question of the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF if the allegation is supported by a showing that the action may have been based upon an improper motive, an issue that will be reviewed on appeal. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">LeVecchia v. OSHRC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3256) ("By definition, a RIF is not an adverse action against a particular employee, but rather serves as 'an administrative procedure by which agencies eliminate jobs and account for employees who occupied abolished positions.' <span class="Italic">Huber v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 284, 286 (Fed. Cir. 1986)."); <span class="Italic">Kukish v. USPS</span>, 68 MSPR 360, 364 (1995) ("[A] reduction in grade and pay may be appealable to the Board as an adverse action if its true nature is not that of a RIF[.] "); <span class="Italic">Carter v. Dept. of Army</span>, 62 MSPR 393, 399 (1994) ("If an otherwise <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> RIF is aimed at removing a particular individual, the action would not be directed solely at eliminating positions. Rather, the separation, demotion, or furlough pursuant to the RIF would be in the nature of an adverse action, i.e., a removal, reduction in pay or grade or suspension within the meaning of 5 USC &#x00A7; 7512."); <span class="Italic">Losure v.

<p class="Body-Text">The appellant has the burden of demonstrating motivation and causation. <span class="Italic">Liguori v. U.S. Military Academy</span>, 4 MSPR 6, 8, 4 MSPB 100 (1980). A RIF created as a substitute for adverse action, or structured to grant improper preferences to individuals, is improperly motivated and will be set aside. The Board declined, on finding improper motivation, to concern itself with an argument that the RIF was motivated by some proper considerations and would have taken place in any event; the only appropriate reason for the RIF offered by the agency, reorganization, was itself found to be a sham. <span class="Italic">Bodrick v.

<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Sahni v. District of Columbia Gov't</span>, 4 MSPR 170, 172, 4 MSPB 252 (1980), discussed proof or persuasion when an allegation is made that a RIF was taken for reasons personal to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Reduction-in-force actions are governed by Chapter 35 of Title 5, U.S. Code. The circumstances under which a RIF may be justified are set out at 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a): "lack of work, shortage of funds, reorganization, reclassification due to change in duties, or the exercise of reemployment rights or restoration rights." The agency presented a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing that it conducted a RIF for a legitimate management reason, i.e., shortage of funds. However, the Board will not allow the circumvention of adverse action procedures where the agency's stated reason is in reality a pretext for summary removal. <span class="Italic">Losure, id.; Fitzgerald v. Hampton</span>, 467 F.2d 755 (D.C. Cir. 1972).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we stated in <span class="Italic">Losure, supra,</span> 2 MSPB 366, 2 MSPR 202: If the employee presents no rebuttal evidence to challenge the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the agency's alleged reason for the RIF, the agency's initial evidence would normally suffice to meet also the agency's burden of persuasion on this element of its decision. Once the agency makes out a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence shifts to the employee but the burden of persuasion (more precisely the risk of non-persuasion) never shifts from the agency. Thus, where credible evidence, either in the employee's rebuttal presentation or in the agency's own admissions, is sufficient to cast doubt on the <span class="Italic">bona fides</span> of the RIF, the agency may find it advisable to present additional evidence to meet its burden of persuasion. But whether the agency presents such additional evidence or not, the burden remains on the agency to persuade the Board by a preponderance of the evidence that the RIF regulations were in fact invoked for one of the legitimate management reasons specified in 5 CFR &#x00A7; 351.201(a).</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Nichols v. DOD</span>, 19 MSPR 471, 476-77 (1984), provides an example of proof of a RIF improperly conducted for reasons personal to the employee:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">..."An open expression of dissatisfaction" is not necessary to a finding of improper agency motivation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The presiding official found that the basis for the abolishment of appellant's position was in reality because he was not performing adequately. Col. Kenneth Kinnamon testified that Mr. Robert Roselle had been hired to fill the Support Services position because he had a great deal of expertise in the area of Security. The presiding official found that the hiring of Mr. Roselle showed that the agency was dissatisfied with appellant's performance and wanted someone with a different background to handle security. Col. Kinnamon further testified that he felt the administrative structure was so poor that he had told the Dean that he would leave the university and consented to stay only on the condition that changes in the administrative structure be made. Col. Kinnamon and Delores Wilson, appellant's administrative assistant both testified that there had been numerous complaints from faculty and staff regarding administrative services. Mrs. Wilson also testified that there was difficulty in the chain of command and insufficient personnel in administrative services.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Michael Newton, Assistant to the Director, Defense Telephone Service testified that Col. Kinnamon was very dissatisfied with a new single line phone system and that appellant and Col. Kinnamon had a sharp disagreement over the system. Col. Samuel J. Turnbull, former Assistant Dean for administration, and appellant's supervisor testified that Col. Kinnamon would not talk to appellant about the phone system, and felt that appellant was trying to force the system down his throat. Col. Turnbull also testified that there had been several complaints from Col. Kinnamon and a Col. Robert Joy. Col. Turnbull stated that Col. Joy had submitted a written complaint so that Col. Turnbull would have ammunition to get rid of appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon the evidence, the presiding official found that in spite of the agency's assertion that the reorganization covered all personnel, the only person adversely affected was appellant; and that the action was personal to appellant and taken because the agency was not satisfied with appellant's performance. The presiding official also found that the appropriate action should have been taken under 5 USC, Chapter 75, Subch. II and not under the reduction-in-force procedures.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Evidence negating an assertion of personal motivation for a RIF included, in <span class="Italic">LeVecchia v. OSHRC</span> (Fed. Cir. 1998 NP No. 98-3256), a demonstration of management studies leading to the closure of an entire office, coupled with an offer of a reassignment to the appellant:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[S]ubstantial evidence supports the view that the agency's decision to conduct a RIF was independent of any negative views individuals within the agency may have had of Mr. LeVecchia, and comported with OPM regulations governing the legitimacy of RlFs. Stewart Weisberg, OSHRC chairman and the deciding official in the RIF action, testified that he had decided to close the Dallas regional office because of budget shortfalls resulting from the Office of Management and Budget's mark for fiscal year 1997, and because he felt that, given its workload, the agency had too many regional offices such that reorganization was necessary. Mr. Weisberg cited a management study on agency cases that went to hearing, conducted by the agency's executive director, which recommended closing the Dallas office. Other agency officials provided further testimony corroborating the view that the agency's RIF was motivated by legitimate budgetary and organizational concerns.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. LaVecchia's contention that the RIF cloaked a personal rather than a positional agency action is further undermined by the uncontested fact that the entire Dallas office was closed, abolishing all positions therein, not just Mr. LaVecchia's. The office closing left no position remaining in the competitive area that could have been offered to Mr. LaVecchia. Moreover, it is undisputed that the agency offered Mr. LaVecchia an identical grade- and step-level position as an ALJ in the agency's Washington, D.C. office, which he initially accepted but later declined.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">At times it can be difficult to determine the burden of proof when an appellant attempts to prove that a RIF was a means to separate or demote him for personal reasons. The difficulty in analysis was evident in <span class="Italic">Marchese v. Dept. of Navy</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3559):</p>

<p class="Body-Text">Although the RIF may not be used as a substitute for adverse action, it may be taken, if otherwise proper, against an employee whom the agency may <span id="Page_3112"></span>have had reason to discipline; all the circumstances must be examined to ascertain the motivation for and propriety of the RIF. <span class="Italic">Willson v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[W]hatever personal reasons Mr. Kelly may have had for recommending this reorganization to Mr. Barnes, the Administrator's decision, not impelled by any personal animus of his own, was made to improve a then serious defect in the operation of the SBA. If this change also had the added effect of relieving a problem in the relationship of plaintiff and Mr. Kelly, that was so much the better as far as Mr. Barnes was concerned.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We gather from the record that some agency action was clearly warranted to attempt to improve the loan-delinquency rate. Plaintiff has not denied this nor has he shown that this ratio was other than a serious problem to the SBA. Neither has plaintiff attempted to prove that the particular means chosen by the Administrator was transparently ineffective or unrelated to the evil to be cured. Reorganization (including the creation and abolition of jobs) as a means of improving the public's business is peculiarly within the authority and discretion of agency heads and supervisory officials. <span class="Italic">Cf. Adams v. Humphrey</span>, 232 F. 2d 40, 41 (C.A.D.C., 1955). Such rearrangements, as everyone who has lived in Washington knows, are a common remedy for the endemic ailments of federal agencies. In this case, too, although the Administrator was not untouched by plaintiff's relationship with Mr. Kelly,[5] the moving factor, the basic concern, in Mr. Barnes's mind was the grave objective problem of loan delinquency which was troubling his agency. That was the <span class="Italic">sine qua non</span>. We do not believe that the possible "taint" of a lower-level purpose, which acknowledged that the reorganization would also relieve the subsidiary problem of a conflict between two subordinates, should invalidate the Administrator's otherwise lawful decision. This secondary consideration was the sauce which spiced the roast but added little to its nourishment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;As the findings show, the record is not empty of pieces of evidence tending to show that even Mr. Barnes was thinking, to some extent, of the advantages of plaintiff's separation from the agency. But the record as a whole does not show that this was the Administrator's primary goal or that he would have taken the action he did in the absence of a belief that division of the loan functions should be tried as one method of solving the delinquency problem.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Whether lower-level animus suffices to set aside a RIF was considered in <span class="Italic">McKenna v. Dept. of Interior</span> (Fed. Cir. 1993 NP No. 92-3520):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">McKenna relies on <span class="Italic">Sullivan v. Navy</span>, 720 F.2d 1266, 1276 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for the proposition that if the animus of an agency official sets a removal decision in motion, the taint is not cured simply because the deciding official harbored no such animus. McKenna also cites <span class="Italic">Jiles v. Ingram</span>, 944 F.2d 409 (8th Cir. 1991), where the court found intentional discrimination based upon a showing that lesser officials set in motion events that led to the employee's removal, even though the actual deciding officials did not act from a discriminatory motive. Finally, McKenna analogizes the present case to <span class="Italic">Chiu v. United States</span>, 948 F.2d 711, 716 (Fed. Cir. 1991), where this court ruled that a RIF was not substantially justified, "where the officials who were ultimately responsible did no more than rubber stamp a facially proper recommendation" which was actually made for an improper and personal reason.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">These cases are distinguishable, however, because in them no independent basis existed for the adverse action taken by the nonbiased decisionmaker. In addition, two of them did not involve a RIF. And in <span class="Italic">Chiu</span>, there was no <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> basis to conduct a RIF. Where there is, the agency decision is not invalidated by personal animus of a subordinate. <span class="Italic">Keener</span>, 165 Ct. Cl. at 341 ("We do not believe that the possible 'taint' of a lower-level purpose, which acknowledged that the reorganization would also relieve the subsidiary problem of a conflict between two subordinates, should invalidate the Administrator's otherwise lawful decision."). <span class="Italic">Keener</span> is binding precedent. <span class="Italic">South Corp. v. United States</span>, 690 F.2d 1368, 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1982).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In this case, the ALJ found that the agency had an independent, <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> basis for the reorganization. This finding is supported by the Blue Ribbon Committee (BRC) report. The BRC report questioned the need for a CALJ because after the Indian Probate Judges attained Administrative Procedure Act status there was a vast decrease of the administrative workload of the CALJ and because the few remaining administrative tasks of the CALJ could be effectively performed from the Director's office.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The ALJ also found that Byrnes himself had an independent, <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> basis for recommending the RIF. Byrnes testified that in making his recommendation, he relied on reasons stated in the BRC report as well as the fact of lengthy periods during which the CALJ position had remained vacant without operations thereby being impeded.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, substantial evidence shows that Byrnes' superiors, Mr. Kay and Secretary Lujan, did not merely rubber stamp Byrnes' recommendation to adopt the reorganization suggested in the BRC final report. Rather, they independently concluded that the BRC final report was sound and Secretary Lujan wrote that the report "recommendations will result in increased management efficiencies and productivity in the Office." Accordingly, Lujan directed that the recommendations of the BRC final report, including the RIF, be carried out.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, the ALJ found that the agency met its burden of showing that it properly invoked the RIF for the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reason of reorganization. This finding is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Ogden v. Dept. of Commerce</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3412), concluded that mixed motives of lower-level personnel did not alone invalidate a RIF:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ogden's legal challenge to the RIF, which eliminated his job, is that the evidence proves that the RIF was taken for reasons personal to him. Ogden points to Judge Dolan's aborted attempt to remove him for cause, and to Judge Dolan's request to reinstate the GM-15 position not long after the RIF was effected. On this point, Ogden has some precedent in his favor, since it is settled law that the Board will review a non-frivolous allegation that an action effected under a RIF is actually an adverse action taken for reasons personal to the employee. <span class="Italic">Bonn v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 667, 670-71 (1991).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bonn</span>, the Board was also faced with a situation in which the "agency had reasons, about the time of the reduction in force, for wanting to remove the appellant from his position." <span class="Italic">Bonn</span>, 49 MSPR at 672. In determining that the RIF was not a disguise for direct adverse action against the employee, the Board noted that the decision to effect the reorganization that resulted in the challenged RIF was made by agency personnel who had no reason to remove Bonn from his position. Likewise, in this case, those responsible for effecting the reorganization were not personally dissatisfied with Ogden's performance. According to Ogden, it was Judge Dolan who was out to get him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even more importantly, the Board in <span class="Italic">Bonn</span> relied on precedent of this court to conclude that the RIF was proper. In particular, our predecessor court held that absent bad faith or an "underhanded scheme" to get rid of a particular employee, an agency conducting a RIF may assess the qualifications of an employee in determining which position to abolish. <span class="Italic">See Gibson v. United States</span>, 176 Ct. Cl. 102, 108-09 (1966). Following that precedent, the Board in this case assessed the record evidence to determine whether bad faith or an underhanded scheme existed to get rid of Ogden. The Board concluded that the record taken as a whole did not establish that the RIF was effected for impermissible reasons. The Board emphasized that the skills described for Ogden's GM-15 position were not required following his split of the AJ into two sections. The Board also credited the testimony of Judge Dolan, who stated that he was genuinely torn between seeking to effect a direct personnel action against Ogden (because of his view that Ogden was incompetent) and eliminating Ogden's job by a RIF (because there was no need for GM-15 skills in the reorganized structure). Judge Dolan admitted that shortly after the RIF, he sought to have the position reinstated. He explained that he had been inartful in describing the slot he wished to have created, because he had not wished to suggest that skills of the GM-15 level were required. Instead, in seeking an additional post-RIF position in his area, Judge Dolan wanted clerical administrative support staff, such as a GS-08 or GS-09 office manager, not a level 15 employee. Although it is clear that the Board gave Judge Dolan the benefit of the doubt in accepting his "genuinely torn" explanation, we cannot say that the Board erred in finding the testimony of Judge Dolan credible. <span class="Italic">See Hambsch v. Dept. of Treasury</span>, 796 F. 2d 430, 436 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (explaining that the presiding officials credibility determinations are virtually unreviewable).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">An example of Board analysis of the various possible (tainted) motivating factors leading to a RIF appears in <span class="Italic">Bonn v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 49 MSPR 667, 670-78 (1991):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to apply the Office of Personnel Management's reduction-in-force regulations when it releases an employee from his competitive level as a result of a reorganization. It may not use those regulations, however, to effect a separation or change to lower grade that <span id="Page_3113"></span>is covered by adverse action regulations. <span class="Italic">Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission</span>, 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195, 199 (1980). The Board will review a nonfrivolous allegation that an action effected under reduction-in-force procedures is actually an adverse action, taken for reasons personal to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Nichols v. Department of Defense</span>, 19 MSPR 471, 476-77 (1984).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is no question that the appellant's position was abolished, and that his internal review function was assigned to another, newly established office. It therefore is clear that there was a reorganization. The question we must decide is whether the reorganization, and the decision to abolish the appellant's position, constituted efforts to circumvent the appellant's procedural rights under 5 USC Chapter 75....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has asserted that it abolished the appellant's position because (1) the commanding officer was required to remove the internal review function from that position; (2) the Comptroller position was to be filled by a civilian instead of by a military officer (as it previously had been filled); (3) civilian incumbents of comptroller positions were expected to have more experience and/or training, and therefore to have less need for a deputy, than military incumbents of those positions were expected to have; and (4) with the loss of the internal review function and the conversion of the Comptroller position to a civilian position, there were not enough Deputy Comptroller duties remaining to justify continuing the Deputy Comptroller position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As we have indicated above, the administrative judge in this case found that the appellant's change to lower grade was effected for reasons personal to him. For the reasons stated below, we do not concur in this finding.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge's finding was based on several factors. Among these were the fact that the appellant had received a marginal performance appraisal on October 15, 1985, less than a year before the reduction in force, the fact that, shortly before the appellant's position was abolished, the commander of the installation's command had declined to approve the appellant's demotion, and the fact that, in declining to approve the demotion, the commander had criticized the investigation of the case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record does show that the appellant's supervisors were not happy with the appellant's conduct on the job. As we have indicated above, the commanding officer had proposed the appellant's demotion for misconduct before he decided to effect the reduction in force. Furthermore, the letter of admonition indicates that, despite the deciding official's failure to effect the proposed action, the appellant's immediate supervisor remained convinced that the appellant was guilty of at least some of the wrongdoing with which he had been charged.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, the record shows that the appellant's supervisors were not happy with his performance of the duties of his former position. Not only did the appellant receive a marginal performance appraisal not long before his position was abolished, but in February 1985 the commanding officer had requested a comprehensive review of the financial management program, in which the appellant was employed. This request was based on a May 1984 report that was critical of the installation's handling of its finance and internal review functions--functions for which the appellant was largely responsible.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This evidence that the agency was not happy with the appellant's performance or conduct lends support to the appellant's allegation. It indicates that the agency had reasons, about the time of the reduction in force, for wanting to remove the appellant from his position. We find, however, that this evidence is outweighed by strong evidence that the reassignment of the appellant's internal review duties, and the reorganization and reduction in force that followed that reassignment, resulted from the exercise of legitimate management considerations of the kind appropriately committed to agency discretion....&#8197;That evidence includes the September 1985 agency instructions mentioned above regarding the organization of the internal review function; it includes the October 18 and December 16, 1985, memoranda from the commander of the installation's command regarding the need for compliance with those instructions; and it includes the May 1986 report and recommendation of the management analyst, who was not an employee of the installation, and who therefore was not under the direct or indirect supervision of the installation's commanding officer. All these documents establish that the inclusion of the internal review function in the Comptroller Department was considered inappropriate not only by officials at the appellant's installation, but also by officials at the command and department level. Because there is no indication that the latter officials had any reason for removing the appellant from his position, the documents offer strong support for the agency's assertion that it removed the internal review function from the appellant's position for legitimate management reasons that were not personal to the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We note further that, even if the decision to abolish the appellant's position was influenced by considerations of the appellant's performance or qualifications, that circumstance would not cause the change to lower grade to be improper. In the absence of bad faith or an "underhanded scheme" to get rid of a certain employee, an agency conducting a reduction in force may consider the relative qualifications of the employees whose positions it is considering abolishing, and it may base its decision as to which position to abolish on that consideration. <span class="Italic">Gibson v. United States</span>, 176 Ct. Cl. 102, 108-09 (1966). <span class="Italic">See also</span> <span class="Italic">Gandola v. Federal Trade Commission</span>, 23 MSPR 383, 386-87 (1984), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 773 F.2d 308 (Fed. Cir. 1985).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Another factor on which the administrative judge based his conclusion concerns the commanding officer's reference to his decision to change the Comptroller position from a military position to a civilian position. The commanding officer asserted that he had abolished the appellant's position partly because of this decision. The administrative judge, however, found this reason unpersuasive because the management analyst who had reviewed the staffing and structure of the internal review function failed to mention alleged decision in his report.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the agency has substantiated its allegation that the conversion of the Comptroller position to a civilian position was a legitimate factor in the reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that, on July 15, the commanding officer of the appellant's installation requested conversion of the Comptroller position from military to civilian that, on August 15, the request was approved and that a civilian did replace the appellant's former supervisor. It is true that these actions were taken after the appellant's position was abolished, and that, as the administrative judge found, the management analyst failed to mention the "civilianization" of the Comptroller position in his May 1985 report. There is other evidence, however, that the agency's action with respect to this matter was planned before that report was issued. The same management analyst stated in an affidavit that his conclusion that there were insufficient duties to support a GM-13 Deputy Comptroller position, and his resulting recommendation that former position be abolished, were based in part on his awareness, at the time he made that recommendation, that the Comptroller position was to be converted from a military position to a civilian position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also based his conclusion regarding the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of the reduction in force on his finding that the appellant's immediate supervisor had told two people in 1985, after the appellant had been detailed from his former position, that the appellant would not be returning to the Comptroller Department. This finding is supported by the sworn statements of the two people in question. We do not believe, however, that the Comptroller's remarks establish that the appellant's position was abolished for reasons personal to him. It is likely that they reflect an expectation that the appellant would be demoted for the misconduct in which he had been alleged to have engaged. They also could reflect an expectation that, if he were not demoted, the appellant would be reassigned to another office. In addition, we note that the remarks reportedly made to one of the affiants were said to have been made in April 1986. Those remarks might reflect an expectation that the appellant might be assigned elsewhere as a result of the organizational changes that were being considered at that time. We find no proper basis for concluding that the Comptroller's remarks reflect a plan to abolish the appellant's position for reasons personal to him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that the management analyst mentioned above had stated in his report that there would be an agency study of the Comptroller Department in which the Deputy Comptroller position would be addressed. He found further that no such study was conducted, and that this circumstance supported the appellant's allegations regarding the reasons for the reduction in force.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Even if the administrative judge's findings are essentially correct, we do not believe they support a conclusion that the reduction-in-force action at issue was improper. At most, they might support a finding that the management analyst was mistaken, or that the agency subsequently decided that the additional study was unnecessary. Whether a separate study addressing the appellant's Deputy Comptroller duties was or was not conducted, the management analyst evidently felt that he had enough information to make a recommendation concerning the continuation of the appellant's former position. An incorrect statement with respect to the study of the Deputy Comptroller duties simply does not show improper agency intent in connection with the appellant's change to lower grade.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, the administrative judge based his conclusion partly on his finding that the commanding officer's request that the appellant's position be abolished was made only one week after the management analyst's report (including the alleged statement regarding the study of the Deputy Comptroller position) was issued.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We see no basis for finding that the agency's prompt response to the report indicates that it made its decision for impermissible reasons. As we <span id="Page_3114"></span>have stated above, that report was neither the first nor the only indication that the appellant's position should be abolished. Instead, the agency evidently had already decided to convert the Comptroller position to a civilian position, and for quite some time it had been receiving and considering information and instructions that led to its decision to remove the internal review function from the Comptroller Department.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">If an appellant raises a nonfrivolous allegation that a RIF was used as an adverse action to secure his demotion, there must be a careful evaluation of the issue by the AJ. <span class="Italic">Nichols v. DOD</span>, 19 MSPR 471, 476-77 (1984). If an appellant attempts to demonstrate that a RIF is based on personal considerations that originated in events two years prior to the RIF, the allegation is not frivolous. The appellant is entitled during the hearing to provide evidence supporting her claims that the discharge was for reasons personal to her. <span class="Italic">Wylie v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 7 MSPR 331, 333, 7 MSPB 218 (1981). The RIF decision should be examined to determine how it was decided that the particular job was to be eliminated, what reasons were offered for its abolition, who made the decision and what relation that individual had to the appellant, and what steps the agency took, within its discretion, to mitigate the effect of the RIF on the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Johnson v. Dept. of Air Force</span>, 11 MSPR 19, 21-22 (1982).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">There is a distinction between an allegation (entitling an appellant to a hearing) and proof (entitling the appellant to a remedy). The Board rejected a claim that a RIF was for personal, resulting from a challenge by the appellant to a performance evaluation in the distant past. There was no evidence linking the challenge with the otherwise legitimate reason stated for the RIF. <span class="Italic">Mumford v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 39 MSPR 579, 581 (1989) (rejecting a claim that a RIF was motivated by protected activity that occurred six years earlier); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Perry v. NCUA</span> (Fed. Cir. 1996 NP No. 95-3532) (discussing the timing of actions involved in a reorganization). [Refer to Chapter 12 (discrimination), "<a href="0100-2023-19-050.html#sec12-49">Reprisal</a>" and Chapter 13 (prohibited personnel practices), "<a href="0100-2023-20-004.html#sec13-5">Whistleblowing Reprisal</a>."]</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Should an employee argue that union animus triggered a RIF resulting in his removal, the AJ is to consider not only management's arguments and evidence on the reorganization used as the justification for the RIF, but also any evidence of improper motivation for the RIF. <span class="Italic">Salazar v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 633, 640 (1994), rejected allegations of animus:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...The administrative judge found that, once an agency shows that it invoked RIF regulations for a <span class="Italic">bona fide</span> reason, the Board lacks the authority to hear an assertion that the agency committed prohibited personnel practices by abolishing certain positions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, while neither the Board nor an employee may dictate to an agency the means it must use to remedy a funding shortage, the Board does have the authority to determine whether it is the funding shortage or union animus that has caused the agency to conduct a RIF. <span class="Italic">See Losure v. Interstate Commerce Commission,</span> 2 MSPB 361, 2 MSPR 195, 201-02 (1980) (an employee may rebut the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> showing regarding the <span class="Italic">bona fide</span>s of a RIF). Here, however, aside from his allegation that the RIF was motivated by a desire to rid the agency of the ATAs' union, the only evidence appellant Salazar submitted in support of his contention is a document showing that the agency announced the RIF and the result of the ATAs' election in favor of union representation on the same day. This mere coincidence falls far short of rebutting the agency's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case in light of the agency's extensive evidence that it conducted the RIF because of a budget shortfall....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A similar union animus argument was advanced but rejected in <span class="Italic">Schroeder v. Dept. of Transp.</span>, 60 MSPR 566, 571 (1994).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">A challenge to a RIF as an adverse action may lead to some peculiar results. A group of excepted service employees challenged a RIF and prevailed to the extent that they demonstrated that the action leading to their separation was not a RIF but an adverse action. The problem was that although the Board has jurisdiction over RIF appeals without regard to preference status, it then lacked jurisdiction over an adverse action appeal from an employee without preference status in the excepted service. The appellants prevailed on their theory that the action was not properly a RIF and then found the Board without jurisdiction to entertain their claims that the constructive adverse action was unlawful. <span class="Italic">Huber v. MSPB</span>, 793 F.2d 284 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The Board could not entertain a RIF appeal--within its jurisdiction under OPM RIF regulations--when the evidence was that the employee was removed for reasons personal to the appellant--an adverse action--but the Board lacked jurisdiction over an adverse action because the appellant did not qualify as an "employee" under 5 USC 7511(a)(1) with statutory appeal rights. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Baker v. DHS</span>, 99 MSPR 92, 95-96 (2005).</p>
