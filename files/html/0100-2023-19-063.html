<h5 class="h5" id="sec12-59"><span class="space">a.</span> Life Activity of Working</h5>
<p class="Body-Text">In the complex analysis of disability discrimination before the 2008 ADAAA, the life activity of working is only one, and usually the point of last analysis, in the range of conditions that may be disabling, that as a result may limit an individual's ability to work, and that may result in an accommodative responsibility by the employer subject to a defense of undue burden as to that accommodation. The complexities of the analysis are illustrated in the extensive discussion of the appeal of a GS-7 Office Automation Assistant who was removed for failure to perform the essential functions of her position, <span class="Italic">Clemens v. Dept. of Army</span>, 104 MSPR 362, 366-77 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 6-33, 2006 MSPB 368 (2006):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An appellant who raises a claim of disability discrimination must first establish that she is a disabled person entitled to the protection of the disability discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">Harris v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5 (2005). A disabled person is one who has a "physical or mental impairment" that "substantially limits" one or more "major life activities," who has a record of such an impairment, or who is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">Id.</span>; 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g). These terms must be interpreted strictly to create "a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled." <span class="Italic">Burgess v. Department of the Interior</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 23 (2003) (quoting <span class="Italic">Toyota Motor Mfg., Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams</span>, 534 U.S. 184, 197 (2002)). The regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) define "major life activities" as "functions such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(i); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 5. Major life activities also include sleeping, thinking, concentrating, and interacting with others. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-ada-and-psychiatric-disabilities">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/psych.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-ada-and-psychiatric-disabilities">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-ada-and-psychiatric-disabilities</a>], at 5; EEOC Compliance Manual, &#x00A7; 902.3; <span class="Italic">see Patterson v. Department of the Air Force</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. 648, 661-62 (1997) (finding that the appellant was substantially limited in the major life activities of thinking and concentrating).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The phrase "substantially limits" does not include impairments that interfere with major life activities in only a minor way. <span class="Italic">Burgess</span>, 95 M.S.P.R. 134, &#x00B6; 23. A medical diagnosis of an impairment, by itself, is not sufficient to prove disability; an appellant must offer evidence "that the extent of the limitation caused by the impairment is substantial, in terms of the employee's own experience." <span class="Italic">Id.</span>, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 23-25. An impairment is sufficiently severe to substantially limit a major life activity if it prevents an individual from performing a major life activity or significantly restricts the condition, manner, or duration under which an individual can perform a major life activity, as compared to the average person in the general population. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(1); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6; 8; EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 5. In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity, the following factors should be considered: The nature and severity of the impairment; the duration or expected duration of the impairment; and the permanent or long-term impact of or resulting from the impairment. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(2). If an individual is not substantially limited in any other major life activity, then, and only then, the individual's ability to perform the major life activity of working should be considered. 29 C.F.R. part 1630, App., &#x00A7; 1630.2(j); <span class="Italic">Patterson</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 660.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant, as a result of her psychiatric conditions, was precluded from performing as an Office Automation Assistant in Nutrition Care, not that she was precluded from all clerical or secretarial work in a hospital environment. The AJ noted the appellant's testimony that she was able to take care of her basic needs such as feeding and clothing herself and that she was also able to "work-out" at the gym and care for her grandchildren. The AJ thus found that the appellant did not establish that her psychiatric conditions "foreclosed her from performing work in her field or...limited one or more of her other major life activities." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Therefore, the AJ found that the appellant did not show that she was a qualified disabled person or was wrongly perceived as such by the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant does not contest the AJ's fully supported finding that she was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working. Instead, the appellant asserts that she was substantially limited in the major life activities of thinking, concentrating, learning, sleeping, multi&#8209;tasking, and caring for herself. Other than the appellant's testimony that she has trouble sleeping, there is no evidence to support her assertion that she was substantially impaired in the major life activity of sleeping. The appellant has not provided, and we are unaware of, any legal authority for her proposition that multi&#8209;tasking is a major life activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the major life activity of caring for oneself, an impairment substantially limits an individual's ability to care for herself if, due to the impairment, an individual is significantly restricted as compared to the average person in the general population in performing basic activities, <span id="Page_3429"></span>such as getting up in the morning, bathing, dressing, and preparing or obtaining food. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 9. Jeff Harazin, M.D., the appellant's psychiatrist since May 2003, testified that the appellant, as a result of her depression, had "daily activity problems, such as showering and getting clean," and that she sometimes arrived at appointments obviously unbathed. However, as the AJ noted, the appellant testified that she was able to feed and clothe herself and that she was also able to "work-out" at the gym and care for her grandchildren. Taking into consideration both the appellant's and Dr. Harazin's testimony, we find that the appellant has failed to show that she was substantially impaired in the major life activity of caring for herself. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant correctly contends that the AJ failed to explicitly address the evidence below regarding whether the appellant was substantially impaired in the major life activities of learning, thinking, and concentrating. An impairment substantially limits an individual's ability to concentrate if, due to the impairment, an individual is significantly restricted as compared to the average person in the general population. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 8. An example of such an individual is one who is easily and frequently distracted, meaning that her attention was frequently drawn to irrelevant sights or sounds or to intrusive thoughts, or if she experienced her "mind going blank" on a frequent basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his March 4, 2005 letter, Dr. Harazin stated that the appellant's Major Depressive Disorder "affects [her] ability to think clearly, perform calculations, pay attention to detail, follow detailed instructions, remember, and to work at a normal speed." He further stated that this illness has caused the appellant to "think at a speed significantly slower than people without Major Depressive Disorder." He stated that the appellant suffers from a "gravely impaired memory...." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Dr. Harazin testified that the appellant, as a result of her psychiatric conditions, is not capable of performing certain complex tasks, and that she has cognitive problems "in memory spheres," difficulty in memory, problems in calculations, and other "cognitive blunting." He testified that his two partners substantiated his finding that she is substantially impaired in these daily life activities. The appellant testified that: It was hard to concentrate; she was always crying; she had to go to the hospital because she thought she was having a heart attack; she would get irritable; she had overwhelming anxiety; she was depressed; and she constantly felt that life was not worth living. Based on this unrebutted evidence, we find that the appellant is substantially impaired in one or more of the major life activities of learning, thinking, and concentrating. <span class="Italic">See Patterson</span>, 74 M.S.P.R. at 662-63 (as a result of her anxiety and depression, the appellant was substantially limited in the major life activities of thinking, concentrating, and making decisions); <span class="Italic">cf.

<p class="Block-Quote2">[3]&#x2003;The appellant also argues that she is a "disabled person" because the agency regarded her as disabled when a personnel specialist determined that she was unqualified for a lateral transfer.

Office of Personnel Management</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 314, &#x00B6; 7 (2002) (the Board generally lacks jurisdiction over a nonselection for a position). That is, the Board lacks jurisdiction over her claim of disability discrimination with regard to that determination. To the extent that the appellant is claiming that the agency regarded her as disabled when it removed her, that claim fails in light of our finding that she has a mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. A "regarded as disabled" claim requires a showing that the employer held an incorrect perception of the employee's abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g), (l); <span class="Italic">Harris</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 452, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 5, 6.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the AJ made a conclusory determination that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability, apparently based solely on her incorrect finding that the appellant was not a "disabled person." The AJ thus did not address whether the appellant could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation. Because we find, as discussed above, that the appellant is a "disabled person," we shall now address whether the appellant could perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the AJ failed to determine the essential functions of her position. However, in addressing the merits of the charge ("failure to perform the essential functions of [her] position"), the AJ determined that the essential functions of the appellant's position included, among other things: Performing calculations; performing complex data&#8209;entry duties; performing data entry for Medical Expense and Performance System (MEPRS) reports; performing time and attendance duties; submitting food service invoices to the Defense Finance and Accounting System (DFAS) for payment on the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) computer system; performing daily cash counts and summary reports; updating the Dining Hall menu; routine word processing; greeting patients; and answering routine patient questions. We find that this determination is fully supported by the record. We also find that this determination applies equally to the appellant's disability discrimination claim. That is, we find that the duties that the AJ determined are the essential functions of the appellant's Office Automation Technician position are "fundamental job duties" of this position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n) (defining "essential functions").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant argues that the financial duties (i.e., submitting food service invoices to DFAS on WAWF and performing daily cash counts and summary reports) were not essential functions of her position. A function can be considered essential for any of the following reasons: The reason for a position's existence is to perform that function; there are a limited number of employees available among whom the performance of that function can be distributed; or the function may be highly specialized so that the incumbent in the position is hired for her expertise or ability to perform the particular function. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); <span class="Italic">see Henry v. Department of Veterans Affairs</span>, 100 M.S.P.R. 124, &#x00B6; 10 (2005). Evidence of whether a particular function is essential may include: The employer's judgment as to which functions are essential; written position descriptions; the amount of time spent on the job performing the function; the consequences of not requiring the incumbent to perform the function; the terms of a collective bargaining agreement; the work experience of past incumbents in the job; and/or the current work experience of incumbents in similar jobs. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); <span class="Italic">see Fortin</span> <span class="Italic">v. Barnhart</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01A46108, slip op. at 3 (June 16, 2005).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the position description for the Office Automation Assistant position in the Nutrition Care Division states that the primary purpose of the position is to perform office automation work, including word processing, and a variety of clerical functions in support of the organization's mission and functions. The specific mission of the Nutrition Care Division is to provide comprehensive medical nutrition therapy to patients and beneficiaries by providing wholesome, nutritious foods and timely assessment, counseling, health promotion, and education with an emphasis on excellent customer service, sanitation, and food service production. The "Major" duties of this position include, among others: "H. Maintains current and comprehensive data on Dining Hall cash receipts and meals served records (4%)." The tasks listed under this duty are: Preparing daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly financial status reports; maintaining current and comprehensive data on dining hall cash receipts, records on meals served and "a la carte" cash, and "ration source" data; monitoring food and non&#8209;food budget; maintaining required stock levels and monitoring all expendable supplies ordered and received per quarter; calculating authorized monetary values from rations served, data, and ration rate; and reviewing all food receipt documents for accuracy of quantity, unit cost and price extension.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Craig testified that the mission of the division is two&#8209;fold: Food service preparation operations for patients, staff, and visitors in the EACH Dining Hall; and medical dietetic therapy of both in-patients and out-patients. She testified that, because the Nutrition Care Division manages and runs a Dining Hall, the Office Automation Assistant is responsible for gathering the money earned from Dining Hall receipts, counting the money and preparing a daily summary report with the cash receipts for that day. The money is then deposited at the Treasury Office on a daily basis with the summary report. Craig testified that the Nutrition Care Division receives food three times each week from its prime vendor. With the food ordered, the vendor supplies an invoice. The Office Automation <span id="Page_3430"></span>Assistant in Nutrition Care is responsible for entering invoice data into WAWF so that DFAS can receive the invoice information for payment. Craig also testified that the WAWF invoice data entry functions was an "extremely important," "critical" dut[y] " of the position. Employees needed to be paid and the prime vendor needed to be paid so that the agency could continue to supply food and nutrition care to patients, staff, and visitors. Craig testified that, if vendor invoices were not paid, the vendor could stop supplying foods vital to patient care and daily operations. Craig testified that it was common for the Office Automation Assistant, GS-7, to perform these types of duties in other military hospitals.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On PFR, the appellant argues that the financial duties under paragraph H of her position description were not essential duties or functions of her position because they had not been designated "critical elements" and were listed as only encompassing 4% of her time on the position description. She argues that "[t]he agency should be held to its own written characterizations [in the position description] as to what are the critical job functions when evaluating the performance of an employee." However, the appellant has not identified, and we are unaware of, any legal authority that requires that a duty be designated as a "critical element" in the position description in order to be an "essential function" of the position. In addition, Craig testified that duty H had to be manually added to the position description because it was not on the personnelist's computer, and that, consequently, "critical" could not be added to the position description under the description of duty H. Nevertheless, she testified that duty H was a "critical" duty because management determines whether a duty is "critical," and duty H was an "essential function" of the appellant's position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to the percentage of time designated on the position description for paragraph H duties, Craig testified that she spoke to a classification specialist concerning paragraph H duties because the position description stated that they comprised only 4% of the duties of the position, but, in her estimation, such financial duties actually constituted 20% of the position. The appellant does dispute this estimation. Craig also testified that she learned that the position would not be reclassified or upgraded unless the financial duties constituted more than 20% of the duties of the position. The AJ properly found that the appellant could have sought a classification review or desk audit of her position if she disagreed with the percentage of time allocated to the paragraph H financial duties. In any event, the fact that paragraph H duties actually comprised 20% of the appellant's duties supports the AJ's finding that such duties were essential functions of the appellant's position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n)(2)(iii); <span class="Italic">cf. Emerson v. Northern States Power Co.</span>, 256 F.3d 506, 512-13 (7th Cir. 2001) (handling customer calls concerning gas and electric emergencies is essential for a customer service worker because of the potentially dangerous consequences, even if those calls occur only 5% of the employee's day); <span class="Italic">Basith v. Cook County</span>, 241 F.3d 919, 929 (7th Cir. 2001) (an essential function need not encompass the majority of an employee's time, or even a significant quantity of time; delivering medications was an essential function of the pharmacy technician job despite the fact that it took at most 1 hour each day because delivering medication is essential to the functioning of the pharmacy and the employer determined that this position was responsible for this function).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Therefore, based on the record evidence and testimony, we find that the financial duties under paragraph H of the appellant's position description (i.e., submitting food service invoices to DFAS on WAWF and performing daily cash counts and summary reports) were essential functions of her position. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(n); <span class="Italic">Fortin</span>, slip op. at 3. As discussed above, we also find that the essential functions of the appellant's position include: Performing time and attendance duties, e.g., time card preparation and submission; performing data entry for MEPRS reports; updating the Dining Hall menu; word processing; greeting patients; and answering routine patient questions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The AJ found that the appellant's psychiatric condition substantially impaired her ability to perform these essential functions. The appellant does not dispute this fully supported finding. The appellant argues, however, that she could perform these essential functions with reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a November 14, 2004 letter, Dr. Harazin informed the agency that the appellant was medically ready to assume her duties. "In an attempt to maximize [the appellant's] return to work on a full&#8209;time basis," he requested the following temporary accommodations: (1) The appellant receive direction and instruction from only one supervisor because the appellant became overwhelmed and anxious when faced with multiple stimuli; (2) the appellant receive training on all new programs, computer or otherwise; and (3) the appellant be granted an average of 10% to 15% more time to complete the tasks assigned to her. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> He also requested that, if these accommodations did not work, the appellant receive a lateral transfer to a different position. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A reasonable accommodation means, among other things, modifications or adjustments to the work environment or to the manner or circumstances under which a position is performed and may include, for example, job restructuring or reassignment to a vacant position. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(o)(1)(ii) &#x0026; (2)(ii). An agency is not obligated, however, to restructure a position if doing so would entail the removal of the essential functions of the position. <span class="Italic">Combs</span>, 91 M.S.P.R. 148, &#x00B6; 25; EEOC Enforcement Guidance: &#x2003;Act, <a href="http://www.eeoc/">http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/accommodation.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/enforcement-guidance-reasonable-accommodation-and-undue-hardship-under-ada</a>], at 13 (stating that "[A]n employer never has to reallocate essential functions as a reasonable accommodation, but can do so if it wishes.").</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is not obligated to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he may request. <span class="Italic">Carter v. Bennett</span>, 651 F. Supp. 1299, 1301 (D.D.C. 1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 840 F.2d 63 (D.C. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Benitez v. West</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 03950100, slip op. at 5 (Sept. 28, 1995). Further, an agency does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the agency. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p); EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 26. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, the nature and cost of the accommodation needed, the overall financial resources of the facility, the type of operation, and the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility. <span class="Italic">Id.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to Dr. Harazin's request that the appellant be granted an average of 10% to 15% more time to complete the tasks assigned to her, the uncontroverted record shows that the agency did just that, even though the agency believed that this requested accommodation was not reasonable (Craig's December 6, 2004 memorandum to the appellant in which Craig stated that she determined a reasonable amount of time for each of the appellant's tasks and added 10% to 15% to the standard completion times for each task, and the attached schedule with specific timeframes and completion dates for each general task); (Craig's testimony that she determined a reasonable amount of time for each of the appellant's essential duties by consulting with soldiers who were filling in for the appellant, and that she then added 10% to 15% to those completion times for each task).[4] The record further shows that, with this extra time and extensive training, the appellant was able to perform the essential functions of her position for 3 months, i.e., late November 2004 through late February 2005. On March 4, 2005, however, Dr. Harazin found that the appellant's condition had worsened to the extent that she could not perform the essential functions of her position. Thus, the appellant has not shown that she could perform the essential functions of her position with the addition of 10% to 15% more time to complete the tasks assigned to her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Contrary to the appellant's assertion, she did not testify that the time schedule developed by Craig did not allow for additional time for required tasks. Rather, the appellant merely testified that the time allotted for the tasks was inadequate.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant testified that she really wanted the agency to let her set the time schedule according to how long it actually took her to perform a task. But an agency is not obligated to provide such an accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 30 n.62 (reasonable accommodation does not require lowering production or performance standards); <span class="Italic">cf. Hoffman v. Caterpillar, Inc.</span>, 256 F.3d 568, 573 (7th Cir. 2001) (employer would not have to tolerate a drop in productivity if an employee could not operate a high&#8209;speed scanner as quickly as needed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to Dr. Harazin's request that only one supervisor give the appellant assignments, adjusting supervisory methods is a form of reasonable accommodation. EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 17. Such adjustments could include "communicating assignments, instructions, or training by the medium that is most effective for a particular individual." <span class="Italic">Id.</span> It is undisputed that the appellant continued to receive assignments from more than one supervisor.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, the agency proved that having just one supervisor assign the appellant tasks would significantly disrupt the operations of the Nutrition Care Division. In her December 6, 2004 memorandum, Craig stated that, in response to Dr. Harazin's request, she would provide the appellant with the majority of the tasks to be assigned, but that, given the dynamics and nature of the organization, there would be occasions when seven other supervisors would need to assign the appellant tasks in their area of responsibility. Craig testified that it would be inefficient and very difficult for operations in the Nutrition Care Division to have just one supervisor assign the appellant tasks. She further testified that the appellant was the only administrative assistant in this division, and that the other supervisors in this division needed to interact with the appellant in their areas of responsibility. Based on this unrebutted testimony, we find that the agency proved that the appellant's requested accommodation <span id="Page_3431"></span>of having just one supervisor assign her tasks would cause an undue hardship to the agency because it would significantly and adversely impact operations in the Nutrition Care Division. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(p); EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 26.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Moreover, the agency did attempt to accommodate the appellant's need to receive assignments from just one supervisor. Craig tried to accommodate the appellant by telling the other supervisors that, if there was something they wanted to assign the appellant other than the agreed upon areas, they needed to tell Craig before assigning it to the appellant and by advising the appellant that she should tell Craig if she was assigned an overwhelming task by a supervisor. Despite these efforts, the appellant was still unable to perform the essential functions of her position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With regard to Dr. Harazin's request that the appellant receive training in all new programs, supervisors may be required to provide additional training as a form of reasonable accommodation, EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Americans with Disabilities Act and Psychiatric Disabilities at 17. Here, Craig testified without rebuttal that WAWF was the only new program or computer system the appellant had to use to perform her essential functions. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the agency provided the appellant with adequate training on WAWF. The appellant testified that this training was interrupted because she had to answer the telephone, schedule patients, and perform other work during the training. Craig testified that the appellant did not have to answer telephones or check in patients during this training because Dietitians took over those duties during the training time. However, we need not determine whether the appellant received adequate training on WAWF because the record shows, and the appellant does not dispute, that she could not perform essential functions of her position that did not require using WAWF, e.g., time card preparation and submission, performing data entry for MEPRS reports, updating the Dining Hall menu, word processing, greeting patients, and answering routine patient questions. Thus, even with adequate WAWF training, she still would not have been able to perform the essential functions of her position with or without reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's claim of entitlement to a lateral reassignment to a GS&#8209;7 patient benefits position that she requested as a reasonable accommodation, an employee must be "qualified" for the new position, i.e., she must satisfy the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job&#8209;related requirements of the position, and must be able to perform the essential functions of the new position with or without reasonable accommodation. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act at 19. An employer is not required to assist the individual to become qualified. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> Here, Therese Untalan of the agency's Civilian Personnel Office testified that the agency searched without success for various permanent positions within the appellant's restrictions, and that she also forwarded the appellant's request for the lateral reassignment to the agency's Southwest Operations Center at Fort Riley, Kansas. She testified that the appellant was found not qualified for the lateral reassignment because she lacked the proper experience for work in the patient benefits area. Based on this testimony, the AJ properly found that the appellant was not entitled to the lateral reassignment she requested as a reasonable accommodation. The appellant's mere disagreement with this explained finding does not provide a basis for disturbing the finding. <span class="Italic">See Weaver v. Department of the Navy</span>, 2 M.S.P.R. 129, 133&#8209;34 (1980), <span class="Italic">review denied</span>, 669 F.2d 613 (9th Cir. 1982) (<span class="Italic">per curiam</span>).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In sum, the agency did attempt to accommodate the appellant in many ways. Despite all of these efforts, the appellant still was unable to perform the essential functions of her position. We therefore find that she was not a qualified individual with a disability. Accordingly, the appellant did not prove her affirmative defense of disability discrimination.</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Carter v. DOJ</span>, 88 MSPR 641, 648-52 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 14-22 (2001), made plain that a limitation on the life activity of working must be assessed as to a range of jobs linked to the appellant's skills and training. If jobs are available to the appellant, he likely is not substantially precluded from working:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the appellant claimed below only that he was disabled in the life activity of working. For the major life activity of working, "substantially limits" means that an individual is "significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes as compared to the average person having comparable training, skills and abilities." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">see Vyas v. Department of the</span> Army, 83 MSPR 452 &#x00B6; 10 (1999). In determining whether an individual is substantially limited in the major life activity of working, relevant factors that should be considered are the geographical area to which the individual has reasonable access, and "the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within [the] geographical area, from which the individual is...disqualified." 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A), (13); <span class="Italic">see Sutton,</span> 119 S.

Similarly, to be regarded as substantially limited in the major life activity of working, it is not enough to show that the employer regarded the individual as foreclosed from a particular job, or from a particular place; the employer must regard the impairment as substantially limiting employment generally. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i); <span class="Italic">Groshans v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The record shows that the appellant has medical limitations as a result of his chronic back problems....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on this medical evidence and the properly sustained inability to perform charge, we find that the appellant established that he had a physical impairment (his chronic back problems) that foreclosed him from performing the specific duties of his Supervisory Border Patrol Agent position. However, because the position of Border Patrol Agent, supervisory or otherwise, is a single job, this finding does not establish that the appellant has a substantial limitation in working<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i) ("The inability to perform a single, particular job does not constitute a substantial limitation in the major life activity of working"); <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2151 (the position of global airline pilot is a single job and, thus, the inability to perform just that job does not establish that the individual is substantially limited in working).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant additionally claimed below that his physical impairment substantially limits his major life activity of working, because it forecloses him from performing a class of manual jobs in the building trades, e.g., bricklayer and carpenter, which routinely require kneeling and lifting over 20 pounds. Contrary to the appellant's argument, proving that his physical impairment and medical restrictions preclude him from performing manual jobs in the building trades would not establish that his physical impairment is a disability because he has not alleged, let alone shown, that he is either qualified to perform such jobs or would pursue employment in that area in the absence of his chronic back problems. Thus, manual jobs in the building trades do not represent jobs open to the "average person having comparable training, skills, and abilities" to the appellant. 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i); <span class="Italic">see Moore v. J.B. Hunt Transport,</span> <span class="Italic">Inc.,</span> 221 F.3d 944, 953 (7th Cir. 2000) (fact that Driver Training Instructor's medical restrictions precluded him from construction trades, farm work, street maintenance, mail delivery, and butchery did not render his impairment a disability).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant also claimed below that his physical impairment substantially limits his major life activity of working, because it forecloses him from performing a class of law enforcement jobs, e.g., police officer, corrections officer, agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and customs agent, which routinely require making confrontational arrests and patrolling rugged terrain on foot or in a vehicle. To prove this claim, the appellant must establish that law enforcement jobs that routinely require making confrontational arrests and patrolling rugged terrain on foot or in a vehicle (e.g., Border Patrol Agent, police officer, corrections officer, FBI agent, and customs agent) are a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes from which he is restricted as compared to the average person having training, skills, and abilities comparable to the appellant. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(i).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record includes a copy of the appellant's Standard Form (SF) 171, Application for Federal Employment, dated January 2, 1997. According to this SF 171, the appellant, at the time of his removal, had over 21 years of experience as a Border Patrol Agent and Supervisory Border Patrol Agent, performing various duties, including frontline law enforcement, supervision, preparing cases for prosecution, training and instructing Border Patrol Agents in firearms, Spanish, and law, interviewing and hiring Border Patrol Agents, and writing and preparing law enforcement manuals.[4] He has an associate degree and has completed additional undergraduate course work. His training includes Border Patrol Agent subjects, as well as U.S. Custom Officer, Drug Enforcement Administration Drug Interdiction, and FBI cross training.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The fact that some of these assignments successfully performed by the appellant were tailored to his physical limitations by the agency does not establish that he cannot show that he was substantially limited in working; rather, the appellant's success in these tailored assignments merely shows that there may be some jobs that he can perform notwithstanding his physical impairment<span class="Italic">. See Mullins v.</span> <span class="Italic">Crowell,</span> 228 F.3d 1305, 1310-11 (11th Cir. 2000). He can still prove that he is substantially limited in working if he shows that <span id="Page_3432"></span>he is significantly restricted in the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broad range of jobs in various classes in his geographical area as compared to the average person having his comparable, training, skills, and abilities. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)(A), (B); <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2151.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next find that the appellant has not established that law enforcement jobs, which routinely require making confrontational arrests and patrolling rugged terrain on foot or in a vehicle, is sufficiently broad to be a "class of jobs" for purposes of determining whether the appellant is substantially limited in the ability to work. A "class of jobs" encompasses "the number and types of jobs utilizing similar training, knowledge, skills or abilities, within [the appellant's] geographical area from which the [appellant] is also disqualified because of [his] impairment." 29 CFR part 1630, app., <span class="Italic">Interpretive Guid</span>ance <span class="Italic">on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act.</span> Other than the appellant's bare speculation during the hearing concerning the duties of various law enforcement jobs, there is no evidence in the record showing that, in the appellant's geographical area, all police officers, corrections officers, FBI agents, and customs agents routinely are required to make confrontational arrests and patrol rugged terrain on foot or in a vehicle. Moreover, no evidence was submitted addressing whether there are other jobs in the appellant's geographical area, besides Border Patrol Agent, police officer, corrections officer, FBI agent, and customs agent, which utilize training, knowledge, skills, or abilities comparable to his. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR &#x00A7; 1630.2(j)(3).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In other words, the appellant has not presented sufficient evidence showing that his physical inability to perform the duties of law enforcement positions that routinely require making confrontational arrests and patrolling rugged terrain on foot or in a vehicle significantly restricts his ability to perform a class of jobs as compared to the average person having his comparable training, skills, and abilities. Accordingly, we conclude, based on the record before us, that the appellant has not established that his impairment substantially limits him in the life activity of work. <span class="Italic">Cf. Murphy v. United Parcel</span> <span class="Italic">Service,</span> Inc., 527 U.S. 516, 119 S. Ct. 2133, 2138-39, 144 L. Ed.2d 484 (1999) (a mechanic was not substantially limited in the major life activity of working where, although he could not perform a position requiring a Department of Transportation certification, he did not present any evidence that he was unable to perform any mechanic job that did not require such certification, he had performed mechanic jobs that did not require such certification for over 22 years and, in fact, had secured another job as a mechanic shortly after leaving his employer); <span class="Italic">Sutton</span>, 119 S. Ct. at 2151-52 (twin sisters were not substantially limited in the major life activity of working because, while their vision problems precluded them from employment as global airline pilots, a number of positions utilizing their skills, including regional pilot and pilot instructor, were available to them); <span class="Italic">Muller v.</span> <span class="Italic">Costello,</span> 187 F.3d 298, 313 (2d Cir. 1999) (correctional officer did not establish that he was substantially impaired in working by showing that asthma and allergies to smoke foreclosed him from working as a correctional officer in his geographical area because he would also be qualified to work as a security guard in an office building or as a guard in a smoke-free county jail); <span class="Italic">Colwell v. Suffolk County Police Depart</span>ment, 158 F.3d 635, 644 (2d Cir. 1998), <span class="Italic">cert. denied</span>, 526 U.S. 1018, 119 S. Ct. 1253, 143 L.
