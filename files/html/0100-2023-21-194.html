<h5 class="h5" id="sec14-193"><span class="space">h.</span> Detrimental Reliance; Set Aside Rule</h5>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Aguon v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 540, 546-49 (1989), developed the concepts of detrimental reliance and unconscionability as bases for waiver of an overpayment:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;<span class="Italic">Detrimental reliance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A second basis for waiver exists when the recipient of the overpayment shows "(regardless of his or her financial circumstances) that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment,...he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403. The appellant in this case alleges that he relied on the overpayment of his annuity to his detriment by enrolling his children in college.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM, in the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> mentioned above, has listed four criteria that it requires an annuitant to meet in order to qualify for a waiver on the ground that he has "relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse." Those criteria are as follows:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_4423"></span>(a)&#x2003;[The relinquishment or change must be] directly caused by the overpayment or notice that such payment would be made (i.e., loss or change would not have otherwise occurred); AND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(b)&#x2003;[it must be detrimental to the overpayment recipient; AND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(c)&#x2003;[it must be] material (i.e., significant enough to warrant the waiver); AND</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;[it must be] irrevocable (i.e., the forfeited right cannot be recovered, the change of position cannot be reversed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.3. at 9.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM's criteria are consistent not only with the regulatory and statutory language on which they are based but also with detrimental reliance or equitable estoppel principles. Accordingly, we find that these criteria are reasonable and proper and therefore are entitled to great deference....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In connection with the third criterion listed above, we note further that waiver under the regulatory provision at issue here should not be used as an instrument for an annuitant's gain or profit, <span class="Italic">see</span> 31 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Estoppel</span> &#x00A7; 63 (1964), and that it therefore is appropriate only in an amount equivalent to the loss the annuitant's relinquishment of a right or change of position otherwise would cause the annuitant.[6]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[6]&#x2003;The requirement in the third criterion that the relinquishment or change must be "material" may not properly be interpreted as requiring that it be major. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Cucuzzella v. Weinberger,</span> 395 F. Supp. 1288, 1298 (D. Del. 1975) (in case involving similar provision, court found that a showing of a "dramatic" change of position was unnecessary).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In addition, we note that an annuitant who requests waiver on the ground that he has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse in reliance on OPM's overpayment has the burden of proving by substantial evidence that he has met the criteria for granting a waiver on this basis. 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1407(b).[7]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;This regulatory provision is consistent with <span class="Italic">Cheeseman v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 21 M.S.P.R. 118, <span class="Italic">aff'd,</span> 791 F.2d 138 (Fed. Cir. 1986) <span class="Italic">cert. denied,</span> 479 U.S. 1037 (1987), in which the Board approved placing on annuitants the burden of proving that misinformation on an OPM form caused them to decide not to elect a survivor annuity. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 123-24. In both this case and <span class="Italic">Cheeseman,</span> the annuitants have greater access than OPM to the information on which the annuitants' claim is based. <span class="Italic">See also</span> 31 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Estoppel</span> &#x00A7; 160 (1964) (party invoking doctrine of equitable estoppel bears the burden of establishing his claim and the elements thereof).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the basis of the existing record, we find that the appellant has not met this burden of proving that he has changed positions for the worse in reliance on his receipt of the overpayment. His detrimental reliance allegation is supported only by brief statements that he "would not have incurred any specific financial obligations if he would have had any idea that he would be charged with a $13,840.00 overpayment," and that his "children started college based upon the father's full income without any of the claimed payment deductions."</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant contended below that she detrimentally relied on the overpayment because, in anticipation of its receipt, (a) she and the decedent bought their home intending to use the lump-sum payments to pay off the mortgage, (b) she resigned from her Personnel Secretary position with the City of Flagstaff, Arizona, to care for the decedent during his illness and did not return to work, and (c) she was planning to start a business.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant's only support for those contentions were her general, unsupported assertions below that: The purchase of the home "was a purchase that was undertaken with the thought that there would be the first lump sum for down payment, closing costs and fix-up...and the second lump sum for further pay downs"; she "entered into various business arrangements which she would not have but for the possession of" the second lump sum; and "because of the security of that lump sum coming at the end of the year, [she] quit her job with a government entity in Flagstaff, Arizona, and stayed home and took care of [the decedent] in his last illness."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant neither alleged nor showed below that, but for the expected second lump-sum payment, she and the decedent would not otherwise have bought their home, she would not have resigned from her job to care for the decedent and to remain out of the workforce, and she would not have made plans to start a business after his death. Neither is there any indication in the record that the appellant would likely not have assumed the foregoing responsibilities but for the second lump-sum payment. Rather, the record indicates that, even without the second lump-sum, the appellant's financial condition rendered her able to easily assume all of these responsibilities. Thus, she has not shown that any relinquishment or change in her position was "directly caused by the overpayment or notice that such overpayment would be made...."<span class="Italic">Aguon,</span> 42 MSPR at 546-48<span class="Italic">; see also Gromo v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">Also, the appellant presented below no evidence regarding the amount of any financial losses she suffered or would suffer as a result of the collection of the overpayment. She did not explain why, or present any evidence that, the expenditures would not have been incurred in absence of the overpayment.

<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant failed to prove that the payment she made towards her nephew's law school tuition was directly caused by the overpayment and also failed to prove the tuition payment was irrevocable. The parties stipulated to the existence and amount of the overpayment and that the appellant was without fault in creating the overpayment. Recovery of an overpayment under the CSRS may be waived when the appellant demonstrates that she is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); <span class="Italic">Zucker v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 7 (2010) (involving a retirement under the Federal Employees' Retirement System); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401;. Recovery is against equity and good conscience when, in pertinent part, the annuitant can show that, because of the overpayment, she relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse.[4] <span class="Italic">Zucker</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 7; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(b)(2). An individual is generally considered to have changed positions for the worse when, as alleged here, she makes an expenditure that she otherwise would not have made. OPM's <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines on the Disposition of Civil Service Retirement Overpayments</span>, &#x00A7; E.5.a (hereinafter <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>). The appellant bears the burden of proving she is entitled to a waiver of the overpayment by substantial evidence. <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 544 (1989); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1407(b). Where an appellant argues for waiver due to detrimental reliance, the Board considers whether the expenditure was (1) directly caused by the overpayment or notice of payment (i.e., the loss or change would not have otherwise occurred), (2) detrimental to the overpayment recipient, (3) material (i.e., significant enough to warrant the waiver), and (4) irrevocable (i.e., the forfeited right cannot be recovered, the change of position cannot be reversed). <span class="Italic">Aguon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 546 (citing <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>); <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>, &#x00A7; E.1.3</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;If an overpayment recipient knew or suspected that she was receiving an overpayment, she is expected to set aside the overpayment pending recoupment. <span class="Italic">Zucker</span>, 114 M.S.P.R. 288, &#x00B6; 7. Absent exceptional circumstances, in instances when this "set-aside rule" applies, recovery is not against equity and good conscience. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. We do not reach the issue of whether the appellant was subject to the set-aside rule in the instant case because of our finding that the appellant has failed to prove detrimental reliance. However, we note that, contrary to the administrative judge's discussion of the set-aside rule, the rule can apply to overpayments that result from interim payments. <span class="Italic">Knox v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 107 M.S.P.R. 353, &#x00B6; 8 (2007) (applying the set-aside rule to overpayments resulting from interim payments begun 3 months too early).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As the appellant argues, the ability of the overpayment recipient to repay the debt is not relevant to a determination of whether to waive collection of an overpayment based on detrimental reliance. <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>, &#x00A7; E.2; <span class="Italic">see</span> 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(2). However, financial status is relevant to the determination of whether the overpayment directly caused the claimed expenditure. <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span>, &#x00A7; E.7. The appellant's mere statements are insufficient to prove causation. <span class="Italic">Id.; see Aguon</span>, 42 M.S.P.R. at 547-48 (finding statements by annuitant, that he "would not have incurred any specific obligations if he would have any idea that he would be charged" with an overpayment, and that his "children started college based upon the father's full income without any of the claimed payment deductions," without more, insufficient to establish causation). The appellant has not shown by substantial evidence that the overpayment was the direct cause of the tuition payment she made on behalf of her nephew. Her statements alone are not sufficient, and the only financial evidence she provided, her 2012 joint tax return, suggests that her income was such that she may have elected to contribute towards her nephew's tuition even in the absence of the overpayment. Therefore, the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the overpayment was the direct cause of the tuition expenditure.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Additionally, the appellant has not demonstrated that her tuition payment is irrevocable. The only evidence presented on this point, besides the appellant's own statements, is a statement from her nephew. <span class="Italic">See</span> PFR File, Tab 1 at 4 (containing the appellant's statement that "the university does not refund tuition payments three months into the semester"). However, noticeably absent from that statement is a claim that financial aid is no longer available to him, that he is unable to repay the appellant, or that he attempted to request that his financial aid be reinstated. <span class="Italic">See Cool</span>, 31 M.S.P.R. at 273-74 (the appellant's lost income from additional taxes was not irreparable).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The "set-aside rule," generally applied to Social Security benefits that the appellant was told by OPM should be set aside based on approval of a FERS annuity, was explained in <span class="Italic">Finch v. OPM</span>, AT-0845-16-0722-I-1 (NP 7/14/2022):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...When an annuitant knew or suspected that she was receiving an overpayment, however, OPM's set-aside rule applies, and the annuitant is expected to set aside the overpaid money pending recovery by OPM. <span class="Italic">See Boyd v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While we agree with the administrative judge's finding that OPM's October 14, 2015 interim pay letter placed the appellant on notice of the fact that her interim payments were only an estimate and that adjustment would be necessary in the event of an overpayment or underpayment, we find no basis to conclude that the appellant knew or suspected that she was receiving an overpayment so as to implicate OPM's set-aside rule, <span class="Italic">see Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has emphasized that "[t]he set-aside rule does not apply to individuals who do not know or suspect they are being overpaid. Those individuals do not know that the money does not belong to them, and may act in good faith when they fail to set aside the overpayments." <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 851 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">see Okonski v. Office of Personnel Management</span>, 63 M.S.P.R. 446, 453 (1994) (finding that the appellant could not reasonably have been expected to set aside money if he did not have a reason to know that it was an overpayment). As such, "[t]o place unknowing individuals in the same position as knowing individuals is an unreasonable interpretation of the guidelines, as it renders the language requiring knowledge superfluous." <span class="Italic">Boyd</span>, 851 F.3d at 1315; <span class="Italic">see Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.C.4 (stating that "[i]ndividuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments are obligated by the principles of equity and good conscience to set aside the amount overpaid pending recoupment by OPM" and that "an individual who accepted a payment which he/she suspected or knew to be erroneous...is obliged to set the overpaid money aside").</p>
<p class="Body-Text"><span class="Italic">Slater v. OPM</span>, 42 MSPR 510, 520-21 (1989), considered the tax consequences of overpayments and detrimental reliance:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant has stated that his total taxable income is decreasing, and that tax rates have been changing since he began receiving the overpayment. He contends that his overall tax burden therefore has been increased by his receipt of the overpayment. He alleges further that his payment of taxes on the overpayment constitutes detrimental reliance on that overpayment, that recovery of the overpayment would be unconscionable in light of these circumstances, and that he therefore is entitled to a waiver under the provisions of OPM's regulations and <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines.</span> He also argues, in the alternative, that he is entitled to a partial waiver of the overpayment--i.e., a waiver equal to the amount of his state and federal taxes on the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Assuming, for the purposes of this section, that the appellant's total tax burden has increased, we find that any such harmful result of the overpayment would not constitute detrimental reliance or meet the criteria described in 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(2) and in the part of the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> that concerns detrimental reliance, <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E, at 9-11. Those criteria do not apply to all situations in which an error or other circumstances cause a person's position to change for the worse. Instead, they apply to situations in which an action by one party misleads the other party and thereby induces the latter to act in a particular manner. <span class="Italic">See</span> 31 C.J.S. <span class="Italic">Equitable Estoppel</span> &#x00A7;&#x00A7; 1, 71. In this case, although OPM's actions may have put the appellant in a position in which he was required to pay more taxes than he otherwise would have been required to pay, it did not do so by misleading him or inducing him to change his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">With respect to the issue of unconscionability, we note that, in <span class="Italic">Aguon v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 42 M.S.P.R. 540, 549-50 (1989), the Board defined "unconscionable," for purposes of 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(3), as meaning "[g]oing beyond the bounds of what is customary or reasonable; ridiculously or unjustly excessive; inordinate," and as, "[i]n law, contrary to good conscience; inequitable." It also held that the unconscionability standard of this regulatory provision was a high one, and that a waiver under that standard would be granted only under exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also note that an argument similar to the one that has been made by the appellant was raised in <span class="Italic">Day v. Office of Personnel Management,</span> 873 F.2d 291, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1989). In that case, the plaintiff alleged that recovery of his annuity overpayment was improper partly because the recovery resulted in unexpected income tax liability. The court found that the recovery was not unconscionable or otherwise improper, and that waiver of the recovery therefore was not warranted. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> at 292-94. In <span id="Page_4425"></span>accordance with that decision, and in accordance with the definition of "unconscionable" stated above, we find that the appellant in the case now before the Board has not shown that the recovery of the entire amount of the annuity overpayment that accrued before the appellant began receiving social security benefits would be unconscionable. We therefore find that the appellant has not shown that he is entitled to either a full or a partial waiver of that amount under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(3).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Detrimental reliance was rejected by the Federal Circuit as a basis for waiver of an overpayment that occurred through no fault of the appellant in <span class="Italic">Kopp v. OPM</span> 456 Fed. Appx. 896, 98-99 (Fed. Cir. 2011 NP):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kopp has not questioned the existence of the overpayment, and OPM has determined that Mr. Kopp was not at fault in causing or contributing to the overpayment. Therefore, the only issue in this case is whether the repayment should be waived because recovery of the repayment would be against "equity and good conscience." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b). OPM has provided by regulation that recovery of an overpayment is against equity and good conscience if</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;It would cause financial hardship to the person from whom it is sought;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;The recipient of the overpayment can show...that due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment either he/she has relinquished a valuable right or changed positions for the worse; or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(3)&#x2003;Recovery could be unconscionable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kopp argues that requiring him to make the repayment would cause him financial hardship. The Board properly considered Mr. Kopp's financial situation as described in his financial resources questionnaire. It followed the <span class="Italic">Policy Guidelines on the Disposition of Overpayments under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System</span> in finding that, after considering Mr. Kopp's household income and expenses, he had enough income and liquid assets to refund the overpayment according to OPM's proposed schedule without suffering financial hardship. That finding, based on OPM's analysis of Mr. Kopp's financial information, is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kopp next argues that the Board erred by not considering the timeline of the overpayment. He argues that during the 20 months in which he was receiving the overpayment he made financial plans that were not reversible and thus detrimentally relied on the overpayment. The Board, however, considered that argument and found that Mr. Kopp did not sustain his burden of showing a causal link between the overpayment and his decision to move from Texas to North Carolina and incur more debt. The Board was also unpersuaded by Mr. Kopp's claim that the overpayment led him to make irreversible financial commitments; in that regard, the Board noted that to the extent Mr. Kopp used the overpayment to fund the purchase of a house in North Carolina, he retained ownership of the house, an asset that could be used to facilitate the repayment. In light of Mr. Kopp's failure to provide evidentiary support for his claim of detrimental reliance, we conclude that the Board's findings on that issue were supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Mr. Kopp notes that the FAA's mistake in offering him a job when he was over 60 years old and classifying him as a new hire, rather than as a returning annuitant, contributed to the overpayment. While it is true that Mr. Kopp was not at fault for the overpayment, simply being without fault does not entitle Mr. Kopp to retain the overpayment. The applicable statute and regulations make clear that, in addition to showing that he is without fault, an individual seeking a waiver of the repayment obligation must show that recovery "would be against equity and good conscience." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8346(b); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1401-1404. Moreover, even assuming that Mr. Kopp relied on the representations regarding his classification as an inducement to accept reemployment in 2005, any such reliance does not serve to entitle him to benefits that were not authorized by statute. <span class="Italic">See Office of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond,</span> 496 U.S. 414, 416 (1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, Mr. Kopp argues that rejecting his request for a waiver of overpayment would be unconscionable in light of a variety of health issues he suffered prior to his separation from service in 2008. Mr. Kopp did not provide the Board with medical records documenting those conditions, and he has not explained how those conditions relate to his request for a waiver of the repayment requirement. The Board therefore properly rejected that contention.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">But the Federal Circuit found detrimental reliance and justification for waiver of an alleged overpayment in an appeal involving a complex domestic relations situation that required resolution in civil courts of entitlement to the decedent employee's retirement proceeds, <span class="Italic">King v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">We next turn to the Board's determination that recovery of the overpayment from Kathryn would not be "against equity and good conscience."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">B.&#x2003;Detrimental Reliance</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Administrative Judge expressly rejected Kathryn's detrimental reliance arguments, stating that there was "no evidence that [Kathryn] changed positions or relinquished a valuable right based on either the incorrect payment or OPM's notice that payments would be made." The Board chose not to address the Administrative Judge's findings on detrimental reliance, but it fully considered the March 24, 2009, and October 19, 2010, decisions and found that "the administrative judge made no error in law or regulation that affects the outcome." We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kathryn contends that the Administrative Judge and the Board overlooked record evidence establishing that she changed positions for the worse because, had she not received the survivor annuity funds, she would not have set aside and transferred those monies to Diana. Kathryn maintains that the transfers to Diana were material and irrevocable under the settlement agreements, and that she presented substantial evidence that after receiving the survivor annuity funds, she detrimentally relied on the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that detrimental reliance is not applicable because Kathryn was "on notice" that "OPM might retract [the survivor annuity funds] and require her to repay." OPM maintains that because Kathryn acknowledged in the 2004 Settlement Agreement that she was not Don's wife, the transfer of funds to Diana was caused by Kathryn's own uninformed decision, not the overpayment from OPM. OPM also presents a secondary argument that Kathryn's change in position is not irrevocable because she still has the opportunity to pursue legal action in state court to recover the annuity payments from Diana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish detrimental reliance of an overpayment, the recipient must show that "due to the notice that such payment would be made or because of the incorrect payment he or she either has relinquished a valuable right or has changed positions for the worse." 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 845.303(b). The financial circumstances of the recipient--i.e., the ability to repay the overpayment debt--are not relevant to a detrimental reliance <span id="Page_4426"></span>determination. <span class="Italic">See id</span>.; 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403(a)(2). In evaluating detrimental reliance claims, the Board has applied criteria from section I.E.3 of the <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span>. OPM advises that waiver is justified when the change in position or loss of a valuable rights is:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a)&#x2003;directly caused by the overpayment or notice that such payment would be made (i.e., loss or change would not have otherwise occurred);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b)&#x2003;detrimental to the overpayment recipient;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c)&#x2003;material (i.e., significant enough to warrant the waiver); and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">d)&#x2003;irrevocable (i.e., the forfeited right cannot be recovered, the change in position cannot be reversed).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.3; <span class="Italic">see also Hunter</span>, 109 M.S.P.R. at 519 (citing <span class="Italic">Alexander v. Office of Pers. Mgmt</span>., 58 M.S.P.R. 358, 364&#8722;65 (1993)). Contrary to the Board's determination that detrimental reliance was not supported by substantial evidence, the record evidence demonstrates substantial evidence supporting each element of detrimental reliance and that waiver of recovery for the annuity overpayment is warranted.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">1.&#x2003;Change in Position for the Worse</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kathryn has demonstrated that receipt of the overpayment was detrimental because, without a finding of waiver, Kathryn would be in a worse financial position than if she had never accepted the survivor annuity funds. The record bears out her net loss:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00B7; From May 2004 until late February 2007, OPM paid Kathryn $41,939.13 in survivor annuity funds.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00B7; Pursuant to a court decree and settlement agreement requiring Kathryn to transfer to Diana any annuity funds or return them to OPM, Kathryn paid Diana $33,563.94 of the $41,939.13.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">&#x00B7; OPM now seeks to recover the full $41,939.13 from Kathryn without taking into account the funds she remitted to Diana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">If Kathryn were required to return the full amount of survivor annuity funds to OPM, she would suffer a net loss of $33,563.94. The record on this point is undisputed. Because returning the annuity funds to OPM would ultimately place Kathryn in a worse financial position than if she had never received the funds, the first element of detrimental reliance is supported by substantial evidence.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">2.&#x2003;Causation</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Kathryn argues that her change in position was directly caused by the overpayment because, if not for the overpayment, she would not have transferred any money to Diana. Kathryn explains that the transfer of funds to Diana was an acknowledgement that she might have received Don's retirement benefits in error, and she relinquished those benefits to the individual ultimately named as the lawful beneficiary by the Montana court. Under this theory, Kathryn's changed position was directly caused by the overpayment; that is, had Kathryn not received the OPM funds, she would not have assumed an obligation under the 2004 Settlement Agreement and the 2005 decree from the Montana court, and remitted the $33,563.94 to Diana.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">OPM asserts that the transfer to Diana represents payment of debts or obligations arising from the 2004 or 2008 Settlement Agreements. OPM contends that Kathryn transferred the funds because she believed she was obligated to pay off an outstanding debt as consideration to end of the litigation and not as a result of the overpayment or notice thereof. Hence, OPM reasons that because payment of existing debts or obligations is not detrimental, Kathryn failed to satisfy the elements of detrimental reliance. The Board, while not expressly analyzing a theory of detrimental reliance, agreed with OPM that Kathryn's transfer to Diana should be viewed as payments meant to settle debts arising from the litigation in the Montana court. We find the Board's reasoning erroneous.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record before us is unclear as to why Kathryn transferred the overpayment to Diana, but there is no dispute that such a transfer did occur. Under the correct legal framework, Kathryn needed only to show that it was <span class="Italic">reasonable to conclude</span>, based on the timeline and record evidence, that the funds transferred to Diana were the overpayment funds she received from OPM.[7] <span class="Italic">Crawford v. Dep't of the Army</span>, 718 F.3d 1361, 1365 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("Substantial evidence is 'such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.'") (internal citation omitted).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[7]&#x2003;The <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span> advise that proof of detrimental reliance, including whether the overpayment directly caused the recipient to change positions for the worse, should be provided in the form of "facts, evidence, and reasonable explanations supporting [the recipient's] assertions." <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.7.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find Kathryn's explanation for the transfer of funds to Diana to be reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. On April 10, 2008, Kathryn sent OPM documentation illustrating that she transferred funds representing Don's retirement benefits pursuant to court order. She reiterated this position in a follow up letter to OPM, in which Kathryn stated that "payment of the full amount due [of overpaid survivor benefits] had already been remitted to Diana King." Kathryn's 2008 correspondence with OPM is consistent with the timeline of events, language of the settlement agreements, tax filings, and modest income levels,[8] indicating that the overpayment was the direct cause of her loss.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[8]&#x2003;Kathryn represents to this court that the monetary transfer to Diana was "more than Kathryn's annual income for each of the years 2005 and 2006." While detrimental reliance does not account for the recipient's financial circumstances, the comparison between Kathryn's annual income and the amount transferred to Diana bears upon the reasonableness of her contention that the change in position was directly caused by the overpayment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">3.&#x2003;Materiality</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We also agree with Kathryn that the transfer of funds to Diana was material. Kathryn's limited financial resources are illustrated in her individual tax returns. From the years 2005 through 2007, her adjusted gross annual income never exceeded $22,000, yet during this period she remitted to Diana funds that exceeded her annual income. Because OPM does not contest that the transfer of funds to Diana was material, we find that Kathryn has satisfied the third element of detrimental reliance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">4.&#x2003;Irrevocability</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As with the first three elements of detrimental reliance, the Board did not analyze whether Kathryn's change in position was irrevocable. OPM argues to the court that, even if there was a change in position, Kathryn is not entitled to a waiver because she can pursue necessary relief in the Montana court by suing Diana for recovery of the transferred funds. Kathryn argues that her change in position is irrevocable because the Montana court entered a final judgment and dismissed the earlier litigation with prejudice (i.e., she is foreclosed from seeking relief from Diana).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Under the <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span>, an irrevocable position is a "change in position [that] cannot be reversed." <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span> &#x00A7; I.E.3. OPM claims that Kathryn's loss can be reversed through additional litigation between Kathryn and Diana. We disagree.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case involves two women with a shared, extensive litigation history. After years of disputing the allocation of Don's assets and sorting claims as to which woman qualified as the lawful widow, the 2008 Settlement Agreement fully settled all claims. Pursuant to Kathryn and Diana's joint stipulation, the state court dismissed the action with prejudice. At oral argument, the parties acknowledged that, in order for Kathryn to seek the relief proposed by OPM, she would have to move under Rule 60(b) to set aside the settlement agreements and reopen the litigation. <span class="Italic">See</span> Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We have considered the uncertainty that would accompany an attempt to obtain relief under Rule 60(b) under the circumstances and conclude that the transfer of funds is irreversible for purpose of detrimental reliance. It is improbable that the Montana court would grant a request to reopen the settled case. In addition, the parties would be encumbered with the burden and cost of litigating an issue that is unlikely to yield actual relief. The dismissal of the Montana action with prejudice and the execution of a settlement agreement intended to end all litigation between Kathryn and Diana render Kathryn's change in position irreversible. Having established that the transferred survivor annuity funds cannot feasibly be recovered from Diana, Kathryn has satisfied the fourth detrimental reliance element.</p>
<p class="Body-Text-c">* * *</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The record before this Court demonstrates substantial evidence that Kathryn is entitled to a waiver of recovery of the overpayment under 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 831.1403 and the four criteria enumerated in the <span class="Italic">OPM Overpayment Guidelines</span>. Because the Board failed to address the substantial evidence demonstrating that recovery of the overpayment to Kathryn was against equity and good conscience, we <span class="Italic">reverse</span>.</p>
