<h4 class="h4" id="sec12-87"><span class="space">3.</span> Alteration of Work Schedule, Worksite; Telework</h4>
<p class="Body-Text">If an employee can perform the essential duties of his job (a sheetmetal worker) on a restructured schedule necessitated by a physical disability, and the agency fails to demonstrate that the restructuring of the work schedule would cause an undue hardship (although some flexibility is shown to be helpful to the agency), the agency commits disability discrimination and a prohibited personnel practice in violation of 5 USC 2302(b)(1)(D) by failing to accommodate the employee and, instead, taking adverse action. <span class="Italic">Roberts v. Dept. of Navy</span>, 5 MSPR 387, 389-390, 5 MSPB 403 (1981) (reversing removal of a sheet metal mechanic for a physical disability caused by rhinitis; evidence indicated that the agency had granted the necessary accommodations of restructured schedules to other employees). An open-ended, flexible, or maxiflex schedule may be a reasonable accommodation based on a case-by-case factual inquiry. <span class="Italic">Solomon v. Vilsack</span>, 763 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2014). An agency provided insufficient accommodation and improperly suspended a blind employee who had a tardiness problem resulting from his dependence on public transportation. The agency should have attempted to modify the employee's work schedule, allowed a liberal leave policy or LWOP, or permitted the employee to change his shift to facilitate the use of public transportation. <span class="Italic">Ross v. Dept. of Commerce</span>, 10 MSPR 454, 456 (1982); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Wilson v. Dept. of Labor</span>, 20 MSPR 391, 393 (1984) (agency offered the appellant the reasonable accommodation of rest breaks; the employee unreasonably rejected the accommodation by seeking payment for 8 hours of work when, following rest breaks, the employee would work only 5 1/2 hours). <span class="Italic">But</span> <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 606, 610 (1989) (<span class="Italic">dictum</span> in decision not resolving disability claim that "an agency is not required to accommodate an employee's transportation problems").</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As to the effect of a medical condition on poor performance, the Board acquiesced in an EEOC decision that an agency failed to properly accommodate an epileptic employee by permitting him a period of time to perform his duties after overmedication had ceased and drug side effects had dissipated. <span class="Italic">Dickson v. USDA</span>, 27 MSPR 284, 286, EEOC 03830002 (1985) (removal of a public information specialist for poor performance); <span class="Italic">see</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch v. Dept. of Educ.</span>, 31 MSPR 519, 528 (Spec. Pan. 1986) (agency accommodation through the liberal grant of leave to deal with medications and epilepsy); <span class="Italic">cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Bond v. Dept. of Energy</span>, 82 MSPR 534, 542-43 &#x00B6; 23 (1999) (agency accommodated an employee by offering the appellant LWOP when he could not stay awake; open-ended "latitude" to the appellant in leave and attendance matters was an unduly burdensome accommodation (citing <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Dept. of Army</span>, 73 MSPR 619, 628-29 (1997)); the potential side effects of medication did not establish the appellant as a disabled individual when the physician's testimony did not link the side effects with the appellant and the literature accompanying the medication suggested a small incidence of those effects among users of the medication).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Work schedules need not always be altered when absences are unpredictable and the employer cannot adjust schedules of other individuals to fill in for the appellant. In <span class="Italic">Jackson v. VA</span>, 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994), involving a housekeeping aide at a facility hospital, the court declined to require a modified schedule:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Jackson sought the following accommodations: when he receives his bi-weekly treatment for arthritis, the VA could either schedule a regular off day or delay the start of Mr. Jackson's shift. In the event of a flare-up due to his condition, Jackson could swap off days with other employees, delay his shift start time, or defer more physically demanding and less time sensitive job duties until the next day.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Such accommodations do not address the heart of the problem: the unpredictable nature of Jackson's absences. There is no way to accommodate this aspect of his absences. Requiring the VA to accommodate such absences would place upon the agency the burden of making last-minute provisions for Jackson's work to be done by someone else. Such a requirement would place an undue hardship on the agency....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">[T]he issue here is not whether absences in excess of allotted leave are subject to accommodation. The VA concedes Jackson only used time allotted to him. Nor does the VA dispute that five of Jackson's six absences were disability related. Rather, the issue is whether the number of sporadic, unscheduled absences within the first few months of temporary employment can be reasonably accommodated. Under the circumstances of this case, there was no reasonable accommodation for Jackson's numerous unpredictable absences in the first few months of work as a temporary employee....</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The inability of an employee, a Border Patrol officer, to work a graveyard shift and substantial overtime placed him in a position of not being able to perform the essential functions of his position, leading the Board to sustain removal for physical inability to perform the job in <span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 116 MSPR 627, 628-34 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 2-14, 2011 MSPB 75 (2011) (on EEOC review, <span class="Italic">Petitioner v.

Pan. 2014), decided by the Special Panel,<span class="Italic"> Alvara v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 613, 2014 MSPB 77 (Spec. Pan. 2014)). The end result was that the Special Panel determined that Alvara had a disability, sleep apnea, and that the accommodation he requested, avoidance of shift swaps, was reasonable, in accordance with EEOC interpretation of the Rehabilitation Act, and not contrary to civil service law, rule, or regulation. We take two of the decisions--that of the EEOC and that of the Special Panel, and excerpt them below. The Special Panel decision summarizes both the MSPB and EEOC proceedings.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">As for the EEOC, <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Secretary DHS</span>, EEOC 0320110053 (July 10, 2014), the lynchpin of the Special Panel decision in <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, <span class="Italic">post</span>, established the Commission's view of the law concerning propriety of accommodation of work schedules, including shift assignments:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner worked as a Customs and Border Protection Officer at the Port of El Paso, Texas. This facility employed about 700 such officers to monitor, at all times, four bridges connecting the United States and Mexico. The officers rotated morning, afternoon, and evening shifts, and could swap shifts with each other if approved by their supervisors. Female officers who were pregnant or breastfeeding were exempt from working the evening shift for up to two years per child.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In February 2007, Petitioner informed the Agency that he suffered from sleep apnea and asked to modify his work schedule so he could get consistent sleep each night. Specifically, he requested to work daytime shifts, rather than the "graveyard" shift from 12:00 <small>A.M</small>. to 8:00 <small>A.M</small>. At first, the Agency accommodated his request, by informally placing him on light duty and did not assign him to the graveyard shift.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">But then in 2008, a new director of field operations questioned why this facility had so many employees not performing their full range of duties, and whether some of these employees ought to return to full duty. So in March 2008, the Agency presented Petitioner with four options: (1) return to full duty; (2) apply for disability retirement; (3) resign, or (4) request a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In response, he asked for several possible reasonable accommodations:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--A modified work schedule that would allow him to get nocturnal sleep each night, such as scheduling him to 12-hour shifts (6:00 <small>A.M</small>.-6:00 <small>P.M.</small>; 8:00 <small>A.M.</small>-8:00 <small>P.M.</small>; 10:00 <small>A.M.</small>-10:00 <small>P.M.</small>);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3487"></span>--Reassignment to another division that did not have graveyard shifts.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In April 2009, the Agency determined that Petitioner was an individual with a disability, whose sleep apnea substantially limited him in the major life activity of sleeping. But the Agency found that he was not qualified for his current position, a Customs Border and Protection Officer, because he could not perform the "essential functions" of rotating his shifts and performing "substantial" amounts of overtime. Therefore, he was not entitled to the accommodation of a modified work schedule in his current position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, the Agency searched for a vacant-funded position within the local commuting area to reassign Petitioner, but could not find any. Consequently, it stopped processing his reasonable accommodation request in September 2009, and removed him, effective January 7, 2010.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 26, 2010, Petitioner challenged the Agency's decision by filing a "mixed case appeal" to the MSPB.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Merit Systems Protection Board</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In a mixed case, a federal employee alleges that an agency personnel action appealable to the MSPB was based on unlawful discrimination otherwise subject to EEOC jurisdiction. In these cases, the employee must choose whether to pursue a "mixed case complaint" through the federal sector EEO process administered by EEOC, or a "mixed case appeal" subject to MSPB jurisdiction in the first instance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, Petitioner filed a "mixed case appeal." A "mixed case appeal" is an appeal filed directly with the MSPB that alleges that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, genetic information, or reprisal. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302(a)(2). Appealable agency actions include removals. <span class="Italic">See, e.g.,</span> Equal Employment Opportunity Management Directive for 29 C.F.R. Part 1614 (EEO-MD-110), Chapter 4: Procedures for Related Processes, Appendix I: Appealable Actions--5 C.F.R. (rev. Nov. 9, 1999).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In his mixed case appeal, Petitioner alleged, among other things, that the Agency discriminated against him on the basis of disability (sleep apnea) when it denied him a reasonable accommodation, and subjected him to reprisal for prior EEO activity when it removed him for requesting reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A hearing was held before an MSPB Administrative Judge (AJ). The AJ issued an initial decision, determining, in relevant part, that Petitioner was an individual with a disability, under the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, because the parties had stipulated that Petitioner satisfied the definition of an individual with a disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the AJ found that Petitioner was not qualified for his current position as a Customs and Border Protection Officer. The AJ reasoned that the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer included working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime. For support, the AJ referenced hearing testimony from management officials and cited <span class="Italic">Bouffard v. Dep't of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065257 (Jan. 16, 2008), in which the Commission found that the ability to work rotational shifts and overtime were essential functions of a seasonal, part-time Customs and Border Protection Officer. Here, because Petitioner's sleep apnea prevented him from working all rotational shifts and unlimited overtime, he could not perform the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer, and was not entitled to a modified work schedule as an accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Instead, the AJ found that Petitioner was entitled to reassignment as an accommodation, and determined that the Agency had attempted to reassign Petitioner to a vacant-funded position, but none were available. Therefore, the AJ concluded that the Agency did not discriminate against Petitioner on the basis of disability when it did not provide him with a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Next, the AJ found that Petitioner failed to show that the Agency retaliated against him because he did not establish a nexus between his removal and requests for reasonable accommodation. The MSPB AJ ultimately affirmed the Agency's removal of Petitioner.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner sought review of the MSPB AJ's decision by the full Merit Systems Protection Board. He argued that the AJ erred in finding that the ability to work the graveyard shift and substantial overtime were essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer. He also argued that the Agency failed to show that providing a modified work schedule would pose an undue hardship, since (1) the Agency had previously exempted him from working the graveyard shift with no apparent adverse effect on the Agency's mission, and (2) the Agency exempted female officers, who recently gave birth, from working the graveyard shift.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board upheld the MSPB AJ's decision, finding that the AJ had properly determined that Petitioner could not perform the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer. The Board deferred to the EEOC's determination in Bouffard that the ability to work rotational shifts and overtime were essential functions of this job. The Board found it unnecessary to address whether providing a modified work schedule would pose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Petitioner then filed this petition with the Commission, maintaining that the Board erred in finding no discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Analysis and Findings</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Standard of Review</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">EEOC Regulations provide that the Commission has jurisdiction over mixed case appeals on which the MSPB has issued a decision that makes determinations on allegations of discrimination. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Upon review, the Commission must determine whether the decision of the MSPB with respect to the allegation of discrimination constitutes a correct interpretation of any applicable law, rule, regulation or policy directive, and is supported by the evidence in the record as a whole. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.305(c).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Reasonable Accommodation</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">a.&#x2003;Individual With a Disability</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the parties have stipulated that Petitioner satisfies the definition of an "individual with a disability. Specifically, in its "Responses to Requests for Admissions," the Agency stated: "The Agency determined Appellant had substantiated his disability.... However, the Agency determined that there was no reasonable accommodation that would allow Appellant to perform the essential functions of a [Customs Border and Protection Officer]."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We therefore move on to determine whether Petitioner is a "qualified" individual with a disability, who can perform the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">b.&#x2003;Qualified Individual With a Disability</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">A qualified individual with a disability is an "individual with a disability who satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment positions such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">i.&#x2003;Essential Functions v. Time for Performing Essential Functions</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Essential functions are the duties of a job, that is, the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position. <span class="Italic">Ta v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613 (Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There is a strong temptation among agencies to frame attendance, or other measures of the time at which functions must be performed, as essential functions. This represents a flawed understanding of the requirements and structure of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Performing certain job functions sometimes requires a person's presence at the worksite. But the fact that attendance can be a condition precedent to performing a function does not render it a job function in and of itself. Job functions are the duties that a person must perform or the outcomes that must be achieved by the person in the job. Attendance and timing are neither duties nor outcomes by themselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Rather, attendance and timing are methods, albeit important ones, by which a person accomplishes the essential functions of a job. And, as with other methods by which a function is accomplished (e.g. lifting as a method of transporting packages or use of certain software as a method of transcribing notes), attendance and timing are subject to the law's obligation to provide a reasonable accommodation that does not impose an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In fact, considering attendance as an essential job function as opposed to a method by which essential functions are accomplished, leads to the perverse and unacceptable conclusion that any employee with disability-related absences is an unqualified individual and, therefore, unable to claim the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This does not mean, however, that attendance and timing are irrelevant or unimportant to a Rehabilitation Act claim. To the contrary, as we have recognized in our past guidance, attendance and timing can be crucial factors in determining whether a request for accommodation imposes an undue hardship on the finances or operations of an agency:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">For certain positions, the time during which an essential function is performed may be critical. This could affect whether an employer can grant a request to modify an employee's schedule. Employers should carefully assess whether modifying the hours could significantly disrupt their operations--that is, cause undue <span id="Page_3488"></span>hardship--or whether the essential functions may be performed at different times with little or no impact on the operations or the ability of other employees to perform their jobs. EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC Notice 915.002, Question 22 (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Similarly, our precedential federal sector cases have recognized that the proper way to determine whether an individual is qualified for a job is to ask whether that person can perform the essential functions of the job when at work. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2, 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950539 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal</span> <span class="Italic">Serv</span>., EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990). Once that determination is made, the analysis then moves to whether an accommodation (if needed) that would enable the person to perform those functions when at work (such as leave or a modified schedule) imposes an undue hardship on the finances or operation of the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> did not adhere to our Enforcement Guidance and precedential federal sector cases in its analysis of the essential functions of a part-time Customs and Border Protection Officer, we find that it was wrongly decided on that point. We therefore overturn that portion of the decision. As the MSPB relied upon Bouffard in finding that the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer include working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime, we must conclude that its analysis was in error and conclude that its decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of our applicable policy directives and Enforcement Guidance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">ii.&#x2003;Essential Functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For a Customs and Border Protection Officer, the essential functions may include duties such as inspecting travelers; examining applicants for immigration privileges and benefits; seizing suspect property; and detaining people engaging in suspicious activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, there is no question that Petitioner can perform such duties when he is at work. Therefore, we find that Petitioner is a qualified individual with a disability, who can perform the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Because Complainant is qualified and can perform the fundamental job duties of a Customs and Border Protection Officer, the appropriate question is whether the Agency had a duty to accommodate his sleep apnea by allowing his absence from the graveyard shift. The Agency must therefore establish that modifying Petitioner's work hours would significantly disrupt the facility's operations--that is, cause undue hardship.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">c.&#x2003;Undue Hardship</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer. Generalized conclusions will not suffice to support a claim of undue hardship. Instead, undue hardship must be based on an individualized assessment of current circumstances that show that a specific reasonable accommodation would cause significant difficulty or expense. A determination of undue hardship should be based on several factors, including:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the nature and cost of the accommodation needed;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the overall financial resources of the facility making the reasonable accommodation; the number of persons employed at this facility; the effect on expenses and resources of the facility;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the overall financial resources, size, number of employees, and type and location of facilities of the employer (if the facility involved in the reasonable accommodation is part of a larger entity);</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the type of operation of the employer, including the structure and functions of the workforce, the geographic separateness, and the administrative or fiscal relationship of the facility involved in making the accommodation to the employer;</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">--the impact of the accommodation on the operation of the facility.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although the MSPB did not make a finding on undue hardship, the Commission determines that the record is adequately developed to make a finding on this issue. Here, the facility employed about 700 Customs and Border Protection Officers to monitor, at all times, four bridges connecting the United States and Mexico. It is undisputed that the Agency permitted officers at this facility to swap shifts with each other, and exempted female officers, who were pregnant or breastfeeding, from working the graveyard shift for up to two years per child.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on these facts, we find that allowing Petitioner, as one of 700 officers, to work between 6:00 <small>A.M.</small> and midnight would not cause an undue hardship at this particular facility. Given that the Agency had previously allowed Petitioner to modify his work schedule for about one and a half years without significantly disrupting the facility's operations, and the flexibility with which other officers could adjust their work schedules for various reasons, such as training, leave, an unexpected emergency, pregnancy, and breast-feeding, we find no compelling evidence to suggest that modifying Petitioner's hours would significantly disrupt the facility's operations or the ability of the hundreds of other officers to perform their jobs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Nor are we convinced by the generalized assertions of Agency officials, who argued that the Agency had never before permanently modified the work schedule of a Customs and Border Protection Officer (although they conceded that there have been "temporary" modifications of substantial duration), and that permitting such a permanent modification would lower morale.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our Enforcement Guidance makes it clear that an employer cannot claim undue hardship "based on the fact that provision of a reasonable accommodation might have a negative impact on the morale of other employees." EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). Moreover, our Enforcement Guidance commands that, absent undue hardship, an employer must provide a modified schedule when required as a reasonable accommodation, "even if it does not provide such schedules for other employees." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at Question 22.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">For all these reasons, we determine that the Agency failed to show that modifying Petitioner's work schedule would cause undue hardship. Therefore, we conclude that the Agency erred in (1) denying Petitioner's reasonable accommodation request to work between the hours of 6:00 <small>A.M</small>. and midnight, and (2) removing him.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Conclusion</span> </p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon a thorough review of the record, it is the decision of the Commission to DIFFER with the final order of the MSPB finding no discrimination. The Commission finds that the MSPB's final order constitutes an incorrect interpretation of the laws, rules, regulations, and policies governing this matter and is not supported by the evidence in the record as a whole.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The Special Panel's decision of September 29, 2014, <span class="Italic">Alvara v. DHS</span>, 121 MSPR 613, 617-32 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 4-46, 2014 MSPB 77 (Spec. Pan. 2014) (MSPB Vice Chairman Wagner dissenting), determined that under Rehabilitation Act, the shift adjustment sought by Alvara was a valid accommodation, that the accommodation was improperly denied, and that Alvara would be reinstated, with a finding of disability discrimination:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based upon our review of the record, the Special Panel finds that the Commission did not rely on any civil service law, rule, regulation, and/or policy guidance in <span class="Italic">Petitioner v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Petition No. 0320110053, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810 (E.E.O.C. July 10, 2014). The Commission relied on the following in rendering its decision: Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Rehabilitation Act), as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>; EEOC regulations such as 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.302, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.303, and 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.305; EEOC federal sector case law; and its own enforcement guidance,[1] specifically the EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). The Commission's decision does not rely on or cite to any civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy. Thus, the Commission did not incorrectly interpret any civil service law, rule, or regulation in its decision. In certifying this case, the Board failed to cite to a single specific civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive that the Commission incorrectly interpreted. We find that the Commission's decision was not so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. Furthermore, the Special Panel has determined that the Commission's decision does not constitute an incorrect interpretation of any provision of any civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directive. Accordingly, the Special Panel defers to the Commission and adopts its decision in the matter as our own.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[1]&#x2003;The EEOC has delegated the authority to issue appellate decisions in federal sector discrimination cases under 29 C.F.R.

<p class="Block-Quote1">II.&#x2003;BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On January 26, 2010, the appellant, Reynaldo Alvara, filed a mixed case MSPB appeal. The appeal contested the appellant's removal from his position as a Customs and Border Protection Officer (CBPO) with the Department of Homeland Security, United States Customs and Border <span id="Page_3489"></span>Protection (agency), for physical inability to meet the conditions of his employment due to a medical condition. Specifically, the agency found that the appellant could not perform all of the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant suffers from sleep apnea, a permanent condition which requires him to get 8 hours of nocturnal sleep. Prior to his termination, the appellant requested that the agency provide him with certain reasonable accommodations. The appellant requested a modified work schedule that would allow him to get nocturnal sleep each night, such as scheduling him to 12-hour shifts (6:00 <small>A.M</small>. to 6:00 <small>P.M</small>.; 8:00 <small>A.M. </small>to 8:00 <small>P.M</small>.; 10:00 <small>A.M</small>. to 10:00 <small>P.M</small>.). This request would have exempted the appellant from the agency's "graveyard" or overnight shift--the midnight to 8:00 <small>A.M.</small> shift--and any overtime which would require him to work during those hours. In his MSPB appeal, the appellant asserted that the agency discriminated against him in violation of Section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, when it denied his request for accommodation, and retaliated against him for engaging in protected equal employment opportunity activity.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On December 1, 2010, the MSPB administrative judge affirmed the agency's removal for physical inability to meet the conditions of his employment due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">See Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, MSPB Docket No. DA-0752-10-0223-I-1, Initial Decision (ID) (Dec. 1, 2010). The administrative judge found that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability entitled to a reasonable accommodation under the Rehabilitation Act because he could not perform the essential functions of his CBPO position with or without accommodation. The ID relied heavily on <span class="Italic">Bouffard v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065257, 2008 WL 276452 (E.E.O.C. Jan. 16, 2008), in determining that the appellant was not qualified, i.e., an individual with a disability entitled to an accommodation, because he could not perform the essential functions of his position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, the complainant, a seasonal CBPO, alleged he was subjected to discrimination on the basis of his disability (severe gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett's Esophagus) when the agency denied his request for a set work schedule without overtime. <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120065257, 2008 WL 276452, at *1-*2. An EEOC administrative judge found for the Department of Homeland Security. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Upon review, the EEOC OFO found that complainant did not fall within the protections of the Rehabilitation Act because he was not qualified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Using the complainant's job description and an affidavit from the area port director, the OFO decision found that the agency established that the ability to work rotational shifts and the ability to work overtime were essential functions of the complainant's position. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. But because the complainant could not perform these essential functions, and because an agency is not required to eliminate essential functions as a reasonable accommodation, the OFO in <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> determined that the complainant was not qualified and was not entitled to relief.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, the MSPB administrative judge relied on <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> in finding that the "ability to work rotational shifts and overtime was an essential function of the appellant's CBPO position." In a footnote, the administrative judge also addressed whether the agency could present sufficient evidence that the requested reasonable accommodation was an undue hardship. The administrative judge stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Although I need not reach the issue of whether providing the appellant's requested accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the agency, in <span class="Italic">Cyr v. Michael Chertoff, Secretary, Department of Homeland Security</span>, EEOC Appeal # 01A43015 (July 13, 2005), the EEOC found that providing a permanent day shift to an Immigration Inspector would impose an undue hardship on the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On February 18, 2011, the appellant filed a petition for review of the administrative judge's initial decision with the Board. In his petition, the appellant argued that the administrative judge erred in finding that the ability to work the graveyard shift and substantial overtime are essential functions of his position and therefore that his inability to perform those shifts precludes him from being qualified. The appellant also argued that the agency failed to establish that his request for accommodation would pose an undue hardship for the agency.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On August 17, 2011, the Board affirmed, as modified, the administrative judge's initial decision. <span class="Italic">Alvara v. Department of Homeland Security</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 627 (2011). The Board also relied on the EEOC's decision in <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> in affirming the administrative judge's initial decision. In relying on <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, the Board opined: "We note that the Board generally defers to the EEOC on issues of substantive discrimination law unless the EEOC's decision rests on civil service law for its support or is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law." <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6; 8. The Board found:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Accordingly, because the <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> decision involves an issue of substantive discrimination law and is neither based on civil service law or is so unreasonable as to amount to a violation of civil service law, we will defer to the EEOC's determination that the agency is not required to accommodate a disabled CBPO by granting a request not to work rotational shifts and overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board also stated, "Because we agree with the administrative judge's findings, it is unnecessary to address the Agency's challenge to her alternative finding as to undue hardship, which is essentially dicta." <span class="Italic">See Alvara</span>, 116 M.S.P.R. 627, &#x00B6; 14.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On September 16, 2011, the appellant filed a petition to the EEOC seeking review of the Board's final order under 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(2).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On July 10, 2014, the Commission issued a decision in which the Commission differed with the Board's finding that the agency did not discriminate against the appellant on the basis of disability. In so ruling, the EEOC partially repudiated <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>. The EEOC reasoned: "Because <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> did not adhere to our Enforcement Guidance and precedential federal sector cases in its analysis of the essential functions of a part-time Customs and Border Protection Officer, we find that it was wrongly decided on that point. We therefore overturn that portion of the decision." Commission Decision, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *13. The Commission explained that, for purposes of the Rehabilitation Act, the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer may include such duties as inspecting travelers; examining applicants for immigration privileges and benefits; seizing suspect property; and detaining people engaging in suspicious activity. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission ruled that the appellant's requested accommodations sought to modify his schedule and attendance and therefore did not affect the essential functions of his position. The EEOC also reasoned that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[C]onsidering attendance as an essential job function as opposed to a method by which essential functions are accomplished, leads to the perverse and unacceptable conclusion that any employee with disability-related absences is an unqualified individual and, therefore, unable to claim the protections of the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *11. &#x00B6; 14</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission also determined that the agency did not establish that the requested reasonable accommodation would be an undue hardship. The EEOC held: "Based on these facts, we find that allowing Petitioner, as one of 700 officers, to work between 6:00 <small>A.M</small>. and midnight would not cause an undue hardship at this particular facility." <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *16. The Commission concluded that the agency erred when it: (1) denied petitioner's reasonable accommodation request to work between the hours of 6:00 <small>A.M</small>. and midnight; and (2) removed him. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Commission then referred the matter to the Board for further consideration pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(5)(B) because the EEOC's decision differed from the Board's decision. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *19.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board rejected the Commission's decision and certified this matter for the Special Panel. The Board recognized that "under the mixed case system governed by 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702, the Board generally must defer to the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law." <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 11. However, the Board reasoned:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The EEOC decision, to which we are asked to defer, is unreasonable both from a legal and a management/operational perspective. At its core, the EEOC decision fundamentally addresses not an interpretation of discrimination law, but rather an agency's ability to determine the essential functions of any given position, in this case, a law enforcement officer position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 8. In doing so, the Board reversed course from its original decision, in which it deferred to the EEOC's interpretation of the anti-discrimination statute. The Board concluded:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[A]s a matter of law the EEOC decision is based upon an incorrect interpretation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. In the alternative, we find that the evidence in the record does not support the EEOC decision, and that the EEOC decision is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. Thus, the Board cannot agree with the EEOC decision. We therefore REAFFIRM our prior decision. <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2); 5 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1201.162(a)(2).</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">IV.&#x2003;ANALYSIS</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's certification to the Special Panel lacked a specific and thoroughly analyzed explanation of how the Commission's decision incorrectly interprets a specific civil service law. The Board's certification also failed to adequately explain how the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record and is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. The dissent seeks to get around this flaw by explaining in more detail its view of the reasoning behind the Board's certification order. However, such after-the-fact justification by one member of the Board cannot save the Board's certification order.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">A.&#x2003;Civil Service Law</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span id="Page_3490"></span>Although the Board held that the Commission's decision constitutes an incorrect interpretation of civil service, law, rule or regulation, it never precisely identified its own interpretation of what constitutes a "civil service law, rule and regulation." Before moving forward with the analysis of the Board's decision it is important to set forth exactly what a civil service law, rule, or regulation is, especially in relation to the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act defines "civil service" as "consist[ing] of all appointive positions in the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of the Government of the United States, except positions in the uniformed services." 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2102. Title 5 of the United States Code outlines the government's organization and employees. However, Title 5 does not expressly define "civil service law." "Thus, the question whether civil service law includes employment discrimination laws which have wider application beyond government employment can be answered only after an examination of the statutory context and the underlying policies." <span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, 21 F.3d 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(i)-(v), discrimination laws are under the jurisdiction of the EEOC:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, in the case of any employee or applicant for employment who--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(A)&#x2003;has been affected by an action which the employee or applicant may appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board, and</p>
<p class="Block-Quote3">(B)&#x2003;alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by--</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(i)&#x2003;section 717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e-16),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(ii)&#x2003;section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206 (d)),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(iii)&#x2003;section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791),</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(iv)&#x2003;sections 12 and 15 of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 631, 633a), or</p>
<p class="Block-Quote4">(v)&#x2003;any rule, regulation, or policy directive prescribed under any provision of law described in clauses (i) through (iv) of this subparagraph, the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures under section 7701 of this title and this section.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(i)-(v). Under section 7702(b)(3)(B)(i), when the case is appealed to the Commission, it is the Commission's duty to decide whether the MSPB has incorrectly interpreted the provisions of discrimination law listed in subsections (a)(1)(B)(i)-(iv). By process of elimination, therefore, these authorities cannot be the "civil service laws, rules, or regulations" that are referred to in the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">King v. Lynch</span>, 21 F.3d 1084 (Fed. Cir. 1994), confirms this view. In <span class="Italic">King</span>, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management argued that the MSPB misinterpreted civil service law and regulation affecting personnel management and that the Board's decision would have a substantial impact on civil service law, rule, regulation, or policy directives. Specifically, the Director asserted that the MSPB erred in interpreting the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 794, and its implementing regulation 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1613.702. <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1088. The court stated:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Section 7702 of Title 5 sets forth the appeal procedures for cases where there is an alleged violation of certain discrimination laws. That section distinguishes between discrimination laws and civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Compare</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(b)(3)(B)(i) (referring to the discrimination laws set out in subsection (a)(1)(B)) <span class="Italic">with id</span>. &#x00A7; 7702(c)(2) (referring to "civil service laws, rules, regulations, and policy directives"). Cases in which certain unlawful discrimination is alleged, although initially decided by the MSPB, may at the appellant's option be reviewed administratively by the EEOC following an adverse MSPB decision. When that occurs, as in this case, &#x00A7; 7702(b) gives the EEOC the primary role in interpreting the pertinent discrimination law and regulation (in this case a regulation promulgated by the EEOC) and under &#x00A7; 7702(c) the MSPB has that role in interpreting "any civil service law, rule, or regulation." <span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(B) (requiring deference to the "respective expertise of the Board and [EEOC] "). The Rehabilitation Act is listed as one of the discrimination statutes subject to this procedure, <span class="Italic">see id.</span> &#x00A7; 7702(a)(1)(B)(iii), and thus is distinguished from civil service laws referred to in &#x00A7; 7702(c). <span class="Italic">King</span>, 21 F.3d at 1088.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The court concluded that the Rehabilitation Act and the other discrimination laws, although applicable to federal employers, have broader application and are not themselves civil service laws. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The court also reasoned that "[t]he Senate Report and statutory scheme for dealing with discrimination issues demonstrates that Congress intended that there be a consistent interpretation of these laws whether their alleged violation arises within or without the federal government." <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 states that civil service law should not abridge discrimination law. Title I of the Civil Service Reform Act, Section 2302(d), provides:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(d)&#x2003;This section shall not be construed to extinguish or lessen any effort to achieve equal employment opportunity through affirmative action or any right or remedy available to any employee or applicant for employment in the civil service under--</p>

<p class="Block-Quote3">(5)&#x2003;the provisions of any law, rule, or regulation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status or political affiliation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">See</span> 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 2302(d).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The statutory language, legislative history and case law recognize that interpretation of a civil service law, rule, or regulation does not encompass interpretation of statutes and regulations relating to employment discrimination. Thus, the Commission's decision did not misinterpret a civil service, law, rule, regulation, or policy directive when it relied strictly upon the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations and case law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B. The Commission Decision Did Not Constitute an Unreasonable Interpretation of Civil Service Law</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board interpreted the Commission's decision as encroaching on an agency's "management/operational perspective" and discretion to determine the tasks, duties and responsibilities of any given position, in this case, a law enforcement position. <span class="Italic">Alvara</span>, 121 M.S.P.R. 453, &#x00B6; 8. The Board misinterpreted the Commission's decision. The dissent argues that "[t]hus, we may reasonably interpret 'civil service law' in this context as encompassing the judicial and administrative decisions and legal principles that govern the operation of the federal civil service in addition to applicable statutory provisions." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 7. The dissent's interpretation would effectively result in any EEOC decision that conflicted with any part of an MSPB decision triggering Special Panel review of the merits. That interpretation is clearly contrary to the intent of the statute.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board's misinterpretation of the Commission's decision is illustrated by its citation to random statutes that pertain to law enforcement officers. The Board states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Under civil service law, CBPOs are classified as law enforcement officers. They are charged with the safety and security of the American people, protecting the country's borders from terrorism, intercepting the smuggling of humans, drugs and other contraband, preventing illegal migration and the entry of agricultural pests, and facilitating the flow of legitimate trade and travel. The special nature of these jobs is why law enforcement officers are treated differently from other civil servants in everything from essential functions to retirement calculations. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8331(2); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 8401(17) (definitions of "law enforcement officer" for retirement purposes under the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees' Retirement System, respectively); 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 3307 (providing that agencies may set a maximum age limit for an original appointment to law enforcement officer positions such as CBPOs).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 13. None of the statutes cited in the certification order pertains to the essential functions of a CBPO officer. The cited statutes are silent on "essential functions," and do not support the Board's belief that agencies enjoy unfettered discretion to identify "essential functions." Instead, two of the cited provisions relate to retirement for law enforcement officers and the third establishes a maximum age for hiring law enforcement officers.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board further misinterprets the Commission's decision when it states, "The EEOC now asks us to second guess the employing agency in what is an essential function of this position. We refuse to do so. To that end, we note that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not define the <span id="Page_3491"></span>term 'essential functions.'" <span class="Italic">Id</span>., &#x00B6; 11. The Board holds that the Commission's decision infringes upon the agency's right and authority to establish the terms and conditions of employment and to determine the essential functions of a position. The Board misreads the Commission's decision.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Federal agencies do enjoy wide discretion in assigning work, duties and responsibilities to personnel and in determining how agency operations will be conducted, in accordance with applicable employment discrimination laws. <span class="Italic">See, e.g</span>., 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106. The dissent argues that "5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7106 gives management exclusive authority, subject to undertaking permissive bargaining, with regard to assigning work, determining the personnel by which the agency operations shall be conducted, and taking disciplinary actions." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 16.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">However, nothing in the Commission's decision restricts or prohibits any agency's managerial and operational prerogatives or any agency's right to establish the terms and conditions of employment. The Board errs where it concludes that under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, management's evaluation of a position's "essential functions" is dispositive. Management can assign duties but cannot determine as a matter of law whether those duties are essential functions. The ADA[4] states:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">The term "qualified individual" means an individual who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires. For the purposes of this subchapter, consideration shall be given to the employer's judgment as to what functions of a job are essential, and if an employer has prepared a written description before advertising or interviewing applicants for the job, this description shall be considered evidence of the essential functions of the job.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;The Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 791 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, which applies to the federal government, was amended in 1992 to apply the standards in the ADA to complaints of discrimination by federal employees or applicants for employment. The standards set forth in the ADA and its implementing regulations have thus been incorporated into the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">Caver v. Department of Navy</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01994882, 2001 WL 1104094 (E.E.O.C. Sept. 7, 2001).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">42 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 12111(8). The inquiry required to define a position's "essential functions" under the Rehabilitation Act is to be performed by the finder of fact--not the employer. The employer's judgment as to what functions are essential is only one factor taken into consideration by the fact-finder who will ultimately determine the essential functions of a position. That fact-finder is the EEOC. The EEOC has final authority to determine what an "essential function" is--not the agency. Further, consistent with the authority granted to the EEOC by Congress, the EEOC has the authority to define the limits of "essential functions" in both regulation and guidance.[5]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[5]&#x2003;The dissent notes that the MSPB administrative judge relied on the EEOC's own regulations in determining that working overtime and a rotating shift were essential functions of the CPBO position. Reliance on the factors set forth in the regulations for determining essential functions would, indeed, have been both appropriate and acceptable if working overtime and a rotating shift could, in fact, be essential functions under the terms of the Rehabilitation Act. The EEOC has said in Enforcement Guidance, and reaffirmed in the case before us, that these are not functions in themselves. Therefore the essential function analysis was not proper in this case. The dissent goes further and says that the Enforcement Guidance that states this position is itself not consistent with the EEOC's regulations and should be disregarded by the Special Panel. This is just another attempt to have the Special Panel throw out the standards of <span class="Italic">Ignacio</span> and examine the issues in the case without the required "due deference" to the expertise of the EEOC in discrimination law and the MSPB in matters of civil service law.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Thus, the MSPB erred when it held that the Commission interfered with the agency's authority to determine the essential functions of the appellant's position. As explained further <span class="Italic">infra</span>, the Commission's decision did not repudiate the agency's judgment. Rather, it disagreed with the agency on the legal analysis required by the Rehabilitation Act when evaluating scheduling and work requirements. It corrected the agency's legal error of characterizing working rotating shifts and overtime (a method of performing the functions of a job) as essential functions of the CPBO position and held that if the agency believed that it could not provide a scheduling accommodation to the complainant it needed to show that such accommodations imposed an undue hardship on agency operations or finance.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In so doing, the Commission interpreted its own regulations, 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m); relied on its own federal sector case law, <span class="Italic">e.g</span>., <span class="Italic">Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 07A00004, 2001 WL 1218254 (E.E.O.C. Feb. 2, 2001); and used its own Enforcement Guidance, EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC Notice 915.002 (Oct. 17, 2002). <span class="Italic">See</span> Commission Decision, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *11-*12. The Commission also relied upon its own case law and Enforcement Guidance in finding that the agency failed to show that modifying the appellant's work schedule would cause an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *19. Thus, the Commission relied strictly on discrimination law, not civil service law, in resolving the issues in dispute in this case.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission's decision only relied upon the anti-discrimination statutes, EEOC regulations, EEOC case law, and EEOC enforcement guidance to render its decision. Whether an employee is able to perform the functions of a position and whether an agency considered a reasonable accommodation are clearly determinations under discrimination law, not civil service law. It is the EEOC, not the MSPB, that has primary authority to determine this issue, and the Special Panel is required to give the EEOC due deference. The EEOC did not infringe upon or incorrectly interpret civil service rules or regulations.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The dissent argues that the Commission's "categorical exclusion of certain terms and conditions of employment from being considered essential to the effective performance of the position is fundamentally at odds with the Board's jurisprudence concerning adverse actions based on physical inability to perform." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 12. The Commission's decision, however, is an interpretation of discrimination law--not the Board's jurisprudence concerning adverse actions based on physical inability to perform. In fact, the dissent's basic point, that the EEOC should not categorically exclude attendance issues from the definition of "essential functions," is in reality just a disagreement with the EEOC's interpretation of discrimination law. The Special Panel cannot give "due deference" to the EEOC on discrimination law and, at the same time, overturn that interpretation based only on the fact that the MSPB disagrees with it. There must be some explicit conflict with civil service law, which has not been shown.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">C.&#x2003;The Commission Decision Is Supported by the Record</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board failed to specifically explain and analyze how the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record. The Special Panel should not and will not guess what the Board means in holding that the Commission's decision is unsupported by the record.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">D.&#x2003;The EEOC's Decision Is Not Unreasonable</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board also failed to specifically explain how the EEOC decision was so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law, rule, or regulation. The dissent argues that "the EEOC's decision effectively eviscerates the authority of federal agencies, in the first instance, from ever establishing time and attendance requirements as essential terms and conditions of employment." Dissenting Opinion, &#x00B6; 25. The dissent's interpretation of the Commission's decision is not accurate. The Commission's decision does not say that attendance can never be an important term and condition of a position. In fact, the Commission's decision concludes that accommodations based on attendance are not required if the agency establishes that they pose an undue burden on its operations. The Special Panel finds that the Commission's position in this regard was reasonable.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This case is unique because the Commission's decision overturned its own legal precedent and a specific portion of <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>. The administrative judge and the Board relied heavily upon <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span> in their decisions. However, the Commission is well within its authority to overturn a decision rendered by the EEOC's OFO.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission relied upon the Rehabilitation Act, an anti-discrimination statute--not a civil service statute. The Commission relied upon its own case law and its own enforcement guidance in rendering its decision. In conducting its analysis of whether the appellant was entitled to a reasonable accommodation, the Commission reviewed <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>. The Commission determined that <span class="Italic">Bouffard</span>, or at least the portion heavily relied upon by the Board in finding that "the essential functions of a Customs and Border Protection Officer include working rotating shifts and significant amounts of overtime," was wrongly decided. Commission Decision, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *6. The Commission found that working substantial overtime and/or the graveyard shift were the methods by which an individual performed the job's essential functions, not the essential functions themselves. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">In fact, considering attendance as an essential job function as opposed to a method by which essential functions are accomplished, leads to the perverse and unacceptable conclusion that any employee with disability-related absences is an unqualified individual and, therefore, unable to claim the protections of the Rehabilitation Act. <span class="Italic">See e.g., Cottrell v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Appeal No. 07A0004 (Feb. 2. 2001); <span class="Italic">McCullough v. U.S. Postal Serv</span>., EEOC Request No. 05950529 (Apr. 25, 1996); <span class="Italic">Ruiz v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</span> EEOC Request 05880859 (May 21, 1990).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *4. The Commission cited to its Enforcement Guidance in reasoning:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2"><span id="Page_3492"></span>Employers should carefully assess whether modifying the hours could significantly disrupt their operations--that is, cause undue hardship--or whether the essential functions may be performed at different times with little or no impact on the operations or the ability of other employees to perform their jobs.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Id</span>., citing to EEOC Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship under the Americans with Disabilities Act, EEOC Notice 915.002, Question 22 (Oct. 17, 2002).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Board failed to clearly explain why it was unreasonable for the Commission to decide that the instant case should have been analyzed through the lens of undue hardship instead of an essential function analysis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">There are several steps that an agency must take in analyzing a request for a reasonable accommodation. The Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals with disabilities who are employees or applicants for employment, unless to do so would cause an undue hardship. Once an agency finds that the employee requesting the reasonable accommodation has a disability, it must determine whether the employee is "qualified."</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An individual with a disability is qualified if the individual "satisfies the requisite skill, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the employment positions such individual holds or desires, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of such position." 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(m). Essential functions are the duties of a job, that is, the outcomes that must be achieved by someone in that position. <span class="Italic">Complainant v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 0120080613, 2013 WL 8338375, at *7 (E.E.O.C. Dec. 23, 2013).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The Commission determined:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">Performing certain job functions sometimes requires a person's presence at the worksite. But the fact that attendance can be a condition precedent to performing a function does not render it a job function in and of itself. Job functions are the duties that a person must perform or the outcomes that must be achieved by the person in the job. Attendance and timing are neither duties nor outcomes by themselves.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Commission Decision, 2014 EEOPUB LEXIS 1810, at *10. The Commission found that since there was no question that the appellant could perform the duties of a CBPO when at work, he was qualified. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *14. The next step in the agency's analysis is whether the appellant's requested reasonable accommodation posed an undue hardship. An employer does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the employer's operation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Several factors must be considered in determining whether a requested reasonable accommodation is an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *15-*16. The Commission's determination that the agency did not meet its burden in substantiating its undue hardship argument is reasonable. The Commission found that the agency made generalized conclusions and assessments supporting its view that providing a reasonable accommodation would result in an undue hardship. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. at *18. It is not sufficient to merely state in a conclusory manner that an accommodation would be an undue hardship. The undue hardship burden is a "rigorous one" and the agency must "prove convincingly" that such a hardship actually exists. <span class="Italic">Swafford v. Tennessee Valley Authority</span>, EEOC Appeal No. 01831944, 1984 WL 484605 (May 21, 1984). The agency bears the burden of proof to show not only that an accommodation would impose an undue hardship, but that the agency actually considered the accommodation. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. In the instant case, it was not unreasonable for the Commission to find that the agency did not meet its burden.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In summary, the MSPB disagrees with the EEOC. However, it failed to specifically explain how the Commission's decision misinterprets civil service law or how the decision is so unreasonable that it amounts to a violation of civil service law. The MSPB sought to transform this controversy into a civil service matter by contending that the EEOC violated civil service principles. No matter how vigorously the MSPB characterizes this case as a violation of civil service law, the Commission's decision was based on its interpretation of discrimination law. The Commission's interpretation of discrimination law and their decision are reasonable. As far as this Special Panel's review is concerned, that is the end of the story.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">The Special Panel defers to the EEOC and adopts the EEOC's decision as the decision of the Special Panel. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(3), this decision is referred to the Board which shall remand the case to the administrative judge in order to conduct a compensatory damages hearing, order the agency to take appropriate action including cancellation of the removal and the award of all payments and benefits to which the appellant is entitled as a result of this decision. Enforcement of this decision is the responsibility of the Board. The parties are notified that this decision is reviewable pursuant to 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7702(d)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">The D.C. Circuit considered work schedule problems arising from disability in <span class="Italic">Carr v. Reno</span>, 23 F.3d 525, 528-31 (D.C. Cir. 1994), involving a clerical employee of the United States Attorney's Office whose attendance was irregular because of an ear condition. The court concluded that irregular attendance and frequent absence in a job that required regular attendance placed the employee outside the protection of the Rehabilitation Act:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applies to all federally funded activities. It provides, "No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States...shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity...." 29 USC 794(a). Section 501 of the Act applies specifically to federal employers; it requires them to take <span class="Italic">affirmative action</span> on behalf of the disabled, an obligation that goes beyond the non-discrimination requirement in &#x00A7; 504. 29 USC 791(b)<span class="Italic">. See Southeastern Community College v. Davis</span>, 442 U.S. 397, 410-11, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2369, 60 L. Ed.2d 980 (1979).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Pursuant to section 501, EEOC regulations define the duties of federal employers toward the disabled. 29 CFR 1614.203 (replacing substantially similar 29 CFR 1613.701 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, in October 1992). These regulations declare that "[t]he Federal Government shall become a model employer of individuals with handicaps." 29 CFR 1614.203(b). Specifically, the "model employer" standard requires that:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(1)&#x2003;An agency shall make <span class="Italic">reasonable accommodation</span> to the known physical or mental limitations of an applicant or employee who is a <span class="Italic">qualified individual with handicaps</span> unless the agency can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an <span class="Italic">undue</span> <span class="Italic">hardship</span> on the operations of its program.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">(2)&#x2003;Reasonable accommodation may include, but shall not be limited to: (i) Making facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with handicaps; and (ii) Job restructuring, part-time or modified work schedules, acquisition or modification of equipment or devices, appropriate adjustment or modification of examinations, the provision of readers and interpreters, and other similar actions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">29 CFR 1614.203(c) (emphasis added).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The essential dispute in this case is whether Ms. Carr is a "qualified individual with handicaps" (formerly, "qualified handicapped person"). Under the regulations, a "qualified individual with handicaps" is "an individual with handicaps who, <span class="Italic">with or without reasonable accommodation</span>, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others...." 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(6) (emphasis added). Both parties interpret the "with or without reasonable accommodation" language to mean <span class="Italic">either</span> with accommodation or without it: that is, an individual with handicaps is "qualified" if she can perform the essential functions of her position with reasonable accommodation. If she can perform these functions <span class="Italic">without</span> reasonable accommodation, so much the better--she is, of course, still qualified. We agree with this interpretation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carr argues that, with reasonable accommodation, she could perform all the essential functions of a Coding Clerk. The Office responds that regular attendance is an essential function and that any accommodation that allowed for lengthy absences without warning or early notice would pose an undue hardship on the workings of the Office. To resolve this dispute, the district court proceeded to consider two apparently separate questions: (1) whether Ms. Carr was a "qualified individual with handicaps"; and (2) whether her handicap could have been accommodated without undue hardship. But these questions are interrelated. Recall that a "qualified individual with handicaps" is someone "who, <span class="Italic">with or without reasonable accommodation</span>, can perform the essential functions of the position"--and we have interpreted the crucial language to mean <span class="Italic">either</span> with or without accommodation. Ms. Carr concedes that without some form of accommodation she cannot perform the essential functions of her job. Under these circumstances, the regulation requires us to ask simply whether any reasonable accommodation would have allowed Ms. Carr to perform all the essential functions of her job without creating an undue hardship for the agency<span class="Italic">. See Hall v. United States Postal Service</span>, 857 F.2d 1073, 1078 (6th Cir. 1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carr asked for the following accommodation: a flexible arrival time (between 8:00 <small>A.M.</small> and noon); release from the requirement of continually providing doctors' reports; and job restructuring to ensure that the time-sensitive portions of her job were taken care of when she was unable to attend. But the district court considered this an unsatisfactory solution. Because of Ms. Carr's erratic (at best) attendance record and her inability to inform the Office when she could not attend, the court found that the U.S. Attorney's Office could not function normally without having others do her work on a daily basis. The U.S. Attorney's Office has demonstrated that its 4:00 <small>P.M.</small> deadline renders a flexible schedule an undue hardship. Its chosen accommodation, to allow Ms. Carr as needed access to the health unit and to a sofa in a nearby office, did not result in improved attendance. As for giving Ms. Carr a flexible schedule, the court noted, even for the short period in 1986 when this was tried Ms. Carr could not <span id="Page_3493"></span>work a full eight-hour day. With or without reasonable accommodation, then, she could not perform the "essential function" of coming to work regularly. <span class="Italic">Cf.</span> <span class="Italic">Matzo v. Postmaster General</span>, 685 F. Supp. 260, 263 (D.D.C. 1987), <span class="Italic">aff'd without opinion</span>, 861 F.2d 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (regular attendance is an essential function.).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We are reminded that section 501 demands a great deal from federal employers in the way of accommodation. Indeed, in appropriate cases, that section requires an agency to consider work at home, as well as reassignment in another position, as potential forms of accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Langon v. HHS</span>, 959 F.2d 1053 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that an agency must consider accommodating a computer programmer with multiple sclerosis by allowing her to work at home). But under the facts of this case the U.S. Attorney's Office properly rejected these options. Ms. Carr concedes that she could not work as a Coding Clerk at home, as the job involves tight 4:00 <small>P.M.</small> deadlines. Even if a job could be found for her that allowed her to work at home, there is no reason to think her periodic dizziness and nausea would allow her to work regular hours on a consistent basis.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Although reassignment in another job may be one form of reasonable accommodation, <span class="Italic">see Rhone v. United States Dept. of</span> <span class="Italic">Army</span>, 665 F. Supp. 734, 744 (E.D. Mo. 1987), and the regulations specifically provide that "job restructuring" or "part-time or modified work schedules" should be considered, 29 CFR 1614.203(b)(2), the district court held that Ms. Carr's attendance was so erratic as to make her unqualified for <span class="Italic">any</span> position. We agree with the proposition that an essential function of any government job is an ability to appear for work (whether in the workplace or, in the unusual case, at home) and to complete assigned tasks within a reasonable period of time. Ms. Carr's record demonstrates that the Office could not count on her to fulfill these minimum expectations. If it is unreasonable to ask the Office to continue to put up with Ms. Carr's poor attendance, it is equally unreasonable to require the Office to refer an unqualified employee to another government agency for employment.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, we must address Ms. Carr's contention that the district court should have conducted an "individualized inquiry" into possible forms of reasonable accommodation<span class="Italic">. See School Bd. of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline</span>, 480 U.S. 273, 287, 107 S. Ct. 1123, 1130, 94 L. Ed.2d 307 (1987) ("[I]n most cases, the district court will need to conduct an individualized inquiry and make appropriate findings of fact"). Once the district court determined that Ms. Carr could not perform an essential function of any government job, we think there was no need for further fact finding. The "individualized inquiry" need be no more extensive than the facts of the case demand. Any other holding would require a district court to engage in a <span class="Italic">pro forma</span> wild goose chase every time a plaintiff invokes the Rehabilitation Act.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In short, we think the district court was correct to hold that there is no genuine issue of fact as to whether Ms. Carr was a "qualified individual with handicaps." With or without reasonable accommodation, Ms. Carr's performance since 1984 showed that she would not be able to work regular hours. Accordingly, the Department of Justice was not obligated to retain her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">B.&#x2003;Civil Service Reform Act</span></p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Ms. Carr also brought suit under the Civil Service Reform Act, 5 USC 7511 <span class="Italic">et seq.</span>, claiming that an agency may not take adverse action against an employee for conduct caused by a medical condition. We may consider only the administrative record, and we may reverse only if the MSPB's decision was arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find that the MSPB's decision was reasonable. The Office dismissed Ms. Carr because of her absences, not because of handicap discrimination. Even though Ms. Carr's handicap was the reason for her absences from work, these absences were real and they were detrimental to "the efficiency of the service." 5 USC 7513(a). <span class="Italic">See Barnes v. Small</span>, 840 F.2d 972, 979-80 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Given our finding that the discharge was justified under the Rehabilitation Act, we cannot upset the MSPB's holding that Ms. Carr's firing was based on her detrimental conduct, and not on impermissible handicap discrimination.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The district court correctly held that Ms. Carr's prolonged, frequent, and unpredictable absences render her unqualified for any government job. Accordingly, we affirm the entry of summary judgment against her. We acknowledge that it is the unusual Rehabilitation Act case that, like this one, can be resolved against the plaintiff without extensive fact finding. In section 501, Congress has placed a heavy burden on government employers to accommodate the needs of individuals with handicaps. This statute represents an important public policy goal, and we do not take lightly our role in enforcing its dictates. But to require an employer to accept an open-ended "work when able" schedule for a time-sensitive job would stretch "reasonable accommodation" to absurd proportions and imperil the effectiveness of the employer's public enterprise. We find that the facts of this case compel summary judgment, and the district court's opinion is therefore affirmed.</p>

SSA</span>, 91 MSPR 148, 153-59 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 11-28 (2002), analyzed a removal for medical inability to perform a full-time job and an affirmative defense of disability discrimination based on the agency's refusal to continue part-time status:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The record supports the agency's charge of inability to maintain regular attendance</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the charge of inability to maintain regular attendance was not proven because she was on approved leave during her absences, including OWCP-covered leave, and that Slaughter agreed that she had never been absent without leave. The appellant asserts that Slaughter testified that management never warned the appellant that she could face an adverse action if she did not work on a regular full-time basis. The appellant asserts that <span class="Italic">Rabago v. Department of the Army,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. 530 (1985), holds that an agency cannot take an adverse action against an employee who utilizes approved leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">In <span class="Italic">Rabago</span>, the Board stated that, as a "general rule[,] ...an adverse action cannot be based on an employee's use of approved leave." 25 M.S.P.R. at 533. The Board reiterated, however, an exception to that rule which the Federal Personnel Manual first set forth and the Board first addressed in <span class="Italic">Cook v. Department of the Army</span>, 18 M.S.P.R. 610, 611-12 (1984). Specifically, provided that certain criteria are met, an agency can bring an action against an employee for excessive approved absence. <span class="Italic">Rabago,</span> 25 M.S.P.R. at 533.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">To take such an action, however, an agency must establish that: (1) The employee was absent for compelling reasons beyond his control so that agency approval or disapproval was immaterial because the employee could not be on the job; (2) the absences continued beyond a reasonable time, and the agency warned the employee that an adverse action could be taken unless the employee became available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis; and (3) the position needed to be filled by an employee available for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. Such an action should also be taken only under unusual circumstances, <span class="Italic">id.</span>, i.e., such as when the employee is unable to return to duty because of the continuing effects of illness or injury, <span class="Italic">Schultz v. U.S. Navy,</span> 810 F.2d 1133, 1137 n.* (Fed. Cir. 1987); <span class="Italic">Allen v. Department of Army</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 564, 570 (1997). Where appropriate, the Board has applied this exception to uphold an agency's adverse action charge of excessive approved absences. <span class="Italic">See Allen</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. at 571; <span class="Italic">Gaskins v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 36 M.S.P.R. 331, 334-35 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, in accordance with these authorities, the administrative judge correctly sustained the agency's charge of inability to maintain regular attendance. As the administrative judge found, the record shows that the appellant was absent from work 53.1% of the time from January 1995 through August 15, 1997. This absenteeism rate was based on the appellant's leave usage of 242.5 hours of sick leave and 257.5 hours of continuation in pay (COP) in 1995; 19 hours of sick leave, 878.25 hours of LWOP, and 248 hours of COP in 1996; and 492.5 hours of LWOP in 1997. The administrative judge noted Slaughter's testimony that: the appellant's absences and part-time work schedule when she was able to work negatively impacted Module 4 because it was staffed with only 1 full-time secretarial position; others had to answer the phones, take inventory and order supplies, and handle time and attendance cards; and the temporary assistance that King provided the appellant caused King to get backlogged in her own non-secretarial work and use overtime.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">While the appellant asserts that the agency conceded that she was not warned that she could be removed for irregular attendance, a review of Slaughter's testimony does not support this claim. Slaughter testified that, during periodic discussions with the appellant about her unsatisfactory performance, she reminded the appellant of her duties as a Secretary in Module 4. Slaughter testified that each time that the appellant requested a shorter week based on doctors' notes, she "let [the appellant] know that there had to be a stopping point at some point, where she could do the full line of her, the full, full line of her duties." Notes of a March 13, 1997 meeting involving the appellant, Slaughter, Glazier, EEO Manager Miguel Castillo, and others, reflect that there was a consensus among the attendees that job alternatives had to be considered for the appellant because her part-time hours and absences prevented her from satisfactorily performing the full-time job of a <span id="Page_3494"></span>Secretary. Further, Slaughter stated in an August 6, 1997 memorandum to Glazier that Slaughter previously told the appellant to provide her with a doctor's note that set forth an "end-date" for her medical restrictions.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">This serves as sufficient evidence that the appellant was on notice that her continued part-time work schedule could result in an adverse action. <span class="Italic">Cf. Taylor v. Department of Health and Human Services</span>, 32 M.S.P.R. 342, 345 (1987) (the Board reversed a removal action based on charges of excessive absenteeism where the agency failed to prove that it warned the appellant that her unavailability for duty on a regular, full-time or part-time basis, might result in an adverse action against her). Accordingly, the agency established all 3 criteria for the charge of inability to maintain regular attendance, despite the fact that the appellant's absences were covered by approved leave.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The record supports the agency's charge of inability to perform assigned duties for medical reasons</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant primarily asserts that the charge of inability to perform assigned duties for medical reasons was not proven because the agency failed to show why her performance differed under Ng and Slaughter although she had the same physical limitations. She asserts that she was performing her duties successfully under her OWCP/agency agreement that she could work part-time as a Secretary until she regained strength but that Slaughter thwarted her efforts. Specifically, she asserts that Slaughter erroneously concluded that she was not performing her Secretary duties, and then detailed her to the Cash Clerk position that presented numerous problems in order to support a removal action against her. The appellant likens her case to <span class="Italic">Schrodt v. U.S. Postal Service,</span> 79 M.S.P.R. 609, 616 (1998), claiming that the Board in <span class="Italic">Schrodt</span> reversed a removal action because the agency failed to document the alleged insufficient performance of the appellant.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant errs in asserting that <span class="Italic">Schrodt</span> warrants not sustaining the charge that she was unable to perform assigned duties for medical reasons. In <span class="Italic">Schrodt,</span> the Board found that the agency had not proved its charge that the appellant was physically unable to perform the duties of his Distribution Clerk position. 79 M.S.P.R. at 614-16. The Board reasoned that no nexus was shown between the appellant's medical condition and the observed deficiencies in his performance or conduct. <span class="Italic">Id</span>. The Board noted that the fitness-for-duty examination supporting the appellant's removal was of little probative value; and that, while agency witnesses testified as to their observations of the appellant's difficulty in performing certain tasks, there was no documentation of any such performance deficiencies. <span class="Italic">Id</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Here, the administrative judge sustained the agency's charge of inability to perform assigned duties for medical reasons based on a comparison of the duties of the appellant's Secretary position and doctors' reports of her medical conditions and restrictions as of August 4, 1997, when the appellant returned from her Cash Clerk detail. Specifically, the appellant suffered from thoracolumbar scoliosis, thoracolumbosacral strain-sprain, chronic degenerative disk disorder and facet joint arthritis, possible lumbar disk herniation with light leg nerve root compression, cervical trapezial myofascial strain/pain syndrome, bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, and cerebral palsy with spastic diplegia-congenital. Her medical restrictions were no lifting or carrying over 5 pounds, pushing or pulling over 10 pounds, repetitive bending, stooping, or repetitive twisting. The physical requirements of the Secretary position, included prolonged sitting at a computer 6-8 hours a day, keying or typing and extensive use of hands.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge noted Ng's testimony that the appellant performed the essential functions of the full-time Secretary position only on a part-time basis. The administrative judge noted Slaughter's testimony that the appellant had problems distributing incoming mail and routing mail because these tasks required standing and passing out mail. Additionally, Slaughter testified in her deposition that the appellant could not perform the essential duties of time-keeping and typing confidential correspondence. Days before proposing the appellant's removal, Slaughter stated that the appellant had to be temporarily reassigned from the Module to the Health Unit because wrist pain prevented her from numericalizing Federal Archive Record Center papers. Further, as the administrative judge found, the absence of a medical release for the appellant's return to full-time work as a Secretary was significant and further supported the charge that she was medically unable to perform the duties of her Secretary position. The appellant, therefore, merely disagrees with the record evidence that both Ng and Slaughter agreed that she could not perform the essential duties of a full-time Secretary.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant further asserts that the charge of inability to perform assigned duties for medical reasons was not proven because: (1) the removal proposal notice did not state the duties that she failed to perform; and (2) the agency erred in removing her under chapter 75 procedures. An agency is required to state the reasons for a proposed adverse action in sufficient detail to allow a charged employee the opportunity to make an informed reply. 5 U.S.C. &#x00A7; 7513(b)(1); <span class="Italic">Plath v. Department of Justice</span>, 11 MSPB 65, 12 M.S.P.R. 421, 424 (1982). Here, the removal proposal notice met this requirement, as it clearly detailed the essential duties of the Secretary position, the appellant's medical conditions/restrictions and chronic absenteeism and her failures in performance. The appellant's challenge to the agency's use of chapter 75 procedures is unavailing. A charge of inability to perform job duties is distinct from a charge of unsatisfactory performance, and, unlike the latter, the former requires medical evidence showing that the employee is incapacitated for particular job duties due to a medical condition. <span class="Italic">Ellshoff v. Department of the Interior</span>, 76 M.S.P.R. 54, 69 (1997).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">The record does not support the appellant's affirmative defense of disability discrimination</span>.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts that the administrative judge erred in finding that she was not a qualified individual with a disability. She asserts that she satisfactorily performed her job on a part-time basis. She asserts that the agency failed to show that her part-time work since December 1995, or a job restructuring, or hiring of another full-time or part-time secretary, would impose an undue hardship. She asserts that, even had the agency shown undue hardship, it was required to reassign her to a position for which she qualified. She also asserts that the agency, instead, detailed her to a Cash Clerk position that aggravated her medical condition and did not attempt to locate another suitable position for her within the same office or at other facilities within the same commuting area. Further, she asserts that the agency merely stated that there were no other positions available for her.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">An agency is required to afford reasonable accommodation to the known limitations of a qualified individual with a disability unless it can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its program. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(c); <span class="Italic">Patrick v. Department of the Air Force,</span> 39 M.S.P.R. 392, 395 (1988). Thus, to prevail on an affirmative defense of disability discrimination in a removal appeal, an appellant must establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability. A qualified individual with a disability is, <span class="Italic">inter alia</span>, one who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of himself or others. 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1614.203(a)(6). The administrative judge found that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability because her medical evidence showed that there was no reasonable accommodation that would allow her to perform the essential functions of the Secretary position.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The crux of the appellant's argument is that the Secretary position was part-time and that she performed the essential functions of the position with accommodations for her medical conditions. A review of the position description and the appointing documents for the Secretary position make clear, however, that the position was fulltime. As noted above, the record shows that the resignation of Rodriguez, the only other Secretary in Module 4 besides the appellant, left Module 4 with one full-time Secretary when the work of Module 4 required a full-time Secretary. As such, the appellant's medical inability to work full-time precluded her from performing an essential duty of her official position. Further, as explained above, the appellant's medical conditions/restrictions precluded her from satisfactorily performing the essential duties of a Secretary. Therefore, the administrative judge correctly found that the appellant was not a qualified individual with a disability. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Harrison v. Department of Veterans Affairs,</span> EEOC Petition No. 03AO0097, slip op. at 2-3 (Apr. 12, 2001) (an appellant with cerebral palsy and unrelated cognitive deficiencies was not a qualified individual with a disability because she could not perform her essential duties even with the help of a full-time assistant, because of her cognitive deficits and the fast-paced, high quality patient care she was expected to provide).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The administrative judge also found that, assuming <span class="Italic">arguendo</span> that the appellant was a qualified individual with a disability, her suggested accommodations (hiring of another full-time or part-time Secretary) was not a reasonable accommodation and that permitting her to do part-time work or restructuring the Secretary position would cause an undue hardship on the agency's operations. Board law supports these findings. <span class="Italic">See Hurst v. Department of the</span> <span class="Italic">Navy,</span> 61 M.S.P.R. 277, 281 (1994) (an agency is not required to restructure a position if the tasks the employee is unable to perform are essential functions of the position).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As for the appellant's claim of entitlement to a reassignment as a reasonable accommodation, she errs. Reassignment is a reasonable accommodation of last resort and is required only after it has been determined that: (1) there are no effective accommodations that will enable the employee to perform the essential functions of his current position; or (2) all other reasonable accommodations would impose an undue hardship. EEOC's Enforcement Guidance: Reasonable Accommodation and Undue Hardship Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, Question 24 (Mar. 1, 1999). An appellant, however, must articulate to the extent possible a reasonable accommodation under <span id="Page_3495"></span>which she believes she could perform the essential duties of her position or of a vacant funded position to which she could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">Kohl v. Department of the Army</span>, 80 M.S.P.R. 678 &#x00B6; 5 (1999). Here, the appellant did not articulate any such vacant position to which she could be reassigned. Indeed, the administrative judge noted, and the appellant does not dispute, EEO Manager Castillo's testimony that the appellant did not request a vacant position as an accommodation. Rather, she insisted that she wanted to remain a Secretary in Module 4.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Finally, although the appellant argues that Slaughter detailed her to the Cash Clerk position in order to remove her based on her disability, the record shows otherwise. Perhaps the appellant asserts error in this regard because the agency's removal proposal notice discussed her performance during the Cash Clerk detail in the narrative supporting the charge of inability to perform assigned duties for medical reasons. The SF 50-B documenting the appellant's removal, however, correctly reflected that she was removed from her permanent position of record as a Secretary, and the administrative judge found that the appellant was removed from that position. Further, as the administrative judge noted, the agency's detailing of the appellant to the potentially permanent position of a Cash Clerk buttresses the agency's position that it made every effort to accommodate the appellant's medical conditions and restrictions and did not impermissibly remove her because of her disability.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Accordingly, we find that the appellant has not proven her claim of disability discrimination.</p>

<p class="Block-Quote1">To establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, an appellant must: (1) Show that he is a disabled person; (2) show that the appealed action was based on his disability; and (3) to the extent possible, articulate a reasonable accommodation under which he believes that he could perform the essential functions of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be assigned. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of the Navy</span>, 66 MSPR 490, 493 (1995). A disabled person is defined as one who: (1) Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of his major life activities; (2) has a record of such impairment; or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> "Major life activities" means functions such as caring for one's self, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning, and working. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(3). For the activity of working, "substantially limits" means that an individual is generally foreclosed by his impairment from the type of employment involved. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(3); <span class="Italic">Groshans v. Dept. of the Navy</span>, 67 MSPR 629, 636 (1995). More generally, that term means (at a minimum) that an individual's impairment significantly restricts him with respect to the condition, manner or duration under which he can perform a particular life activity as compared to the condition, manner or duration under which an average person in the general population can perform the same activity<span class="Italic">. See</span> 29 CFR 1630.2(j)(1); <span class="Italic">see also Roth v. Lutheran General Hospital</span>, 57 F.3d 1446, 1454 (7th Cir. 1995), and <span class="Italic">Forrisi v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">One of the essential functions of almost every government job...is coming to work regularly. <span class="Italic">See Carr v. Reno</span>, 23 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 1994) ("an essential function of any government job is an ability to appear for work," and it is unreasonable to ask an agency to countenance an employee's poor attendance); <span class="Italic">Jackson v.</span> <span class="Italic">VA</span>, 22 F.3d 277, 279 (11th Cir. 1994) (an essential function of a job requires work attendance that is "reasonably regular and predictable," and not "unreliable and sporadic"); <span class="Italic">Walders</span> <span class="Italic">v.

Va. 1991) (some degree of regular, predictable attendance is fundamental to most jobs), <span class="Italic">aff'd</span>, 956 F.2d 1163 (4th Cir. 1992) (Table). Following agency leave-requesting procedures, moreover, is an essential part of a government job because the failure to do so results in unscheduled absences which seriously burden an agency and are disruptive to its efficient operations. <span class="Italic">See Law v. USPS</span>, 852 F.2d 1278, 1279-80 (Fed. Cir. 1988); <span class="Italic">Wilkinson v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 68 MSPR 4, 7 (1995). Given the sustained leave-related misconduct at issue here and the appellant's prior disciplinary record of such offenses, we find that he has demonstrated an inability to adhere to a regular work schedule, an essential function of almost every government position. The appellant thus is foreclosed from the kind of employment involved here and is disabled from the major life activity of working. <span class="Italic">See Groshans</span>, 67 MSPR at 636....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The evidence discussed above thus shows that the appellant is a disabled person because he is also substantially limited with respect to the major life activities of caring for oneself and the ability to think, concentrate, and make decisions. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(a)(1), (3), 1630.2(j); Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Compliance Manual 902.3(b); <span class="Italic">Randel v. Dalton</span>, EEOC No. 03950108, slip op. at 6-7 (Feb. 8, 1996)....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Our inquiry thus now turns to the issue of whether the appellant is a "qualified" individual with a disability, i.e., a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of his position with or without reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Randel</span>, slip op. at 7. As discussed above, coming to work on a regularly-scheduled basis and following agency leave-requesting procedures are essential functions of almost every government job, and the appellant has demonstrated an inability to perform those functions without reasonable accommodation. In order to establish a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, then, the appellant had to articulate a reasonable accommodation that would enable him to accomplish the essential functions of his position or of a vacant position to which he could be reassigned. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Sheehan</span>, 66 MSPR at 493. Once an appellant has established a <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of disability discrimination, the agency has the burden of showing that the action at issue was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. <span class="Italic">See id</span>. The agency can meet this burden, in pertinent part, by showing that the appellant is not a "qualified disabled person" because he cannot perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others. <span class="Italic">See id.</span> It can also establish that the reasonable accommodation suggested by the appellant would impose an undue burden on its operations. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Casillas v. Dept. of the Air Force</span>, 64 MSPR 627, 632 (1994).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant articulated six proposed reasonable accommodations below: (1) Greater latitude in leave and attendance matters in order to take into account his limitations with respect to walking in bad weather and his memory problems; (2) a modified work schedule to permit him to begin work at a later hour during inclement seasons; (3) reassignment to a work environment where he can receive close supervision; (4) designation of an employee to drive him to and from work; (5) allowing his sister to be responsible for arranging for his leave and attendance; (6) education of his supervisors concerning the nature of his limitations and appropriate methods of dealing with them. With respect to proposed accommodation # 4, an agency is not required to accommodate an employee's transportation problems by driving him to and from work<span class="Italic">. See Hardin v. Dalton</span>, EEOC No. 03940002, 1993 WL 763380, at *4 (Dec. 23, 1993); <span class="Italic">Gottlieb v. VA</span>, 39 MSPR 606, 610 (1989); <span class="Italic">Williams v. DHHS</span>, 29 MSPR 525, 527 (1985). In addition, open-ended "latitude" granted to an appellant in leave and attendance matters as suggested by proposed accommodation # 1 constitutes an unduly burdensome accommodation. <span class="Italic">See Widger v. VA</span>, 37 MSPR 368, 371-72 (1988).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">On the other hand, a modified work schedule and closer supervision have been deemed, at least facially, to constitute reasonable accommodations. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 CFR 1614.203(c)(2)(ii); <span class="Italic">Lynch v.</span> <span class="Italic">Dept. of Educ.</span>, 52 MSPR 541, 546 (1992). Dr. Baird also testified that the appellant's short-term memory problems and resulting difficulties with unscheduled absences could be accommodated by having a responsible family member handle leave and attendance matters through communication with agency officials so that future unscheduled absences could be prevented. Ms. Stevens indicated her readiness to be responsible for ensuring that the appellant complied with the agency's attendance requirements and to communicate with agency officials so that these problems could be avoided. In addition, if these attendance problems could be resolved, the evidence discussed above shows that the appellant's performance with the agency has been otherwise satisfactory. For these reasons, the appellant has made at least a facial showing that he can perform the essential duties of his position with reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See</span> <span class="Italic">Lynch</span>, 52 MSPR at 545-46.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The agency has refused to consider modifying its supervision of the appellant in a way that would attempt to recognize his short-term memory problems and resulting difficulties with leave management. It has expressed some willingness to grant the appellant liberal leave as an accommodation, but it argues that a modified work schedule for later reporting does not address its central concern--its inability to rely on the appellant's consistent attendance and compliance with leave-reporting requirements. The agency does articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory interest when it insists that it cannot tolerate unscheduled absences and the resulting disruption to its ability to plan its work. <span class="Italic">See Widger</span>, 37 MSPR at 372.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The arrangement described by Dr. Baird and Ms. Stevens above for ensuring the appellant's regular attendance and compliance with leave-requesting procedures, however, appears to address that concern adequately. The agency's response to this proposal is the objection that it would have no "control" over such an arrangement. In analyzing the issue of disability discrimination where a mechanism has been suggested that would limit the job-related effects of an appellant's disability, the Board has looked with some skepticism on an agency's claim that it could not afford to "risk" allowing a trial of that mechanism. <span class="Italic">See Frye v. Dept. of the Army</span>, 63 MSPR 242, 244-45 (1994) (issue of whether or not an appellant with bipolar disorder would comply with lithium treatment that would <span id="Page_3496"></span>control his condition). That skepticism is particularly justified given the affirmative obligation (grounded in statute and regulation) of every federal agency employer to develop plans to address the special needs of its disabled employees and to become a "model employer" of such employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 29 USC 791(b); 29 CFR 1614.203(b).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">As in <span class="Italic">Frye</span>, then, the record in this case does not convince us that the risk of failure of the arrangement proposed by Dr. Baird and Ms. Stevens is so great that it should be allowed to foreclose the appellant's employment as a Materials Handler or deny him the protections against disability discrimination guaranteed under law to federal employees. <span class="Italic">See</span> 63 MSPR at 246. We therefore find that the agency has not demonstrated that this proposed accommodation is unduly burdensome or that it would not permit the appellant to perform the essential duties of his position. <span class="Italic">See Sheehan</span>, 66 MSPR at 493; <span class="Italic">Casillas</span>, 64 MSPR at 632. Because the agency has failed to rebut the appellant's <span class="Italic">prima facie</span> case of discrimination, his removal cannot be sustained. <span class="Italic">See Clark v. DLA</span>, 36 MSPR 162, 168 (1988).</p>

Dept. of Transp.,</span> DC-0752-10-0403-I-1 (NP 4/13/2012) (remanding for determination of whether extending a few months of LWOP to an employee prior to initiation of removal was a reasonable accommodation for a disabled employee); <span class="Italic">Davis v.

USPS</span>, 29 MSPR 460, 463 (1985) (agency did not fail to accommodate an employee by declining to permit him to attend afternoon AA meetings during duty hours rather than the employee attending noontime meetings; reassignment to another shift was not feasible because those positions were all filled); <span class="Italic">Mallard v.

<p class="Block-Quote1">[E]ven assuming that the appellant is disabled under 29 C.F.R. &#x00A7; 1630.2(g), the appellant failed to meet his burden of proving that the agency denied him a reasonable accommodation when it refused to allow him to work from home on a part-time basis. An agency is not obligated to provide a disabled individual with every accommodation he may request. <span class="Italic">Clemens v. Department of the Army,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6; 25 (2006) (citations omitted). Further, an agency does not have to provide a reasonable accommodation that would cause an "undue hardship" to the agency. <span class="Italic">Id.</span> In light of the agency's ample evidence that it needed a regular, full-time individual in the appellant's Aerospace Engineer position in the T56 engine program, and that the appellant's absence caused an undue burden on its operations, we find that the agency was justified in not allowing the appellant to telecommute. In addition, the agency could not have been reasonably expected to allow a problematic employee who required close supervision to work from home, as telecommuting would have hindered its ability to supervise the appellant. Finally, as the administrative judge pointed out, the work restrictions imposed by the appellant's physician, that rendered him unable to perform the full-time duties of his position at work, would have been equally applicable at home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Based on the foregoing, we find that the appellant has failed to show that the agency denied him a reasonable accommodation. <span class="Italic">See, e.g., Clemens,</span> 104 M.S.P.R. 362, &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 29-30 (the agency proved that the appellant's requested accommodation of having just one supervisor assign her tasks would cause an undue hardship to the agency because it would significantly and adversely impact operations in her division); <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Department of the Army,</span> 73 M.S.P.R. 619, 628-29 (1997) (open-ended latitude granted to an appellant in leave and attendance matters constitutes an unduly burdensome accommodation).</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Telework as an accommodation was discussed but not required in <span class="Italic">Fox v. Dept. of Army</span>, 120 MSPR 529, 546-48 &#x00B6;&#x00B6; 28-30, 2014 MSPB 6 (2014) (the text of the case should be consulted for the details of appellant's work as a Corps of Engineers program manager, GS-14):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We next consider whether the appellant could have safely and efficiently performed those essential functions with her requested accommodation of full-time telework. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has provided the following guidance on whether and to what extent telework may serve as a reasonable accommodation:</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">An employer does not have to remove any essential job duties to permit an employee to work at home. However, it may need to reassign some minor job duties or marginal functions (i.e., those that are not essential to the successful performance of a job) if they cannot be performed outside the workplace and they are the only obstacle to permitting an employee to work at home. If a marginal function needs to be reassigned, an employer may substitute another minor task that the employee with a disability could perform at home in order to keep employee workloads evenly distributed....&#8197;For some jobs, the essential duties can only be performed in the workplace. For example, food servers, cashiers, and truck drivers cannot perform their essential duties from home. But, in many other jobs some or all of the duties can be performed at home. Several factors should be considered in determining the feasibility of working at home, including the employer's ability to supervise the employee adequately and whether any duties require the use of certain equipment or tools that cannot be replicated at home. Other critical considerations include whether there is a need for face-to-face interaction and coordination of work with other employees; whether in-person interaction with outside colleagues, clients, or customers is necessary; and whether the position in question requires the employee to have immediate access to documents or other information located only in the workplace. An employer should not, however, deny a request to work at home as a reasonable accommodation solely because a job involves some contact and coordination with other employees. Frequently, meetings can be conducted effectively by telephone and information can be exchanged quickly through e-mail.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">If the employer determines that some duties must be performed in the workplace, then the employer and employee need to decide whether working part-time at home and part-time in the workplace will meet both of their needs. For example, an employee may need to meet face-to-face with clients as part of a job, but other tasks may involve reviewing documents and writing reports. Clearly, the meetings must be done in the workplace, but the employee may be able to review documents and write reports from home.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1"><span class="Italic">Work at Home/Telework as a Reasonable Accommodation</span>, &#x00B6; 4, U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html">http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/telework.html</a> [now at <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/work-hometelework-reasonable-accommodation">https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/work-hometelework-reasonable-accommodation</a>] (last modified Oct. 27, 2005).[4]</p>
<p class="Block-Quote2">[4]&#x2003;Although EEOC's guidance does not have the force of law and therefore does not warrant deference under <span class="Italic">Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</span>, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), it is nonetheless "entitled to respect" under <span class="Italic">Skidmore v. Swift &#x0026; Co</span>., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), to the extent that its interpretation of the statute it administers has the "power to persuade." <span class="Italic">See Christensen v. Harris County</span>, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (quoting <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span>). We find EEOC's interpretation of the Americans with Disabilities Act persuasive and therefore entitled to <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> deference. <span class="Italic">See Solamon v. Department of Commerce</span>, 119 M.S.P.R. 1, &#x00B6; 9 (2012) (granting <span class="Italic">Skidmore</span> deference to OPM advisory opinion).</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The EEOC guidance suggests that the appellant can perform some of her core duties through telephone and email, and the physical provision of briefing materials is arguably a marginal function that could be reassigned in exchange for other tasks. Furthermore, Dr. Presant's suggestion that the appellant's use of sick leave would preclude useful service from home is contradicted by the opinion of multiple practitioners and also by the fact that the appellant used no sick leave during the period she was permitted to telecommute full-time. However, the essential functions of the appellant's position do require at least some travel and face-to-face interaction, and the agency is not required to modify or eliminate duties that are an essential function of the position. <span class="Italic">Johnson v. U.S. Postal Service</span>, 120 M.S.P.R. 87, &#x00B6; 10 (2013). We therefore conclude that permanent full-time telework would not be a reasonable accommodation.</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">Furthermore, the agency has established a nexus between the appellant's medical condition and observed deficiencies in performance. Although the agency has not provided a performance evaluation for the period during which the appellant was permitted to telework full-time, the agency has supplied declarations by Wagner and Pike describing the consequences of the appellant's physical absence....</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">...</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">We find the statements by Wagner and Pike are sufficient to establish that the appellant's absences had a negative effect not only on her own performance, but also on the operations of the RIT as a whole. Because the agency has shown that the appellant's medical condition rendered her unable to safely and efficiently perform all the core duties of her position, we sustain the first charge. <span class="Italic">See Marshall-Carter</span>, 94 M.S.P.R. 518, &#x00B6; 13.</p>
<p class="Body-Text">Telework was not a required accommodation for an employee with some history of attendance problems, <span class="Italic">Koch v. SEC,</span> DC-0752-10-0413-I-1 (NP 11/14/2011):</p>
<p class="Block-Quote1">The appellant asserts in his petition for review that the administrative judge erred in finding that the appellant's requested accommodation of telework, flexible schedule, use of credit hours, and an intermittent part-time schedule were not appropriate because they would not allow him to perform the essential function of regularly reporting to work. <span id="Page_3497"></span>The appellant has failed to show how his requested accommodation of flexible workplace, telework, part-time work schedule, and full use of credit hours would allow him to adhere to a regular work schedule in light of his extensive history of excessive AWOL, falsely reporting his work hours, and failure to follow his tour of duty, which was previously altered as a reasonable accommodation. Moreover, while the Board has held that a modified work schedule may, at least facially, constitute a reasonable accommodation, <span class="Italic">Stevens v. Department of the Army</span>, 73 M.S.P.R. 619, 629 (1997), we discern no error in the administrative judge's finding that providing such an accommodation to an employee who has shown a willingness on many occasions to falsely report his work hours, fail to report for duty for months, and use official time inappropriately would be unduly burdensome for the agency.</p>
